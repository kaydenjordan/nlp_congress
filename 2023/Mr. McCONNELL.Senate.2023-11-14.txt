 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, the Supreme Court  announced its adoption of a code of ethics. The Court produced the code  internally and adopted it unanimously. In  [[Page S5483]]  other words, as I expected, a coequal branch of government conducted  its business independently, which sounds an awful lot like the  separation of powers envisioned in the Constitution.   Certainly, that hasn't deterred Senate Democrats from their obsessive  effort to bend the Court to their will. In fact, their monthslong smear  campaign--disguised as an effort to make the senior-most jurists in the  country, duly confirmed by the Senate, more ``accountable'' to the  American people--unfortunately, continues apace. We know what our  colleagues really mean by ``accountability.'' It is code for  ``intimidation.''   I am sure that this sort of accountability is exactly what the  Justices and their families felt as the Biden administration declined  to enforce Federal law and protect them in their homes from angry mobs  or when Senate Democrats threatened to slash the Court security budget  in the face of death threats or on any number of occasions when our  colleagues have issued ominous, veiled warnings about ``restructuring''  or outright threats that Justices would ``pay the price.''   This week, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are at it again. Our  colleagues planned last week to threaten legal action against private  citizens who decline to indulge their sham trial of the Justices. The  only problem? Republicans on the committee submitted too many  commonsense amendments, and the majority worried that some of them  might pass with bipartisan support.   But regardless of how Senate Democrats choose to spend their time, I  will repeat what I have said before: I have the utmost confidence in  each one of the Justices of our Nation's highest Court, and they should  continue to pay this intimidation campaign no mind.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on another matter, this morning's  October inflation report tells a story that has become familiar on  President Biden's watch. Prices remain stubbornly high and well above  the Federal Reserve's 2-percent target. Prices are up 3.2 per year over  year, and cumulative inflation since the President took office now  clocks in at 17.6 percent.   Even as the rate prices are growing ebbs, working Americans are  growing more frustrated with an expensive new normal. The price of a  gallon of milk has risen 15.8 percent since January of 2021. Meanwhile,  a gallon of gas is going for 54.8 percent more. As one small business  owner in Texas put it to reporters recently, he said:         I'm trying to think of one area where prices have eased,       and I can't think of anything.    Earlier this month, President Biden told a gathering in rural  Minnesota that ``Bidenomics is just another way of saying `the American  Dream.''' The American people are just simply not buying that.   According to one recent survey, only 14 percent of U.S. voters have  said President Biden has made them better off, and 65 percent of voters  said they had cut back on nonessential spending.   So, if the President thinks that Bidenomics is the American dream, he  might want to pay closer attention to how many Americans are desperate  to wake up.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, today, our  Nation's Capital will welcome a rally of Jewish Americans and friends  of Israel. The participants in today's events are gathering in  mourning, in worry, in fear, and in shared resolve.    In the dark days since the terrorist massacre of October 7, their  message has been crystal clear: There is no moral equivalence between  terrorism and self-defense. Israel has a right to exist, and Jews  everywhere have a right to live without fear.   These basic truths should be obvious and unimpeachable. But if anyone  failed to see the creeping advance of anti-Semitism across the West in  recent years, if any corner of our society let itself believe that this  unique hatred of Jews has been confined to history, that naive fiction  was shattered on October 7 and swept away by the hate that has poured  across college campuses and city streets throughout America and the  West over the past month.   In just the first week after Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad  murdered 1,200 Israelis, harassment, vandalism, and assault against  American Jews rose nearly 400 percent.   But the peaceful people gathering in Washington today aren't here to  ask for pity for themselves. They are here on behalf of the more than  240 hostages, including a 3-year-old American boy and at least 8 other  Americans who cannot speak for themselves. They are here with a clear  message for our leaders: Stand with Israel.   Since October 7, I have spoken repeatedly about the challenges Israel  faces as it works to protect its people, bring the hostages home, and  destroy Hamas's capability to wage war. I have talked about the  terrorists' reprehensible record of systematically violating the  customary laws of war; their expropriation of humanitarian aid; the  cold-blooded practice of putting command centers and weapons caches in  hospitals, schools, and even mosques; their grotesque penchant for  using innocent Gazans as human shields; and, of course, the threat of  further violence from the Iran-backed terrorists on the second front.   This is why I have urged the Biden administration to give Israel the  time, space, and support it needs to bring these savages to justice.   How quickly some in the West have become confused about the crystal- clear distinction between terrorism and self-defense. It is not the  same thing.   Hamas sought the conflict. Hamas perpetuates it by holding hostages  and continuing its terrorism. And those of us who live out of range of  terrorist rockets should pause before second-guessing Israel's  response.   This is the time that demands moral clarity on campuses, in  newsrooms, in Congress, and at the sharp end of American military  strength. It is also time to restore credible deterrence against Iran,  the chief underwriter and architect of violence against Israel and  against American forces in the Middle East.   In less than 1 month, Iran-backed terrorists have targeted U.S.  servicemembers in Iraq and Syria 52 times. From the abandonment of  Afghanistan to the delisting of the Houthis, to our failure to respond  to proxy attacks on our friends in the region, the Biden administration  has made Iran's job actually easier.   And now, as America dithers over support for their friends in  Ukraine, Tehran has thrown itself firmly behind Putin's Russia. It will  take more than demolishing a couple of warehouses to show our  adversaries we are credible. Iran and its terrorist networks must know  that violence against America or our allies will be met swiftly and  overwhelmingly with lethal force.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
