 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for up to 20 minutes.    Mr. President, this is a ``Time to Wake Up'' good  news-bad news speech.   The good news from last week is on business community support for  carbon pricing. What is carbon pricing? Well, remember that IMF--the  International Monetary Fund--pegs the fossil fuel subsidy in the United  States at more than $600 billion per year, so the energy market is  dramatically tilted to favor fossil fuels. Carbon pricing helps  [[Page S5811]]  set that right, helps make an even playing field. It is economics 101.  And carbon pricing makes a lot of sense.   What happened last week? The Business Roundtable, made up of all of  these giant American corporations and more--these are the top 50 that I  could fit on this chart, but there are 200 of them--came out in support  of carbon pricing. Their report warned that the consequences of climate  change for global prosperity and socioeconomic well-being are  significant. The world simply cannot afford the costs of inaction.   The Business Roundtable's report went on to urge companies to ``align  policy goals and [greenhouse gas] emissions reduction targets with  scientific evidence.'' Listen to the scientists. We could do more of  that.   The BRT said that a key component of science-based climate policy  should be a price on carbon. Here is what they said:         A price on carbon would provide an effective incentive to       reduce [greenhouse gas] emissions and mitigate climate       change, including through the development and deployment of       breakthrough technologies. . . . Establishing a clear price       signal is the most important--    The most important--       consideration for encouraging innovation, driving efficiency,       and ensuring sustained environmental and economic       effectiveness.    So this is big news--these are big companies--and this is good news.  These companies at the Business Roundtable employ more than 15 million  people. They have more than $7.5 trillion in revenues. Their unified  voice is a good thing and a big deal.   With all of that good news from all of these big American  corporations, what is the bad news? The bad news is that corporate  America often shows one face to the world and a very different face to  Congress, and the face they show to Congress is not at all aligned with  this policy they just announced to the world. This discrepancy, this  misalignment, is a persistent problem, and it needs to be fixed.   The problem has three dimensions. One, even these companies don't pay  much attention to climate change in their lobbying and election  activities. For most, it is zero attention.   By the way, that silence is deafening around here, and that silence  by these companies is compounded by the trade associations through  which they consolidate their lobbying work. Most trade associations do  nothing on climate.   Here is Coke and Pepsi's trade association. By the way, here are  Pepsi and Coke on the list of companies that joined the Business  Roundtable pro-climate, pro-carbon-price statement. But when they  lobby, here is their American Beverage Association, the trade  association. As you can see, they haven't been spending much money  lately, and they haven't been spending anything on climate.   In 2009 and in 2010, they spent a lot of money. Why? Because we were  starting to work on ObamaCare and there was an idea that the companies  that sold sugary beverages that created health issues should help pay  the cost of the health issues that their sweetened beverages created.  So off to battle went the American Beverage Association with millions  and millions of dollars in spending.   This, by the way, is just the number of lobbyists. This is their  spending. So if they cared about climate change and wanted to put a  little bit of lobby pressure on, this is what they are capable of  doing. This is what they are doing.   Here is a pitch, in my hands right here, entitled ``TechNet:  Remaining Legislative Priorities for 2020.'' This is 13 pages of  advocacy for all the things the tech sector wants from Congress through  their trade association, TechNet--13 pages. The list goes on and on.  ``Top priorities,'' and then page after page, in small print, of all  the priorities, of all the things that they want Congress to do for  them--and there is not a single mention of climate change, not a single  mention of carbon price.   What do you think Congress will respond to--general noise made to the  world or your specific asks to Congress?   Here is the list of companies whose CEOs signed that Business  Roundtable report and came out for action on climate and a carbon price  and who are also in TechNet, which, the week before, came here with 13  pages of legislative priorities that didn't include either climate  change or carbon price.   You have to line things up, you guys. These are big players. Look at  them: Honeywell, Amazon, Microsoft, Cisco, Dell, Visa, GM, Apple,  Comcast, Oracle, Accenture, Hewlett-Packard, and PayPal--all on both  sides of the issue within the same week here in Congress. So those are  the trade associations that do nothing on this issue.   It gets worse because there are trade associations that are our worst  enemies on climate action. In fact, InfluenceMap has done some research  and tracked which groups and which corporations are the most climate  friendly and which are the most climate hostile. If you look all the  way over, right next to Marathon Petroleum in hostility is the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce. There was actually a tie. The U.S. Chamber of  Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers were  statistically tied as the two worst climate obstructers in America.   So they are out here, having worked hammer and tongs to stop climate  legislation and prevent a carbon price, and you have the Business  Roundtable statement supporting action on climate change and supporting  a carbon price.   So here are the companies that are members of the Business Roundtable  and came out last week for action on climate change and supported a  carbon price and that are also members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  which relentlessly opposes all serious climate action and,  specifically, a carbon price.   Look at them all. Look at them all. I don't know if the camera can  pan in on that, but these are some of America's biggest corporations. I  would bet you that, if this group said, ``Hey, we have just made a new  decision over in the Business Roundtable, wearing our Business  Roundtable hat,'' and went to the Chamber and said, ``We are not going  to do your opposition any longer; we are not going to support your  opposition to climate action; we are actually serious about being for  climate action and a carbon price''--if all of those companies actually  said that to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and threatened to quit if  they didn't clean up their act at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, that  would make a very big difference.   And around here that would make a very big difference because the  Chamber is the biggest kahuna of lobbying. It is electioneering all the  time, usually against Democrats, almost inevitably for the worst  candidate on climate, and they are over in courts and in regulatory  agencies opposing climate action all the time. So why support that if  what you really support is doing something on climate, including a  carbon price?   So the National Association of Manufacturers was the other group in a  tie with the Chamber for America's worst climate obstructer. These are  all the companies whose CEOs signed the Business Roundtable statement  supporting climate action and supporting carbon pricing and are members  of one of the two worst climate obstructers in America, at the same  time. So that creates a little bit of a problem.   Now, I should go back to the Chamber one just briefly and put a  caveat in here. We don't know who all the Chamber members are. It is a  very secretive organization. Many of its members report that they are  members of the organization, and that is how we can assemble a list  like this. But if the company doesn't report that they are members, we  don't know.   So this is not necessarily complete, but this is all that we can know  out of this secretive, very oppositional, worst climate obstructer  organization--the Chamber of Commerce.   There are some other odd discordances among these Business Roundtable  leaders. We go back to Business Roundtable membership who signed on  this; that is, companies like Google, Amazon, AT&T, and Verizon, which  are on the BRT list. There is Verizon right there. They are donors to  something called the Competitive Enterprise Institute.    The Competitive Enterprise Institute is the group that put that  flagrant, some would say almost nutty, climate denier Myron Ebell onto  the EPA transition team. The Competitive Enterprise Institute is a  dramatic antagonist to either anything serious on climate  [[Page S5812]]  or a price on carbon. Yet companies that signed this Business  Roundtable statement support the Competitive Enterprise Institute.   Many people will remember when we came to the floor in groups of  Senators to talk about the web of denial and the web of front groups  that the fossil fuel industry set up to hide their hands and do their  dirty work and stop climate action in Congress. That is the Competitive  Enterprise Institute right there--right there, right smack in the  middle of the web of fossil-fuel-funded climate denial, and Google,  Amazon, AT&T, and Verizon were all supporting that group while  supporting the Business Roundtable.   Now, none of this would matter much if Congress was just a sideshow  and it was really up to corporations to do their own thing, but that is  not the case. Action in Congress is actually the main event in  succeeding on climate. That is why the fossil fuel industry has worked  so hard to set up this web to deny climate science and to obstruct  climate action here in Congress.   So when these Business Roundtable companies come to Congress through  their other groups and say, ``Don't bother on climate'' or ``Don't do a  carbon price,'' it matters. And it makes it a little hard to really  take action in Congress based on their statement that they support  climate action and a carbon price when, through other groups, they are  funding the opposition to the position that they claim to support.   So, to the BRT, thank you for what you did. I don't want to under  appreciate that. It is a big deal. It is a good, good thing. But now  you have to make it real. You have to make it real in Congress. No more  zero effort from you. No more zero effort from your trade associations.  No more support for our biggest climate obstructers from you.   If you want the results of what you asked for, you have to align your  actions in Congress with your values. Align what you say in that  statement with what you do through your groups here in Congress. That  ought not to be much to ask--to align what you do in Congress with what  you say you want to do to the outside world.   I have a few suggestions, if you are interested. One, think about  commissioning a lobbying and electioneering audit of your own company.  If you are the CEO, commission an audit of your own company's lobbying  and electioneering so you actually know what your company is doing on  climate.   I suspect a lot of the CEOs signed this in good faith. They don't  know. So commission an audit. Learn what your company is really doing  on climate.   Do an audit of your trade associations. If you are a member of a  trade association, get in there and see what they are up to. I bet that  you will find that what I say is true.   Three, demand that your trade associations declare where they get  their money. It seems obvious that the reason that the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers became the two  worst climate obstructers in America is because they were paid to. If  you, CEOs on the Business Roundtable, had known that, this might not  have happened. We might not have been here by now.   It is very likely that the Chamber and the NAM leaders snuck up on  you, taking floods of fossil fuel money that they didn't tell you about  and selling out their organizations to the fossil fuel industry,  leaving you high and dry, having to explain why you are supporting the  two worst climate obstructers in America.   So do your audit, and then give those trade associations a deadline  to align with your policy or you will quit--you will quit on the  deadline if they haven't. Don't let them slow-walk you through endless  discussion and process while they are still loading up on fossil fuel  money and running fossil fuel errands in your names. Don't let them do  that.   Finally--finally--recommendation five, ask your lawyers. Ask your  lawyers, particularly if you are on the board of climate obstructer  groups: If these groups were trafficking in fraudulent information,  what is the board's responsibility? That is a lawyer question.   If they loaded up with fossil fuel money, how was your due diligence  on the board of that organization in detecting that warning signal that  your trade association had loaded up with fossil fuel money and was  arguing against your position when it came to Congress, carrying the  water for the fossil fuel industry? Your lawyers may have some advice  about whether you have met due diligence.   Final point, climate is not really a partisan issue. It wasn't in  2007 to 2009, when Senator Cardin and I got here and the Senate had  multiple bipartisan climate bills.   It wasn't in 2008, when Republican John McCain had climate on his  party platform as the Republican nominee. It all started with Citizens  United in 2010, when the fossil fuel industry was allowed to trade up  its political weaponry from muskets, corporate PACs, to tactical nukes,  unlimited spending, secret super PACs, phony front groups--the whole  apparatus of climate obstruction.   Today, as a result of that, the Republican Party has been so captured  that on climate it is little more than the political wing of the fossil  fuel industry. It doesn't have to be that way.   To these big companies who signed this wonderful pledge: Fix your  politics, push back on the fossil fuel obstruction, clean up your  obstructor trade associations, wake up your sleepers, and make climate  a real priority in Congress, and you will see what looks like magic  begin to happen.   For you all, it is less time to wake up to climate change than it is  time to wake up to your own political indifference and presumably  unknowing complicity in the political logjam on climate action that the  fossil fuel industry has deliberately created here in Congress.   With that, I yield the floor.
