 Mr. Speaker, it is said that there is no need in  childhood as strong as the need for a father's protection. That is a  father's job.   Recently, a Texas father arrogantly violated all of his  responsibilities. He forcibly sex trafficked his teenage daughter. In  the milky darkness of night, he would take her to truck stops and  coerce her to have sex so he could pocket the filthy lucre.   The 16-year-old was sold to multiple customers in a single night.  Every dollar the deviant collected was stolen at the expense of his  daughter's childhood. His evil and greed were so boundless that this  so-called father placed ads on the internet to sell his daughter. She  was sold on the marketplace of sex trafficking. But the girl was  rescued.
