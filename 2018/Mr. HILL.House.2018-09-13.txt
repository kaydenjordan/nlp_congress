 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms.  Sinema), my good friend, for yielding. She and I have the pleasure of  serving on the House Financial Services Committee together and  cooperating on many legislative measures and regulatory measures that  benefit our economy, so I thank her for that work. I greatly appreciate  her stepping up and reaching out across the aisle on the subject of  suicide, particularly during Suicide Prevention Month, and letting all  of us have an opportunity to share our perspective on this national  tragedy.   Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States.  There is an average of 123 suicides per day. What could be more tragic  than that?   Yet, I don't see nearly the people on the floor tonight that there  should be, because this affects all our districts so tragically. One in  five are suffering with some form of mental illness in our country, a  problem that has disrupted so many families, caused too much violence  and pain, and caused far too many lives. Representative Sinema and I  talk about this every time the subject comes up.    When I was a high school senior, I can't remember a friend that was a  victim of suicide. But, Mr. Speaker, my kids just turned 19 and 21, and  within 4 or 5 years of their ages, I can think of six families who have  lost a child to suicide--different reasons, same tragedy. So our  families are hurting from the scourge of suicide.  [[Page H8254]]    In Congress, this is an area where we work together, the 21st Century  Cures Act, where we attacked the first comprehensive approach to mental  illness treatment in decades, where we say we want people with mental  illness and who need treatment to get it. We worked together most  recently on the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act for American veterans,  and the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act--small steps, but  concrete steps that call attention to suicide, particularly in our  veterans community.   The VA is helping on this issue and marked Suicide Prevention Month  with its Be There campaign. This campaign highlights the risk factors  and warning signs for suicide, provides information about VA mental  health and suicide prevention resources, and helps individuals and  organizations start the conversation around veteran mental health in  their communities.   Our VA employees must have the necessary resources to offer guidance  to veterans while providing essential suicide prevention services.   This is a together thing. This is an ``all of us in this together''  thing.   Mr. Speaker, I have a chair in my front office in my district office  in Little Rock that was hand-painted to raise money for suicide  awareness and suicide prevention. On that chair, it says: ``We Are The  22.'' This is a nonprofit organization in my community started by  veterans helping veterans, because it is not an ``us and they'' thing.  It is an ``us'' thing. It is a ``we'' thing.   We are all in this together. We are the 22, the number that we have  as the estimate of veterans who are taking their own lives.   So I want to echo the Speaker pro tempore this afternoon, a  distinguished American and distinguished veteran and brave, heroic  representative of our Armed Forces, our patriots, the people who defend  our liberties, when he said we don't leave people behind. We don't  leave a sailor, a marine, or a soldier on the battlefield. We bring  them home.   Just last week, we honored John McCain on the floor of this House.  And Sam Johnson, leaving the House this year--Representative Schweikert  was there--he was in the Hanoi Hilton with John McCain. We don't leave  a man or woman behind on the battlefield. But when they come home, we  equally should not leave them behind.   I really commend the Speaker's comments that the mission is not over.  All of us have that partnership and sense of duty to carry that mission  forward on the home front when we are out of harm's way and out of  theater.   To me, it is that buddy system that we all learn, whether it is in  boot camp or swim team, you team up; you check in on each other; you  don't leave people alone. That is the secret, I think, to preventing  suicide.   I lost a good friend of mine, a fraternity brother, a partner in a  law firm in Houston, Texas. He never once intimated to his wife, to his  children, or to his law partners that anything was wrong, and they got  the call that he had been found.   Check in: How are you doing?   So we are the 22. We are on the buddy system. We don't leave our  warriors behind. The mission continues here. All those things are true.   I carry in my wallet, Mr. Speaker, the veterans crisis hotline as a  reminder to me that we want our veterans to reach out if there is a  moment of crisis.   If somebody is watching this or hearing the words of brave Brian  Mast, or the emotional content and leadership of Representative Kyrsten  Sinema from Arizona, and you are having that moment now as a veteran, I  urge you to call 1-800-273-8255 for yourself, for a friend, for a  neighbor.   We, in Congress, are fighting to make sure that that veterans hotline  is a value, that it is answered, and that we are part of that thin  thread of connectivity between all of us that keeps us right on the  moment.   Mr. Speaker, I see my friend from Arizona is here. It was a pleasure  to have both of my friends from Arizona talk about their senior Senator  last week, John McCain, and what he meant to each of us and what he has  meant to our country.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to yield to the gentleman from Arizona  (Mr. Schweikert), my friend, now on the House Ways and Means Committee,  formerly of the best committee in the House, the House Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for  participating, and I thank his colleague, Representative Sinema, for  her heartfelt tribute that she has carried on since she has been in the  House to bring attention to suicide prevention.   I also commend the House for the efforts that it has taken on mental  health and on suicide prevention, particularly for our veterans.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  one of Arkansas' marketing and public relations geniuses and a dear  friend, Mr. Ron Robinson, who recently passed away at the age of 75.   Born and raised in my hometown of Little Rock, Ron had a natural  talent for media and journalism at a very young age. As a teenager, he  worked as a sports writer for the Arkansas Gazette and was paid $1 an  hour.   After graduating from the University of Arkansas with a degree in  journalism, Ron joined the Air Force, serving as a public information  officer. He quickly rose to the rank of captain and earned a Bronze  Star for his service in Vietnam and the Air Force Commendation Medal in  1969 for his support of the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon.   A year later, he joined Cranford Johnson Robinson Woods, CJRW, as  director of public relations. He would eventually become chairman and  CEO until his retirement in 1996.   Ron received many awards for his contributions to Arkansas and the  journalism industry. He was honored in 2005 as a distinguished alumnus  of the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences and inducted  into the Lemke Journalism Society Hall of Honor in 2016.   Ron was a role model and friend for many across the State of  Arkansas, and I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his  friends, his family, and his many, many mentees during his years of  service.                  Honoring the Life of David W. Mullins, Jr.     Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor today to honor the  life of a longtime work colleague and friend, David W. Mullins Jr., who  recently passed away at the age of 72.   David had a remarkable career of public service, including working in  both the Department of the Treasury and as a member of the Federal  Reserve Board of Governors. It was a pleasure to work with him in  Domestic Finance at the Department of the Treasury under President  George H.W. Bush.   David's journey began in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where his father was  president of the University of Arkansas. David attended Fayetteville  High School before graduating from Yale University with a degree in  administrative sciences. He then pursued graduate work at MIT, and  there he completed his Ph.D. in economics and finance.   David's public service began shortly after the stock market crash in  1987, and his expertise proved vital toward the rejuvenation of the  economy and the resolution of the savings and loan crisis under the  Reagan and Bush administrations.   Mr. Speaker, he was a thoughtful leader, a friend to many, and I  extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends, family, and  loved ones.              Honoring the Life and Legacy of Mr. Don Zimmerman     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  one of Arkansas' statewide leaders, Mr. Don Zimmerman, who recently  passed away at the age of 75.   Don worked as executive director for the Arkansas Municipal League  for over four decades and was there at the time of his death.   A graduate of the University of Arkansas with a degree in business  administration, Don first joined the Arkansas Municipal League back in  1966 as a field representative before working his way up to the  executive director position in 1974.    Two years ago, he became the first State Municipal League employee to  be recognized by the National League of Cities for 50 years of service.  Don also served two terms on the board of directors of the National  League of Cities.   Mr. Speaker, he was a friend to many across our State of Arkansas,  and I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends, family,  and loved ones.               Recognizing Olan Wages, One of Arkansas' Finest     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize one of Arkansas'  finest, Olan Wages, who recently died at the age of 95.   A veteran of the Army, who served in World War II, Olan Wages was at  the Battle of the Bulge. Mr. Wages' story is one that makes all  Arkansans proud. For his service, he was awarded two Purple Hearts with  oakleaf cluster, four Bronze Stars, a Good Conduct Medal, a World War  II Commemorative Medal, a Normandy Jubilee of Liberty Medal, and a  French Legion of Honor Medal, among others.   Mr. Wages is survived by his three loving daughters, Brenda, Marcia,  and Kay.   Mr. Speaker, Olan's example is one all Americans and Arkansans can  admire, and I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends,  family, and loved ones.               Recognizing the Achievements of Kevontae Carter     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the achievements of  Kevontae Carter, a junior at Philander Smith College in my hometown of  Little Rock. I am pleased to announce that the White House Initiative  on Historically Black Colleges and Universities has named him an  inaugural Competitiveness Scholar. Competitiveness Scholars are  students who have exhibited exceptional academic achievement,  engagement with their communities, and an entrepreneurial spirit.   Kevontae, who is majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics, was  personally nominated for this honor by Philander's president, Dr.  Roderick Smothers. A leader on campus, he serves as a student  ambassador for the United Negro College Fund, of which Philander is the  only member in the State of Arkansas.   Mr. Speaker, I honor Kevontae's commitment to excellence and commend  him on being named to this distinguished fellowship.                         Recognizing Ms. Annie Abrams     Mr. Speaker, it gives me a lot of pleasure today to  recognize a dear friend and a civil rights icon from Arkansas, Ms.  Annie Abrams, and wish her a very, very happy 87th birthday.   Ms. Abrams has served her State and country tirelessly throughout her  career, from her involvement in the desegregation of Central High  School to her role with the Arkansas Teachers Association, including  becoming the first African American PTA president at Central High.   Born in Arkadelphia, Ms. Abrams moved to Little Rock at the age of 13  to pursue a better education, and she graduated from Dunbar High School  and later Philander Smith College with a degree in special education.   She continues to be involved in many local community service  organizations, including the Little Rock Central High Integration 50th  Anniversary Commission, a commissioner for the Fair Housing Commission,  and treasurer of the Arkansas Democratic Black Caucus.   As a local educator and civic and community leader, Ms. Abrams has  enriched the lives of countless Arkansans and Americans. She is the  busiest woman I know, particularly for someone on the cusp of an 87th  birthday.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to our next opportunity to be together,  and I thank her for her lifetime of service to our community.      Recognizing the Anniversary of the Central High School Integration     Mr. Speaker, 61 years ago today, all eyes were on South  Park Street that fronts the beautiful facade of Central High School in  Little Rock, Arkansas. Just days before, the Arkansas Governor, Orval  Faubus, had called out the National Guard to prevent nine Black  students from entering that school on September 4.   Central High and its beautiful neighborhood had become ground zero in  the march to end the five-decade legacy of Plessy v. Ferguson, separate  but equal. Now, just over 3 years after the Brown v. Board of Education  decision, it was time for action.   In a few days, on the 25th of this month, we will celebrate the  successful integration of Central High School when the Little Rock Nine  entered the school, escorted by the 101st Airborne Division.   It is fitting today, Mr. Speaker, that we pay tribute to the Little  Rock Nine, their defenders, and the successful end to separate but  equal. I am proud to recognize this important milestone today on this  House floor and remember passing the bill 1 year ago that I authored  that expands the park boundary of the National Historic Site at Little  Rock Central High School. This is a historic and an important  touchstone for all those modern-day history travelers retracing the  steps of the civil rights movement.  [[Page H8256]]    The National Historic Site Visitor Center was opened in 2007 on the  occasion of the 50th anniversary of Central High's integration. My bill  extended the park boundaries to take in the houses that fronted the  school along South Park Street so that future generations will be able  to picture that street just as it was and reflect on those 21 days of  trauma back in 1957.   Bringing the properties into the boundary of the site provides the  National Park Service with more tools and flexibility for partnering  with the homeowners to historically preserve their front facade and the  yards of those homes. Together with the school, the seven homes across  the street from Central High will now stand as a living monument to the  civil rights movement in Arkansas and the United States.   I want to thank the National Park Service superintendent at that  site, Robin White, for her leadership and her persistent work with the  community to enhance it as an educational resource and a key stop on  the Civil Rights Trail.   The Little Rock Nine's brave actions integrating Little Rock Central  High will forever be remembered for their unparalleled role in ending  so-called separate but equal. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize  the 61st anniversary of these brave actions by those young people.                                time  1715         Recognizing the Accomplishments of Women Throughout History     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the important  accomplishments of women throughout history and to call attention to  the millions of women across the globe who lack access to education and  are denied access to opportunity.   Small businesses are the engines of our economy in Arkansas and  across our entire Nation. They create and support jobs within our local  communities and employ approximately half of all private-sector workers  in the United States.   According to the Small Business Administration, 30 million small  businesses in the U.S. make up over 99 percent of our Nation's  businesses; and of those, 11.4 million are women-owned businesses,  employing nearly 9 million people. They are centers of innovation,  discovery, and opportunity, empowering and equipping Americans for  success.   Everyone should have the opportunity to rise, but in America, women  entrepreneurs face barriers to certain business resources that many  males with similar aspirations don't.   We have got to work hard for our hardworking Americans and our  hardworking American families. In Arkansas, Winrock International is  doing just that through its Arkansas Women's Business Center. The  Arkansas Women's Business Center provides training, counseling, and  access to capital for women who want their business to grow and become  competitive.   Though obstacles to entrepreneurship and opportunity also exist  outside the U.S., there are entities, including Winrock, supporting  solutions that promote prosperity and provide a means for women to  flourish around the world.   I had a chance to visit with a very hardworking, enterprising, caring  young woman from my hometown of Little Rock, recently, whose innovative  efforts were to eradicate hopelessness and give hope to those in  poverty by lifting them up and aiding their pursuit of happiness and  promoting the fruits of the dignity of work.   Anna Taylor is the founder of the clothing company Judith & James of  the nonprofit James127 Foundation. She started her remarkable journey  during her family's mission work in Africa.   Inspired by the desire and drive of the Kenyan women she encountered,  Anna set out to work with them to ensure that they have the opportunity  to provide for their loved ones and themselves. Today, her foundation  provides practical and hands-on sewing training to Kenyan widows,  offering hope and a future to women whose communities have been ravaged  by poverty and disease.   When you empower women, you empower their communities.   For too long, too many young girls and women throughout the world  continue to be denied an effective education. We must continue to work  to address this injustice and ensure that all women are provided  fundamental freedoms in the political, social, cultural, economic, and  civic fields.   So I would like to applaud the House on its recent passage of H.R.  5480, the Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, and  commend my fellow Arkansan, Senator John Boozman, for introducing its  companion in the Senate.   As the proud father of a daughter studying hard in college--I hope  she is studying hard--I believe that it is critical that we all support  all of our aspiring young women. I urge the Senate to act quickly on  this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
