 Madam Speaker, I could speak for hours about this  administration's multiple failures over the last year, but I only have  a couple of minutes, so I will cover just inflation, one of them.   Since Joe Biden took office, inflation has risen every single month.  Americans are paying more for just about everything while earning less  in every paycheck.   This is not sustainable, and it didn't have to be this way. This  administration is so out of touch with the average American that  despite inflation reaching a 40-year high, they are still pushing for  more reckless spending that will only make this crisis worse.   American families are paying substantially more for everyday  products, from gasoline to groceries and to energy for heating their  homes this winter, to heat their homes in northern Minnesota when it is  30-below for a week straight.   Make no mistake, inflation is a tax on us all, especially our working  class and those on fixed incomes. It is no secret that we live in a  very polarized nation right now, but there is one thing a strong  majority of Americans agree on: Joe Biden's first year in office has  been disastrous to the American people. We deserve better.
