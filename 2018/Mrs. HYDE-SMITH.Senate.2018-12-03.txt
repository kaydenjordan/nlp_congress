 Madam President, I would like to call  attention to U.S. Navy LCDR Kerry S. Jackson, who is retiring December  7, 2018, after 26 years of honorable service to our country. He  enlisted in 1988, completed Navy SEAL Training in 1989, and received  his commission as a naval officer in 2003. As a SEAL, he completed  eight deployments and a broad scope of high-risk missions across the  globe.   From 2015 to 2018, Lieutenant Commander Jackson served as executive  officer of the Naval Small Craft Instructional and Applied Technical  Training School, NAVSCIATTS, located at Stennis Space Center in Hancock  County, MS. NAVSCIATTS trains students from partner nations around the  world in small craft and riverine operations. Under his leadership,  foreign military students are better prepared to fight both state and  nonstate adversaries by employing advanced riverine combat, navigation,  and other technical skills developed at NAVSCIATTS. Lieutenant  Commander Jackson's leadership of this program created and fostered  critical diplomatic relationships with partner nations around the  world.   During the course of his military career, he has been awarded three  Joint Service Commendation Medals, seven Navy and Marine Corps  Commendation Medals, one Army Commendation Medal, two Joint Service  Achievement Medals, five Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, the  Combat Action Ribbon, and various other personal, unit, and campaign  awards.   I commend Lieutenant Commander Jackson for his 26 years of faithful  service to our Nation, extend my deepest gratitude to him and his  entire family, and wish him the best during his transition to civilian  life.                            ____________________
