 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are here tonight for a very simple  reason with a very simple proposition--that the American people deserve  to know about the origins of COVID-19. They deserve to know how this  terrible pandemic that has ravaged the globe and our country, how it  got started and what China's role was in starting it.   Now, we have seen a parade of government officials speculate about  the origins in one place or another. And there is increasing  speculation and, indeed, increasing numbers of statements from  government officials saying that perhaps this virus originated in a  Chinese lab, in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.   Well, I think it is time that the American people got to decide for  themselves. It is time that they actually got to see the evidence that  the U.S. Government has collected on this issue, and that is exactly  what the measure that we are introducing here tonight would do. It  would make available to the American people the evidence that the U.S.  Government has about the origins of this terrible virus and this  terrible pandemic.   I am proud to be joined in this effort by Senator Braun, and I know  that he would like to make a few remarks.    Mr. President, the American people can be trusted with  the truth. More than that, the American people deserve the truth.   They deserve to know the true origins of this virus. They deserve to  be able to evaluate the evidence for themselves. They deserve it. Their  government owes it to them, and it is time to act.   And the American people deserve something else. They deserve to have  this government hold accountable that nation which started this virus,  whose lies about this virus turned it into a global pandemic, whose  lies about this virus prevented our country and many others from being  able to address it effectively in time. Of course, I am talking about  China. The American people deserve to have all of the evidence and  deserve to have this government's full effort and the effort of our  allies and partners in holding accountable China for what it has done,  not just to this country but to the world, and to make sure that  something like this never happens again.   So, Mr. President, I ask now unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1867, which is at desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I thank the Senate for this action  tonight.   This is, as Senator Braun said, an important first step. It is only a  first step, but the truth is always the right step, and that is the  action that we have taken tonight.   I yield the floor.                              Order of Business
