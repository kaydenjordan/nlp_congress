 Mr. President, I think we are going to have a couple of  votes shortly on amendments. Senator Alexander and I will offer one to  the underlying bill. I think Senator Coons will offer another one along  with, I believe, Senator Rounds.                   Amendment No. 2920 to Amendment No. 2910    As Members are returning from their caucus lunches, I will kick it  off and lay the groundwork for the amendment Senator Alexander and I  will be offering. I believe we have Senate amendment No. 2920 at the  desk on behalf of Senator Alexander and myself.   I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 2920 be called up and made  the pending business.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading  of the amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, the amendment Senator Alexander and I are  offering is a bipartisan effort, as you can tell. It is the result of  discussions between Senator Alexander's Appropriations Committee staff  and the staff who works for us on the Environment and Public Works  Committee.   The amendment would require the Corps to report to Congress on the  status of Corps project expenses. The amendment would allow project  sponsors to receive a final cost accounting of project dollars so that  they understand how those dollars are spent and know whether there are  excess unspent funds and whether those funds are being returned to  State and local government or to the Federal Government.   As many of our colleagues know, the Senate is getting ready to  address soon--probably, if not this month, then next month--the water  resources development legislation that Senator Barrasso, our chairman  on Environment and Public Works, and I and other colleagues have worked  on. It was reported unanimously out of the Environment and Public Works  Committee. That bill, which is called America's Water Infrastructure  Act of 2018, makes investments in updating and expanding water  infrastructure systems throughout the country. Along with reauthorizing  the ongoing work of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, our legislation  addresses a wide variety of priorities. Again, it was reported  unanimously out of our committee about a month or so ago, 21 to 0.   In the drafting of this legislation, several concerns were raised  about how the Corps selects and prioritizes projects for construction,  as well as what happens to excess local cost share dollars at the end  of a project. For example, in my home State of Delaware, our State  agency that sponsors the beach renourishment and other shoreline  protection projects has been asking the Corps for a detailed balance  sheet for years to understand how funds are being allocated on various  projects and how local tax dollars are being spent. Unfortunately, that  material has never been provided despite repeated requests.   Delaware is not alone in this. The Senator from Kansas, Mr. Moran,  has brought to my attention an issue of malfunctioning radial arm  gates--also called Tainter gates--on a reservoir in his home State of  Kansas. The local irrigation district was billed for the repairs of the  gates, which was added as an additional cost to their annual share of  the operations and maintenance of that project.   Although the irrigation district has been paying on this bill, they  never knew how much it actually cost to repair the gates. It took my  staff and Senator Barrasso's staff to find out that the total cost of  repairs was $31 million. This means, according to the Corps, that the  remaining local cost share is about $5 million. However, because there  is not a detailed accounting, the question has been raised about  whether the Corps billed the irrigation district correctly. If the  Corps had accounted for this program correctly, the cost share should  have been about $1 million. That difference of $4 million may not sound  like a lot to us here in the Senate or in the Federal Government, but  $4 million to a local rural irrigation district is a lot of money.   Sadly, as I said before, this data has not been provided to many cost  share partners, as is the law, and we need to get to the bottom of why  and where it is happening.   Senator Alexander and I believe that this report that is being  requested sets the stage for more transparency and better budgeting at  the Corps, which is also a theme in the America's Water Infrastructure  Act that we will be addressing, I hope, next month.   Let me conclude by once more thanking Chairman Alexander and his  staff for working with my staff and me and also with Senator Barrasso  on the water resources development legislation and on this amendment.  It truly is a bipartisan amendment and a good one to start off the  discussion on the underlying bill. We are pleased to be a part of this,  and we look forward to passing this important piece of legislation that  is critical to funding a central piece of our Nation's economic  infrastructure.   I encourage support for my amendment.   I yield the floor to Senator Alexander and look forward to working  with him as we go forward.    Mr. President, earlier when I spoke about the amendment  with Senator Coons as the lead Democrat, I mentioned the wrong  cosponsor. I would correct myself to say it is not Senator Rounds, who  does great legislation, but in this case, it is Senator Gardner.    I yield back our time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges of  the floor for the remainder of this Congress be granted to the  following members of my staff: Andrew Wishnia, Zachary Pilchen,  Christina Baysinger, and Skylar Bayer.
