 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 380,  I call up the bill (H.R. 1065) to eliminate discrimination and promote  women's health and economic security by ensuring reasonable workplace  accommodations for workers whose ability to perform the functions of a  job are limited by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical  condition, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 1065, the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1065, the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act introduced by Representatives Nadler and Katko.   It is unacceptable that, in 2021, pregnant workers can still be  denied basic workplace accommodations that help them stay healthy  during their pregnancy. These accommodations, from  [[Page H2323]]  providing seating and water to excusing pregnant workers from heavy  lifting, are not complex or costly.   But without these protections, too many workers are forced to either  leave their jobs or put their health and the health of their pregnancy  at risk. We can and must do better to ensure that no worker in this  country is forced to choose between financial security and a healthy  pregnancy.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would finally establish a right to  reasonable accommodations to all pregnant workers, and it would  guarantee that pregnant workers can seek those accommodations without  facing discrimination or retaliation.   Last Congress, 226 House Democrats and 103 Republicans came together  to pass this legislation by a margin of 329-73. I hope we can come  together again this year and finally deliver this bipartisan priority  to our Nation's workers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for the Pregnant Workers Fairness  Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                               Committee on House Administration,                                     Washington, DC, March 24, 2021.      Hon. Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       1065, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. There are certain       provisions in the legislation which fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on House Administration.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration, the Committee on House       Administration agrees to forego action on the bill. This is       done with the understanding that the Committee on House       Administration's jurisdictional interests over this and       similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In       addition, the Committee reserves its right to seek conferees       on any provisions within its jurisdiction which are       considered in a House-Senate conference and requests your       support if such a request is made.        I would appreciate your response confirming this       understanding with respect to H.R. 1065 and ask that a copy       of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in your       committee report on the bill and in the Congressional Record       during consideration of the bill on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Zoe Lofgren,      Chairperson.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Education and Labor,                                     Washington, DC, March 25, 2021.      Hon. Zoe Lofgren,      Chairperson, Committee on House Administration, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairperson Lofgren: In reference to your letter of       March 24, 2021, I write to confirm our mutual understanding       regarding H.R. 1065, the ``Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.''        I appreciate the Committee on House Administration's waiver       of consideration of H.R. 1065 as specified in your letter. I       acknowledge that the waiver was granted only to expedite       floor consideration of H.R. 1065 and does not in any way       waive or diminish the Committee on House Administration's       jurisdictional interests over this or similar legislation.        I would be pleased to include our exchange of letters on       this matter in the committee report for H.R. 1065 and in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill       to memorialize our joint understanding.        Again, thank you for your assistance with this matter.

Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, House Committee on Education and Labor, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 1065, the ``Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act,'' that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I       appreciate your consulting with us on those provisions. The       Judiciary Committee has no objection to your including them       in the bill for consideration on the House floor, and to       expedite that consideration is willing to forgo action on       H.R. 1065, with the understanding that we do not thereby       waive any future jurisdictional claim over those provisions       or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Education and Labor,                                     Washington, DC, April 28, 2021.

In the interest of permitting your Committee to proceed       expeditiously on this bill, I am willing to waive this       Committee's right to sequential referral. I do so with the       understanding that by waiving consideration of the bill, the       Committee on Oversight and Reform does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the bill that fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I request       that you urge the Speaker to name members of this Committee       to any conference committee that is named to consider such       provisions.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our respective       Committees.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the chair of the Civil Rights  and Human Services Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), a  member of the Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath), a member of the Education and  Labor Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), the lead cosponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to  briefly respond to the fact that, first of all, this only applies to  those employers with 15 workers or more. Furthermore, the Religious  Freedom Restoration Act and First Amendment still apply. It is hard to  imagine any religious objection to giving a pregnant worker water or an  extra bathroom break, and there haven't been any complaints to the EEOC  about the failure to do that.   At this time I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stevens), a member of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), the chair of the House Judiciary  Committee and sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter  from dozens of religious organizations, including the Catholic Labor  Network, Jewish Women International, National Council of Churches,  Union for Reform Judaism, and United Church of Christ, Justice and  Witness Ministries in support of the legislation as it is.         Dear Representative: On behalf of the undersigned religious       and faith-based organizations representing a diversity of       faith traditions and communities across the nation, we write       today in support of healthy workplace environments and       conditions for pregnant workers. We urge you to pass the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 1065). People of faith       across the ideological spectrum understand that prioritizing       the health and safety of pregnant workers should not be a       partisan issue. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would       ensure that pregnant workers can continue safely working to       support their families during a pregnancy. The bill requires       employers to make the same sort of accommodations for       pregnant workers as are already in place for workers with       disabilities.        Our faith traditions affirm the dignity of pregnant       individuals and the moral imperative of ensuring their       safety. We also affirm the dignity of work and the obligation       to treat workers justly. It is immoral for an employer to       force a worker to choose between a healthy pregnancy and       earning a living. By passing the bipartisan Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act (H.R. 1065), Congress will ensure that workers       who are pregnant will be treated fairly in the workforce and       can continue earning income to support themselves and their       families. Efforts to distract from the central goal of       ensuring pregnant workers can maintain their health and the       health of their pregnancies by inserting unnecessary,       harmful, and politically divisive language into this bill       undermines our obligation to protect pregnant workers across       our country.        While many pregnant individuals continue working throughout       their pregnancies without incident, there are instances when       minor accommodations are necessary at the workplace to ensure       the safety of the expecting mother and the baby. All too       often, requests for simple workplace accommodations like a  [[Page H2337]]       stool to sit, a water bottle, or a bathroom break are denied.       Within the COVID-19 context, such critical accommodations       might include proper protective equipment, telework, or       staggered work schedules that offer employees commute times       which avoid crowded public transportation and increased       exposure. Currently, pregnant workers may continue to work       without necessary accommodations because they fear losing       their jobs and need the income, thus endangering their health       or the health of their pregnancy. Without these protections,       it is not uncommon for pregnant workers to be let go or       forced out onto unpaid leave for requesting accommodations.       Many others must quit their job to avoid risking the health       of their pregnancy.        Passing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a moral and       economic imperative; two-thirds of women who had their first       child between 2006 and 2008, the last year for which data is       available, worked during pregnancy, and 88 percent of these       first-time mothers worked into their last trimester. Keeping       these women healthy and in the workforce is paramount to       family economic security. In 2020, 77.5 percent of mothers       with children under age 6 worked full time, and that number       goes up to 81.2 percent for employed mothers with children       ages 6 to 17. Millions of families rely on their earnings. In       2019, the last year for which data is available, 41 percent       of mothers were the sole or primary breadwinners in their       families, while 24.8 percent of mothers were co-breadwinners.       Whole families suffer when pregnant workers are forced out of       a job.        The undersigned religious and faith-based groups are united       in support of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. We strongly       urge you to vote for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.

Faith Leader Statements. of Support for Pregnant Workers Fairness Act         ``The Union for Reform Judaism is proud to support the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. According to the ancient       rabbis, workers should not be put in the position where they       have ``to starve or afflict themselves in order to feed their       children'' (Tosefta Bava Metzia 8:2). With reasonable       workplace accommodations, pregnant workers can keep earning a       livelihood while protecting their health, so no worker faces       the agonizing choice between a healthy pregnancy and their       family's financial security. As the inequitable impact of the       pandemic has highlighted, People of Color are more likely to       hold demanding, inflexible jobs where they face tradeoffs       between their work and their health. Illegal pregnancy       discrimination and denial of workplace accommodations, which       disproportionately affect pregnant People of Color,       contribute to the Black maternal health crisis and other       forms of racial inequity. Congress must protect expectant       parents and pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which       will help to mitigate the racial and economic injustices that       pregnancy discrimination perpetuates.''--Rabbi Jonah Dov       Pesner, Director, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism        NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice urges all members       of the House of Representatives to vote yes on the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act (PWFA). In just the fall of 2020, this       critical legislation received more than 300 affirmative votes       in the House and now is the time to show the same       overwhelming support for pregnant workers. This common sense,       bipartisan legislation is faithful to the principles of       Catholic Social Teaching--and the dignity of the human person       in particular--by caring for the health and economic security       of pregnant people and their families. Forcing workers to       choose between a healthy pregnancy and a paycheck is immoral       and the PWFA ends this injustice. NETWORK Lobby calls on the       House of Representatives to quickly send the PWFA to the       Senate to support working people in the United States who are       bringing new life into the world.''--Mary J. Novak, Executive       Director, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice        The Catholic Labor Network strongly supports the Pregnant       Workers' Fairness Act. Pro-life and proworker, this essential       legislation protects worker justice and honors families. No       woman should have to choose between her job and her unborn       child.''--Clayton Sinyai, Executive Director, Catholic Labor       Network        ``National Council of Jewish Women knows that pregnancy       discrimination is a racial justice issue. Black women,       Latinas, and immigrant women are more likely to hold       inflexible and physically demanding jobs that present       specific challenges for pregnant workers and are less likely       to provide reasonable pregnancy accommodation. The Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act would ensure that pregnant people do not       have to choose between a healthy pregnancy and their economic       security.''--Jody Rabhan, Chief Policy Officer, National       Council of Jewish Women        ``ln so many of our homes, children depend upon their       mothers for placing food on the table. Moms work; that's been       the case for years. Yet our laws and regulations are not       keeping up. Too often, working women who are pregnant are not       given appropriate accommodations while they are pregnant.       Congress must pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that       would ensure that pregnant workers are able to continue       working safely, in the same way as workers with disabilities       are accommodated''--Lawrence E. Couch, Director, National       Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd        ``Women of Reform Judaism is proud to support the Pregnant       Workers' Fairness Act. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened       the urgent need to establish policies to protect essential       workers--overwhelmingly Black women, Latinas, immigrant       women, and other Women of Color. Today, far too many of these       essential workers are denied temporary job-related       accommodations in order to maintain a healthy pregnancy and       are forced to make the heartbreaking choice between their       family's economic security and their health. No worker should       ever be forced to make such a choice. Passing the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act is a moral imperative and we urge       members of Congress to support its swift passage.''--Rabbi       Marla Feldman, Executive Director, Women of Reform Judaism     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, could you advise as to how much  time is remaining on both sides?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the United States  House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), the chair of the Subcommittee on the  Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties of the Judiciary  Committee.     Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is based on the simple  idea that no one in this country should have to choose between  financial security and a healthy pregnancy.   This concept of fairness for pregnant workers is precisely why both  Democrats and Republicans came together to pass the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act in the last Congress.   Let's be clear. Reasonable protections for workers are nothing new in  our Nation's workplaces. Employers already have several decades of  experience providing reasonable accommodations for workers with  disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act.   We have heard about the fact that it doesn't include a religious  exemption. Well, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act still applies.  The First Amendment still applies. But there is no reason to give a  wholesale exemption to religious organizations, because what are you  exempting them from? Providing water for pregnant workers, giving a  bathroom break to a pregnant worker, is that what they need an  exemption from?   We need to make sure that those accommodations are available to all  pregnant women who are working and that organizations with at least 15  workers are guaranteeing protections for pregnant workers in Federal  law.                                time  1015    By doing that, this bill will eliminate the confusing patchwork of  State and local workplace standards that workers and employers are  currently forced to navigate. This legislation has broad support across  the political spectrum and our communities.   In a recent nationwide survey, 89 percent of voters say they support  the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. Labor unions; civil rights groups,  as we have heard; and the business community, including the Chamber of  Commerce, have all endorsed this proposal as it is. It is imperative  that we finally guarantee pregnant workers access to reasonable  workplace accommodations.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by over 250  organizations in support of H.R. 1065, the Pregnant Workers Fairness  Act.

Dear Member of Congress: As organizations committed to       promoting the health and economic security of our nation's       families, we urge you to support the Pregnant  [[Page H2340]]       Workers Fairness Act, a crucial maternal and infant health       measure. This bipartisan legislation promotes healthy       pregnancies and economic security for pregnant workers and       their families and strengthens the economy.        In the last few decades, there has been a dramatic       demographic shift in the workforce. Not only do women now       make up almost half of the workforce, but there are more       pregnant workers than ever before and they are working later       into their pregnancies. The simple reality is that some       pregnant workers--especially those in physically demanding       jobs--will have a medical need for a temporary job-related       accommodation in order to maintain a healthy pregnancy. Yet,       too often, instead of providing pregnant workers with an       accommodation, employers will fire or push them onto unpaid       leave, depriving them of a paycheck and health insurance at a       time when it may be most needed.        Additionally, discrimination affects pregnant workers       across race and ethnicity, but women of color and immigrants       may be at particular risk. Latinas, Black women and immigrant       women are more likely to hold certain inflexible and       physically demanding jobs that can present specific       challenges for pregnant workers, such as cashiers, home       health aides, food service workers, and cleaners, making       reasonable accommodations on the job even more important, and       loss of wages and health insurance due to pregnancy       discrimination especially challenging. American families and       the American economy depend on women's income: we cannot       afford to force pregnant workers out of work.        In 2015, in Young v. United Parcel Service, the Supreme       Court held that a failure to make accommodations for pregnant       workers with medical needs will sometimes violate the       Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA). Yet, even after       Young, pregnant workers are still not getting the       accommodations they need to stay safe and healthy on the job       and employers lack clarity as to their obligations under the       law. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will provide a clear,       predictable rule: employers must provide reasonable       accommodations for limitations arising out of pregnancy,       childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless this would       pose an undue hardship.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is modeled after the       Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and offers employers       and employees a familiar reasonable accommodation framework       to follow. Under the ADA, workers with disabilities enjoy       clear statutory protections and need not prove how other       employees are treated in order to obtain necessary       accommodations. Pregnant workers deserve the same clarity and       streamlined process and should not have to ascertain how       their employer treats others in order to understand their own       accommodation rights, as the Supreme Court's ruling currently       requires.        Evidence from states and cities that have adopted laws       similar to the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act suggests that       providing this clarity reduces lawsuits and, most       importantly, helps ensure that workers can obtain necessary       reasonable accommodations in a timely manner, which keeps       pregnant workers healthy and earning an income when they need       it most. Workers should not have to choose between providing       for their family and maintaining a healthy pregnancy, and the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would ensure that all those       working for covered employers would be protected.        The need for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is       recognized across ideological and partisan lines. Thirty       states and D.C. have adopted pregnant worker fairness       measures with broad, and often unanimous, bipartisan support.       Twenty-five of those laws have passed within the last seven       years. These states include: Alaska, California, Colorado,       Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,       Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New       Mexico, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North       Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee,       Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Vermont, Virginia, and       Washington. Lawmakers have concluded that accommodating       pregnant workers who need it is a measured approach grounded       in family values and basic fairness.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is necessary because it       promotes long-term economic security and workplace fairness.       When accommodations allow pregnant workers to continue to       work, they can maintain income and seniority, while forced       leave sets new parents back with lost wages and missed       advancement opportunities. When pregnant workers are fired,       not only do they and their families lose critical income, but       they must fight extra hard to re-enter a job market that is       especially brutal on those who are pregnant and unemployed.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is vital because it       supports healthy pregnancies. The choice between risking a       job and risking the health of a pregnancy is one no one       should have to make. Pregnant workers who cannot perform some       aspects of their usual duties without risking their own       health or the health of their pregnancy, but whose families       cannot afford to lose their income, may continue working       under dangerous conditions. There are health consequences to       pushing pregnant workers out of the workforce as well. Stress       from job loss can increase the risk of having a premature       baby and/or a baby with low birth weight. In addition, if       workers are not forced to use their leave during pregnancy,       they may have more leave available to take following       childbirth, which in turn facilitates lactation, bonding with       and caring for a new child, and recovering from childbirth.        For all of these reasons, we urge you to support the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.        We also welcome the opportunity to provide you with       additional information.

Mr. Speaker, lastly, I thank Chairman Nadler  and Congressman Katko for their leadership on this important  legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House of  Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
