 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as Senators, our gravest responsibility  is deciding when to authorize the use of military force because that is  a decision about life and death. It is a decision about sending our  sons and daughters into harm's way.   More than 20 years ago, we voted on whether to authorize the use of  military force against Iraq. Decades later, we have a chance to  formally end that war and claw back an outdated authority.   When authorizations for military force have outlived the purpose that  Congress intended, we should repeal them. We should repeal them to  ensure that Congress determines when to send Americans into harm's way,  so that our laws reflect current threats and protect U.S. interests,  and to guard against future executive abuse.   Now, it has taken a long time to get here. I want to commend Senators  Kaine and Young, two esteemed members of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee who have been pursuing repeal of the 1991 and 2002 AUMFs  against Iraq for years, and I applaud their relentless focus on this  issue.   As we mark the 20th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, we cannot  ignore its heavy toll. It destabilized the Middle East. It empowered  Iran. It turned al-Qaida into a regional franchise. By some estimates,  it killed more than a half million Iraqis. It was a war our partners in  the region did not support, and it damaged American leadership on the  global stage. But, most gravely, it cost our Nation nearly 5,000  lives--Americans who fought bravely and served their Nation and didn't  ask the question whether it is right or wrong but just answered the  call.   Now, I am proud to have voted against going to war with Iraq in 2002  when I served in the House. I believe history has proven that that was  the right call. But that is not the question before us today. The Iraq  of 2023 is far different than the Iraq of 2003. Today, Iraq is a  critical strategic partner. We fight ISIS together. We protect American  personnel and American assets together. This relationship also goes far  beyond security. We are partnering on health, education, on climate  change. We are working to stabilize global energy markets together.   Repealing these outdated authorizations would cement this important  relationship with serious bilateral diplomacy. It would help Iraq chart  a course for the future that is independent and more closely integrated  with its Arab neighbors. It also removes a major Iranian talking point,  however false, that the United States is a colonial power in Iraq.   Now, there are real threats in this part of the world. We must be  clear-eyed about those, but the answer to those threats is not the 1991  or 2002 AUMF.   Now, I know, when we get to amendments, my colleagues will offer  amendments to this bill. They will try to delay repeal. They will argue  that we need these authorizations to respond to Iranian-led and  Iranian-backed attacks. They may even offer amendments to expand these  authorizations and give the President even broader authority. But I  urge my colleagues to remember this: The President is clear in his view  that he has the authority, under the 2001 AUMF and the Constitution,  for defensive military operations against ISIS or Iranian threats  against U.S. personnel and interests. In fact, the President has  responded to Iranian-led and Iranian-backed attacks repeatedly and has  done so without--without--relying on the 2002 AUMF.   Now, take it from me, as someone who has worked for decades to  confront the challenge of Iran, I know well the threat that Iran poses  to us and to our allies in the region. We cannot be naive about their  intentions, and we need to have the political will to respond how and  when we deem necessary. But repeal will have no impact on our ability  to defend U.S. interests against Iran--none whatsoever.   After 20 years, this is a defining moment. Congress needs to repeal  these authorizations for the use of military force to reassert our  constitutional role on war powers.   We should not just declare war; we need to be able to end them as  well. And let's be clear: This is not some theoretical debate. This is  about the lives of our servicemen and -women who may be called upon to  fight and make the ultimate sacrifice.   In our democracy, those decisions must be made by Congress. So I am  proud that we are stepping up to have the difficult debates that we  should have. And I look forward to passing this bill with a strong  bipartisan vote, as it passed out of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, which has jurisdiction over the authorizations for use of  military force. That bipartisan vote there, I think, will be reflected  in a bipartisan vote in the House.   I urge my colleagues to vote to repeal these authorizations, and, in  the first instance, to start by doing so by voting to have cloture.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

The estimated total cost is       $895 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist our ally in developing and maintaining a       strong and ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale will improve Australia's capability to       interoperate with U.S. maritime forces and other allied       forces as well as its ability to contribute to missions of       mutual interest. By deploying the Tomahawk Weapon System,       Australia will contribute to global readiness and enhance the       capability of U.S. Forces operating alongside them globally.       Australia will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to       regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense.       Australia will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime U.S. contractor will be Raytheon Missiles and       Defense, Tucson, AZ. There are no known offset agreements       proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require multiple       trips by U.S. Government representatives and contractor       personnel to visit Australia on a temporary basis over the       life of the case to support delivery and integration of items       and to provide supply support management, inventory control,       and equipment familiarization. Visits will also include       program and technical reviews.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            transmittal no. 23-02       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION     Romania--M1278A1 Heavy Gun Carriers Joint Light Tactical Vehicles                                  (JLTVs)         The Government of Romania has requested to buy an       additional ninety-five (95) Heavy  [[Page S824]]       Gun Carriers Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs). This       amendment will push the current case above the MDE and total       case value notification thresholds and thus requires       notification of the entire case. The original FMS case,       valued at $43.73 million, included thirty-four (34) Heavy Gun       Carriers JLTVs. Therefore, this notification is for a total       of one hundred twenty-nine (129) M1278A1 Heavy Gun Carriers       Joint Light Tactical Vehicles. Also included are VRC-104       radio kits; VRC-114 radio kits; baseline integration kits;       basic issue items; Defense Advanced GPS Receivers (DAGRs);       DAGR integration kits; network switch ports; exportable power       kits; silent watch energy storages; power expansion kits;       RF7800i intercom kits; combat bumper kits; winch kits; flat       tow kits; run flat kits; spare tire kits; commander supply       display units; improved turret drive systems; M1114 turret       ring hatches; 2-year contractor spare parts package;       technical assistance; total package fielding; technical       publications/manuals; and other related elements of logistics       and program support. The total estimated cost is $104.0       million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO Ally that is a force for       political stability and economic progress in Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Romania's capability to meet       current and future threats by providing a credible force that       is capable of deterring adversaries and enhance its       participation in NATO operations. Romania will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Oshkosh Corporation,       Oshkosh, WI; and Oshkosh Defense, LLC, Oshkosh, WI. There are       no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of this sale will not require the assignment       of any U.S. Government or contractor representatives to       Romania.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-06       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program is a       light tactical vehicle designed to replace the U.S.       Military's aging High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle       fleet. It was designed to close the existing gap in payload,       performance, and protection to our adversaries during multi-      domain operations. It has been an operationally optimal       choice for the light tactical vehicle mission spectrum       anywhere in the world. All JLTV mission variants include a       strong balance of protection, maneuverability, speed,       reliability, and combat support/combat service support       capability that far surpasses any similar vehicle developed       in its weight class today.        2. The JLTV is designed to be a system of systems. System       of systems is a ``set or arrangement of systems that results       when independent and useful systems are integrated into a       larger system that delivers unique capabilities. The Joint       Light Tactical Vehicle allows material and equipment from       authorized contractors or industrial facilities used by U.S.       forces in tactical operations and managed by other Program       Offices.        3. The JLTV has inherent armor built into the base vehicle.       It is what the U.S. Government (USG) calls A-Kit armor. This       A-Kit Inherent armor provides both opaque and transparent       armor solutions to provide a 360-degree azimuthal (i.e., all       around) to include an elevated fire level of protection from       a spectrum of kinetic energy/small arms fire threats with       survivability enhancements to include Automatic Fire       Extinguishing Protection (AFES) and structural rollover       protection of 150% of the vehicle Ground Vehicle Weight       Rating (GVWR).        4. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or       be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        6. A determination has been made that the Government of       Romania can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the       U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined       in the Policy Justification.        7. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Romania.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Joshua  Kretman, a detailee from the State Department to the Foreign Relations  Committee, be granted floor privileges for the duration of the 118th  Congress.
