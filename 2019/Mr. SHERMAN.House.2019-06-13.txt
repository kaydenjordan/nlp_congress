 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for  including my amendment, along with one other amendment, in this en  bloc.   My amendment would transfer $500,000 from the State Department's  capital investments fund and put it in the U.S. Agency for Global Media  fund. This extra money would allow the USAGM to begin the process of  having Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty broadcast in the Sindhi language  in Pakistan.   There is, perhaps, nowhere in the world where it is more important  for the United States to battle extremism and to reach out with a  message of democracy and the message of the American people than  Pakistan.   Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state, the only nuclear-armed state that  has ever experienced a military coup, and is a nuclear-armed state with  a significant problem with terrorism.   Today, the USAGM broadcasts in the Urdu language of Pakistan, which  is the primary language of only 8 percent of the Pakistani population.  It does not have the funds to broadcast in the Sindhi language, which  would reach 40 million people.   Mr. Chair, we had hearings in the subcommittee that I chair, the  Subcommittee on Asia, where we focused on this issue. Just today, the  relevant Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia talked about how  important it was for us to reach out to the people of Sindh, to  southern Pakistan, in the language that the people actually speak in  their daily lives.   Accordingly, I offer this amendment, which would provide expanded  broadcasting by the entity known as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Of  course, Pakistan is not in Europe, but it is reached by Radio Liberty.   In 2015, the State Department began some efforts to reach out in the  Sindhi language with a website and with press releases. Now, we have to  take it to the point of radio broadcasting.   Since 2001, the United States has invested $30 billion in economic  security and humanitarian assistance for Pakistan. This amendment deals  with only $500,000 to be invested in winning the hearts and minds of  the Sindhi people.   I will point out that while this amendment would provide $500,000 for  this purpose, it is my hope that, as we go through the legislative  process, we can increase that amount to $1.5 million, which is the  estimate that the Broadcasting Board of Governors has given me for what  it would cost to have a year-round, mostly close to 24-hour Sindhi  language service.   I know that amount seems low, but keep in mind that they already have  most of the content since they are already doing the journalism  necessary to do stories about Pakistan in the Urdu language. This would  give them a chance to broadcast that same content and some other  content in the Sindhi language.                                time  1445     Mr. Chair, I will simply say that looking at the fact  that we have invested $30 billion in our relationship with Pakistan, I  cannot think of a better investment than for us to provide $500,000,  and, I hope, as we go through the legislative process, $1.5 million in  reaching out to those who speak the Sindhi language, some 40 million  people.
