 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, at a time when rolling blackouts have become more common  and as it has become clear that green energy tools, like wind turbines  and solar panels, cannot meet our energy needs, the Biden  administration has taken yet another step to limit the ability of  Americans to use natural gas in their homes.   The weaponization of government against our energy industry only  serves to make our energy future less secure.   This legislation is about ensuring that American families have access  to the products and the energy resources that they need and that they  want.   Currently, natural gas stoves are the preferred cooktop appliance of  nearly 40 percent of American homes. We know that natural gas is safe,  it is reliable, it is affordable energy, and it is a source for  millions of Americans.   The Gas Stove Protection and Freedom Act is a step toward getting the  Federal regulations out of homes and out of businesses. Any attempt to  say that the Biden administration's actions are based in public safety  is not supported by the data that we have at hand.   According to the National Fire Protection Association, electric  ranges were 2\1/2\ times more likely to cause a home fire than gas  stoves. Let me repeat that. Electric ranges were 2\1/2\ times more  likely to cause a fire than gas stoves.   We know that gas stoves are safe, and we cannot allow the Biden  administration to strip away consumer choice simply to fulfill its  green energy agenda.   Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 1615.
