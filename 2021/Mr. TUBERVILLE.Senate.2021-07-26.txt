 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, you know, there is an old saying  that I have used quite often, but it bears repeating: Give a man a  fish, you feed him for a day. Teach a man how to fish, and you feed him  for a lifetime.   It is a simple yet insightful concept. Human beings often like things  to be easy. It is just in our nature. But the reward for easy is very  short-lived. Sometimes, if you don't earn it, you don't understand it.  If we work hard and challenge ourselves to improve, we reap the  benefits for much longer. That is the American way.   I would tell this to my players over the years that I coached. You  know, lessons learned that are applied to the football field also apply  in life. You know, this country owes you one thing: an opportunity.  Sometimes people just need to be shown where that opportunity is at and  encouraged to take it, and that is what everyone in this body should be  focused on doing: opening doors for opportunity for the people of this  country.   President Biden seems determined to close those doors of opportunity  by creating, it looks like, a future massive entitlement state.   My Republican colleagues and I have talked a lot about the reckless  tax-and-spend plan and the cost of that plan on American families. We  are seeing rising inflation, which means dollars from your paycheck are  not going as far. We are seeing costs rise on everyday goods that  families need: food, gas, diapers--you name it; it is going up. This is  a direct result of untargeted spending this year as we are trying to  recover from a pandemic, which is the worst time in the world to be  throwing government money at a pandemic.   And, now, our Democratic colleagues, it looks like, want to spend  $3.5 trillion more, after spending $1.9 trillion back in February. And  what gets talked about less than the cost of this spending is the  social and societal cost of all of these new and expanded programs.  While it may not be easy to see or measure, it is no less important,  and that is what I want to talk about today.   Let's remember how this started and how we got here. It started with  President Biden's announcing two plans--great names. First was the  American Families Plan, and then there was the American Jobs Plan.  Despite their confusing and similar names, on the face they don't sound  that bad. I am for American families, and I am for American jobs.   These plans are not about American families or American jobs. They  are full of progressive items that can only pass the Senate through a  reconciliation process. There won't be any--there won't be any-- Republicans that will vote for this, and Democrats know this. So, now,  here we are with our colleagues stuffing the worst parts of President  Biden's agenda--I am talking about the most progressive items that only  appease the far left of their base--into their latest package. And all  of President Biden's progressive programs cost money, lots and lots of  money. And they are going to pay for them with your taxpayer dollars,  not the government dollars--taxpayer dollars.   A lot of my colleagues have expressed concern with the Democrats'  tax-and-spend spree, but they aren't the only ones sounding the alarm.  Folks back home have started to take notice, and there is a lot more  collective wisdom among the folks back home than there has been here  lately in Washington, DC.   So I brought a couple of letters with me today. These are folks from  Alabama who wrote to me about their concerns with President Biden's  massive spending plan. Here is what James Merrill from Huntsville, AL,  wrote to me:         I have been studying this atrocious ``Biden American       Families Plan'' and it is clear that not only is the cost       staggering, the implications of all the rules that will go       with it will terribly impact all family life and our freedoms       to manage our lives. It blatantly makes the middle-class       dependent on the government--cradle to grave. A clear path to       socialism.''    James, you are exactly right.   And Rosa Hill in Birmingham, AL, had this to say:         I have just listened to President Biden . . . and the ideas       are ridiculous. [We] should be helping each other, [not] the       government . . . [getting] involved.    Ms. Hill makes an important point. Much of this work can and should  be done by our neighbors, churches, and people in the communities. The  problem is, we have been conditioned to wait for the government to do  the hard work of helping the less fortunate for us rather than doing it  ourselves.   Half a century ago, President Lyndon Johnson launched the ``War on  Poverty.'' He and leading liberals at the time thought the answer to  poverty was to dramatically increase the benefits the Federal  Government would give out to the poor. Well, the War on Poverty didn't  work like its backers thought it would. The following decade was filled  with economic stagnation, high inflation, gas lines, spikes in drug  addiction, and a horrifying rise in crimes across our country. Sounds  familiar--doesn't it?--just like what is happening today.   Folks, the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and  over again expecting a different result. We have already tried this.  President Biden is determined to try the same worn out policies today:  throwing trillions and trillions of taxpayer money at the problem and  hoping the problem goes away. It has been and still is the wrong  solution.   President Biden's reckless spending spree won't help struggling  American families. It will trap them in the endless cycle of dependence  on Big Government and taxpayer money. Just take a look at what  President Biden has proposed in his American Families Plan:  [[Page S5064]]  government-subsidized childcare, free preschool, free community  college. Free, free, free; that seems to be the slogan of this  administration.    Of course, we all know that there is no such thing as free in this  country. I have talked before about the fact that President Biden has  proposed 30--you heard me right, 30--new taxes that the Democrats can  choose from to pay for these free programs in their next spending  package--30 new taxes during a pandemic.   According to one analysis by the Hoover Institution, President  Biden's American Families Plan would add 21 million Americans to the  Federal Government's list of beneficiaries--21--21 million more people  living off the government. Now, there are certainly people out there  who need help. We all know that. But this plan opens the floodgates to  taxpayer-funded benefits instead of concentrating on those who mostly  need it. Under President Biden's plan, your family could make up to  $200,000 and still qualify for Federal healthcare--$200,000.   We don't have to comb through the history books for examples on how  these progressive policies fail. We don't have to look far. Just look  at what we have done here recently and the insistence on keeping  unemployment benefits historically high.   My Republican colleagues and I have spoken about how these misguided  benefits essentially paid people not to work, destroying small  businesses all over the country, and our economy's progress has gone  down as we try to recover from this pandemic.   Republican Governors across the country recognized the problem and  decided to cut out the overly generous benefits months ago. Folks who  needed help would get it, but they wouldn't be paid to sit at home, and  then they wouldn't be sitting home when they could have been working at  jobs that would help their family. Just about every Democratic Governor  has insisted on keeping these benefits. Now, what does that tell you,  insisting on keeping the benefits and not keeping the benefits?   We have made some terrible decisions just in a short period of time.  Well, we can already see the results of what is happening with these  benefits. According to the monthly data from the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, States that cut the Federal expanded benefit are closer to  returning to prepandemic employment levels than the States that kept  them. Thirteen of the top 15 States with the best unemployment numbers  have all ended their Federal expanded unemployment insurance.   Why don't we learn from this misguided policy and not repeat it by  spending money on bad outcomes? We seem to continue to do that every  time we turn around.   The reckless tax-and-spend spree to advance President Biden's  progressive agenda isn't just unaffordable; it is un-American. The  United States was founded on the ideas of personal liberty and self- reliance. It makes you feel good about yourself earning your own way,  not government handouts best known as socialism.   Since our founding, people have flocked to the United States because  of the opportunity it gives citizens to succeed, not because of cushy  government handouts. Our society valued and values hard work, grit, and  determination more than the countries most of these folks have left  behind.   Again, this country owes you one thing and that is an opportunity to  succeed through education and hard work. Democrats want you to believe  that you can only succeed with the government's help. Republicans  believe in self-reliance and that you have within you God-given skills  and potential to work hard and succeed. You have that. That is what  this country gives you, which is why President Biden's reckless  spending spree and expansion of government programs is so, so  disappointing.   The President and Democrats think success is measured by how much  taxpayer money the government can spend, but real success is measured  by how many people no longer need the help in the first place. Our  efforts need to empower people to be free to live and work to build a  better life for themselves and their families. The most successful  anti-poverty program should eventually put itself out of business.   So I say, enough. Enough of continuously growing the Federal  Government. Enough of the reckless taxpayer-funded spending sprees.  Enough of trapping people in a cycle of dependence, because a culture  of dependency is a culture in decline.   I say we work together to encourage people to seize the many  opportunities in our country, not have them wait around hoping the  government will fix every problem life throws their way. We can't do  that. It is long past time we get back to teaching folks to fish, to  learn to fish themselves, to be self-reliant. That is a culture of hard  work and resilience. That is a culture of the United States of America,  the best country on the face of the Earth.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
