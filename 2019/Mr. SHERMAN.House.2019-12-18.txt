 Madam Speaker, Robert Mueller lays out facts from 2017  that constitute Obstruction of Justice but says the President cannot be  indicted, only Congress can apply the law to those facts.   Many of us have been talking about impeachment since those facts  emerged in 2017.   Of course, today, we focus on more recent crimes.   So why did we talk of impeachment back when a Republican-led Congress  would not act?   Why do we impeach today when a Republican-led Senate is unlikely to  act?   First, because it is our constitutional duty, no matter what the  political consequences.   Second, because it is the most effective tool to chasten and restrain  a President who does not naturally feel constrained by the rule of law.   I would note that the President's attempt to extort Ukraine was  secretive and furtive, far different from his modus operandi of brazen  threats that we saw in 2017.   We can only imagine what high crimes and misdemeanors this President  would have boldly committed had nobody been talking about impeachment  then--had he felt immune from impeachment.   Today we will demonstrate that the President is not above the law.
