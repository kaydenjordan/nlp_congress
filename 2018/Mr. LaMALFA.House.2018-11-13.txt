 Mr. Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart. In my district,  just a few days ago broke out a tremendously devastating wildfire. It  affected the town of Paradise, California, and has completely destroyed  the town and displaced at least 27,000 people, with many missing, their  whereabouts unknown.   Mr. Speaker, we ask for the prayers of the people of this country for  this still unfolding situation. The fires aren't even all the way out  yet. They haven't investigated everything yet. And they still have  many, many missing people there.   So what we really need is a little more time to put the fires out, so  that we can have re-entry and find those who are missing.   For those who want to support and help in this country, Mr. Speaker,  monetary donations at this time for the Paradise, California, fire,  known as the Camp fire, would be the most helpful thing that people can  do at this time, to give the most assets and resources, the most  helpful for those who are providing and helping with the shelters for  so many people who have been displaced.   I thank the American people for their prayers and support for our  Paradise citizens.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
