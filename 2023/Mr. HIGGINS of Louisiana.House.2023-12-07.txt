 Mr. Speaker, silence your heart and look  into the eyes of this young American. Tomorrow he would have been 101  years old.   On December 8, 1941, for his 19th birthday, he got World War II. Like  millions of other young men across the country, when the attack on  Pearl Harbor was announced the following day after that fateful morning  on December 7, this young man stood up, went and joined the Navy.   The Navy sent him to flight school. He served his country as a pilot  in World War II. He died many years later as I held his hand. This man  is my father, George Joseph Higgins.   Happy birthday, Dad.                            ____________________
