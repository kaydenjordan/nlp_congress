 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jacob's letter  and my response letter be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Dear Senator Rubio: Approximately a year and half ago I was       diagnosed with Celiac, which means that I can only eat gluten       free foods.        There are not a lot of things that are labeled gluten free       and there should be more. A lot of things right now I have to       look up to see if they're gluten free. I have read some       articles that explain how every company should label their       products. It's also hard to know for sure if something is       safe to eat when I go food shopping, out with my friends, and       to restaurants. It would be great if the government could       find a way to put food labeling on packages consistently.        Thank you for putting your time into this.            Sincerely,      Jacob Tannenbaum.                                   ____                                             United States Senate,                                      Washington, DC, June 20, 2018.      Jacob Tannenbaum,      202 Royal Palm Way,      Boca Raton, FL.        Dear Jacob: Thank you for your letter regarding food       labeling. Hearing from fellow Floridians on issues that       affect millions of Americans, including children, is       important for me to do my job in the U.S. Senate.        Food allergies are sometimes mild and easily preventable by       avoiding consumption of certain foods, while other cases may       be life-threatening. With respect to celiac disease, the U.S.       Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that there are       approximately 3 million people in the United States, like       you, who must refrain from ingesting gluten.        Among its many roles, the FDA is responsible for ensuring       the safety of our nation's food supply by enforcing labeling       laws and regulations. The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer       Protection Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-282) was enacted to       require a list of ingredients that may cause allergic       reactions to be included on food labels. Further, the law       tasked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to define       the term ``gluten-free'' on food labels. The FDA issued its       final ``gluten-free'' rule in 2013. Currently, all FDA       regulated food products and dietary supplements (including       imports from other countries) which bear a ``gluten-free''       label must comply with the agency's 2013 voluntary labeling       law. Under the rule, ``gluten-free'' means a food is either       naturally gluten-free, is not constituted from gluten-      containing grains, is constituted from gluten-containing       grains that have been processed to remove gluten, or has an       ``unavoidable presence'' of gluten of not more than 20 parts       per million.        With the prevalence of food allergies impacting millions       across our nation, the federal government plays an important       role in enforcing voluntary labeling requirements, based on       sound science, to ensure consumer safety and confidence.       National, uniform, voluntary labeling standards establish       consistency for businesses engaged in interstate commerce,       while providing necessary protections for consumers to make       safe choices when selecting what food products to purchase       and eat. Mandatory labeling, however, could pose significant       burdens on industry and produce confusion for consumers with       a multitude of labels for every food allergy recognized by       the federal government on each product.        I understand your concerns that it may be difficult at       times to determine what is safe to eat. The good news is that       we live in a country blessed with a plethora of food options,       and a market that responds quickly to consumer needs and       demands. This evolving market, in concert with federal       standards for voluntary labeling, means that it will only get       easier for all Americans to find the ingredient and nutrition       you need to make safe and smart choices in the future.        It is an honor and a privilege to serve you as your United       States Senator, and I commend you for bringing awareness to       this important issue.            Sincerely,                                                       Marco Rubio,      U.S. Senator.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I commemorate the life of  Andrew Ramotnik, a retired veteran from Jacksonville, FL, who recently  passed away.   Andy Ramotnik grew up in Pennsylvania coal country. Two weeks after  the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, at the age of 18, he enlisted in  the U.S. Army Air Corps. In 1943, after basic and radio operator  training, he was assigned to a B-25 medium bomber squadron based in the  north African desert.   On his 43rd bombing mission, Andy's bomber was shot down over Italy,  and he was captured. Andy was a prisoner of war in Stalag 17B for 19  months in Austria. In April 1945, he escaped, was recaptured, and  escaped a second time. For 13 days, Andy and a fellow POW evaded  capture. He was evading the enemy when the war ended in May 1945 and  had to find his way to friendly troops. Andy met up with American  troops and was granted leave and returned to service. After his return,  Andy received a letter from the War Department and a check compensating  him $1 for every day he was a POW. The check was for $554.   It was the rest of the letter that led to my knowing Andy and his  incredible story. While the check he received was for $554, Andy had  actually been a POW for 567 days. However, for 13 of those days, Andy  was evading capture while hiding from the Germans in the Austrian  countryside. The Army does not pay soldiers when they are evading  capture, so the Army docked Andy $13 for the days he had escaped.   Now, Andy did not need the $13. It was not the money but rather the  principle. He had done what was expected of him and what was prescribed  in the Armed Services Code of Conduct. He had escaped, and the Army was  docking him for it. So when I met Andy more than 60 years later, he  still had that $13 on his mind. He told me his story of the bombing  missions, of his plane being shot down, and the struggle to get the  door open so he and another soldier could parachute out. He told me  about the POW camp, hiding in a cave during his first escape, and  hiding at an Austrian farm during his second. He also told me how  foolish he thought it was that the Army docked his pay for doing what  he was supposed to do.   My office looked into it. Unfortunately, it is a longstanding policy  not to pay soldiers evading capture and an issue not easily remedied.  Unfortunately, we could not get Andy his $13.   So, with his passing, I would like to recognize the life of Andy  Ramotnik and thank him for his service. On principle, I think we still  owe him $13. It is a small cost to pay for an 18-year-old boy standing  up to help stop the spread of tyranny and preserving the free  world.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Jaha Dukureh for  her Nobel Peace Prize nomination.   A recent graduate of the University of Central Florida, Jaha was  named one of TIME magazine's ``100 Most Influential People in the  World'' in 2016 and has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize this  year for her work to end female genital mutilation, FMG. She was born  in The Gambia, a small west African country, and was subjected to  female genital mutilation when she was just one week old.   A documentary produced by the Guardian called ``The Girl Who Said No  to FGM'' was made about her story. It details how her identity was  stripped again when she was forced into an arranged marriage at the age  of 15 in New York City and was cut for a second time.   Since beginning her activism, Jaha helped usher in the ban of female  genital mutilation in The Gambia. It is estimated that, by the age of  14, nearly 56 percent of girls in The Gambia were subjected to FMG. She  is also the first person to have been nominated for the Nobel Peace  Prize from The Gambia.   Jaha earned her bachelor's degree in business administration  management at Georgia Southwestern State University in 2013. She  graduated with her master's degree in nonprofit management from the  University of Central Florida in 2018.   I am honored to express my sincere gratitude to Jaha for her  extraordinary leadership to end this horror and look forward to hearing  of her continued work in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Donald Eslinger, the  former Seminole County sheriff, for his induction into the Law  Enforcement Officers' Hall of Fame.   Sheriff Eslinger's law enforcement career began in 1978 as a radio  dispatcher for the department. He subsequently rose through the ranks,  leading in various roles at the department  [[Page S4279]]  until his appointment as sheriff in 1991 and election to the position  the next year. He served the community as sheriff for 25 years,  retiring in 2017. Throughout his tenure, Sheriff Eslinger focused on  mental health advocacy, crime reduction, and is responsible for the  Kids House, Shop with the Sheriff, and Christmas Village programs.   Sheriff Eslinger was nominated by law enforcement leaders to be  inducted into the Florida Law Enforcement Officer' Hall of Fame. His  induction was approved by Governor Rick Scott and the State cabinet. At  his induction ceremony, Sheriff Eslinger noted protecting the most  vulnerable in the community was at the core of the Seminole County  Sheriff's Office under his leadership.   Sheriff Eslinger earned his bachelor's degree from National Louis  University and graduated from the Federal Bureau of Investigation  National Academy in Virginia. He and his wife, Elise, have four  children.   I express my sincere gratitude to Sheriff Eslinger for his dedication  to serving the community with the Seminole County Sheriff's Office, and  I wish him the very best in his retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I recognize Judge Thomas Patterson  Maney, who has served his Nation honorably and is retiring.   Judge Maney served our Nation in the Army Reserve for almost 37  years, including 8 years of Active Duty, serving in Panama, Haiti,  Bosnia, and Afghanistan. As a major and lieutenant colonel, he worked  with the military group at the U.S. Embassy in Panama, training the  Guardia Nacional/Panama Defense Force in civil affairs and civic  action. He commanded a reserve civil affairs brigade in Maryland, as  well as the 350th Civil Affairs Command in Pensacola, and later served  as the deputy commander of the Civil Affairs and Psychological  Operations Command and deputy commandant of the John F. Kennedy Special  Operations School at Fort Bragg. He is the recipient of the Purple  Heart and retired as an Army brigadier general in 2007.   Judge Maney was appointed Okaloosa County court judge by Governor Bob  Martinez and assumed the bench on June 5, 1989. He was elected to the  position in 1990 and was subsequently reelected each time he was on the  ballot. During his time as a circuit court judge, he served as a  juvenile dependency judge, child support judge, and served as the Baker  Act/Marchman Act judge for nearly a decade. Judge Maney shares his  passion and expertise of the law with colleagues across the district  and the State of Florida, delivering educational presentations for the  Conference of County Court Judges and the Advanced Judicial College. He  also started the Okaloosa Mental Health Court and the Okaloosa Veterans  Treatment Court. The act establishing the Okaloosa Veterans Treatment  Court was named the T. Patt Maney Veterans Treatment Court Act in his  honor.   Judge Maney was born in Lexington, KY, and is a graduate of the  University of Kentucky, the University of Louisville College of Law,  Troy State University, and the Army War College. He has been married to  his wife, Caroline, for almost 47 years, and they have two daughters  and six grandchildren. He is also a member of the Sons of the American  Revolution.   I thank Judge Maney for a lifetime of devotion to serving our Nation  both overseas and on the bench. I extend my best wishes to him and his  family on his well-earned retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Mr. James Weir  with respect for his service and accomplishments as he turns 93 years  old this month. Jim, as his friends refer to him, or Pap-pap, as he is  known by his family, grew up in Mount Pleasant, PA, not far from  Pittsburgh. Inducted into the U.S. Navy on August of 1943, Jim went to  war on behalf of this Nation, fighting in Europe and Asia. On June 6,  1944, Coxswain Weir crossed the English Channel aboard a LCT(A) to  deliver tanks and troops onto the beaches of Normandy. After the battle  was won in Europe, Jim fought in the liberation of the Philippines and  was stationed in Japan as part of the occupational forces after the  war.   In between those pivotal moments, Jim received a 20-day leave after  D-Day. He rushed back to the States to marry his sweetheart, Laverne  Myers. They had been sweethearts since he had sat behind her in sixth  grade, but Laverne was only 17 and Jim's leave was short. He loved  Laverne, and she loved him. They quickly left Pennsylvania for Alabama,  where they tied the knot before he had to return to the war. They  remained in love for 73 years of marriage.   After the war, he worked as a master electrician and was a renowned  Corvette racer, leading the national Corvette club as its president.  Jim now lives in Miami, FL, where he has two granddaughters and six  great-grandchildren who love him dearly.   In honor of his 93rd birthday, for his service to our great Nation  and his love for his family and community, I would like to recognize my  friend Jim Weir and look forward to seeing him on his 94th birthday  this time next year.                            ____________________
