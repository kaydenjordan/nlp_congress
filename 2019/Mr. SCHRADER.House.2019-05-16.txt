 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in favor of the package of  bills before us that includes efforts to stabilize the marketplace and  address drug prices, a win-win for America. I am particularly proud to  rise in support of one bill in the package, my bill, cosponsored with  my good friend from Georgia, Buddy Carter, H.R. 938, the BLOCKING Act.   As we are all too well aware, the rising cost of drug prices is  deeply impacting every American. At the same time, addressing this  issue does not have one big silver bullet solution. The BLOCKING Act is  one of many that will address this larger problem. It takes action to  ensure that generic drugs reach the market as quickly as possible.   Generic drugs save patients tens of billions of dollars every year.  The more competition we have in the generic space, the more savings we  see. It is with that knowledge that we provide generic manufacturers  that incentive of 180 days of exclusivity.   Unfortunately, in the current system, some generic manufacturers  delay bringing their drugs to market by parking their applications,  once being awarded the exclusivity, and not actually bringing their  drug to market. Doing so does not allow others to come to the market  and extends their hold, to the disadvantage of the American consumer.   That being said, a solution is quite simple. We need to prevent  loopholes that decrease competition and inadvertently keep drug prices  high.   I remain committed to working to lower drug prices and urge others to  support passage of this package of bills that will assist in addressing  this critical issue for America.
