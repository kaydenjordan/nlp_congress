 Madam Speaker, I oppose this dangerous resolution.  Iran has been at war with us for 40 years. They held Americans hostage  in Tehran. They murdered our marines in Beirut. They killed hundreds,  if not thousands, of American servicemembers in Iraq.   In recent months, Iran shot down a U.S. drone, they killed an  American citizen, and they organized an attack on our embassy.   So let's be clear: General Soleimani was the mastermind behind these  attacks. Soleimani was in Iraq claiming imminent attacks on our  servicemembers, our diplomats, and our Iraqi allies.   Soleimani was an enemy combatant and a lawful target. As a Navy JAG,  I prosecuted terrorists in Iraq. I was actually stationed right across  from our embassy in Baghdad, and I witnessed these threats on our Armed  Forces. So I applaud President Trump, I applaud our warfighters, and I  applaud our intelligence community for reaching an incredible outcome  against Iran.   Soleimani's death was a win for America, for freedom, and for peace.  In supporting this resolution, Democrats are choosing to stand with  their far-left radical base rather than standing up against Iran.
