 Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, on March 5, 2020, I was  not able to cast my votes during the vote series due to a family  emergency. Had I been in attendance, I would have voted:   1. YES on Amendment No. 7, Cisneros (D-CA)--Requires the Secretary of  Homeland Security to prioritize the hiring of veterans and related  preference eligible individuals, including disabled veterans and widows  or widowers of veterans, for positions within the Transportation  Security Administration;   2. YES on Amendment No. 9, Mucarsel-Powell (D-FL) [on behalf of  Schrier (D-WA)]--Would ensure the Administrator of TSA in coordination  with the Director of CDC and NIAID shall ensure that TSA employees are  provided the proper guidance regarding prevention and protections  against coronavirus, including guidance and resources;   3. NO on Republican Motion to Recommit; and   4. YES on Final Passage of H.R. 1140--Rights for Transportation  Security Officers Act of 2020.                             personal explanation
