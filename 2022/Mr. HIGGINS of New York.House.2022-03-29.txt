 Mr. Speaker, I rise on National Vietnam War  Veterans Day to honor U.S. Army Specialist Roger Dearmyer, a western  New York native and Purple Heart recipient who passed in December 2021.   Roger deployed to Vietnam in 1966 with the Fourth Infantry Division  of the United States Army. Spending much of his deployment in the  jungles of Vietnam, he was injured in action in April 1967.   Roger returned home and served as an Erie County sheriff's deputy for  31 years.   He remained active in the veteran community as a member of the Fourth  Infantry Division Association and the Military Order of the Purple  Heart Chapter 187.   In 2019, we presented Roger with the medals he earned while serving,  including a Purple Heart, a Vietnam Service Medal with a triple Bronze  Star attachment, and a Combat Infantryman Badge.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Roger Dearmyer, a man who  lived a life of service to his family, his community, and his country.                            ____________________
