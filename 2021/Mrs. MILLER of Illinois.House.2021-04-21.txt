 Madam Speaker, I proudly signed a discharge  petition in order to vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act.   Along with my Republican colleagues, we are standing up for the  voiceless to end this ongoing tragedy once and for all. We must end  infanticide.   Seventy-seven percent of Americans support protections for babies  born alive after a failed abortion, but Speaker Pelosi refuses to bring  up the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act for a vote.   This legislation is long overdue. It is time to stand up to Speaker  Pelosi and the radical Democrats' lack of regard for human life and  pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   My heart aches in all instances when the dignity of human life is  violated. As a Christian, I believe that the image of God in each one  of us gives us intrinsic worth that cannot be assaulted.   This bill simply requires an abortionist to give lifesaving treatment  to a child who survives a botched abortion rather than let them die  slowly.                            ____________________
