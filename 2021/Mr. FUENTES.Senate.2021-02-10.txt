 In the first Million MAGA March, we promised       that if the GOP would not do everything in their power to       keep Trump in office that we would destroy the GOP.        (People chanting: Yeah. GOP.)         And as we gather here in Washington, DC, for a       second Million MAGA March, we're done making promises. It has       to happen now. We are going to destroy the GOP!        (People chanting: Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. Destroy       the GOP. Destroy the GOP. Destroy the GOP.)   Those words--that was Trump's message: Destroy anyone who won't  listen, who won't help them take the election for Trump.   And, as you will see, this was just the preview for Fuentes, who,  like the Proud Boys and the Trump caravan organizers, would later heed  the President's call and come to Washington and be there on January 6.   Later in the rally, a former Trump campaign spokeswoman, Katrina  Pierson, also spoke.   During her speech, she stated: ``This isn't over. This is just  beginning,'' referring to the fight to stop the steal.   Then she added:         We knew that both Republican and Democrats were against we       the people. We are the cavalry. No one's coming for us.    It is clear that Trump and some of his supporters saw this as war--a  fight against anyone who was unwilling to do whatever it took to keep  Donald Trump in power. ``We are the cavalry.''   President Trump continued to reinforce the support of these messages  throughout the day. At 1:48 p.m., after both speeches, he retweeted his  Deputy Chief of Staff's tweet, showing his crowd that he had flown over  on Marine One, and he tweeted:         Thank you, Patriots.    These people were, as you can see, gathered en masse and being told  by the President's allies that their election had been stolen, and they  were told they were the cavalry; that no one else could do it.   After hearing these speeches and seeing the President's support, this  is what Donald Trump's cavalry was capable of.   (Video footage of 12-12-2020.)   What you just saw was the violence that ensued after that rally.   The Proud Boys, after that rally, engaged in serious acts of violence  in downtown DC. Some Trump supporters and self-identified Proud Boys  vandalized churches after that rally.   If we look at these events, it is clear how we got here because what  did the President do after that? He turned right around, and a little  over a week later, he began coordinating the January 6 Save America  rally with the same people who had planned the second Million MAGA  March.   You will recall that the Women for America First had organized that  second Million MAGA March. They had originally planned rallies for  January 22 and January 23, after the inauguration, but Donald Trump had  other plans. On December 19, President Trump tweeted his save the date  for January 6. He told his supporters to come to DC for a ``big  protest'' that day, billing it as ``wild.'' Just days later, Women for  America First amended their permit to hold their rally on January 6,  pursuant to the President's save the date, instead of after the  inauguration. This was deliberate.   Reports confirm that the President himself, President Trump, became  directly involved with the planning of the event, including the  speaking lineup and even the music to be played, just as he chose the  music of his retweet of the caravan, driving the Biden-Harris bus off  the road, with a fight song.   He brought in the same people who spoke at the second Million MAGA  rally to help as well. Trump's campaign adviser, Katrina Pierson, who  you will recall said on December 12 that this is only the beginning-- ``we are the cavalry''--also became directly involved in planning the  event. They even sent out invitations together.   This is Amy Kremer, one of the Founders of Women for America First,  tweeting the invitation, tagging Donald Trump and other organizers,  inviting the same supporters who had just engaged in serious violence  at the second Million MAGA rally to show up to the largest rally to  stop the steal. President Trump seemed to have other plans for what was  going to happen at that rally too.   Women for America First had initially planned for the rally goers to  remain at the Ellipse until the counting of the State electoral slates  was completed, just like they had remained at the Freedom Plaza after  the second Million MAGA March. In fact, the permit stated, in no  uncertain terms, that the march from the Ellipse was not permitted. It  was not until after President Trump and his team became involved in the  planning that the march from the Ellipse to the Capitol came about in  direct contravention of the original permit. This was not a  coincidence. None of this was.   Donald Trump, over many months, cultivated violence, praised it, and  then, when he saw the violence his supporters were capable of, he  channeled it to his big, wild, historic event. He organized January 6  with the same people who had just organized the rally resulting in  substantial violence, and he made absolutely sure, this time, these  violent rally-goers wouldn't just remain in place. He made sure that  those violent people would literally march right here, to our steps,  from the Ellipse to the Capitol, to stop the steal--his cavalry. This  was deliberate.   Because the President of the United States incited this, because he  was orchestrating this, because he was inviting them, the insurgents  were not shy about their planning. They believed they were following  the orders of the Commander in Chief. They were, as with the tweet we  just saw, quite literally, his cavalry. So they posted exact blueprints  of the attack openly, loudly, proudly, and they did this all over  public forums. They were not just hidden posts on dark websites that  [[Page S630]]  Trump would not have seen. Quite the opposite. We know that President  Trump's team monitored these websites. We know this because his  advisers confirmed it.   An ``ex-White House and campaign insider,'' as you will read, ``who  has known both Scavino and the president for years, said there was no  way that Scavino and the Trump social media operation would not have  been aware of the plans circulating online to storm the Capitol''  because the Trump ``operation closely monitored the web's darkest  corners, ranging from mainstream sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and  Reddit, to fringe message boards like 4chan and 8cha (now called 8kun)  to TheDonald.win, an offshoot from a banned Reddit community dedicated  to rabidly supporting all things Trump.'' They actively monitored the  exact sites, like TheDonald.win, on which these insurrectionists wrote  their posts.    So what would Trump and his team have seen when they were monitoring  these sites? What would his supporters have said? They would have seen  a clear roadmap of exactly what happened.   This is an example of a post that was captured from one of the sites  dedicated to Donald Trump, that we just talked about, shortly before  the site was taken down.   The meme reads:         The Capitol is our goal. Everything else is a distraction.       Every corrupt Member of Congress locked in one room and       surrounded by real Americans is an opportunity that will       never present itself again.    Let that sink in. Think about that. The exact thing that happened on  January 6--that was their goal, and they said it out loud on sites that  the Trump administration was actively monitoring.   A third-party site captured a post on TheDonald.win, where one user  posted:         This cannot simply be a protest. It has to be the       establishment of the MAGA militia with command offices set       up, with all further militia tactical missions spreading from       there.    Another user said in response:         We will have to achieve an actual tactical victory like       storming and occupying [the Capitol] to have the intended       effect.    That is what they understood Donald Trump to want--there it is in  black and white--and they explained why they felt justified in this.   Another poster on the forum TheDonald.win wrote on January 4:         If Congress illegally certifies Biden . . . Trump would       have absolutely no choice but to demand us to storm Congress       and kill/beat them up for it.    Donald Trump will have no choice. That was what he made them believe  to the point his supporters felt justified even in carrying weapons and  storming our Capitol. This was in post after post.   Here is another. When discussing how to carry guns into DC, one  noted:         Yes, it's illegal, but this is war, and we're clearly in a       post-legal phase of our society.    What? They treated it as a war, and they meant it.   On the morning of the attack, under a thread titled ``Today, I told  my kids goodbye,'' one poster wrote:         Today I had the very difficult conversation with my       children, that daddy might not come home from DC.    Within a matter of hours, that post amassed 4,000 ``likes.''   President Trump had truly made them believe that their election had  been stolen and that it was their patriotic duty to fight to steal it  back--``patriotic,'' a term he gave those who use violence for him--and  they were willing to say goodbye to their children for this fight.   These supporters didn't just rely on entering the Capitol with guns  haphazardly. They had maps of this building. They talked through which  tunnels to use and how to get to the Senate Chamber. Some posted  specific floor plan layouts of the Capitol alongside hopes of  overwhelming law enforcement to ``find the tunnels; arrest the worst  traitors.''   Posters also fixated on what they saw as their ability to easily  overwhelm the Capitol Police as ``there are only around 2k of them,''  and, again, they urged ``the capitol is our goal. Everything else is a  distraction.''   There were hundreds of these posts--hundreds--monitored by the Trump  administration, and these posts were chillingly accurate right down to  communication devices.   A new affidavit, filed by the FBI, described preparations by the  rightwing group, the Proud Boys, to storm the Capitol, including using  earpieces and walkie-talkies to direct movements throughout the  building. This happened. That is the level of planning in advance that  occurred. They had earpieces. On the slide, you will see Proud Boy  member Dominic Pezzola has an earpiece in his right ear, consistent  with the affidavit. In addition to these detailed posts, they made  clear why they thought they could do this. It wasn't just that they  were doing it following the President's orders; they thought he would  help them.   A third-party site captured a post on TheDonald.win--again, the site  monitored by Trump's team.         He [meaning Donald Trump in this instance] can order the       NAT guard to stand down if needed. Unfortunately he has no       control over the Capitol Police . . . but there are only       around 2k of them and a lot are useless fat asses or girls.    It is all right there--the overall goal, maps of the Capitol, the  weapons, communications devices. They even said publicly, openly,  proudly that President Trump will help them to commandeer the National  Guard so all they have to do is overwhelm the 2,000 Capitol Police  officers.   This was reported in the NBC News and the Washington Post, with  headlines like: ``Violent threats ripple through far-right internet  forums ahead of protest.'' ``Pro-Trump forums erupt with violent  threats ahead of Wednesday's rally against the 2020 election.''   FOX News also reported that the Proud Boys would come to the January  6 rally prepared for violent action, even quoting a Proud Boy member  who said they would be ``incognito'' and ``spread across downtown DC in  smaller numbers.''   City officials, seeing these same warnings, also publicly warned  about the violence and unlawful weapons at the event. DC Mayor Muriel  Bowser cautioned residents of the District of Columbia to avoid the  downtown area while the rally attendees were in town.   Federal law enforcement warned of these threats also. On January 3, a  Capitol Police intelligence report warned of a violent scenario in  which ``Congress itself'' could be the target of the angry supporters  of President Trump on January 6. According to that report, obtained by  the Washington Post:         Supporters of the current president see January 6, 2021, as       the last opportunity to overturn the results of presidential       election. . . . This sense of desperation and disappointment       may lead to more . . . incentive to become violent. Unlike       previous post-election protests, the targets of the pro-Trump       supporters are not necessarily the counter-protesters as they       were previously, but rather Congress itself is the target       [for January 6].    The day before the rioters stormed the Congress, an FBI office in  Virginia also issued an explicit warning that extremists were preparing  to travel to Washington to commit violence and ``war,'' according to  internal reports.   The FBI report cited to an online post where the user declared that  Trump supporters should go to Washington and get violent. The supporter  said:         Stop calling this a march, or rally, or a protest. Go there       ready for war. We get our President or we die.    These threat warnings were not just hypothetical. Actual arrests  occurred in the days leading to the attack.   On January 4, 2 days before the rally, one extremely well-publicized  arrest was of a Proud Boy leader who destroyed a church's Black Lives  Matter banner a month earlier during the December 12, second Million  MAGA March. The report emphasized that when he was arrested, he was  carrying high-capacity firearms magazines, which he claimed were meant  to be supplied to another rally attendee for January 6.   By the night before the January 6 attack, DC police had already made  six arrests in connection with the planned protests on charges of  carrying weapons, ammunitions, assault, assaulting police.   This is all in public view--all of it. The truth is usually seen and  rarely heard. Truth is truth, whether denied or not, and the truth is,  President Trump had spent months calling his supporters to a march on a  specific day, at a specific time, in specific places to stop the  certification.  [[Page S631]]    And leading up to the event, there were hundreds--hundreds--of posts  online showing that his supporters took this as a call to arms to  attack the Capitol. There were detailed posts of the plan to attack  online. Law enforcement warned that these posts were real threats and  even made arrests days leading up to the attack.   And yet, in the face of all this--these credible warnings of serious,  dangerous threats to our Capitol--when those thousands of people were  standing in front of President Trump, ready to take orders and attack,  this is what he said:         We're going to the Capitol.        And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight       like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.    And that is why this is different. That is why he must be convicted  and disqualified.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Representative Dean will now return to the events  of January 6 itself. She will demonstrate President Trump's repeated  incitement of the crowd that morning, as he directed them to the  Capitol in his last-ditch effort to retain his hold on power.   Ms. Manager DEAN. For me and for many Americans, January 6 is forever  etched in our memories.   I went to work with a sense of excitement--the start of my second  term in Congress and the first time I would participate in the  certification of a Presidential election.   And then we all know what happened. I know many of us have similar  experiences from that day, but I will briefly share mine. I stood with  colleagues in the Gallery above the House floor to observe the Arizona  challenge. Moments later, police radios reported a breach of the  Capitol grounds. Someone shouted up to us, ``Duck''; then, ``Lie  down''; then, ``Ready your gas masks.''   Shortly after, there was a terrifying banging on the Chamber doors. I  will never forget that sound. Shouts and panicked calls to my husband  and to my sons, instructions to flee, and then the constant worrying of  the gas masks filtering the air--the Chamber of the United States House  of Representatives turned to chaos.   For Donald Trump, it was a very different day. Earlier, I showed you  Donald Trump's desperate attempts to maintain power: ignoring adverse  court rulings, attacking elected officials, pressuring his Justice  Department, even attacking his own Vice President. You saw a man who  refused to lose, who was desperate to retain power by any means  necessary. You saw a man willing to attack anyone and everyone who got  in his way, and you saw a man who thought he could play by different  rules.   He told his supporters, as my colleague Ms. Plaskett just showed you,  exactly what he thought those different rules were--combat, fight,  violence.   This was not just one speech. This was weeks and weeks of deliberate  effort by Donald Trump to overturn the election results so that he  didn't have to give up the Presidency.   The speech on January 6 builds on, refers to, and amplifies that same  pattern--the pattern Trump had used and broadcasted for months: He  refused to lose, his attacks on others, and his different rules.   The only thing different about hi speech on January 6 from all these  other times that we went through was that he was no longer telling his  base just that they had to fight to stop the steal. He was finally  telling them: Now is the time to do it. Here is the place, and here is  how.    For weeks, he had urged his supporters to show up at a specific time  and place, and when they got there, he told them exactly what he  wanted.   Let's start with his desperation. You saw how much planning went into  January 6, and when the day arrived, Donald Trump's desperation was in  full force.   Between the time he woke up on January 5 and the start of the Save  America March that next day, he had tweeted 34 times. When Donald Trump  wants to get his message across, he is not shy, as you all know. These  tweets were relentless. And these tweets all centered on his singular  focus--his drumbeat to motivate, anger, and incite his supporters--his  big lie: The Presidential election had been rigged. It had been stolen  from him, and they had to fight to stop it.   And the timing was no coincidence. He sent 34 tweets because this was  his last chance to rile up his supporters before the big, historic,  wild event he had planned.   Now, I won't go through all of these tweets, but let me just  highlight a few. At 1 in the morning, he tweeted:         If Vice President [Mike Pence] comes through for us, we       will win the Presidency. . . . Mike can send it back.    This will look familiar to you because Mr. Lieu just showed you how  Trump had privately been pressuring and publicly attacking his Vice  President to stop the certification.   And when Vice President Pence refused, when he explained that the  Constitution simply does not allow him to stop certification, Donald  Trump provoked his base to attack him. The late-in-the-evening tweet  was no different. It just got more forceful.   Let's be clear. What Donald Trump was saying--that Vice President  Pence could send back the certification--was not true.   For one thing, all 50 States had ratified this election. And for  another, Vice President Pence explained to him that he does not have  the power to unilaterally overturn States' votes and just send  certification back.   And Donald Trump knew this, but this was his last chance to get his  Vice President to stop the certification, and so he was willing to say  or do just about anything.   These tweets--attacking the election as fraudulent, attacking his  Vice President, and urging his supporters to fight--continued  throughout the morning.   Here is another example. At 8:17 a.m. he tweeted:         All Mike Pence has to do is send it back to the States, AND       WE WIN.    ``And we win.'' That is what he said, even though by then he had  clearly lost.   As Trump continued tweeting, the Save America March at the White  House was now in full swing. The speakers who warmed up the crowd for  Trump were members of his inner circle--family members, his personal  attorney, people President Trump had deputized to speak on his behalf.   Some of the speakers also spoke at the second Million MAGA March,  which resulted in serious violence.   The warmup acts on January 6 focused on promoting Donald Trump's big  lie. They stoked the same fears--a stolen election, of fraud, of  ripping victory away from them. And the speakers told them what to do  about it. As the crowd erupted in ``fight for Trump'' chants throughout  that morning, Donald Trump Jr. urged:         That's the message! These guys better fight for Trump!    The speakers lasted 3 hours, repeating President Trump's message.  And, finally, at about noon, Donald Trump took the stage with the seal  of the Presidency on his podium and the White House as his backdrop.   President Trump spoke for more than 70 minutes. His narrative was  familiar. It was the same message he had spent months spreading to his  supporters: the big lie, the election was stolen; that they should  never concede; and that his supporters should be patriots and fight  much harder to stop the steal, to ``take back our country''--the same  phrases he had spread for weeks.   But now the message was immediate. Now it was just no longer just  fight; it was ``fight right now.''   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. All of us here today do not want to see       our election victory stolen by emboldened radical-left       Democrats, which is what they're doing. And stolen by the       fake news media. That is what they've done and what they're       doing. We will never give up. We will never concede. It       doesn't happen. You don't concede where there's theft       involved.        Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore,       and that's what this is all about. And to use a favorite term       that all of you people really came up with: We will stop the       steal.    That set the tone. ``Our country has had enough.'' And ``[w]e will  not take it anymore.''   He told them and us, right at the beginning, that the only way to  take back the country was to fight. Let's look at what he said next.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. And, Rudy, you did a great job. He's got       guts. You know what?  [[Page S632]]       He's got guts, unlike a lot of people in the Republican       Party. He's got guts. He fights   Ms. Plaskett showed you example after example of Donald Trump, when  confronted with violence, praising it. We saw him instruct the Proud  Boys, a violent extremist group, to stand back and stand by. That group  was there on January 6. We saw him praise a caravan of his supporters  after they tried to drive a bus belonging to the Biden campaign off the  road. The organizer of that attack was there on January 6. And we saw  him team up with the organizers of the violent second MAGA Million  March to plan his rally on January 6.   What does he do at that rally? He tells Giuliani he is doing a great  job addressing the crowd, saying he has ``guts'' to call for fighting.  And to be clear, this is what he was praising.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)
