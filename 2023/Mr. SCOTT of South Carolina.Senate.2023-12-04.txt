 Madame President, as the junior  Senator from the great State of South Carolina, it is my pleasure to  honor the legacy and great work of the late Michael Del Priore from  Folk Shoals, SC. Michael graduated from Columbia High School and began  his career as an artist, which spanned more than 40 years. He first  worked for J.B. White's Department Store as an advertising artist. In  addition to this job, he produced art for ``The State'' newspaper and  other local businesses.   Michael's natural talent led him to meeting Gian Cassone who  introduced him to the techniques of painting portraits with oil and  pastels. Michael was commissioned to paint his first portrait of an  elected official for Congressman William Jennings Bryan Dorn to be  displayed in the Dorn VA Hospital in Columbia.   Relocating to Charleston, SC, Michael became a student under Ray  Goodbred at the Gibbes Museum of Art. Michael Del Priore continued to  perfect his craft and was awarded the distinct opportunity to paint an  official oil portrait for former Governor and then-U.S. Senator Strom  Thurmond to honor his 50 years of public service.   Michael Del Priore served as the past chairman and a member of the  board of directors for what is now known as the Portrait Society of  America. Michael's talents inspired both at home and on a national  level. In 2018, just 2 years before his passing, Governor Henry  McMaster awarded him the ``Order of the Palmetto'' to recognize the  great strides he made as an artist over his lifetime. Michael's  portfolio includes portraits for President Reagan, former House Speaker  John Boehner, various other Members of Congress, elected officials in  South Carolina, and many others.                            ____________________
