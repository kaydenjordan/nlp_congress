 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  retirement of William P. Getty as president of the Claude Worthington  Benedum Foundation. Since 1999, Pat has served as president of the  foundation, and during his tenure, the region has been blessed with  significant opportunities to grow and diversify the economy.   Established in 1944, the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation issues  grants primarily in West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania. The  region served by the foundation is a tribute to the founder Michael  Benedum's native home of West Virginia and his strong connection to  Pittsburgh, PA, where he built a successful oil and gas exploration  business. The foundation administers grants that support education,  economic development, health and human services, and community  development.   Pat's leadership as president has focused on regional collaboration  to capture economic opportunity. First and foremost, the discovery of  the Marcellus, Utica, and Rogersville shale deposits have created  tremendous opportunity for West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio to not  only explore these natural resources but to also capture more  downstream value in affiliated sectors of the economy. Pat's leadership  in fostering a regional approach and cooperation between leaders in the  three States has been instrumental to creating initiatives like the  ``Power of 32'' site development fund and the tristate shale agreement  that will help the region maximize the benefit of this opportunity. In  addition, he has been an invaluable partner and ambassador for the  Appalachian Storage and Trading Hub project, participating in meetings  with private sector leaders and government leaders to stress the  importance of this project to the region. By working together, we can  truly realize the potential for thousands of new jobs and billions in  private sector investment.   Pat's contributions as president extends well beyond the energy  sector. Under his leadership, the foundation has been a leader in  focusing on the importance of STEM education, advanced manufacturing,  and transitioning the region to a more technology based economy. Each  of these areas is a significant growth opportunity for the region,  while at the same time is a tribute to the region's history as a leader  in manufacturing and developing natural resources. Pat has also been  instrumental in working with community, State, and Federal leaders to  maximize Federal resources and partnerships to spur economic growth.   I wish Pat the best in his retirement and hope that he enjoys this  special time with his wife, children, and grandchildren. I know that he  will remain engaged as an ambassador for West Virginia and the  region.                            ____________________
