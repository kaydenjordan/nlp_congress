 Mr. Speaker, due to a prior commitment to speak at an  event in my district that was set prior to the late change in the  schedule by the Majority, I was unable to attend votes. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 157--H. Con. Res 19  and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 158--H.R. 1331.                            ____________________
