 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it appears that our friends across the  aisle are experiencing an existential crisis when it comes to deciding  how to manage their newfound powers in the majority. We are just 2\1/2\  months into this new Congress, and already we are hearing the majority  leader and many on the other side of the aisle threatening to blow up  the rules of the Senate. After decades as a Senator, President Biden  even yesterday relented and threw his support behind the plan.   The filibuster has been called into question a number of times over  the past few years. That is to be expected, but it is just that our  Democratic friends used to be on the other side of the argument. They  took one position when they were in the minority, where the filibuster  protected their rights. And now when they are in the majority, many of  them are looking to eliminate any minority rights and to fundamentally  change the Senate.   In 2018, our Democratic colleagues were afraid the Republican Senate  majority would blow up the filibuster. I am not really sure why they  were concerned. After all, Senator McConnell and Republican Senators  have consistently defended the rights of the minority by use of the  legislative filibuster, even when President Trump called for it to be  eliminated.   But our Democratic friends keep piling on. Senator Durbin, the  Senator from Illinois, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was  asked about President Trump's call to end the filibuster--that was when  President Trump called to end the filibuster--and he said: ``That would  be the end of the Senate as it was originally devised and created going  back to the Founding Fathers.'' That would be on the right-hand side of  this chart. Just to repeat, he said: ``That would be the end of the  Senate as it was originally devised and created going back to the  Founding Fathers.''   I agree with Senator Durbin. I agreed then, and I agree now.   The Senate filibuster was designed to ensure that the two political  parties would actually have to work together, which I think the  American people believe is a good thing. And it should be hard to do  the work of building consensus in a country as big and diverse as the  United States.   But the filibuster was designed to make sure that the majority just  couldn't jam things through and deny the rights of the minority to be  heard. But when you get 60 Senators to agree on something, it becomes  all but impossible for ultrapartisan proposals to become law. That is  the nature of the consensus-building process, and that is a good thing  for the country.   Imagine the instability and unpredictability that would occur if laws  changed as quickly as Presidents and Senate majorities do. Just 4 years  ago, Republicans controlled both Chambers of Congress and held the  White House. Twelve years ago, our Democratic colleagues controlled all  three. The filibuster was designed to encourage, again, consensus  building on a bipartisan basis and to provide some stability between  those transitory majorities and changing Presidents. And that is a good  thing, like I said, in a country where the political party in control  is constantly changing, and it ensures that a minority viewpoint cannot  be steamrolled.   Our Senate Democratic friends have certainly benefited from the  protections of the filibuster over the last 6 years. They filibustered  countless bills on everything from pandemic relief to police reform.   But now it appears that our Democratic colleagues--at least their  leadership--have flip-flopped. The political tides have shifted, and  since the radical left wants to get rid of the filibuster, so do they.   In a floor speech earlier this week, this same Senator, Senator  Durbin, our friend from Illinois, said the filibuster is ``not the  guarantor of democracy. It has become the death grip of democracy''--a  pretty dramatic conversion from 2018 to 2021.   What has changed? Well, the majority has changed. Republicans  controlled the majority when he thought the filibuster was a good  thing. Now, when Democrats control the majority, he thinks it is a bad  thing.   Apparently, the countless filibusters of our Democratic colleagues  were not a mockery of democracy. They certainly wouldn't be guilty of  that. But  [[Page S1587]]  now that the shoe is on the other foot, Democrats are ready to hit the  big red button and go nuclear. And, I must say, once you go nuclear  around here, you certainly don't go back.   But Senator Durbin's views aren't the only ones that have changed on  this matter. As I mentioned, former Senator and now President Joe Biden  finally changed his views as well. For decades, he was a staunch  defender of the institution. When he was asked about removing the  filibuster, going nuclear, he said:         This nuclear option is ultimately an example of the       arrogance of power. It is a fundamental power-grab by the       majority party.    Well, that is certainly not mincing your words. And this isn't some  long ago abandoned view of his. In January of this year, President  Biden was asked if he could move his agenda with the filibuster rules  intact, and he answered yes and explained the opportunities to work  together on shared priorities, as he did throughout his career as a  U.S. Senator.   He went on to add:         I think we can reach consensus on that and get it passed       without changing the filibuster rule.    But now the pressure has been put on both President Biden and the  Democratic leadership in the Senate to endorse a rules change, not by  the ordinary course of rule changes but by the nuclear option. We know  that there are unpredictable consequences of changing the rules in a  place where your power, where your majority, is never guaranteed.  Chipping away at the rights of the minority may help you today, but you  will live to regret it when the shoe is on the other foot.   But it won't take a shift in the majority for our Democratic  colleagues to see the disastrous consequences of going nuclear on the  filibuster rule because, if anybody needed a reminder, we have a 50-50  Senate: 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans.   Yesterday, Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, somebody who has  been around this institution a long time and understands it better than  almost anybody I know, reminded our colleagues that ``[t]his is an  institution that requires unanimous consent to turn the lights on  before noon.''   Unanimous consent is literally the grease that helps the machine run.  In order to accomplish even the most mundane tasks in the Senate, you  need an agreement. Most of the time it is easy because it is not  controversial; it is not partisan; it is the right, practical thing to  do. But you need compromise, and you need a quorum.   This rules change being floated wouldn't clear a path for  productivity in the Senate. It is an invitation to futility. If our  Democratic colleagues take the unprecedented step of blowing up the  filibuster, they can expect to be met with an unprecedented response.   Republicans will not sit idly by while Democrats take an axe to the  rules in order to advance a partisan agenda. If Democrats go down this  road, they will have no one to blame but themselves for the  consequences of a horrible miscalculation.
