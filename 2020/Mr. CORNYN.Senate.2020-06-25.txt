 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate was prepared yesterday to  answer the call of millions of Americans to take action on police  reform. The senseless and tragic death of Houston native George Floyd  galvanized people of all races and ethnicities to speak out against the  injustices that persist in our criminal justice system and to demand  action. We tried to take that responsibility seriously.   Senator Tim Scott, our colleague from South Carolina, led the effort  to draft a bill that would improve policing practices around the  country. That bill, the JUSTICE Act, addressed choke holds and no-knock  warrants--two practices which have, for good reason, been brought into  question by recent events. This legislation would have ensured that the  best trained officers on our police forces would be using body  cameras--reporting critical data--and being held accountable for  crossing redlines.   We thought our colleagues across the aisle would have taken this  matter seriously as well. They drafted their own version of a reform  bill. While there were differences between the two proposals, there was  a lot of overlap. In fact, there was more these two bills had in common  than was different. Both bills, for example, focused on training,  transparency, and accountability.  [[Page S3300]]    I had hoped that would have meant that we would have been in a good  place when it came to trying to reconcile the remaining differences.  After all, the Democratic leader had been urging the majority leader to  put a police reform bill on the floor by July 4, and that is exactly  what we did. Leader McConnell made clear that this would be an open  debate and that there would be amendments and an opportunity for our  Democratic colleagues to work with us in order to make the bill better.  Ultimately, if they had decided to get on the bill, as the Presiding  Officer knows, there would have been 60-vote thresholds on the back end  that would have given them leverage to have made sure that the debate  would have been fulsome and fair. But that simply wasn't enough for our  friends across the aisle.    When it came time to take a purely procedural vote to begin debate,  they blocked it. They refused to engage in any meaningful or productive  way.   So after promising the American people that they were going to act to  reform America's police departments, they were given the opportunity,  but they broke their promise.   As Senator Scott said yesterday, it wasn't what was being offered but  who offered it. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle find  themselves too politically conflicted to work on a bipartisan basis to  enact meaningful reforms, so they have chosen to take the low road of  obstruction. They have shown they can't be bothered to pass a bill that  would help families like the Floyds who have lost their loved ones in a  senseless and completely preventable way. They proved yesterday that  this was a purely political calculation--very sad.   Both Democrats and Republicans have said repeatedly over the last few  weeks that the status quo was not sustainable and that it is time to  change. As I said, both parties drafted bills, but it is pretty clear  there was only one party interested in making a law.   Unless you can get enough votes to pass a Republican-led Senate, a  Democratic-led House, and get the signature of a President, those  reforms won't change the behavior of a single officer. If those  solutions only live on the page of a bill or within the borders of a  press release, they are not going to accomplish anything.   So I understand that our Democratic colleagues weren't happy starting  with the JUSTICE Act, but the temper tantrum we witnessed yesterday  isn't moving us one step closer to achieving the results they claim  they want, which is change.   The majority leader has indicated that this body will have another  opportunity to vote on whether to begin debating this legislation.  Again, this wasn't about the final bill; this was about beginning the  process of determining what that bill would look like. So I hope our  colleagues across the aisle will reconsider. I hope they will listen to  the millions of Americans who want to see us working together. They  want to see action, not cynical political gestures.                                   S. 4049    Mr. President, turning to another matter, I am glad the Senate has  now moved to consider another critical piece of legislation--the  National Defense Authorization Act.   The NDAA, as it is called, represents one of the most basic duties of  the Federal Government, and that is to provide for the common defense.  The National Defense Authorization Act is how we ensure that critical  Department of Defense programs are continued, that American  servicemembers are paid, and that our national defense is modernized to  keep pace with the rapidly evolving threat landscape.   All of us have understood the importance of passing the NDAA each  year, which is why, for the last 59 years, we have done it without  delay.   I hope Members of this body are committed to continuing that  tradition because as our Nation battles on so many different fronts, we  cannot afford to let military readiness lapse.   One of my top priorities is to make sure our men and women in uniform  have the support they need and the training they need on and off the  battlefield.   The defense authorization bill builds on the progress we have made to  implement the national defense strategy and ensure that our military is  prepared to counter the threats we face today and those that will  inevitably come tomorrow. It goes a long way to maintain our  technological advantage, to modernize our weapons, to build resilience,  and to strengthen our alliances.   America's 2.1 million servicemembers have made a commitment that few  are willing to make and joined the ranks of America's heroes who have  defended our country throughout our history. Roughly 225,000 of them  call Texas home, in places like Fort Hood, Fort Bliss, Lackland Air  Force Base, Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, and Ellington Field, just  to name a few. Those Texans--those Americans--carry out missions that  are crucial to our national security, protecting us from increasingly  complex threats.   We have a responsibility to provide our troops with the training,  equipment, and resources they need so they can complete their critical  missions and hopefully return home safely. After all, these men and  women are much more than dedicated and talented servicemembers; they  are our sons and daughters, our parents, our spouses, and our family  members.   While we are providing them the resources they need to succeed, we  need to support those military families. This legislation includes a 3- percent pay raise for our troops, additional support for the family  members, such as military spouse employment opportunities, and  childcare.   Earlier this month, the Senate Armed Services Committee completed its  markup and voted overwhelmingly to send this bill to the Senate floor.   As we begin consideration of the defense authorization bill, I want  to thank all of the men and women who serve in our U.S. military and  ensure them that we will do everything we can to support them and  ensure they are empowered and mission-ready.   I yield the floor.
