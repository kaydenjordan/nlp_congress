 Mr. President, this past Saturday, June 20, we marked the  20th commemoration of World Refugee Day. Since 2000, World Refugee Day  annually shines a light on the struggles of displaced people all over  the globe and encourages us all to redouble our efforts to help them.   We are currently experiencing the most severe refugee crisis in  recorded history. There are almost 80 million forcibly displaced people  worldwide, of which more than 30 million are refugees and asylum- seekers. Every 2 seconds, someone is forced to leave his or her home  because of conflict or persecution. That means that, since I began  speaking, roughly 20 individuals have become newly displaced.   These numbers are staggering and difficult to comprehend, but try to  imagine for a moment what it means to be a refugee: to watch your home  torn apart by conflict; to become the target of violence and  oppression; to fear so greatly for your life and the lives of your  loved ones that you choose to leave everything you know behind and take  a dangerous journey to a place where the language and the culture are  unfamiliar, where you have no support system, where you may struggle  every day to make ends meet.   This nightmare is the reality for almost 80 million human beings  around the world. The situation has only worsened since the outbreak of  the global COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of refugees are in low and  middle-income countries, where weak health systems are already  struggling to provide the basics of care. According to the  International Rescue Committee, just 34 conflict-affected and fragile  countries could see between 500 million and 1 billion COVID-19  infections, leading to between 1.7 million and 3.2 million deaths over  the course of the pandemic. Furthermore, refugees and displaced persons  tend to live in precarious conditions that make them even more  vulnerable to the coronavirus. They often live in crowded housing  situations with little access to basic hygiene services, the perfect  breeding ground for infectious diseases to spread. For instance, there  are about 850,000 Rohingya refugees living in congested camps in Cox's  Bazar in Bangladesh. As the coronavirus began to take hold there in  March, experts warned that the lack of sanitation and capacity for  social distancing in these refugee camps would create the ``perfect  storm'' for transmission of the disease.   Additionally, many refugees are employed in informal industries with  little to no options for sick leave, restricted access to public health  services, and have few, if any, resources to weather the financial  burden of quarantine measures. Many are forced to defy stay-at-home  orders to find ways to support their families, risking their health and  that of their loved ones to provide basic shelter and food.   Take, for example, the story of Orlando, a member of an indigenous  community in Venezuela who is among the 4.5 million Venezuelan migrants  and refugees who have fled the country's hunger, violence, and  insecurity since 2014. He now lives in Brazil with 18 other families  from his indigenous group. He and his family make their living as  artisans, but when lockdown orders prevented them from selling their  crafts, they could no longer afford rent. All 120 of the individuals  living in his house were expelled, sent to the street in the middle of  a pandemic. Meanwhile, many of Orlando's family members became sick  with the virus, and one sadly passed away, devastating the community.  Unfortunately, stories like this one are common among refugees.   The good news is that there are a number of incredible multilateral  and nongovernmental organizations working tirelessly to ensure that  displaced people are safe, healthy, supported, and treated with the  dignity they deserve. These organizations deserve our gratitude and,  more importantly, our assistance. In my home State of Maryland,  organizations such as the IRC, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee  Service, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society--now HIAS--and World Relief  are there to help refugees start a new life in the United States.  Especially now, as the COVID-19 pandemic stretches resources and  capacity of service providers around the world, it is critical that the  United States do its part to help address the refugee crisis.   That is why I joined all the other democratic members of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee in introducing legislation to provide an  additional $9 billion in funding for international efforts to fight the  COVID-19 pandemic and strengthen our refugee resettlement process to  accommodate those affected by the global health crisis. I also urged  Secretary of State Pompeo to contribute at least $500 million to the  U.N. campaign to protect displaced and disadvantaged persons around the  world from the coronavirus.   Historically, the United States has prided itself on offering safe  harbor to the world's refugees. This country, after all, was founded by  a group of people fleeing religious persecution. The plaque on the  Statute of Liberty, perhaps the most famous symbol of American freedom  and democracy,  [[Page S3125]]  reads, ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to  breathe free.'' But we have not always lived up to the values on that  inscription. When World War II displaced millions of Jews, many of them  sought asylum in the United States. Thousands were turned away and sent  back to their deaths in their home countries. The most infamous  incident was a ship called the St. Louis that carried almost 1,000  Jewish refugees to a port in Miami. After being denied entry and forced  to return to Europe, more than a quarter of those passengers perished  in the Holocaust.   It is important to acknowledge and learn from dark chapters in our  history like this one, so that we can do a better job of respecting and  protecting human life moving forwards. This is why I have been so  troubled by President Trump's anti-refugee policies. Whether by making  the lowest Presidential determination on refugee admissions in the  program's history or by locking up asylum-seekers at our southern  border, the Trump administration has turned our Nation's back on those  fleeing violence and oppression and stained the U.S. reputation as a  champion of human rights.   We cannot allow these policies to continue. First and foremost, they  are wrong. This sort of behavior violates the most basic tenets of our  democracy: equality, freedom, and justice. But beyond that, it actively  hurts our country to ignore the plight of refugees. When we shirk our  responsibility as a global leader in humanitarian assistance, we  exacerbate worldwide instability that will affect us, too. Moreover, by  closing our doors to refugees, we miss out on the valuable  contributions that they make to our society. Think of the contributions  to science, art, and politics that refugees like Albert Einstein,  Gloria Estefan, and Madeline Albright have made to the United States  and to humanity. As I speak, think of all the displaced people around  the world who are working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic to  help keep their adopted communities, including ours, safe.   To improve our country's treatment of refugees, I worked with  Senators Leahy, Booker, and Harris and Representative Zoe Lofgren to  introduce the Refugee Protection Act of 2019. This bill is a  comprehensive blueprint for reinvigorating U.S. refugee and asylum  systems. It bolsters the U.S. Refugee Admission Program and expands  protections for refugees, and restores due process and dignity for  asylum seekers. Broadly, it seeks to repair the U.S. role as a refuge  for the persecuted. I urge all of my colleagues to support this  crucial, lifesaving measure.   The most important thing to remember is that refugees are our fellow  human beings who have found themselves in the most difficult of  circumstances. They are brothers, daughters, fathers, grandmothers, and  friends. They have ideas, hopes, and aspirations and deserve the same  respect, security, dignity, and opportunity we wish for ourselves and  our families and friends. This World Refugee Day, let us recommit to  providing safe harbor to the vulnerable, no matter where they are from.  I always like to say that our values are our strength, so let us live  by our values and help build a brighter future for all the world's  peoples.                            ____________________
