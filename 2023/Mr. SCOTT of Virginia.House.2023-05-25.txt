 Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my  opposition to the House Republicans adjourning for the holiday while  leaving the American people in limbo.   I get tired of being lectured by Republicans about debts and  deficits. Twenty-five percent of the entire national debt was  accumulated under the 4 years of the Trump administration.   Every Democratic administration since Kennedy has left for their  Republican successors a better deficit situation than they inherited,  and every Republican administration since Nixon has left for their  Democratic successors a worse deficit situation than they inherited-- all without exception.   Speaker McCarthy has presented a false choice: either we default on  our debts for the first time in history, or we agree to devastating  cuts in education, law enforcement, veterans benefits, food assistance,  border security, and healthcare and going into a recession.   House Republicans created this crisis. It is time they ended it by at  least five of them signing the discharge petition and agreeing to  responsibly pay our Nation's debts.                            ____________________
