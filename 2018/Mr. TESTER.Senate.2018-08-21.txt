 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the fine  broadcasters at KRTV in Great Falls, MT, who are celebrating their 60th  year on the air.   On June 27, 1958, KRTV went live with its first broadcast, only to be  promptly knocked off the air by a severe windstorm that damaged its  television tower, but as they would prove, time and again, nothing  could keep KRTV from bringing the news of the day to northcentral  Montana. Three months later, they were back on the air, and they have  been leading the way ever since.   In 1960, KRTV pioneered the first live broadcast from the Montana  State Fair. At the time, it was a historic technological development in  northcentral Montana. In 1961, they began broadcasting in color,  bringing life to storytelling and breaking news. Every day since, KRTV  has set the standard for excellence in broadcast journalism in Montana,  winning EB Craney newscast of the year numerous times.   They have covered events large and small, from Presidential visits  and historic flooding to six-man football and fall harvest. Legendary  broadcasters like Norma Ashby laid the groundwork for the familiar  faces of Tim McGonigal and Shannon Newth and so many others. They have  brought the news to Great Falls and its surrounding market area with  passion, grace, and persistence.   For 60 years, KRTV has been a shining example of how much local news  matters to a community. I know the next 60 years will be as good as the  first.                            ____________________
