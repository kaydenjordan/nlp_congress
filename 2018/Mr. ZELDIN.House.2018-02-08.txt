 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent,  Ms. Tijuana Fulford, founder and executive director of the Butterfly  Effect Project in Riverhead.   In 2014, Ms. Fulford set out to establish a free program to provide  young girls with the tools they need to achieve self-confident futures  in hopes of bringing forth a generation of strong, independent, and  knowledgeable women.   This program has grown from 4 to 108 young girls with an ever-growing  waitlist. These are girls who are empowered with the resources  necessary to secure a prosperous future for themselves and their  families.   Through financial, educational, emotional, and career support, the  Butterfly Effect Project is building community involvement and  curtailing the effects of cultural and mobility limitations.   With locations in Riverhead and Bellport, the Butterfly Effect  Project is having such a positive effect on young girls from Riverhead,  Flanders, Calverton, Mastic, Shirley, Bellport, Westhampton, Peconic,  Patchogue, and West Islip.   The Butterfly Effect Project has provided an invaluable service to  our community. I applaud Ms. Fulford for her dedication, and I look  forward to witnessing the growth of her organization and the bright  future of so many of the young women it supports.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4771, the  Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act, and I commend my friend from  Utah, Mia Love, for her amazing leadership on this important issue and  her tireless effort to bring relief to the community banks that lend to  small businesses and families in my district and in towns all across  America.   By reforming the onerous one-size-fits-all regulations mandated by  the Dodd-Frank law that roped small community financial institutions in  with large global too-big-to-fail megafirms, this commonsense bill will  give community banks and the customers they serve more clarity and  allow them to focus on their important mission of lending to homeowners  and businesses.   This legislation also makes it easier for small- and medium-sized  institutions subject to Dodd-Frank mandates to form new holding  companies, fund existing holding companies, and make acquisitions by  issuing debt at the holding company level.   Now that they are subject to the Basel III capital requirements, many  community banks have found it difficult to access and raise capital.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    The consequence of this choke hold on community lending  means less mortgages, less small business loans, and less economic  growth. H.R. 4771 fixes this and facilitates the ability of community  banks and savings institutions to raise needed capital.   I urge adoption of this bill.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time and I am prepared to close, so I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats support targeted, measured relief for our  community financial institutions. We recognize that these smaller banks  and credit unions intimately know their communities and how best to  serve them. But we also know that changes to the rules that are  designed to ensure that community banks are safe and sound can have  unintended consequences.   While community banks did not cause the 2008 financial crisis, they  were at the center of another crisis just two decades before. When I  came to the Financial Services Committee, thousands of savings and loan  holding companies were failing and causing serious harm to the  communities they were supposed to serve. This was due, in part, to the  fact that lawmakers thought it was wise to weaken safeguards on these  savings and loan holding companies, allowing them to take on more  leverage and offer riskier products. I fear that Congress will again  pass legislation today that will ultimately cause harm to both the very  community banks we want to help and the hardworking Americans that rely  on them.   And now, Republicans are trying to raise the threshold as high as  possible. In the chairman's ``Wrong Choice Act,'' he would raise the  threshold tenfold, to $10 billion. At the end of last Congress,  Republicans sought to raise it to $5 billion. A few months ago, the  Trump administration recommended raising it to $2 billion, and now, a  little less than 3 years after we reached a bipartisan compromise, we  are inexplicably considering legislation to raise it to $3 billion.   I tried to tell you just a few moments ago, they don't know. They are  just throwing it up against the wall: whatever we can get. Next they  will be asking for $20 billion. No, you have moved away from $10  billion; you have moved away from $5 billion; now you are at $3  billion. Your President wants $2 billion. We say, leave it as it is.   Mr. Speaker, if you are listening to this and feeling dizzy, it is  understandable. None of these levels are backed by the same careful  consideration Congress gave to the threshold 2 years ago, and I am  afraid it is exactly the kind of legislating that set the groundwork  for the savings and loan crisis and left thousands of communities  without access to banking services.   When I came on, Members of Congress were fleeing the old Banking  Committee. They wanted to get out of there because they had been  responsible for public policy that had put the S&L business at risk,  and now that was all failing. They were fleeing it, and they were  punishing people, all the new Members coming on, and making them go on  this committee because they knew that they had nobody else to serve on  it.    So I have been there. I have seen it. I have experienced it. I am a  part of Dodd-Frank reforms. I served on the conference committee. I  worked with Dodd. I worked with Frank. I know what we should be doing.   Before I close, I would like to remind my colleagues that this bill  and many of the other one-off financial services bills Republicans are  pushing should really be viewed as setting the table for the dangerous  deregulatory package making it through the Senate. That package, which  our committee has not even considered to thoroughly understand the  interactions of all the rollbacks it contains, weakens oversight of  Wall Street and the Nation's largest banks under the guise of community  bank relief.   H.R. 4771 is one of the many provisions in the Senate bill that, when  taken together, will risk further bailouts and harm homeownership in  America. Every time this House passes another provision of that bigger  bill, we make it more likely that critical safeguards and protections  will be eviscerated at the expense of our Nation's homeowners and  consumers.   I urge all Members to soundly reject H.R. 4771 today and to reject  the larger Senate legislation if it comes to the House. I comfortably  say, despite the fact that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle  are trying to frame this in a certain way, they really don't know what  they are doing. Reject this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.
