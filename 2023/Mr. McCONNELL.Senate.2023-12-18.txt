 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the weekend, our colleagues  continued to make progress toward an agreement on border security. I am  especially grateful to Senator Lankford for stewarding Senate  Republicans' efforts to produce meaningful policy changes, fix our  broken asylum system, and secure the southern border.   Addressing the border crisis at home is a fundamental part of  legislation that will help America meet each of the most glaring  national security challenges we face around the world. And there are a  number of significant issues our colleagues are still working to  resolve.   The effects of years of failed border enforcement are compounded.  Border security policy is complex. And our colleagues at the  negotiating table are clear-eyed about the fact that getting this  agreement right and producing legislative text is going to require some  time.   Senate Republicans will not make up for others showing up late to the  table by waving our responsibility to carefully negotiate and review  any agreement before voting on it. I am encouraged by our colleagues'  commitment to keep making steady progress in negotiations over the  coming week and beyond.   America is facing a never-before-seen border crisis. An imperialist  thug is trying to redraw the map of Europe. A repressive authoritarian  state is preparing to put more of the Indo-Pacific under its control.  And the world's largest state sponsor of terror is showing us it is as  determined as ever to kill American servicemembers and disrupt global  commerce. There is simply no room for falling short here. We cannot  afford to get this wrong.
