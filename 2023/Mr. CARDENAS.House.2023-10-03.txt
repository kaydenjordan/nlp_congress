 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a true champion of  the San Fernando Valley, a trailblazer, a leader, ``y una de las  nuestras,'' ``and one of ours,'' the Honorable Cindy Montanez from the  city of San Fernando.   Cindy and I have had the privilege of representing the northeast San  Fernando Valley for the past 27 years. Cindy is a strong, unwavering  community leader who, throughout her years of public service, has made  sure that the voices of the people of the valley are heard and that  they have a seat at the table.   Cindy has lived a quintessential American immigrant story, just like  the monarch butterfly. They are bicultural and bring beauty everywhere  they go.   She is the proud daughter of Miguel and Margarita Montanez,  immigrants from Veracruz and Chihuahua, Mexico. The Montanezes came to  the city of San Fernando, where Cindy and her five siblings were born  and raised. Together, her family pursued the American Dream, a dream  that includes giving back to the community and the country that has  given us so much.   Cindy's activism began in 1993, as she pushed to establish the  Chicano studies department at the University of California, Los Angeles  by participating in a 14-day hunger strike.   At the age of 25, she won a seat on the San Fernando City Council,  and 2 years later, she became the mayor of that city. Her exceptional  leadership extends to the California State Legislature, where Cindy was  the youngest woman elected to the California State Assembly at the age  of 28 at that time. At the age of 30, she became the first Latina to  chair the powerful assembly rules committee.   She fought for workers' protections, consumer rights, and healthcare  access. Out of these accomplishments, what Cindy is best known for is  her environmental work.   She continued her environmental activism to become the CEO of  TreePeople, one of the largest environmental organizations in all of  southern California. With over 3 million volunteers, they planted  hundreds of thousands of trees, from San Fernando to Huntington Park.   In 2020, she was called back to her role in public service. She  returned home to serve as a councilmember for the city of San Fernando.   Cindy is a titan who has worked tirelessly for her community. It is  an honor to stand before you today to tell Cindy Montanez' story. I am  not the only one highlighting her and her accomplishments. Last month,  the city of San Fernando and the city of Los Angeles voted to rename  Pacoima Wash Natural Park, which is shared by both cities, to Cindy  Montanez Natural Park.   On August 28, the California State Legislature declared January 19 as  Cindy Montanez Day.   These distinctions are well deserved, built on years of tireless  service.   I just saw Cindy when I had the privilege to join our community in a  celebration to rename Cindy Montanez Natural Park. Cindy was surrounded  by dozens and dozens of community members, full of love and prayer. It  was a beautiful tribute to a hero in our community. For all of this and  more, I honor my friend and my ``hermana,'' ``sister,'' Cindy Montanez.   Every time I see a monarch butterfly, I will think of the impact she  has had, from the tree-lined streets of San Fernando to the committee  rooms of Sacramento and all across our great State of California.   I had the pleasure of meeting Cindy Montanez when she was running for  city council 28 years ago. I remember her coming into my office and  saying some of her supporters had abandoned her, and I listened to what  she had to say. I stood up and said: ``I will support you. What I see  in you is someone who is running for the right reasons. You care about  the community.'' She said thank you. That is where she launched her  career in 1995.   Sometimes in life we meet people and never know where our journeys  are going to go, but I am so honored to have called Cindy Montanez my  colleague and friend. I am so honored to be able to witness one of the  first people who got elected to the State legislature out of our  community of the San Fernando Valley who could speak to every  constituent both in Spanish and in English. That had never happened  before in our community, even though our community of northeast San  Fernando Valley was over 75 percent Latino by population, parents like  Cindy's parents and my parents who came from Mexico to make a better  life for the next generation and the next.   Once again, it is my honor to speak before all of you in this  beautiful House about an amazing, beautiful person, Cindy Montanez.                            ____________________
