 Madam Speaker, while we mourn those lost in these all-too- frequent mass shootings, it is important to remember, while some cities  suffer these tragedies occasionally, others suffer them daily.   Every year, dozens of my neighbors are victims of shootings across my  city. We need to stop looking at guns as simply a Second Amendment  issue and address them as a national health and security crisis.   Our people are dying, and we have the power to stop it.   We have already taken similar actions in other industries when lives  are threatened or lost. Automobiles are a safety risk, so we pushed for  seatbelts and airbags. Smoking is a health risk, so we banned  advertisement and vending machines to protect our children.  [[Page H7979]]    That is why I am proud to support stricter background checks before a  gun purchase and a ban on high-capacity magazines, which should only be  available to trained American soldiers.   But we must do more.   Like me, many Members return to districts where gun violence is all  too common and where it is rare to find a family that has not lost a  member to this national menace.                            ____________________
