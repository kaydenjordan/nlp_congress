 Mr. Speaker, today I will introduce H.R.  [[Page H302]]  356, the Medgar Evers Home National Monument Act. The home is located  in Jackson, Mississippi.   The Evers family home, which was designated a National Historic  Landmark in 2017, is hallowed ground for those of us who lived through  the struggle for racial equality and desegregation. That single-story,  ranch-style home bore witness to one of the most consequential  monuments in the civil rights era, the assassination of Medgar Wiley  Evers.   I am honored to, in my capacity as Congressman of the Second  Congressional District of Mississippi, to offer this legislation to  honor the sacrifice of not just civil rights icon Medgar Evers, but his  widow, Myrlie, by designating their home as a national monument.   Due to bipartisan efforts last Congress, this legislation passed  through the Committee on Natural Resources and ultimately passed the  House by unanimous consent. I am asking that we make this happen again  and honor the legacy of an icon in American history, Medgar Wiley  Evers.   I urge everyone to support this legislation.                            ____________________
