 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman. It is the great  State of Tennessee.   Madam Speaker, for the last year, Joe Biden and the Democrats have  completely controlled our government in Washington. Their first order  of business when they took power was to ram through Congress almost $2  trillion in Federal spending under the so-called American Rescue Plan.   When this bill became law last March, Democrats said it was necessary  to fight the coronavirus. Ten months later, our country is still  dealing with the same problems Democrats claimed their bill would  solve.   COVID tests are sold out at drugstores, and testing centers have  [[Page H241]]  hourlong lines. Not even Kamala Harris can give a straight answer about  when Americans will receive at-home test kits. Is it this week? Is it  next week? Is it sometime in the future? I don't think she knows.   We have overwhelmed hospitals that are struggling to treat patients  due to staffing shortages. Corrupt teachers' unions are forcing  students out of the classroom and bullying parents. Businesses of all  sizes and across industries cannot find enough workers to keep up with  the demand.   Madam Speaker, the American Rescue Plan failed miserably to address  or prevent these issues. That is because it mostly focused on funding  liberal special interests instead of targeted pandemic relief.   This whole debacle confirmed two things: Congress cannot spend its  way out of a problem, and Democrats will always use a crisis to advance  their political agenda.   Joe Biden promised to shut down the coronavirus when he took office.  One year later, all he shut down were America's hospitals and  businesses.   Thank you, Vice Chairman Johnson, for your adequate and more-than- lackluster leadership skills.
