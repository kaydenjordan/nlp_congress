 Mr. Speaker, I attended the funeral of a close family  member and was unable to fly back to the Capitol in time for votes  today. Had I been present to vote, I would have voted ``yea'' on H.R.  1397, To authorize, direct, facilitate, and expedite the transfer of  administrative jurisdiction of certain Federal land, and for other  purposes, and ``yea'' on H.R. 1719, the John Muir National Historic  Site Expansion Act.                            ____________________
