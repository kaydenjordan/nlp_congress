 Madam Speaker, last week, as COVID-19  cases continued to spread, even reaching historic highs, and as the  number of Americans killed by this virus rose well above 100,000,  Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court to strike down the entire  Affordable Care Act. If Trump and Republicans got their way, millions  of Americans would immediately lose their health insurance in the  middle of a pandemic, with no alternative available.   Ending the ACA is life-threatening, especially as we battle COVID-19.  That is why I am proud to support the Affordable Care Enhancement Act.  This bill would build on the success of the ACA by expanding tax  credits to ensure more Americans have access to health insurance, not  fewer. And it expands eligibility for these credits so that Dreamers  can access affordable healthcare as well, something we know will  benefit entire communities.   The coronavirus does not discriminate, and neither should we.   Critically, this bill undoes the Trump administration's expansion of  junk insurance plans, which offer minimal coverage and leave patients  with massive bills when they do get sick; because, while access to  healthcare is essential, it must be affordable.   That is why it is so important that this bill also includes language  from H.R. 3, the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act. This will  lower prescription drug prices by allowing the government to negotiate  for those prices, bringing our prescription drug prices in line with  what they cost overseas.   This bill puts the health of the American people first when we need  it most. I am proud to support this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''
