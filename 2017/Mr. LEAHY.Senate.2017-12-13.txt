 Madam President, this week, the Federal Communications  Commission--FCC--is preparing to give a giant, early Christmas present  to a few, deep-pocketed telecom companies, as it prepares to repeal  critical net neutrality protections. Net neutrality is the simple  principle that the internet should be kept free and open by preventing  the corporations who control the connections to selectively throttle or  block certain content, especially that of competitors.   Repealing net neutrality rules will benefit just a few powerful  corporations--and it will do so at the expense of small businesses,  consumers, and hard-working Americans, whose persistent and passionate  voices on this issue have been completely ignored by the FCC's  Republican majority.   Despite calling for public hearings when the current net neutrality  protections were developed, Chairman Pai has failed to heed his own  advice now that he is in charge of the FCC.   It seems the only people he listens to are those with deep enough  pockets to afford high-powered lobbyists. If you are a concerned  citizen or small business owner, your voice doesn't matter to this FCC.  As someone who held public hearings on this issue in 2014, I can tell  you that there is widespread and overwhelming support for net  neutrality just about everywhere except at the FCC itself.   If the Chairman took the time to listen, as I did, he would hear from  small business owners like Cabot Orton at the Vermont Country Store,  who told me, ``We're not asking for special treatment, incentives, or  subsidies. All the small business community asks is simply to preserve  and protect Internet commerce as it exists today, which has served all  businesses remarkably well.''   Just today, we received a letter from businesses in Northern New  England, including Vermont's own Ben & Jerry's, Cabot Creamery  Cooperative, and King Arthur Flour, discussing the  [[Page S7985]]  ``crippling effect'' a repeal of net neutrality rules would have on  rural businesses.   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the  Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   Chairman Pai would hear from libraries, which for some rural  communities are the only way to access the internet.   As Vermont's State librarian, Martha Reid, told me: ``All Americans-- including the most disenfranchised citizens, those who would have no  way to access the Internet without the library--need to be able to use  Internet resources on an equal footing.''   Chairman Pai would also hear from independent content creators whose  voices are too often not heard on traditional media. As actress,  writer, and producer Ruth Livier told me: ``In the unprecedented world  of an open, nondiscriminatory Internet, no longer did low-budgets and  no connections mean there was no way in. Never again could we be  disregarded by anyone who essentially asks, `Who are you to have your  story be told?' ''   These are the voices being ignored. They are the people, the  Americans, who stand to lose the most in the Chairman Pai's misguided  plan.   This is not about partisanship. Republicans and Democrats alike, in  my State and every other State, benefit from the power of an open  Internet, and equally stand to be harmed if the rules of the road  ensuring its openness go away.   I know there are some people with a lot of money who want to do away  with net neutrality. They are even filing fake comments with the FCC  saying they want to repeal these protections. One of those comments  came to my attention. It had my name and my home address on it. Most  people, when they saw it, just laughed, because they knew it was fake.   None of us should support a process that willfully dismisses the  voices of our constituents. I hope that all Senators will join me in  calling on the FCC to abandon this reckless vote to repeal net  neutrality.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  December 13, 2017.      The Hon. Ajit Pai,      Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.        Dear FCC Chairman Ajit Pai: We are a group of businesses       from Northern New England with strong ties to the rural and       agricultural business community. We are writing today out of       deep concern about the FCC's proposal to roll back the       current net neutrality rules based on Title II of the       Communications Act. We urge you to maintain the existing       rules instead.        As members of the business community in this region, we       regularly witness how small rural businesses, including the       farms and cooperatives that many of us source from, already       struggle with limited access to broadband and limited options       for Internet service providers. The repeal of net neutrality       would compound the challenges faced by these businesses,       adding cost and creating a competitive disadvantage to       running a successful business in rural America.        Uninhibited access to the internet is already a fundamental       necessity for operating a successful business in rural areas.       Looking to the future, this is only going to become more       important. In our work with farmers in this region, we see       how this particular group of businesses is increasingly       reliant on the internet for access to technical information       and support, and for access to information about markets.        The changes proposed by the FCC would remove the only       existing legal foundation strong enough to ensure net       neutrality protections are enforceable: Title II of the       Communications Act, as implemented in the agency's 2015 Open       Internet Order.        Under this change, internet providers would gain new powers       to steer businesses and customers one way or another. For       example, Internet access providers could charge new fees for       prioritized access to customers. While big companies and       farms might be able to afford a pay-to-play prioritized `fast       lane' to users, small and medium sized businesses cannot; at       the very least, such new fees would put them at a distinct       disadvantage with larger competitors. Internet access       providers could also charge rural businesses new fees for       access to websites and services. They could favor certain       businesses by slowing down traffic or exempting competitors'       traffic from users' data caps. They could also block websites       and apps outright. This would create immense uncertainty for       companies in every sector of the economy who rely on open,       unencumbered connectivity as a key enabler for their business       and productivity. It could also greatly limit or bias       farmers' access to products, services, and information they       need to run their business.        Ultimately, repealing net neutrality will have a crippling       effect on rural economies, further restricting access to the       internet for rural businesses at a point in time where we       need to expand and speed this access instead. We urge you to       maintain strong net neutrality rules and focus on advancing       policies that foster fair competition.            Sincerely,      Stonyfield,        Londonderry, New Hampshire.      King Arthur Flour,        Norwich, Vermont.      FoodState,        Londonderry, New Hampshire.
