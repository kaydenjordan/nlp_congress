 Madam Speaker, there are two times we are going to be  called to account for our votes here in Congress. One is at our next  election; the other is when we draw our last breath of air. I am more  concerned about the latter.   This vote isn't about supporting or opposing President Trump. I voted  for President Trump. I plan to vote for President Trump again.   This vote is about exercising our constitutional authority. More  importantly, it is about our moral obligation to decide when and where  our troops are going to be asked to give their lives.   Congress needs to do more of what we are doing here today. We need to  debate our involvement in Afghanistan, and then we need to bring our  troops home. We need to debate our involvement in Iraq, and then we  need to bring our troops home.   We certainly don't need another war. If we do go to war, it needs to  be with the blessing and the support of the people and a mission that  our soldiers can accomplish.   We do that by following the vision of our Founding Fathers: We debate  it here on the floor of the House.   That is what this resolution is about, and I urge my colleagues to  vote ``yes.''
