 This week, the Senate is making more progress in the  personnel business. Since returning to more prompt consideration for  unobjectionable, lower level nominees, we are continuing to fill  important vacancies around the executive branch and on the Federal  bench.   Yesterday we confirmed several more well-qualified nominees to  important seats on the Federal judiciary--Ryan Holte of Ohio and  Richard Hertling of Maryland to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and  Rossie David Alston, of Virginia, to the U.S. District Court for the  Eastern District of Virginia. These brandnew judges possess impressive  legal and academic credentials.   In the case of Mr. Holte, who taught law school for several years,  125 former students wrote our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to  say their former professor would ``provide impartial, unbiased, and  principled decisions, and will apply the law faithfully no matter the  litigants.''   That is exactly what this body should look for in every nominee we  consider for the Federal bench. So I am glad we will have the  opportunity this week to consider six more distinguished judicial  nominees.   First up today will be Sarah Daggett Morrison, tapped by the  President to serve the Southern District of Ohio. Ms. Morrison is a  graduate of Ohio State University and Capital University Law School.  Earlier this year, the Judiciary Committee reported her nomination  favorably on a voice vote.   After Ms. Morrison's nomination is confirmed, we will turn to  consider Pamela Barker for the Northern Virginia District of Ohio,  Corey Maze for the Northern District of Alabama, Rodney Smith for the  Southern District of Florida, Thomas Barber for the Middle District of  Florida, and Jean-Paul Boulee for the Northern District of Georgia.   Following them, we will fill two more executive branch vacancies, one  each at the State Department and in the diplomatic corps. I hope my  colleagues will join me in voting to confirm each of these nominees  with strong bipartisan support on the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, on an entirely different matter, like  many of my colleagues, I watched images from Hong Kong this weekend and  could not help but be moved by the residents of that metropolis. They  are mounting a bold stand to preserve Hong Kong's autonomy from China  and, by extension, defend their liberties.   Over the weekend, more than 1 million residents, a staggering  proportion of the population--about one in seven--took to the streets  to protest a draft law that would allow the people of Hong Kong to be  extradited to mainland China. Hong Kong residents rightly view this  measure as another erosion of the rule of law and tightening of  Beijing's grip on their imperiled autonomy.  [[Page S3300]]    These are not just students or lawyers or intellectuals who have  taken to the streets but a broad cross-section of Hong Kong's diverse  society--all age groups, all professions, all walks of life--all  committed to preserving the personal freedoms and judicial independence  that have made Hong Kong such a special and prosperous city.   The Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, which I sponsored, has, for nearly  three decades, enshrined America's commitment to preserving Hong Kong's  special status and its freedoms. This draft law is inconsistent with  the Hong Kong Policy Act and puts Hong Kong on the path of becoming  just another one of China's cities subject to Beijing's whims.   As the Vice President stated last autumn, ``For a time, Beijing  inched toward greater liberty and respect for human rights. But in  recent years, China has taken a sharp U-turn toward control and  oppression of its own people.''   I regret that reports from Guangdong to Xinjiang continue to prove  him right as Beijing's grip on its own people grows tighter, even as  the rest of the world marks its 30th anniversary of the violence in  Tiananmen Square.   I encourage the administration to stay engaged and express our  concerns with the authorities in Hong Kong before this proposal becomes  law and the Chinese Communist Party further extends its control over  the people of Hong Kong.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, last week's  announcement of progress in negotiations with Mexico was a welcome  development. It staved off the threat that tariffs would disrupt an  important trading relationship and secured a promise that Mexican  authorities will take more responsibility for their own borders, but,  as I said yesterday, while this was a critical step, it does not  absolve Congress of our duty to finally act--not even close.   It was May 1 when the administration first transmitted to Congress  its urgent request for supplemental border funding. That will be 6  weeks ago tomorrow that the administration set up a request for  supplemental funding for the crisis at the border--6 weeks--and this  emergency request is essentially falling on deaf ears among our  Democratic colleagues.   In the meantime, we should note that the month of May marks a third  straight month with more than 100,000 individuals apprehended at the  southern border. In fact, last month's total of more than 140,000 was  the largest in the last 13 years of CBP data.   By the way, that includes more than 84,000 family units and more than  11,000 unaccompanied children. These are enormous numbers of people  showing up at our border. The American personnel who are charged with  securing our Nation and looking after these individuals are simply  overwhelmed. The agencies are overwhelmed. The facilities are  overwhelmed. It is a true humanitarian crisis, totally unsustainable  for these individuals for whom our national security and rule of law  dictate that we need to detain.   At overcrowded facilities, beds are in short supply, medical care is  wearing thin, money and personnel from across the Department of  Homeland Security are being diverted from other important missions on  an emergency basis to cover shortfalls, but even that cannot go on much  longer.   This is from John Sanders, the Acting Commissioner of Customs and  Border Control. He said: ``We are at a full-blown emergency . . . the  system is broken.'' The system is broken--that from the head of Customs  and Border Patrol.   The professionals whom our Nation has entrusted to keep America safe  and care for these people have been begging--literally begging--for  more resources for 6 weeks. Their calls have solidified a national  consensus that spans the entire political spectrum.   More than 1 month ago, the editorial board of the New York Times--not  what you call devoted admirers of the Trump administration--wrote an  editorial they titled--listen to this headline: ``Congress, Give Trump  His Border Money.''   That is the New York Times. They wrote:         Something needs to be done. Soon. [But] unfortunately,       political gamesmanship once again threatens to hold up       desperately needed resources.    That was the New York Times in early May, at the time both Houses of  Congress were negotiating the supplemental funding bill for recent  natural disasters, but Democrats chose to come down to the left of the  New York Times' editorial pages--that is pretty hard to do--and decided  to deny the White House this border money.   One Member of the House Democratic conference complained that the  need for border money was ``political.'' Political.   Another House Democrat admitted to reporters that his own side was  the problem. This is what he said: ``In my opinion, we do have to come  up with some money. But we've got to convince our more progressive  friends.''   Again, these are not resources for any remotely controversial cause.  We are talking about humanitarian funding for caring for families and  children who show up at the border in need of help. That is what we are  talking about. This is not a subject where the political left should  need week after week of convincing, but apparently our liberal  colleagues just could not get past their animosity for the President,  even on something like this.   During these last 6 weeks, the House has found plenty of time and  energy for purely partisan things. There has been plenty of histrionics  and political theater. We have seen hearing room melodrama. We have  seen some partisan messaging votes. We have seen plenty of political  theater, opposing the President for the sake of opposing him. They have  had time for all of that but nothing--nothing--for the urgent border  crisis.   So, May 5, the New York Times: ``Congress, Give Trump His Border  Money.''   May 23, ``Democrats balked at allocating billions of dollars more  toward border security.''   June 9, very recently: ``When Will Congress Get Serious About the  Suffering at the Border?'' Two New York Times editorials say: Give  Trump the money for the border crisis. This is breathtaking--the  alliance between the New York Times editorial board and the Trump  administration being ignored by our Democratic colleagues.    So look, the question we have been asking ourselves every day as the  House continues to ignore this crisis is, What is the problem here?   I suspect it is the question men and women we ask to secure the  border are asking one another every day. When will our Democratic  colleagues get serious about this?   Believe me, we know that our Democratic counterparts are not charter  members of Donald Trump's personal fan club. We get that. They have  made that abundantly clear over and over again. Their entire political  agenda these days seems to be repeating that fact nice and loud, over  and over again in case we hadn't already heard it.   We are all plenty familiar with ``the resistance.'' We have seen that  here in the Senate. That is why we have had so many nominations clogged  up. But, look, ``the resistance'' doesn't pay the bills. ``The  resistance'' doesn't produce the funding that the border facilities  desperately need. ``The resistance'' doesn't plug the holes in our  Nation's border security or improve humanitarian conditions down on the  border.   There is only one way to fix this--bipartisan legislation with  supplemental border funding. That is what we need to do.   So for everyone's sake, I think the entire country is hoping that  Democrats remember their job is governing, not resisting. It is far  past time to get serious about this and solve this problem.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:45  p.m., Wednesday, June 12, the Senate vote on the confirmation of the  Barker, Maze, Smith, Barber, and Boulee nominations in the order  listed.    Madam President, for the information of all Senators,  following the disposition of the Boulee nomination, the Senate will  vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Stilwell nomination. This  means that we will have six votes starting at 1:45 p.m. tomorrow.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, my privilege to pay tribute to Dr.  Mary Pauline Fox, a pioneer of public health in the Commonwealth of  Kentucky, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 87. Mary's  remarkable life included more than four decades of service to eastern  Kentucky communities, and the full effect of her legacy will continue  to be felt throughout the region for years to come.   Mary began her exceptional career at the age of 19, graduating from  Union College in Barbourville, KY. A trailblazer in her time, she then  attended the University of Louisville's medical school as one of only  five women in a class of 100. Mary also holds the distinction as one of  the early women to participate in the Reserve Officers Training Corps.   Soon after beginning her career as a doctor, the Kentucky Department  of Health appointed Mary as a regional director, and for the next 7  years she oversaw healthcare delivery in 20 eastern Kentucky counties.  Afterward, she served as the director of the Pike County Health  Department for more than two decades. Mary only agreed to retire from  her position after funding was secured to build the current health  department facility located in Pikeville. To this day, that facility  continues to operate in the same building, which now bears her name.   Even at the end of her career, Mary refused to slow down. In  coordination with the U.S. Department of State, she was part of the  first public health group in our country invited to China. She remained  committed to her community, giving sought-after lectures on public  health issues throughout the Commonwealth.   As a healer and a teacher, Mary made our Commonwealth a better place.  Elaine and I commend her for her lifetime of service to others, and we  send our condolences to her family and friends.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 45, S.  395.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 504  and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I further ask unanimous consent that the Tillis-Sinema  amendment at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 245, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, June 12; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to  executive session and resume consideration of the Barker nomination,  under the previous order.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:12 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, June 12, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
