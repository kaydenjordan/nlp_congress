Sec. 5.  Each day during the period addressed by section 3       of this resolution shall not constitute a legislative day for       purposes of clause 7 of rule XV.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 790, providing for consideration of  two measures: H.R. 1230, the Protecting Older Workers Against  Discrimination Act, and H.J. Res. 76, providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Department of Education relating to ``Borrower Defense  Institutional Accountability.''   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1230 under a structured  rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking member of the Committee on Education and Labor. It makes in  order five amendments and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 76 under a closed  rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and the ranking member of the Committee on Education and Labor, and it  provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides for standard district work period  instructions from January 17 through January 24, 2020.   Mr. Speaker, since taking the majority a year ago, Democrats have  made it a priority to protect our Nation's students and workers. As a  member of the Committee on Education and Labor, I am proud that I have  played a role in passing legislation that will provide students and  workers the support they need to thrive. We have that opportunity once  again this week with these bills, both of which I am proud to  cosponsor.   First, we are taking a stand against the Department of Education's  deliberate disregard for students who have been defrauded by  institutions. In 2019, student loan debt reached an all-time high in  the United States of $1.41 trillion. Our Nation is truly in a student  debt crisis.   Even more significantly impacted by this crisis are students who have  been defrauded by predatory for-profit colleges. On top of their  crushing debt, they have useless degrees and none of  [[Page H217]]  the job opportunities that they were promised.   In 2016, following the collapse of two major predatory for-profit  institutions, President Obama established the borrower defense rule to  help students access relief from their student loans. Instead of  helping students, Secretary DeVos modified the rule, creating an  intentionally complicated process that restricts how much relief  defrauded students can receive.   According to The Institute for College Access and Success, the new  rule would forgive only about 3 cents on every dollar borrowed. Even in  cases where schools clearly violate the law, this new rule denies  students relief if they can't prove the school intentionally defrauded  them, can't file their claim fast enough, or can't document exactly how  much financial harm they have suffered due to fraud.   Although we don't have the full picture because their investments are  shrouded in secrecy, Secretary DeVos' connections to the for-profit  college industry led me to believe that her siding with the industry is  not a coincidence.   The bill we will consider this week would bring us back to the Obama- era rules that put students first and profit second.   Second, we will bring to the floor the Protecting Older Workers  Against Discrimination Act. One in four adults age 65 and older are  part of the workforce, and that number is still growing. While some of  the reasons behind this shift in the labor force are positive, like  better health and job satisfaction, many older Americans must keep  working because they are not financially prepared for retirement.   Sadly, aging American adults have a median savings of just over  $150,000 for retirement. If a person is fortunate enough to live a  long, healthy life and has 30 years of retirement, that would leave  them with just $5,000 a year, a sum no one could retire on anywhere in  this country.   Unfortunately, older workers suffer disproportionately from long-term  unemployment and age discrimination in the workforce. Six out of 10  older workers have experienced age discrimination, but a 2009 Supreme  Court ruling has made it harder for them to prove it. The decision  upended decades of precedent, making it more difficult for older  workers to get justice through the courts.   This legislation restores workplace protections for older Americans,  paving the way for a more inclusive and diverse workforce.   Taken together, these bills honor our commitment to students and  workers and offer us the opportunity to reverse two misguided and  harmful policies.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to respond to the comments from my friend from California.   We know the Government of Iran admitted to mistakenly shooting down  the Ukraine International Airlines flight. It was a tragedy, and  tragedies led to tragedy. The people of Iran stood up and demanded  accountability and are standing up from their government today.   This Congress supports those who have stood up to their government  demanding transparency and fighting for their rights. That is why the  concurrent resolution we passed last week reaffirmed that it is in our  national interest to support the people of Iran and other Middle  Eastern countries who demand an end to government corruption in  violation of basic human rights.   As of this morning, the Foreign Affairs Committee is holding a  hearing to examine our policy with Iran. While the Foreign Affairs  Committee is hearing from experts on Iran, the House is taking action  to protect students and protect Americans from discrimination in the  workplace, and that is what this rule is about.   Make no mistake, defeating the previous question is not a vote on the  McCarthy resolution, it is a vote to hand over control of the House  floor to the minority.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous question so we  may proceed to these critical pieces of legislation without delay.   I might add, just on a personal note, I would ask my colleagues to  help--and I am sure they have had some cases of this--the Iranian  Americans who have come to my office in my district with very troubling  stories about their relatives who regularly have come to visit them in  this country who are unable to come right now because of the travel ban  by this administration.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I recognize the gentleman from Connecticut, I  want to mention, like the previous speaker, I am a Member of this House  who made payrolls for over 35 years in the restaurant business. I have  a different perspective.   I wanted to hire the most talented person in front of me, and I  wanted my managers to do the same thing. I don't think this rule, these  kinds of laws, will inhibit that.   I understand the intuitive perspective, but if you believe in hiring  the best person, I don't think you have to be afraid of this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Courtney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Shalala), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have one more speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a September 3  Institute for College Access and Success article titled ``Defrauded  Students Left Holding the Bag Until Final `Borrower Defense' Rule.''      [From The Institute for College Access & Success, Sept. 3, 2019]      Defrauded Students Left Holding the Bag Under Final ``Borrower                               Defense'' Rule         Claiming to protect students and hold colleges accountable,       on Friday the Department of Education finalized its so-called       borrower defense rule. The rule allows students to seek to       cancel student loans connected to fraud and other illegal       activity by their colleges. ``If a school defrauds students,       it must be held accountable,'' said Secretary of Education       Betsy DeVos in the press release.        Yet the Trump Administration's proposal would do virtually       nothing to hold schools accountable for their misdeeds or to       protect students who were wronged. To really understand the       impact of the rule, you have look at page 669 of the notice       where--in a table titled ``Assumptions for Main Budget       Estimate Compared to PB2020 Baseline''--the Department       published its own estimates of the likely impact of the rule:        Borrowers will be required to repay the vast majority of       loans resulting from colleges' wrongdoing. Only about 3 cents       of every dollar borrowed will be forgiven under the borrower       defense rule.        Colleges, on the other hand, will rarely face any       questions. They will repay only about a penny for every       dollar of loans stemming from misconduct.        The Department expects substantial amounts of illegal       activity by colleges. In 2021 alone, the Department expects       nearly 200,000 borrowers to suffer from colleges' illegal       conduct, but their rule would leave borrowers to repay 97       percent of the resulting $2.5 billion in debt.

Available at       https://bit.ly/21POWdk. Because Table 3 provides the data by       sector, we used other Department data on loan volume by       sector to produce a weighted average, on the assumption that       these figures are consistent over time. U.S. Department of       Education, ``Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Proposal,'' March 11,       2019, page Q-30, https://bit.ly/21XI7Xm. To translate these       percentages into the number of affected students, we used       other Department data on the number of students borrowing       federal loans, again assuming that these figures are similar       from year to year. Federal Student Aid Data Center, ``Aid       Recipients Summary,'' April 2019, https://bit.ly/l2MGL5wc. To       translate these percentages into dollar terms, we used       projected loan volume in year 2021 from the Congressional       Budget Office. Congressional Budget Office, ``Student Loan       Programs--CBO's May 2019 Baseline,'' May 2019, https:// bit.ly/21A5juo. We examined fiscal year 2021, the first full       year of the rule's implementation.     Mr. Speaker, according to the Institute for College  Access & Success, the DeVos rule would forgive just 3 cents of every  dollar borrowed by students. That means those scammed by bad actors and  fly-by-night institutions would be forced to repay the vast majority of  their loans for degrees they didn't get, often through no fault of  their own.   We need to help defrauded borrowers, not defend for-profit colleges.  That is what this resolution is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, these two issues are extremely important to the American  public.   When I think of the comments from my friend from Iowa and the  comments about having made a payroll, I reflect on my career making  those obligations. He neglected to say that doing  [[Page H222]]  what he suggested employers would do is discriminatory on its face.   I knew that when I instructed my managers and when I interviewed  prospective employees, I was not to discriminate based on certain  Federal and State categories. So by taking the lead that he assumed  that some employers might do, that you wouldn't hire somebody who is  older because you might find yourself in court, that would in itself be  discriminatory.   What we are doing with this legislation is just bringing this to an  equal perspective with other categories. You shouldn't discriminate  based on ethnicity, gender, or sexual preference. Why should you have  any different performance standards or adhere to the same level for  older people?   Given that baby boomers, people of my generation, find they have to  work longer and harder, and given the issues around retirement, I would  think that all of us would want to make sure that they were protected  and that the economy would get the benefit of their wisdom and  experience, and not have them discriminated against.   On the second subject, Ben Franklin once famously said at the  beginning of this country that an investment in education is always the  best investment.   Sadly, with this administration, Mr. Franklin might not say that  because young people who are encouraged to get degrees, to get  undergraduate degrees and graduate degrees to be part of a knowledge- based economy, to take that access to the best educational system in  the world in higher education in this country, it would end with them  in debt and with a degree that is worthless in the open marketplace.   I would think that all Members of Congress would want to protect both  aging workers and students who are defrauded.   Mr. Speaker, as you can see, we are on the floor this week to restore  justice to those who need our help. Struggling students and workers  deserve our support, not for us to turn our backs on them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 790         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 791) condemning the actions of the       Government of Iran and supporting the protesters in Iran,       their demands for accountability, and their desire for the       Government of Iran to respect freedom and human rights. The       resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble       to adoption without intervening motion or demand for division       of the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall       not apply to the consideration of House Resolution 791.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
