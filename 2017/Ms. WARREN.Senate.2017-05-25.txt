 Mr. President, I thank Senator Whitehouse for his  important words and all the Senators who have come to the floor this  afternoon to talk about the Republican plans to dismantle our  healthcare system.   As we speak, Republicans in the Senate are busy behind closed doors  working overtime to come up with a secret health plan to ram through  the Senate. I guess they are afraid of how the public would react if we  could see the full scope of their plans, but in the last 24 hours, we  have seen new details about what they want to do. The formula is as  clear as it is cruel: destroy healthcare for tens of millions of  Americans, including people struggling under the weight of our national  opioid crisis. Why? In order to give tax cuts to rich people.   These plans are simply unforgivable, and I say ``unforgivable''  because I cannot find any justification that makes it  [[Page S3184]]  OK to take away health insurance from 23 million Americans. I cannot  come up with a single sliver of an argument that says it makes sense to  rip away more than $800 billion from kids with complex medical needs,  seniors in nursing homes, and one of the largest sources of help for  people and families struggling with substance abuse disorder, all to  produce tax breaks for a handful of millionaires and billionaires.   The Republican agenda is destroying healthcare in this country, and  it has never been clearer. President Trump released his budget proposal  this week. If the healthcare bill is a punch to the gut, his budget is  a knife in the ribs. The Trump budget is about the future, and for the  future, Trump says there is too much medical research. He wants to cut  more than $5 billion from the NIH budget. That is the place where  research is ongoing about treatments for Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes,  ALS. That is America's future that President Trump wants to cut by more  than $5 billion.   Then there is the Republican effort to blow up our existing  healthcare system. The Republican bill would open the door to  discriminating against people with preexisting conditions, and there is  more. Insurance companies could drop coverage for mental health and  substance abuse disorders. Insurance companies could decide not to  cover pregnancy or maternity care. They can drop coverage for  prescription drugs. Insurance companies could, once again, impose  lifetime limits on diseases like cancer and heart conditions, even for  people on employer plans in States like Massachusetts that want nothing  to do with the waivers the Republican bill allows.   The CBO says that out-of-pocket costs for these services that are no  longer covered would rise ``thousands of dollars a year,'' but cutting  out cancer patients and mamas and newborn babies and people with  preexisting conditions just wasn't enough for the Republicans.  President Trump used his new budget to cut hundreds of millions of  dollars from the Federal agency leading the fight against opioids. Tens  of thousands of people are dying, and the Trump budget cuts money  needed in the fight against opioids. It gets even worse.   Together, the Republican healthcare bill and the President's budget  rip well over a trillion dollars out of the Medicaid Program, which  provides health insurance to one in five people in this country.  Medicaid funds more than half the people in nursing homes. When a new  baby is born in this country, Medicaid pays for about half of those  births. Seniors in nursing homes and new babies are just targets for  the Republican cuts.   Then, like extra chocolate sauce drizzled over this misery sundae,  the budget also cuts the Children's Health Insurance Program by 20  percent over the next decade. Children's health insurance is the  program that works together with Medicaid to provide health insurance  for one out of every three kids in this country. Trump and the  Republicans say: Let them go sick.   What does that mean? Don't repair a hole in their hearts or fix their  broken arms? Don't treat them when they get ear infections or does it  just leave someone else to pay? If that is the answer, then tell us  who? Who exactly is going to pay for the healthcare for these children?   I just don't get what the Republicans in Congress are thinking. I  know they have people back in their home States who are begging them to  keep healthcare coverage. Disease, accidents, old age, substance abuse,  these misfortunes don't ask whether you are a Democrat or a Republican  before they come knocking at your door. I just don't get how  Republicans can turn their backs on people who will be hurt, but I  understand whom the Republicans are helping.   The CBO score lays it out in black and white. The budget lets you go  line by line to see just whom the Republicans do care about. The  Republican healthcare bill burns down healthcare access for millions of  people in this country in order to hand out tax breaks to a tiny  handful of millionaires and billionaires.   The Republican budget rips away coverage for people with disabilities  so that giant corporations can keep more of their giant profits. The  Republican budget tosses seniors out of nursing homes and puts the  brakes on Alzheimer's research so the richest people in this country  can rake in millions in tax cuts. That is not puzzling; that is  unforgivable.   Let's be clear about what is at stake here. A couple of weeks ago, I  was at Malden Care Center, which is part of the Cambridge Health  Alliance. Health providers like these in Massachusetts are on the  frontlines, and they are fighting back against the opioid epidemic.   The folks at Cambridge Health Alliance told me that before the ACA,  they were lucky if one out of every three people walking through their  doors had health insurance. Today, after years of hard work in  Massachusetts to pass bipartisan health reform and then to implement  the ACA, more than 97 percent of the people in our State have  healthcare. More than 9 out of 10 people coming into Cambridge Health  Alliance clinics now have coverage. Because of that coverage, CHA could  offer a wide range of services, including treatment for opioids. They  are making headway: More lives saved, more success stories, more  healthy babies.   I am not going to tell the seniors and the mamas and the people on  the frontlines of the opioid crisis they have to give up those gains to  pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest people in this country. If Senate  Republicans want to defend this indefensible budget and unforgivable  healthcare bill, then they can start by coming out from behind closed  doors where they are conducting secret negotiations over healthcare.  They can look the American people in the eye and admit they care more  about the wealthy few in this country than they do about hard-working  families and people who need our help. They can be straight up, and the  American people--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--can hold  them accountable for what they are trying to do to our families and to  our country.   I yield the floor to my colleague from Maryland.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Maryland.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to  honor the memory of Trooper Thomas Clardy, who was killed in the line  of duty on March 16, 2016.   Last week, the country observed National Police Week, a week in honor  of the brave law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line  of duty, and on Monday, we will observe Memorial Day, a day we honor  the heroic men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to  their country. Thomas Clardy, an officer and a veteran, is one of those  brave people to whom our Nation owes a debt of gratitude.   Born and raised in Park City, UT, Trooper Clardy spent his adult life  in service to his country, his community, and his family. After  graduating from high school, Trooper Clardy spent 2 years in the U.S.  Army before transferring to the U.S. Marine Corps, where he served 11  years.   Following his honorable discharge from the Marines, Trooper Clardy  began a long and esteemed career in service to his community. He  graduated from the Massachusetts State Trooper Academy in 2005 and was  a valued member of the Massachusetts State Police until his untimely  death.   Trooper Clardy was a dedicated and loving husband to his wife, Reisa,  and father to his seven children. Thanksgiving was a sacred holiday for  Trooper Clardy. He spent it, without fail, surrounded by friends and  loved ones, enjoying football with the kids and spending quality time  with the family he loved so much.   Today we honor his service and sacrifice. May his memory continue to  challenge and inspire us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to  honor the memory of Officer Ronald Tarentino, who was killed in the  line of duty on May 22, 2016.   Last week, the country observed National Police Week, a week in honor  of the brave law enforcement officers who paid the ultimate sacrifice  in service to their community. Officer Ronald Tarentino was one of  those brave officers.   Officer Tarentino was born in Medford and raised in Medford and  Tewksbury, MA. The son of a police officer, he followed his father's  example when he joined the police force, spending 7 years in the  Leicester Police Department before transferring to the Auburn Police  Department, where he served until his untimely death 2 years later.   I had the honor of attending the wake of Officer Tarentino and was  moved by the stories of his selfless dedication to those around him.  Officer Tarentino was the coworker everyone loved. His passion for his  work was easily apparent to anyone who knew him. He came into work with  a smile and made friends with all of his colleagues. Outside of work,  he enjoyed fishing, hunting, and archery and was a member of the  Massachusetts Police Association, the Auburn Elks, and Mustangs or  Massachusetts.   Most of all, Officer Tarentino was a loving husband and a father of  three. Today we honor his service and sacrifice. May his memory  continue to challenge and inspire us.                            ____________________
