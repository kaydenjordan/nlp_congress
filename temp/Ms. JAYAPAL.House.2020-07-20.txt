 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, my amendment would repeal the law that  requires the military to provide an unfunded priorities list to  Congress along with their budget request each year.   This year, the Pentagon requested a whopping $740 billion from  Congress, even more than last year, while other agencies like the State  Department, the EPA, and the Department of Housing and Urban  Development were cut by over 15 percent.   The defense budget eats up over half of our Nation's annual  discretionary budget, and yet this year Pentagon officials gave Members  of Congress a wish list of $18 billion in unfunded priorities on top of  its request for $740 billion in spending.   Why? Because in 2016, Congress actually passed a law requiring the  military services and combatant commands to provide annual wish lists  of weapons systems that the Pentagon couldn't fit into its already  massive budget.   No other Federal agency is required by law to provide such wish  lists, and with good reason. The practice is irresponsible, and it  undermines the very goals of budgeting.   So why does it exist? Because it gives special interests and the  defense contractor industry an opportunity to argue for Congress to  fund additional, extremely expensive weapons systems not important  enough to make it into the Pentagon's budget.   Now, this is a bipartisan concern. You might hear that this is  something that just Democrats want. No. Lawmakers have long questioned  the utility of unfunded priority lists. The late Senator John McCain,  chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in 2015:  ``Actually, I am not really big on unfunded priority lists. I think  they're sort of a backdoor way of getting things done.''   Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates took a step further to ban the  practice of submitting these lists to Congress during his tenure.   Senator McCain and Secretary Gates were exactly right. We need to see  spending discipline and better efficiency within the Pentagon.   The Department of Defense has now failed two consecutive audits in 2  years. The Pentagon lost track of $800 million in construction projects  and $2.1 billion in spare parts for the F-35 program. And it even  buried an internal study revealing $125 billion in bureaucratic waste  amid fears that the findings might lead Congress to reconsider the  massive sum of taxpayer money that goes to the Pentagon each year.   If a private corporation lost track of hundreds of millions of  dollars and shielded evidence that it could save billions in wasteful  spending, its shareholders would find that completely unacceptable, but  the Defense Department has not undertaken the kind of real reform that  it needs. In fact, the senior officer the Pentagon appointed just 3  years ago to reform the Department is now poised to be eliminated  because she identified too much waste that could be saved.   Now, the other side might claim that these wish lists are necessary  for our national security. To that I say, if they are necessary, put  them in the budget. Put them in the budget. The Pentagon submitted a  budget for $740 billion. If these programs are so necessary, put them  in the budget. No budget on top of budgets.   Additionally, this amendment doesn't preclude our military services  and combatant commands from sending over wish lists or testifying to  Congress, but what it does do is end a terrible budgeting practice that  lines the pockets of a bunch of defense contractor lobbyists at the  expense of working people. That is unsustainable, and we must rein that  in.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith), the distinguished chairman of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left?    Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to say that we are getting  the priorities from the Pentagon. That is called the budget. That is  what they are supposed to do. They are supposed to put together their  priorities and send it to us. So, we are looking at exactly what the  Pentagon wants.   We are responding to that by, in this case, putting $740 billion into  a defense budget. Now, you are going to tell me you need a budget on  top of the budget. That is bad budgeting, by every stretch of the  imagination.   Mr. Speaker, I don't care which President asked for it, it is bad.  That is why this has always been a bipartisan amendment or a bipartisan  idea to get rid of this Unfunded Priorities List. It does not do the  job; it bloats the military budget; and it is unnecessary and  inefficient and bad spending.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of this amendment  by my fantastic co-chair, Mr. Pocan, and Ms. Lee.   This is critical for us to just do this small step of cutting 10  percent of our Pentagon budget.   Enough is enough. This year's defense budget is 90 times bigger than  the budget for the Centers for Disease Control. Yet, we are nearing 4  million COVID cases and over 141,000 deaths, and this President wants  to add money for defense spending while cutting money for testing. That  is just wrong.   It is a small amount, but it is a start. That $74 billion could mean  childcare for every family. It could mean housing vouchers for every  eligible family. It could mean a $23,000 raise for every public-school  teacher.   So many things that we could do with this money--what we cannot do is  give it away to corrupt defense contractors.   Pass this amendment. Reset our priorities. It is time.
