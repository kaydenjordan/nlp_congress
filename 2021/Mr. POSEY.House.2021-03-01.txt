 Madam Speaker, transparency has always been a cornerstone  of good government. Over the past 10 years, we have made important  [[Page H864]]  progress toward making Congress more transparent and accountable to  those we serve.   In 2010, I introduced a resolution calling for a 72-hour period of  public availability before the House could bring a bill up for a vote,  so Members of the House and the public could actually see what was in a  bill before we were asked to vote for it. In 2011, the proposal was  adopted into House rules as a 3-day rule.   But, sadly, this year's House rules package abolished that rule. It  is incredibly sad to see that this House is moving backward and making  government less open and less accountable to those we were sent here to  represent.                            ____________________
