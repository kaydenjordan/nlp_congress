 Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of a  significant anniversary in our Nation's history. Thirty years ago, on  July 26, 1990, President George H.W. Bush signed into law the Americans  with Disabilities Act, ADA. Because of the monumental impact on  individuals with disabilities, the ADA remains one of the most  celebrated pieces of civil rights legislation today.   Behind the ADA is a specific vision: a more equitable, accessible and  inclusive America. This watershed legislation sought to eradicate the  discrimination that long confronted individuals with disabilities in  the United States in many areas--including employment, education,  transportation, and government services. The ADA established a clear  and comprehensive national mandate to ensure individuals with  disabilities have equal opportunities to participate in their  communities.   We can be proud of organizations in Arkansas dedicated to providing  services and life-enhancing skills so individuals with disabilities can  engage in everyday activities and independent living.   To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the ADA, the Senate recently  passed S. Res. 661 recognizing this landmark legislation and the  importance of independent living for individuals with disabilities that  was made possible with this law.   In celebration of this milestone, I am proud to recognize the  advancement of disability rights in Arkansas and nationwide.                            ____________________
