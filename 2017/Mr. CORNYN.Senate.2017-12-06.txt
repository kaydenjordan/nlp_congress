 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                           Remembering Al Hill, Jr.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                           Remembering Al Hill, Jr.     Mr. President, I would like to begin my comments today by  offering my condolences to the family of my friend, Al Hill, Jr. Al was  the oldest grandson of the legendary Texas oilman H.L. Hunt, and he  passed away last Saturday.   Al was many things to many people. We shared in common as alumnus the  fact that we both went to Trinity University, but the difference  between us is that Al was a star tennis player and I was not. He later  popularized the sport as president of World Championship Tennis. During  the rest of his career following his education, he worked in the energy  industry, was a commercial real estate developer, and most of us knew  him as a prominent philanthropist, along with the entire Hill family.   Al positively impacted the lives of more people than I can count,  including mine, and I simply want to say how much we will miss him.                      SAFER Program Reauthorization Act    Mr. President, the second person I would like to talk about today,  and the focus of my remarks, is a Texas woman named Lavinia Masters.  Lavinia is not famous in a sense, but she is near and dear to my heart  because of her courage.   When Lavinia was 13 years old, she was sexually assaulted at  knifepoint by a man who broke into her family's home. Her parents were  sleeping upstairs and immediately called the police.   Lavinia was taken to the hospital in Dallas, where a forensic exam  was performed and DNA evidence was collected in a rape kit, but then it  sat there. The evidence sat around for 20 years untested, believe it or  not. When other victims of sexual assault had similar forensic exams  performed, their rape kits were added to Lavinia's, warehoused, not  tested, and eventually a backlog began.   More than two decades later, in 2005, Lavinia's rapist had not yet  been identified. She calls the frustration and anxiety of having to  wait year after year ``pouring salt on the wound.'' She didn't know who  the rapist was, and she didn't know if he was still around or whether  her life was even in jeopardy.   One day, Lavinia saw a TV commercial about a new initiative to clear  backlogged rape kits. She called the Dallas Police Department, and,  fortunately, officers reopened her case. Soon thereafter, her untested  rape kit was located. When it was finally tested, it turned up a DNA  match for her perpetrator. Well, the rapist was already in jail for  other crimes he had committed, but because of the statute of  limitations--which bars prosecuting somebody after a certain period of  time--she couldn't even press charges, which is a shame.   This case, and Lavinia's courage in coming forward and letting us  talk about her case, demonstrates the importance of testing these rape  kits. It is important not only because the power of DNA testing will  allow you to identify whom the perpetrator was, but it will also allow  you to exonerate or exclude somebody whose DNA does not match that in  the rape kit.   All of this illustrates problems inherent in untested rape kits that  lie in storage lockers and laboratory counters across this country.  These kits contain forensic evidence with the potential to solve a  crime. As Lavinia's case demonstrates, frequently, people who commit  sexual assault don't just do it once; they are serial offenders, and  they will keep going until they are caught.   Unfortunately, in Lavinia's case, because of the 20-year interval  from the time she was assaulted, it is unknowable how many times her  assailant committed similar acts of sexual violence against other  people before he was finally stopped.   These rape kits contain forensic evidence with the potential to solve  a crime, to put a rapist behind bars, and to provide victims with  closure and vindication, and society with justice. The good news is, we  have made great strides in recent years--not only in my State but the  United States--in dealing with this problem.   One recent report from the Department of Public Safety indicates that  there are still more than 2,000 kits that remain untested in Texas.  That is unacceptable, but nationally the problem is even much bigger,  with as many as 175,000 rape kits that haven't been analyzed. In other  words, Lavinia Masters is not alone. She is joined by other Texas  women, courageous women, like Carol Bart, who came forward with her  story to help other women and potential victims avoid their fate.   Their cases are why the bill I authored earlier this year is so  important. It is called the SAFER Program Reauthorization Act. SAFER is  an acronym for Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting. Victims of  sexual assault--scarred by painful memories and physical trauma--can't  afford to wait for more efficient procedures and funding that is easier  to come by. They need their stories to be heard and the evidence  tested.   My bill reauthorizes a program that was created in 2013, which has  helped law enforcement reduce the national rape kit backlog. There are  many jurisdictions like the city of Houston, for example, which, a few  years ago, took this on their own and didn't wait around for the  Federal Government or additional funding. It was just amazing how many  hits they got on these untested rape kits that matched up to other  reported crimes as well. It allowed them to solve not only unsolved  sexual assault cases but other crimes by putting people at the scene of  the crime who claimed to be somewhere else, for example.   My bill reauthorizes this program created in 2013, which has helped  law enforcement reduce the national rape kit backlog. I am happy to  have the support of my friend and colleague Representative Ted Poe, who  is cosponsoring the bill in the House. The original legislation bears  the name of the Debbie Smith Act, the name of another brave woman who  stepped up and used her personal tragedy for good. We named the Debbie  Smith Act after her. It allowed us to then use Federal funds and make  them available to test untested rape kits. Actually, that original  legislation improved it to 35 percent and required 7 percent of them to  be used as audits on existing rape kit programs. The problem is, when  we started, we didn't even know how many untested rape kits there were  because there was no audit program, and much of the funds that were  being used for the Debbie Smith Act were being used for administrative  or other purposes and not to test rape kits. These audits are  important. They have had the potential to uncover thousands more  untested rape kits across the United States, each with evidence to be  used to bring criminals to justice.   The reauthorization I sponsored goes one step further than the  original legislation. It also ensures that pediatric forensic nurses  are eligible for training so, once they complete it, they are better  equipped to respond promptly and appropriately to children suffering  from abuse.   Finally, this bill extends the sunset provision of the SAFER Program,  which will ensure the longevity of our program with a proven history of  success. I am grateful this SAFER Act has enjoyed the support of a  broad range of bipartisan supporters in this Chamber, including the  senior Senator from Minnesota and the Senators from Nevada  [[Page S7863]]  and Colorado, each of whom are original cosponsors.   Here is the problem. This bill has now passed the Senate but is  waiting for action in the House. It is December, and we know the clock  is ticking. It is imperative that the House act to reauthorize this  program before the end of the year. While I am confident it will, time  is running out. We need to make sure this money is allocated for the  SAFER Program for the new year and that not only the testing continues  but the audits continue so we can find other rape kits, like those of  Carol Bart and Lavinia Masters, that need to be tested, perhaps sitting  on an evidence locker shelf somewhere in a police department.   This week, a coalition of advocacy groups and law enforcement  agencies called for the House to pass the SAFER Program Reauthorization  Act in a timely fashion. They said the promise of SAFER has yet to be  fully realized. They pointed out that the Nation is at a reckoning  point when it comes to sexual assault and harassment. They are  absolutely right. We have reached a critical turning point.   Today, as more and more survivors reach out to report these life- altering crimes, it is certainly not the time to let authorization for  SAFER lapse. Fortunately, I know and these law enforcement and victim  rights groups know that our colleagues in the House share their  beliefs. Like I said, I know we are going to get this done, but time is  running out, and I hope our colleagues in the House will take up this  legislation--which has no controversy at all associated with it--and  get it passed and get it to the President.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.

The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, I ask for our colleagues to vote no on the  motion to instruct, unless you happen to believe that 2 percent and  below growth is the new normal for the American economy, and we have  nowhere to go but down as a country; that people don't react to  incentives to keep more of what they earn and businesses invest more in  jobs and in pay that people can take home and spend to enhance their  standard of living; and unless you are satisfied with the fact that  companies are incentivized to keep earnings abroad and not bring them  back home and invest in pay and jobs here in America. If you believe  there is no better, brighter future for the American people, yes, vote  for the King motion to instruct.   If you believe we can and will do better under this bill, vote no.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``nay.''    Mr. President, the United States has the highest  corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. We are simply  noncompetitive, which is why businesses are moving out of America,  overseas, to lower taxed countries. If our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle think that is a good idea, then they ought to vote with  the distinguished Senator from Michigan, but we think it is a terrible  idea to ship American jobs and American investment overseas.   We happen to agree, by the way, with Barrack Obama's 2011 State of  the Union Message as well as the positions taken by the distinguished  ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Wyden, and the  Democratic leader, Senator Schumer. We need to get back in the game,  become more competitive, and all Americans will benefit from that.   We urge the Congress to maintain the current competitive corporate  rate.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander).
