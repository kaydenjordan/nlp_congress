 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ava Lawless, a  resident and constituent from my district in Missouri, and I am so  honored to appoint her to the United States Air Force Academy.   Ava was my first appointee to a military academy, and we took in a  lot--a lot--of qualified applicants on this one.   Ava is active, focused, and driven. She is going to the U.S. Air  Force Academy, and she is proudly going to serve our great Nation.   She comes from a strong family. Her dad is, in fact, a graduate of  the Air Force Academy. Her family instilled in her great dedication and  a foundation of understanding and respecting our Nation.   They cultivated a real patriotism and passion for service, and her  family taught her the value of hard work.   We are so, so very proud of Ava Lawless and her commitment to serving  our Nation. I couldn't be more proud and honored to recognize her today  as our first appointee to the United States Air Force Academy.   God bless you, Ava. God be with you, and we look forward to seeing  you here on Capitol Hill some day.                            ____________________
