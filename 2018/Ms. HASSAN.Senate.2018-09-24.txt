 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Laura  Landerman-Garber of Hollis, NH, who truly embodies our State's all- hands-on-deck spirit, as September's Granite Stater of the Month.   One holiday season years ago, Laura read a story about the importance  of remembering servicemembers away from home during the holidays. So  during a holiday dinner, she set out cards and told her family and  guests that she would start serving turkey dinner after they each wrote  a card to a servicemember. This tradition continued and grew last year  when a family friend was stationed on an aircraft carrier, the U.S.S.  Theodore Roosevelt, inspiring Laura to try to send a card to each  member of the crew--or 5,000 cards.   To accomplish this task, Laura mobilized her community. She reached  out to churches, synagogues, scout troops, and schools. She also talked  to the local media and public officials. Instead of receiving 5,000  cards, Laura received 17,000 cards for members of the Navy in just 6  weeks.   As Laura says, New Hampshire may be small in size, but we are mighty  in heart. She has decided to continue her mission to honor our heroes  serving in the Armed Forces and says she draws particular inspiration  to carry on her tradition after meeting a Vietnam war veteran who  described a card he had framed on the wall of his house, written to him  by a boy he has never met.   This year, Laura has formed a nonprofit organization to help with the  postage and has expanded her goals; she aims to collect 5,000 cards for  each branch of our military, 25,000 total. Already, Laura has said the  outpouring of support from the entire New Hampshire community has been  incredible, reinforcing that, from preschoolers to seniors, the people  of New Hampshire exhibit a remarkable generosity of heart and spirit.  Laura is confident that, this year, she will once again meet her goal.   For her dedication to our servicemembers and for her work to  [[Page S6276]]  bring Granite Starters together, I am proud of to recognize Laura as  our September Granite Stater of the Month.                            ____________________
