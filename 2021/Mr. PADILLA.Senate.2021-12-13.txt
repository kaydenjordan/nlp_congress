 Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination  of Judge Lucy Koh to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth  Circuit. Judge Koh is an outstanding legal thinker and a trailblazing  public servant. Her commitment to equal justice for all has earned her  support on both sides of the aisle. From her first judicial appointment  by former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to her unanimous  Senate confirmation to serve as a Federal district judge in California,  to her strong bipartisan advancement recently from the Senate Judiciary  Committee for this appointment, Judge Koh has a reputation for  excellence that stretches far and wide.   She built this reputation over the course of a stellar legal career  that started right here in this Senate, as a women's law and public  policy fellow with the Senate Judiciary Committee. She then spent 7  years with the U.S. Department of Justice, earning numerous accolades  for her work, including an FBI award for excellence in prosecuting  major fraud.   From the Department of Justice, Judge Koh made her way to  California--to Silicon Valley, specifically--where she made a name for  herself as an expert litigator on intellectual property cases.   In 2008, Governor Schwarzenegger, as I mentioned, appointed her to  the California Superior Court. Just 2 years later, President Obama  nominated Judge Koh to the Federal District Court bench, and she was  confirmed unanimously by this Senate. And in the decade since, Judge  Koh has gone on to distinguish herself as a jurist. She is well known,  not only in her district but across the country as talented,  thoughtful, smart, and fair.   This nomination is actually her second nomination to the Ninth  Circuit. In 2016, she was nominated and advanced out of the Senate  Judiciary Committee at that time on a bipartisan basis but,  unfortunately, never received a floor vote in this Senate.   But now that we have this vote scheduled, I hope that my colleagues  will join me in voting to confirm Judge Koh on a strong bipartisan vote  once again. I know the people of California, the Ninth Circuit, and the  country at large will benefit from her dedication, her integrity, and  compassion as a circuit court judge.   In many ways, the story that Judge Koh brings to the bench is the  epitome of the American Dream. The daughter of Korean immigrants who  fled communism and dictatorship in search of a better life, Judge Koh  was born in Washington, DC, and raised in Vicksburg, MI. And growing  up, Judge Koh  [[Page S9115]]  studied at public schools and was no stranger to poverty and  discrimination.   She spent weekends and summers working in her father's small  business, and she was surrounded by the love and lessons of her  immigrant family. Now, these experiences all helped to shape the unique  and needed perspectives that she now brings as a Federal judge. If  confirmed, Judge Koh will become the first Korean-American woman to  serve on a Federal circuit court.   Now, as the first Latino to represent California here in this Senate,  I know the importance of diversity at all levels of government, and  that includes the judiciary. Our country is stronger and fairer when we  are guided by the voices and experiences of all of our people. And we  still have a lot of work to remake our justice system to better reflect  the country that it serves.   Based on Judge Koh's record, her skill, intellect, and respect for  the rule of law, her confirmation is a big step in helping us achieve  that goal.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm her to the Ninth  Circuit.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
