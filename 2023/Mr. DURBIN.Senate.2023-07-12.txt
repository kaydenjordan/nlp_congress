 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Tiffany Cartwright to the U.S. District Court for the Western District  of Washington.   Ms. Cartwright is an accomplished litigator who has dedicated her  career to protecting the civil rights of all Americans. She received  her Bachelor's degree from Stanford University and her law degree from  Stanford Law School.   Ms. Cartwright began her legal career as a law clerk--first with  Justice Dana Fabe on the Alaska Supreme Court, and then with Judge  Betty Fletcher on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Most  recently, she has worked as a trial lawyer at MacDonald Hoague &  Bayless, where she has handled a number of cases on issues ranging from  employee discrimination to voting rights.   In addition to her litigation practice, since 2016, Ms. Cartwright  has served on the Local Rules Committee of the Federal Bar Association  of the Western District of Washington, a role in which she has gained  significant expertise in the District's rules and practices.   The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Ms. Cartwright  ``Qualified,'' and she has the strong support of Senators Murray and  Cantwell.   Given her considerable trial experience and deep knowledge of the  Western District, Ms. Cartwright will be an excellent addition to the  federal bench.   I strongly support her nomination and urge my colleagues to join me  in voting for her confirmation.    I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fetterman), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Vermont (Mr. Welch) are necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 47, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 180 Ex.]                                  YEAS--50       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Graham      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--47       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Budd      Capito      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Mullin      Murkowski      Paul      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Vance      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--3       Fetterman      Sanders      Welch   The nomination was confirmed.

I went there in a bipartisan delegation to  be present for the NATO summit. It was a historic meeting. President  Biden was there and the leaders of many countries from around the  world--not just the NATO allies but, for instance, the President of the  Republic of South Korea and the Prime Minister from Australia. What  brought them all together was a historic event.   The NATO alliance, which has been in existence for over 70 years, was  created after World War II to bring peace  [[Page S2342]]  to at least the European and American region of the world. It has been  successful because we gathered nations--now 31--together in common  purpose to fight off anyone who would attack us, to let those who are  thinking of attacking us know the heavy price they would pay.   So the message from Vilnius, Lithuania, to Vladimir Putin this week  is not a good one for him. The message is that the NATO alliance is  bigger, stronger, and more unified than it ever has been in history. In  a way, it is kind of a surprise. It wasn't that long ago that the  previous President, Donald Trump, raised enough questions among leaders  in the world that they wondered if there would be a NATO. Trump, of  course, was a close friend--I still can't understand why--of Vladimir  Putin's, often finding him so admirable and praising him for his crazy  politics. Yet, when it came to the NATO alliance, President Trump was  very critical--to the point where, when Joseph Biden became President  of the United States and started meeting with world leaders, the first  question they asked was, well, what is the position of the United  States when it comes to this common security alliance? Biden assured  them that it was strong and would continue to be, and he has proven it.   What happened in Lithuania at the NATO summit this week is a tribute  to leadership by many people, not the least of whom is our President.  He came together and understood that we are stronger when we stand  together, and we saw it in Vilnius. The situation that we witnessed  yesterday was historic.   My mother was born in that little country of Lithuania many years ago  and immigrated to the United States at the age of 2. I have been back  many times. My first visit was in 1979 before I was elected to  Congress. I am glad I went. It was good for me to see what Lithuania  looked like in Soviet times and to see the sharp contrast today with  modern Lithuania.   It is just plain historic that a NATO summit would be held in that  same former Soviet socialist republic, this year, 2023. The summit was  hosted in Lithuania because of that country's extraordinary journey  from Soviet tyranny to a thriving democratic voice.   Knowing Putin's tyranny all too well, Lithuania has been an outspoken  supporter of Ukraine despite the invasion by Putin, as well as a  supporter of the exiled voices from Belarus and Russia and has stood  firm against Chinese economic bullying resulting from growing trade  with Taiwan.   It brought back to mind what I witnessed over the years. That former  Soviet socialist republic was literally the first republic to step  forward and say: We are breaking with Moscow. We want our own  independence.   They paid a heavy price: pressure, killing, invasion--all of the  things which Gorbachev and Soviet leaders could conjure up to try to  stop this little country from succeeding. But they failed. Lithuania is  a proud nation now, and I am glad it hosted this NATO summit.   We saw at the summit an amazing array of international leaders,  including Asian allies like Australia and South Korea as well as our  own President and Secretary of State Tony Blinken. What struck me was  the sustained resolve and common purpose in defeating Russia in their  war with Ukraine. Our NATO allies, many former captives of the Soviet  Union themselves, have enduring memories of war and are determined to  not allow Russia's imperial actions of today.   I want to recognize President Joe Biden's clear-eyed vision and  leadership in galvanizing and reinvigorating the critical NATO alliance  and its support for Ukraine.   The chairs of our journey, the NATO observers from the Senate, were  Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. They  did an admirable job, and I was glad to be part of their effort.   We must never forget that NATO was born from the ashes of two  horrific wars in Europe, with many newer members eventually joining  after decades of Soviet oppression.   Despite Putin's warped paranoia to the contrary, NATO is not a threat  to Russia, but it will defend every inch of member territory from  Russia or any other such attack. The alliance is still growing, with  this summit's newest member, Finland, and now Sweden on the way.   Putin's colossal strategic blunder in Ukraine has cost the lives of  more than 100,000 Russian soldiers, and it lowered Russia's standing in  the world. Much to his disappointment, Putin's senseless invasion in  fact strengthened and expanded the NATO alliance, including along  hundreds of miles of Russian border.   There were a few other key summit outcomes--notably, further security  guarantees to Ukraine and an easier pathway for Ukraine to ultimately  be part of NATO, which I hope it will be.   I believe Ukraine's future rests ultimately within NATO, and, until  then, the United States and our allies must continue to support its  defense against Russian aggression.   I think Lithuanian President Nauseda argued this well--that the  Europeans understand that Ukraine's fight is their fight. That also is  my feeling and of most of us here in the Senate of both political  parties. Ukraine's fight for democracy and sovereignty is our fight  too.   In Vilnius we also met with Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana  Tsikhanouskaya. Her husband Sergei was jailed after trying to run in an  election against Belarusian strongman Alyaksandr Lukashenka, the last  dictator in Europe. So she ran in his place, and probably won. But with  Lukashenka refusing to honor the election results, she tragically had  to flee to neighboring Lithuania.   Her country has become a puppet state of Putin, even allowing Russia  to move nuclear weapons into its territory. Countless Belarusians have  been jailed for demanding basic freedoms, and yet she and so many  others heroically continue their struggle, including some who were  fighting to help Ukraine.   This poster shows two jailed Belarusian journalists who worked for  Radio Free Europe, which is doing heroic quality journalism in the  region: Andrey Kuznechyk and Ihar Losik. Both were jailed by Lukashenka  for simply being reporters. They and all the country's political  prisoners should be released, period.   I also hope the administration will soon announce a new special envoy  for Belarus, and I plan to work with my Senate colleagues to update and  strengthen the Belarus Democracy Act.   I want to close with a message to Vladimir Putin from the summit. The  NATO alliance is stronger than ever, and we are united in our  determination to stop your ruthless invasion of Ukraine.    Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Myong Jin Joun to the U.S. District Court for the District of  Massachusetts.   Judge Joun is a long-serving State court judge with extensive  experience as a litigator. And with his confirmation, this Senate will  take another important step forward in building a Federal judiciary  that reflects the personal and professional diversity of America and  the legal profession.   Born in South Korea, Judge Joun received his J.D. from Suffolk  University Law School in 1999. Prior to law school, he served for 6  years in the U.S. Army Massachusetts National Guard as an E-4  specialist. He even served throughout his undergraduate studies at the  University of Massachusetts, where he earned a B.A. and graduated magna  cum laude. After earning his law degree, Judge Joun began his legal  career at a civil rights law firm, where he worked for 6 years before  starting his own firm in 2007. During his 15 years in practice, Judge  Joun tried approximately 20 cases to verdict, including 17 jury trials.  In 2014, Judge Joun was appointed as associate justice of the Boston  Municipal Court. Over the past 8 years, he has presided over  approximately 140 trials, including 98 jury trials, for both criminal  and civil matters. Importantly, if confirmed, Judge Joun would make  history as the first Asian-American man and first Korean American to  serve on the District Court for the District of Massachusetts.   With his extensive trial experience on and off the bench, Judge Joun  will make an excellent addition to the district court. He enjoys the  strong support of Senators Warren and Markey. And the American Bar  Association has unanimously rated him ``well qualified'' to serve on  the District of Massachusetts.   I support this outstanding nominee, and I urge my colleagues to join  me in doing so.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Welch) are necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 46, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 182 Ex.]                                  YEAS--52       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Fetterman      Gillibrand      Graham      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--46       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Budd      Capito      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Mullin      Paul      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Vance      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--2       Sanders      Welch           The nomination was confirmed.   (Mr. MURPHY assumed the Chair.)    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study       Abroad Program Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) To prepare students for success in the modern global       economy, opportunities for study abroad should be included as       part of a well-rounded education.        (2) Study abroad programs provide students with       unparalleled access to international knowledge, an unmatched       opportunity to learn world languages, and a unique       environment for developing cultural understanding, all of       which are knowledge and skills needed in today's global       economy.        (3) Only 10 percent of United States college students study       abroad before they graduate, leaving 90 percent of graduates       entering the workforce without the global skills, knowledge,       and experiences afforded by study abroad programs that will       position them for success in the global economy. Minority       students, first-generation college students, community       college students, and students with disabilities are also       significantly underrepresented in study abroad participation.        (4) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission       on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program       (referred to in this section as the ``Lincoln Commission'')       under section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations and       Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199).       Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted a       report to Congress and to the President containing its       recommendations for greatly expanding the opportunity for       students at institutions of higher education in the United       States to study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in       developing nations.        (5) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[e]xperience       shows that leadership from administrators and faculty will       drive the number of study abroad participants higher and       improve the quality of programs. Such leadership is the only       way that study abroad will become an integral part of the       undergraduate experience.'' A competitive grant program is       necessary to encourage and support such leadership.        (6) Student health, safety, and security while studying       abroad is, and must continue to be, a priority for       institutions of higher education and study abroad programs.        (7) The COVID-19 pandemic prevented students from       participating in study abroad due to travel restrictions and       reduced budgets. According to Open Doors 2022, published by       the Institute of International Education in partnership with       the Department of State, study abroad participation at       colleges and universities in the United States plummeted by       91 percent during the 2020-2021 academic year. In the post-      pandemic world, increasing access to study abroad for       students at institutions of higher education across the       United States is critical to ensuring that those students       gain the skills, knowledge, and experiences necessary to       maintain the leadership of the United States in tackling       global challenges, such as pandemics, and succeeding in a       global economy.       SEC. 3. PURPOSES.         The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to ensure that significantly more students have access       to quality study abroad opportunities, especially among low-      income students and students of color;        (2) to ensure that the diversity of students studying       abroad reflects the diversity of students and institutions of       higher education in the United States;        (3) to encourage greater diversity in study abroad       destinations by increasing the portion of study abroad that       takes place in nontraditional study abroad destinations,       especially in developing countries; and        (4) to encourage a greater commitment by United States       institutions of higher education to expand study abroad       opportunities.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to permit  removal of trees around electrical lines on National Forest System land  without conducting a timber sale, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study       Abroad Program Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) To prepare students for success in the modern global       economy, opportunities for study abroad should be included as       part of a well-rounded education.        (2) Study abroad programs provide students with       unparalleled access to international knowledge, an unmatched       opportunity to learn world languages, and a unique       environment for developing cultural understanding, all of       which are knowledge and skills needed in today's global       economy.        (3) Only 10 percent of United States college students study       abroad before they graduate, leaving 90 percent of graduates       entering the workforce without the global skills, knowledge,       and experiences afforded by study abroad programs that will       position them for success in the global economy. Minority       students, first-generation college students, community       college students, and students with disabilities are also       significantly underrepresented in study abroad participation.        (4) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission       on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program       (referred to in this section as the ``Lincoln Commission'')       under section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations and       Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199).       Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted a       report to Congress and to the President containing its       recommendations for greatly expanding the opportunity for       students at institutions of higher education in the United       States to study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in       developing nations.        (5) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[e]xperience       shows that leadership from administrators and faculty will       drive the number of study abroad participants higher and       improve the quality of programs. Such leadership is the only       way that study abroad will become an integral part of the       undergraduate experience.'' A competitive grant program is       necessary to encourage and support such leadership.        (6) Student health, safety, and security while studying       abroad is, and must continue to be, a priority for       institutions of higher education and study abroad programs.        (7) The COVID-19 pandemic prevented students from       participating in study abroad due to travel restrictions and       reduced budgets. According to Open Doors 2022, published by       the Institute of International Education in partnership with       the Department of State, study abroad participation at       colleges and universities in the United States plummeted by       91 percent during the 2020-2021 academic year. In the post-      pandemic world, increasing access to study abroad for       students at institutions of higher education across the       United States is critical to ensuring that those students       gain the skills, knowledge, and experiences necessary to       maintain the leadership of the United States in tackling       global challenges, such as pandemics, and succeeding in a       global economy.       SEC. 3. PURPOSES.         The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to ensure that significantly more students have access       to quality study abroad opportunities, especially among low-      income students and students of color;        (2) to ensure that the diversity of students studying       abroad reflects the diversity of students and institutions of       higher education in the United States;        (3) to encourage greater diversity in study abroad       destinations by increasing the portion of study abroad that       takes place in nontraditional study abroad destinations,       especially in developing countries; and        (4) to encourage a greater commitment by United States       institutions of higher education to expand study abroad       opportunities.
