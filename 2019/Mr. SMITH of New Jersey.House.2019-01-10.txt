 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McCaul for yielding  and for his very strong support of this legislation. And Eliot Engel,  the new chairman, I thank him as well. I thank Brad Schneider for being  the original Democratic cosponsor.   This is a bipartisan bill. In the last Congress, we had 86  cosponsors. Even in this Congress, we already have gotten up to 80  cosponsors. It shows that we can reach across the aisle and fight this  pernicious evil called anti-Semitism.   In 2004, Mr. Speaker, I authored the provisions of law that created  and required this position and the office it leads at the State  Department. H.R. 221 upgrades and strengthens the position to better  anticipate, prevent, mitigate, and respond to threats against Jewish  communities worldwide.   H.R. 221 elevates the Special Envoy to the rank of Ambassador,  reporting directly to the Secretary of State. This would enable  sufficient seniority and access inside the U.S. Government and when  engaging foreign governments.   The bill requires the President to nominate a candidate no later than  90 days--and all the Presidents from Bush to Obama, and now, sadly,  under President Trump, have been very late in coming forward with that  nominee. There was a nominee for the Special Envoy, but because of  illness or a health crisis, that person was not named. But we--all of  us--have asked the President to name that person and to do so  immediately.   This bill requires, as I said, to do it no later than 90 days after  the bill becomes law and no later than 120 days thereafter whenever  that position is empty.   H.R. 221 prohibits double-hatting of the Special Envoy with duties  irrelevant to combating anti-Semitism. The legislation also mandates  the Special Envoy to be the primary adviser to the U.S. Government on  monitoring and combating anti-Semitism.   Far too often, Mr. Speaker, over the decades, the U.S. Government has  put combating anti-Semitism, human trafficking, and religious freedom  violations in the back seat of our foreign policy. That is why Congress  has created offices and positions to ensure the United States was  focused on fighting these evils.   Over the past decades, there has been an unprecedented rise in anti- Semitic acts and rhetoric all over the world: Jews harassed, assaulted,  and even murdered; synagogues attacked; graves and cemeteries  desecrated; anti-Semitic slurs; plus targeting the State of Israel  itself with the three Ds--demonization, double-standard, and  delegitimization, as my good friend, the great Soviet Jewish refusenik  and religious prisoner Natan Sharansky named them. The so-called BDS  movement to boycott, divest from, and sanction Israel is one of the  most pernicious examples of what Sharansky called the new anti- Semitism.   Anti-Semitic hatred is hardwired into the ideology of violent  Islamist  [[Page H436]]  and White supremacist groups, but the evil goes beyond those  perpetrators.                                time  1530    Politicians, entertainers, and public intellectuals across the  philosophical spectrum have exhibited anti-Semitism. Strong American  leadership, therefore, is essential to battle this bigotry.   Combating anti-Semitism, as I said earlier, has always been a  bipartisan effort. This bill did pass the last Congress 393-2. The text  before us in the legislation is identical. I hope we have very strong  support for it and the Senate, hopefully, will take it up, consider it,  pass it, and get it to the President.
