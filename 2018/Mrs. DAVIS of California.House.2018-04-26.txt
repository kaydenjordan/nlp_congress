 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the committee  for including amendment No. 111 in this en bloc.   After the tragic fires that we have seen in California, we must do  everything possibly to protect our communities. In San Diego,  helicopters and air tankers had to be grounded during fire fights after  recreational drones were spotted in the area. These drones can pose a  risk to aircraft and emergency personnel flying overhead. That is why  my amendment would protect emergency response efforts from  interruptions by drones and direct the FAA to work with local agencies  to inform the public about this issue.   I want to thank, again, the committee for their tireless work on this  bill.
