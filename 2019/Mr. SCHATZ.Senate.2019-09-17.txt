 Madam President, I want to recognize my friend and  colleague Senator Murphy for his moral leadership on this issue and for  continuously demanding that all of us do better and that all of us do  more to address what is an epidemic of gun violence.   We are here tonight and through the night to call on Leader McConnell  to do a very simple thing, which is to bring background check  legislation and other gun safety legislation to the Senate floor for a  vote.   Forty thousand Americans had their lives cut short by guns last year.  Forty  [[Page S5531]]  thousand Americans died. It is unthinkable that we would allow mass  violence to occur in our country with this type of frequency. What is  shocking is that not only do we accept this as part of the American way  of life--as though it were enshrined in the Constitution that we must  have this amount of violence in order to have our Second Amendment  rights--but that we allowed the question of what to do to keep our  people safe to turn into a partisan question. The Democrats are out  here on the floor saying: Why don't we figure out what we can do to  make people safer? And on the other side of the Chamber, there is no  one.   This isn't the first time this has happened or the second time or the  third time or the fifth time. When we come down to the floor to demand  action on gun safety, we have no dance partner.   It shouldn't be this way, especially given where the public is.   I don't just mean Democrats or Independents. Americans of all  stripes, Democratic and Republican gun owners, agree that commonsense  gun safety reforms are the way forward. This means background checks.  It means no guns for violent criminals or domestic abusers and no guns  for anyone who could endanger themselves or endanger others.   About 90 percent of all Americans support these very sensible  reforms. Here is the thing. They support them not for purely  ideological reasons or partisan reasons; the reason these things pull  85, 90 percent of all Americans, even among NRA members, is because, A,  it doesn't infringe on your Second Amendment rights, and, B, it works.   It is no coincidence that the two steepest drops in murder rates in  our country came right after the passage of two sets of significant gun  laws: The first were the national firearms control acts of 1934 and  1938, and the second were the background checks and assault weapons ban  bills in 1993 and 1994. Those legislative efforts, and the decrease in  violence that followed their passage, prove that progress is possible.   Here is the thing. Whenever we get into this conversation, we get  into kind of trying to figure out whether whatever law we are trying to  pass would retroactively be able to fix whichever moment of silence we  are now focused on and sad about and despairing about. That is not the  way to look at this.   Sure, there are individual situations, where, if we pass background  checks, it would absolutely help, but it is also a matter of the  Federal Government putting some parameters on the kinds of guns that  you can get and the requirements in order to own a gun.   What is happening? Why are we still stuck? Why are we still stuck?  Republicans in the Senate are just waiting on the White House. It is as  simple as that.   This isn't some partisan attack from me, a partisan Democrat. This is  literally what Leader McConnell said. He said he will not schedule a  vote or schedule a debate on the House-passed bill to expand background  checks for gun purchases because President Trump has indicated he will  not sign it. According to Leader McConnell: ``[I]f the President took a  position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law  and not having serial votes, [he would] be happy to put it on the  floor.''   Let me just say, that is not actually how the Senate is supposed  operate. We are supposed to originate the legislation. We are supposed  to be the world's greatest deliberative body. We are supposed to  determine what kind of law to make. We are not supposed to play  ``Mother, may I'' with the President of the United States and wait for  clearance before we even initiate a debate.   The idea that, in this body, where today we voted on the UAE  Ambassador, the Ambassador to Sweden, I think--not that those are  unimportant matters--but we had full postcloture debate time when,  basically, we were in a quorum call--we were in a quorum call; no one  was talking--we cannot afford to set aside 30 hours or 50 hours or 2  weeks of Senate time to figure out what to do about the gun violence  epidemic? Shame on us.   Congress should be taking up bills, debating them, passing them, and  the President can make his decision about whether to sign or veto them.  We cannot wait for President Trump on this because he is deeply, deeply  inconsistent, not just generally speaking but specifically on the  question of gun safety.   In the immediate aftermath of every horrific shooting, the President  talked about doing something meaningful to address gun violence, but  then he backtracked.   In February of 2018, in the wake of the horrific shooting at  Parkland, President Trump said: ``[W]e're going to be very strong on  background checks.'' A year later and 2 days before the House passed  legislation that would require universal background checks for most gun  purchases and transfers, Trump threatened to veto the bill if it  passed.   In February of 2018, during a televised meeting with lawmakers, the  President proposed raising the age for buying assault rifles from 18 to  21, and then he backtracked.   More recently, following the shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 29  dead and dozens wounded, Trump tweeted on August 5 that Washington  ``must come together'' to ``get strong background checks.'' That sounds  pretty good.   On August 19, just 14 days later, he reversed course. When talking  with reporters, he used an NRA-approved talking point: ``[J]ust  remember, we already have a lot of background checks,'' and he warned  of gun control's ``slippery slope.''   The President has a long history of changing his position on guns. In  2011, he was against gun control. In 2013, he supported background  checks. A year after that, he protested against background checks for  gun purchases in New York State. This is just how he rolls,  specifically, on this issue but frankly on a lot of stuff. You could  say the same thing about having an honest broker as it relates to  immigration. He is just not reliable. That is how he rolls.   We don't have to be downstream from all of that. We are the article I  branch. We can do what we decide to do as the so-called world's  greatest deliberative body.   To make it worse, in the weeks since the attacks in Ohio and Texas,  we keep hearing from Republicans that gun violence is not caused by  guns. To quote the President directly: ``[M]ental illness and hatred  pulls the trigger, not the gun.''   ``[M]ental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun.'' I  want to spend a little time on this one because this one is really  offensive and really deeply hurtful. Setting aside the lack of progress  on guns, we are also losing 10, 20, 30 years of progress we have made  destigmatizing mental health services.   Mass shooters and regular people experience mental illness at the  same rate. There is no indication that mass shooters or individual  people who are homicidal experience mental illness at any higher rate  than your general population. Blaming the mentally ill is just  factually untrue, but it is more insidious than that.   About 20 percent of all Americans at some point need some mental  health services. The great difficulty in terms of getting mental health  services is not just the availability of care; it is also that people  still feel embarrassed to say: I need some help.   Shame on the President of the United States to equate someone who may  need care for postpartum depression or post-traumatic stress coming  back from Iraq or Afghanistan, or who may experience bipolar disorder,  or whatever it may be--a kid with autism--to imply that people who need  mental health services are somehow dangerous and that they are the ones  who should be cracked down on. That is a deeply, deeply dangerous thing  to say about 20 percent of all Americans who simply need to get better  and who simply need to not be characterized as crazy or dangerous or  that they should be ashamed of what they are experiencing. Shame on the  President of the United States for equating mental illness with being  dangerous to society.   Consider for a minute the progress we have made as a society to  destigmatize mental health. We have fundamentally changed the way we  talk about it, and because of that, we have helped to reduce the shame  around living with mental health challenges, and more people are  willing to prioritize their mental well-being. People should not be  embarrassed or scared to seek the help they need, and  [[Page S5532]]  they certainly shouldn't be blamed for the gun violence epidemic in our  country.   I want to read a letter from a Hawaii resident, Elizabeth Sader from  Lahaina, Maui. She writes:         Two mass shootings in 24 hours. This cannot be our new       norm. We need change. . . . We can no longer assume heading       to the store, an event, or school is safe anymore.        There are places in the United States that make it easier       to get a gun than it is to adopt a pet at a local animal       shelter. This is not right.        We need sensible gun laws in this country. We need better       systems in place to prevent this from happening again. I       cannot imagine what the world is going to look like for       children growing up today.    The Senate has the power to save lives and protect more of our kids  by enacting sensible reforms. What we need is for Republicans to do the  right thing and to rise to the moment. Thousands of people are dying  every month. We cannot wait for the President.   I yield the floor.
