 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 290) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for  greater transparency and efficiency in the procedures followed by the  Federal Communications Commission, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 290         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am pleased to support H.R. 290, a bill to reform the FCC, sponsored  by the chair of the full Committee on Energy and Commerce.   Mr. Speaker, this bill has a unique history. It has been passed out  of the House not once or twice, but four times already in the last  three Congresses. The last three times this bill has come to the floor,  it has passed on suspension with full bipartisan support. That support  speaks to the deep necessity for fundamental reform of the Federal  Communications Commission.   As Members of Congress, we hear from constituents whose applications  at the FCC are left to languish unresolved while consumers and  businesses let opportunities slip by because they haven't received  approval yet from a Federal Government agency. It is even worse when  the FCC, under its public interest mandate, decides to put its  [[Page H575]]  thumb on the scale in favor of one technology sector or another, often  without providing reasonable evidence that its intervention is  necessary and appropriate.   While I have faith that Chairman Pai will bring about real reform at  the FCC, without legislative changes, I am afraid that this type of  jury-rigged rulemaking will return under a future administration. That  is why I have supported this bill each time it has made its way through  our committee and each time it has come to the House floor. I believe  that strong process can restore the agency's integrity and rein it back  in the interest of the stakeholders and the society that it should  serve.   The bill requires the FCC to conduct a notice and comment rulemaking  in order to adopt clear rules to guide its own process. By giving the  FCC flexibility when setting procedures and deadlines, we are not  hamstringing the agency; rather, we are providing them with goals to  meet and allowing them to determine the best way to meet those goals.   We are asking the FCC to consider and adopt rules for itself that  would provide clear deadlines on starting and stopping comments, clear  deadlines for resolving petitions filed by the public, clear notice of  status to those affected by petitions and rules, and clear schedules of  statistical reports.   The bill also requires the FCC to consider publication of Commission  documents to be considered at an open meeting and to consider whether  cost-benefit analysis just might improve their rulemakings. This  legislation also changes the existing Sunshine Act to allow for greater  collaboration between Commissioners.   There was fine bipartisan work that went into these bills, and I  thank my Democratic colleagues for working with us to improve the  agency.   This country is blessed with the most creative and competitive  technology industry in the world. The agency charged with overseeing  this robust and dynamic sector should be open and transparent and  foster continued growth, and I believe this bill will help in achieving  that goal.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the author of the  legislation and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 423) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to expand and  clarify the prohibition on provision of misleading or inaccurate caller  identification information, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(e) Commission Defined.--In this section, the term       ``Commission'' means the Federal Communications Commission.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 423, the Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017. Today  we are considering a very worthy piece of legislation, which has been  introduced in each of the last two Congresses by Vice Chairman Barton,  Vice Chairman Lance, and Representative Meng. All of them have put a  lot of hard work into this bill, and I thank each of them for their  dedication in pursuing a much-needed update to the Truth In Caller ID  Act.   Spoofing is the act of altering the number that will appear on the  receiving end of the caller ID. It is a trick that has been around for  more than a decade. Spoofing provides a false identity to bad actors  and criminals who seek to harass and defraud our hardworking taxpayers,  oftentimes through various scams.   Sometimes the scams are elaborate, and other times they are simple.  But these schemes are all petty; and once carried out, they are  criminal. Spoofing lets the bad guys disguise their identity and will  often pose as official entities, such as credit card companies,  hospitals, and government agencies to target their unsuspecting  victims. These crooks regularly target seniors and use intimidation  tactics to extract personal and financial information.   The FCC has the authority to levy penalties and criminal fines  against individuals that use fake caller ID information for the purpose  of defrauding or harming another. However, current law only covers  traditional voice calls. While this was considered a good fix when it  was enacted in 2009, the Truth in Caller ID Act no longer sufficiently  protects consumers. New communication methods and an evolving consumer  trend towards text messaging have left the law with significant holes  for the fraudsters to fly through and avoid prosecution.   H.R. 423 would extend and clarify provisions of the Truth in Caller  ID Act to include text messages and Voice over Internet Protocol  services and would also apply the penalties to violators outside of the  United States.   The bill would also seek to make it more challenging for those using  fake caller ID information. In the past, you needed to have advanced  skills and expensive equipment in order to spoof. Nowadays, it isn't  hard. All someone needs to have is a smartphone and access to any of  the various apps on the market that can instantly generate a fake  caller ID.   This is another classic case where technology has outpaced the laws  that govern it. We will never be able to legislate ahead of technology  advancement, nor should we try to do so. But when we find areas where  legislation can help shield our consumers and hold the bad guys  accountable, it is incumbent on us to act.   I believe that the legislation we are considering today is a good  next step in our pursuit of stronger protection for our consumers. This  bill will not prevent spoofing and it will not make our constituents  invincible from the related scams and harassment, but what this bill  does is important. By updating the law to more accurately reflect  today's environment, we will be equipped to hold violators subject to  the penalty of law.   I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the committee  report for this legislation from the last Congress.                    H.R. 423, Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017                     background and need for legislation         Spoofing is a practice in which a phone number shown on a       phone or caller identification device is deliberately       falsified, often to portray an official entity such as a       government agency or credit card company, typically with       malicious intent. Spoofing is a commonly used tool for a       number of illegal practices, including phishing for personal       information and swatting--calling in a fictitious crime in       progress in order to generate a police response. The original       Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 prohibits spoofing voice       caller identification. However, as communications methods and       consumer habits continue to evolve, so too do the attempts by       third parties to fraudulently gain personal information for       criminal use. Many Americans are now relying on text       messaging to stay connected, and this method of communication       has become a target for spoofing in much the same way voice       calls have been.        H.R. 423 extends the provisions of the Truth in Caller ID       Act to include text messaging as well as Voice over Internet       Protocol services. The legislation, introduced by Rep.       Barton, Rep. Lance, and Rep. Meng, also addresses the growth       of services that allow users to knowingly transmit misleading       or inaccurate caller identification information by adding a       definition of ``spoofing service'' to the Truth in Caller ID       Act.        In amending H.R. 423, the Committee significantly changed       the definitions of ``text message'' and ``text messaging       service.'' The changes are designed to exclude from these       definitions those online messaging services that use       traditional telephone numbers for the purpose of identifying       a user's account, just as other online services may use an       email address or username for a similar purpose. The excluded       services do not use telephone numbers to interconnect with       the public switched telephone network or enable communication       with individuals who do not subscribe to the same messaging       service. The Committee intends the Commission to devise its       rules using the meanings set forth in the legislation.       ``Short message service'' and ``multimedia message service''       should be narrowly interpreted consistent with current       industry standards (see, e.g., ETSI, Technical Specification,       3GPP TS 23.040 version 12.2.0 Release 12, ETSI TS 123 040       v12.2.0 (Oct. 2014), available at www.etsi.org).        The Committee takes notice of the fact that the language       set forth in the version of H.R. 423, as ordered reported, is       identical to the text relating to the same subject contained       in S. 253, the Communications Act Update Act of 2016, as       passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, on September 27,       2016. The House passed S. 253, as amended, by unanimous       consent. The foregoing discussion should therefore serve as       an explanation of that bill's provisions for purposes of       legislative history.                section-by-section analysis of the legislation         Section 1. Short title        This section provides that the Act may be cited as the       ``Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017''.        Section 2. Spoofing prevention  [[Page H578]]         This section amends the Communications Act to expand the       Truth in Caller Act to include text messaging services, as       well as communications from outside of the United States.       This section defines the terms ``text message,'' ``text       messaging service,'' and ``voice service.''        This section also requires the Commission, in coordination       with the Federal Trade Commission, to develop consumer       education materials regarding caller ID scams and       technologies that can help consumers protect themselves       against fraudulent activity.        This section also requires a Government Accountability       Office report on the actions taken by the Federal       Communications Commission and FTC to combat caller ID fraud.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), a new member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   When disaster strikes, there is a lot of hard work to be done, and  every second counts. First responders go into action for those that  need help. Relief organizations and volunteers rush in to begin the  process of cleaning up. Utilities and service providers must be on the  ground repairing damaged infrastructure.   All of these mission-critical tasks require a functioning  communications network. People turn to the network for potentially  lifesaving information and rely on its functionality to reach emergency  services.   We are here today to consider this bill. Representative Pallone--I  want to give some credit to him--has been a champion of following the  eye-opening effects of Superstorm Sandy. He has worked tirelessly on  this legislation since October 2012.   In total, the Sandy storm resulted in roughly $74 billion in damages  in the U.S. alone. Sometimes we forget the magnitude of that storm.  Damage to power and communications infrastructure, it knocked out about  25 percent of the cell sites in its path. In some of the hardest-hit  counties, 50 percent of those sites were down.   When the networks go down, public safety communications and emergency  response services are threatened. In order for the networks to get back  up and running, telecommunications providers need access to critical  resources and permission to enter the disaster area.  [[Page H580]]    The chaos immediately following a major disaster makes it challenging  to obtain resources and entry to the affected area. What we saw after  Sandy were communication providers being turned away from the disaster  area and denied resources because they were not considered essential to  the recovery effort. This bill seeks to change that.   In the wake of Sandy, and as a result of repair workers being barred  from the recovery effort, communication networks remained offline for  hours and, in some cases, days longer than need be. This left those who  were still vulnerable in the disaster area without critical information  and no means to call for help.   There are numerous entities that are essential for the rescue and  recovery phase following a disaster. The affected area needs power.  Water is critical. The bill would clarify that communications networks  are also an essential service.   Whether it be wireline, mobile telephone, Internet, radio or  television, communication services play a key role in facilitating  recovery. In some cases it can be the difference between life and  death. By defining these types of providers as essential,  telecommunication companies will be granted the access and resources  needed to get their networks back online.   The bill would also require the FCC to conduct a study on the  feasibility and benefits of making WiFi access points available to the  general public to access 911 services during times of emergency.   I would also like to recognize that the original version of this bill  included a number of wireless provisions designed to increase  preparedness. These provisions were removed, however, because the five  largest wireless carriers voluntarily adopted these provisions.   H.R. 588, in its current form, combined with the voluntary framework  established by the wireless carriers, leaves us with a strong,  bipartisan bill that will improve the resiliency of our Nation's  communications infrastructure to avoid a recurrence of the widespread  and extended service outages, as experienced in the aftermath of  Superstorm Sandy.    I thank our colleagues from the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure for working with us on this bill, and I urge the support  of my colleagues for the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Mr. Pallone for his  diligence in solving this problem not only for his constituents there  in New Jersey after Superstorm Sandy, but many of my family were down  in south Mississippi and we know what happened in Katrina with those in  the Gulf region around New Orleans and over in south Mississippi and  the loss of communications that were there.    This week we are seeing it in Mr. Carter's district in Georgia,  again, the impact that a storm has when people cannot reach their loved  ones and when they cannot get in contact to let people know the  services that they needed or the injury that they are experiencing. So  we are fortunate to be able to bring this bill forward. We extend our  condolences and concerns to Mr. Carter for what is going on in his  district.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter) to speak on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.   I yield back the balance of my time.
