 Madam Speaker, this month is National Adoption  Month. As the proud dad of six and a foster parent, adoption is  personal to me.   On April 5 of this year, my wife, Kelly, and I were blessed to adopt  our two foster kids and our two youngest daughters, Jayna and Aliya.  These two sweet sisters complete our family and bring us so much joy  together.   The journey of adopting opened my eyes to the challenges families  across America face through the adoption process. In honor of my  daughters and so many Iowa families in the same boat, we are fighting  to simplify the adoption process right here in America and make it  easier for every child to join their forever family.   That is why, in Congress, I have introduced the Fight for Families  Act to  [[Page H5999]]  make adoption more affordable for low- and middle-income families as  well as grandparents and seniors on fixed incomes.   Every child in America deserves a loving home, and this forever  opportunity I will fight for every day and refuse to let a D.C.  bureaucracy get in the way of that. I look forward to joining my  friends on both sides of the aisle to make this a reality.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I begin by thanking a fellow combat  veteran for leading this effort to hold the terrorist group Hamas  accountable by cutting off its number one funding source, that coming  from Iran. This extends to Hezbollah, it extends to the IRGC, and  it extends to Houthi rebels throughout the region.    In the last week alone, we have seen attack after attack threatening  American forces, including those of our friends still serving in  uniform today.   The effort that I am proud to co-lead with Congressman Pfluger  highlights revoking Iran's funding act, an effort that the  administration has taken a first step on--without a firm plan by  Congress to prevent this waiver from going forward--which has time and  time again been exploited by the President of Iran.   The $20 billion that came out of the Turk Bank, the funding,  illicitly, of money coming through on this side for frozen assets needs  to be stopped.   Congress must act. I applaud my friend for leading this charge, and I  am proud to cosponsor it going forward.   Mr. Chair, I urge the support of the entire body.
