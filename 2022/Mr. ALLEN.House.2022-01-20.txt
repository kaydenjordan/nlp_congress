 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for all  his great work on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 49th anniversary of the Supreme  Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, a devastating decision that we have  continued to remind you has killed 63 million children in this country.   Who do we trust on this issue? There it says: ``In God We Trust.'' So  if that is the case, this is what God said to Jeremiah in Jeremiah 1:5:  I knew you before I formed you in the womb. So what more evidence do we  need?   This shouldn't be a political debate, but now my Democratic friends  are taking it one step further by attempting to abolish the Hyde  amendment, which prevents taxpayer money from funding abortions. The  government should not be using hard-earned taxpayer money to kill  innocent children.   However, I am optimistic that the fight for life will take a step in  the right direction.   The Supreme Court is currently reviewing Dobbs v. Jackson Women's  Health Organization, a lawsuit challenging a Mississippi law that bans  abortion after 15 weeks.   I pray that the judges will rule in favor of life.   As the father of four and the grandfather of 14, I believe that life  is precious, and I will fight to protect that life.   I have taken an oath to fight for life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness, and so has every Member of this body.
