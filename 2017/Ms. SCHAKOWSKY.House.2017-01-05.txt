 Amendment XIV, section 1:   ``All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject  to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of  the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law  which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the  United States; . . .''    Mr. Speaker, I stand here as a proud Jew and someone  who, throughout my entire life, has been an advocate for the State of  Israel, and I am standing here to oppose H. Res. 11.   As a Member of Congress, I have been committed to maintaining  America's unwavering support for Israel, which has lasted from the very  first moments of Israel's existence.   The U.S.-Israel bond is unbreakable, despite the fact that the United  States' administrations have not always agreed with the particular  policies of an Israeli Government. Contrary to the assertions of H.  Res. 11, the U.S. has often expressed those differences in the context  of the United Nations. Presidents, from Lyndon Johnson to George W.  Bush, have each vetoed and sometimes voted for a U.N. resolution  contrary to the wishes of Israel's Government at the time. Only the  Obama administration, until 2 weeks ago, never, ever cast a vote  against what Israel wanted.   But opposition to the building of settlements on land belonging to  Palestinians before the 1967 war--with the exception of the land, of  course, that is going to be swapped, agreed to by both parties--has  been the official U.S. policy for many decades, contrary, again, to the  assertions of H. Res. 11.   It has also been the policy of the United States to recognize that  the only long-term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--the  violence, the loss of life--is to create two states: one for the  Palestinians and one for Israel. A two-state solution is the only way  Israel can continue as both a democratic and a Jewish state, living in  the peace and security that has eluded her from the very beginning. The  building of settlements is an obstacle to achieving that goal.   And, of course, settlements aren't the only obstacle to Israeli- Palestinian peace. The U.S. resolution reiterates the Palestinian  Authority security forces must continue to counter terrorism and  condemn all of the provocations.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.
