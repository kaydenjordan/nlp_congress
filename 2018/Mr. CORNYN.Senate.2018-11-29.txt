 Madam President, the clock is ticking and the days are  passing us by, but we know we have a deadline to meet on December 7,  and if we don't meet that deadline, then there will be a lot of lives  disrupted and a lot of people will say: There they go again. Congress  is unable to work together to try to solve problems, just creating more  distrust and undermining confidence in our ability to actually do our  job to govern.   What I want to talk about specifically is this fight over border  funding because that is what the deadline is on December 7. Our  Democratic friends have said: We are not going to fund President  Trump's wall. On the other hand, we see caravans of people coming from  Central America, coming through Mexico, closing down the ports of entry  at the San Ysidro bridge between Tijuana and San Diego. What I fear is,  we have made a parody out of what the problem is. We have thought about  the challenge of border security and immigration in too small a way and  not given the complete picture of what the challenges really are.   I just have to believe that if we were willing to acknowledge the  facts, that we would be more inclined to work together to solve the  problem, and I feel like we are looking at these problems like we are  looking through a soda straw.   I have heard people talk about the humanitarian crisis at the border  there at Tijuana caused by this huge caravan of Central Americans who  want to storm the barriers and enter the United States illegally, and  people question why would we stop them, why would they use nonlethal  means like tear gas and pepper spray like President Obama did during  his administration and which now Customs and Border Protection is doing  again in order to protect the sovereignty of our country and to protect  our borders from those who would enter it illegally.   So let's not look at this through a soda straw. Let's open up the  aperture and look at the larger problem because it is a very serious  problem, and it affects many lives, both here, in Mexico, and in  Central America.   Our Democratic colleagues have offered a lot of criticism of the  Trump administration when it comes to border security, but anytime you  ask them, well, what is your solution, what are you offering as an  alternative, it is crickets--complete silence. In other words, they are  not offering any constructive solutions, just criticism. Our  constituents deserve more than just for us to criticize one another.  They deserve our working together to try to come up with solutions.   This is a crisis that has arisen as a result of our inability to  acknowledge that this is a failure to enforce our immigration laws, a  failure to fix our broken immigration system, and a failure to secure  our borders.   Coming from Texas, representing 28 million constituents in a State  which has a 1,200-mile common border with Mexico, this affects my  constituents in my State directly. We are at ground zero, and I have  tried my best to get educated about the problem and potential  solutions. My trips to the border, talking to people in border  communities who live and work in those communities, talking to our  heroic Border Patrol agents, and visiting our ports of entry where  millions and even billions of dollars of commerce flow legally between  the United States and Mexico--that is important not only to our border  communities but to jobs in the United States.   The border communities that rely on the flow of legal commerce  through our ports know that without border security, legitimate trade  can easily be brought to a standstill. In fact, that is exactly what  has happened at San Ysidro, the port of entry between Tijuana and San  Diego. They had to shut down the port of entry. So people whose jobs  depend on those ports of entry and the trade and commerce that goes on  between our countries, they are the ones who are being hurt by the  uncontrolled disruption of legal immigration. Any disruption of  legitimate trade has an immediate impact on the businesses and the  employees and affects the livelihoods of our border residents.   An unsecured border creates avenues for the entry of drug cartels and  [[Page S7200]]  transnational criminal gangs to exploit because they are the same  people who are facilitating the passage of migrants from Central  America to our borders. Those are the same people who are transiting  the heroin, 90 percent of which comes from Mexico, which contributes to  our opioid crisis in the United States.   As I mentioned before, last year the Centers for Disease Control  estimates 72,000 Americans died of a drug overdose--about 50,000 of  those from some form of opioid, either prescription drug, synthetic  fentanyl, or heroin coming across the same borders these migrants are  attempting to storm across.   The people who are organizing that, as I said, are the same people.  They are the drug cartels that are getting rich because we have not  found a way to come together to fix our border, to reform our laws, and  come together to try to protect the people we represent in the  process. We know that the gangs, the cartels, and the transnational  criminal organizations are ever evolving. They are always adapting.  They spread terror, they prey on the weak, and they have taken control  of large swaths of Mexico and Central America. They are, as I have said  before, commodity-agnostic--they don't really care whether they are  trafficking children for sex or heroin that will cause an overdose in  the United States or a migrant who just wants a better life in the  United States, because they do want a better life. The same people  facilitate that for money.    On average, I have read that a migrant from Central America has to  pay about $8,000. You multiply that $8,000 times thousands and  thousands. Last year, in 2017, there were almost 400,000 migrants  detained at our southwestern border. Just multiply that number by  $8,000, and you get just a glimpse of what we are talking about in the  huge criminal enterprise. We are continuing to enrich these cartels and  transnational criminal organizations when we fail to do our job when it  comes to securing our border and fixing our broken immigration system.   This is more than just about whether President Trump gets his money  for the wall. As a matter of fact, many of our Democratic colleagues  voted in--I think it was 2006 for the Secure Fence Act, which called  for 700 miles of secure fencing along the southwestern border. So they  have already voted for tactical infrastructure that is part of the  piece of the puzzle of securing our border; yet they stand intransigent  against our effort to try to improve border security now even though  they have supported similar funding in the past.   As I said, we know that the cartels are very shrewd, adaptive, and  are always evolving. They know that if they can tie up the Border  Patrol with processing children and family units, those same Border  Patrol agents aren't available to stop the drugs that come across the  border. So it is a method of distracting the Border Patrol and law  enforcement in order to exploit that vulnerability for the purposes of  bringing those drugs into the United States.   When I want to learn more about what is happening at the border, I  talk to my constituents in the Customs and Border Protection business,  such as Chief Manny Padilla, who is the Chief of the Rio Grande Valley  Sector of the Border Patrol, and Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost.  Customs and Border Protection does all it can do with the tools  available to it to stop flows of illegal immigration and to stop  illegal contraband, including drugs, from making it across the border,  but they need our help. We basically have not given them the tools they  need in order to do the job we have asked them to do. Shame on us.   We know the cartels are cunning. I have seen produce that appears to  be watermelons or other vegetables that basically contain heroin or  fentanyl or some other illegal drug. The creativity of the cartels is  amazing. I have seen them put human beings, migrants, into the  upholstery of a seat in a car so they are obscured or pack them into a  truck or put them in an 18-wheeler--unfortunately sometimes leaving  them to die as a result of exposure to heat and other conditions. We  also know that these same organizations traffic women and children  through Central America and enslave them, essentially, here in the  United States. They traffic them for sex--again, to generate money  because that is all they care about.   The operations of these cartels are increasingly sophisticated, and  they are always diversifying their income streams to avoid detection  and defeat our efforts to stop it. They are strategic about when and  how they cross the border, and they have developed this strategy over  many years.   To put it simply, they are taking advantage of and exploiting our  inability to deal with our porous border, and a lot of innocent people  are getting hurt in the process.   Again, this is about more than just funding President Trump's border  wall; this is about our pulling back and looking at the complexity of  this problem and using our very best efforts in order to stop it. But  somehow it becomes trivialized over a fight over tactical  infrastructure that our Democratic colleagues have already voted for in  the past under the Secure Fence Act.   Well, the instability and violence created by the criminal  organizations in Central America and Mexico over the last few years are  part of the strategy. Violence, unfortunately, is at an alltime high in  Mexico. That is one of the reasons President Lopez Obrador was elected.  He said he wanted to decrease the violence in Mexico. I learned  recently that more people have died in Mexico since 2007 than have died  in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. It is terrible, and we  need to work together to try to stop it. We know that gangs control  much of El Salvador, and as a result, many Central Americans have their  lives and safety threatened daily. It is no wonder they try to flee.   But the United States cannot bear the burden of this crisis alone. I  believe the United States is the most generous country in the world  when it comes to legal immigration. We have always considered ourselves  a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws, and we see  what happens when the law is ignored and when Congress fails to fix the  problem to the best of our ability.   We have seen uncontrolled illegal immigration. We see thousands of  people banding together in caravans trying to storm our ports of entry  into the country, overrun our Customs and Border Protection personnel.  Until we deal with this problem, new caravans will continue to arrive  on a daily basis. In fact, they have. It is just now in the news  because it is so large. We have had literally many caravans show up on  a daily basis, but that doesn't make a lot of news. As I said, 400,000  people were detained on the southwestern border in 2017 alone.   What is frustrating is that the tools we need to address these  problems are at hand and available to us. We can begin to work together  to fight these gang cartels and organizations and secure our border by  partnering with the governments of Central America and Mexico because  our War on Drugs, our effort to provide safety and security to our  constituents, is part of their war too. It is a fact that border  security doesn't begin at our southern border; it ends at our southern  border. It starts in Central America and Mexico.    I know it is sometimes difficult to grasp the complexity of these  problems, and that is why it is so tough to resolve them. There are  social, political, historical, and moral aspects to all of them. Many  people and facets of our society are implicated.   Because of corruption and powerful criminal organizations in Mexico  and Central America, a genuine rule of law is missing in many parts of  these countries, and it has been for a long time. That is why it is so  important for us to work together with these countries in Central  America and with Mexico to help them stabilize their governments, root  out the corruption, and stop the violence, which will benefit them and  their economy, as well as the United States. These countries can in  turn restore the relationship between their government, their law  enforcement, and their people. When their people begin to see  opportunity and safety in their home countries, making the long haul  from Central America to the United States becomes less of an imperative  and less of a necessity for them. They would probably be happier  staying at home if they could do so safely and enjoy some modest  prosperity.  [[Page S7201]]    We have already had some successes in partnering with our closest  neighbor in the crisis; that is, the Government of Mexico. I believe we  can and should continue to build on some of the things we have already  put in place.   We have already partnered with Mexico in recent years through  programs like the Merida Initiative to combat drug trafficking,  organized crime, and money laundering.   We have directed funds toward strengthening communities and  empowering the Mexican criminal justice system and judicial system to  combat the rampant culture of impunity.   We have collaborated on intelligence matters and cooperated on  providing various forms of security.   The Bureau of International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement  Affairs continues to work to develop programs to combat international  narcotics and crime, especially in Central America, but U.S. funding  for this program in Mexico has stagnated. Why? Because we somehow fixed  the problem? No. It is because we have taken our eye off the ball once  again.   Additional aid for these programs would help not only improve drug  interdiction and train Mexican law enforcement and judicial personnel,  it would help them help us work together to combat the threats of these  transnational criminal organizations. We should begin to look at the  effectiveness of these programs so we can take full advantage of the  work they do and make sure they are modernized and are more efficient  and more effective.   I was encouraged to see that the State Department, the Department of  Homeland Security, and the Trump administration have already begun to  negotiate new partnerships with Mexico to implement a new strategy to  address some of the migrant flows from Central America. I appreciate  Secretary Nielsen's and Secretary Pompeo's work with Mexican  officials--primarily those associated with the incoming administration  of President Lopez Obrador--toward an arrangement where migrants can  seek asylum in the United States but wait in Mexico while their claims  are being processed.   I look forward to attending the inauguration of Mexico's incoming  President this Saturday with Vice President Pence and other Members of  Congress. I think this is--hopefully--a gesture that will be  appreciated and reciprocated when it comes to our desire to work  closely with this new administration to address many of the problems  that I have talked about this morning.   Ignoring this problem is not going to make it better; it is only  going to get worse. Working together--not just here in Congress but  with the administration and our partners to the south--to secure our  borders is the only path forward. Solving this crisis takes a whole- government strategy and one that looks at all pieces of the puzzle.   Instead of shutting down the government by refusing the President's  request for border security measures, we need to get to work and fix  our broken immigration system. I hope our friends across the aisle are  ready to leave their criticism behind and join us in solving the  problem.    Madam President, I yield the floor.
