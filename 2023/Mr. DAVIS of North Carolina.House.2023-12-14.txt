 Mr. Speaker, I met with families of  Israeli hostages because it was important to hear their stories. While  listening, there was deep pain and even moments of tears. These  families continue carrying burdens no one should have to bear.   It has been over 2 months. These families are missing their loved  ones and expressed a strong desire that we continue prioritizing their  return. There are significant concerns about the rapidly deteriorating  conditions of those who are still held captive. While life seems to  continue for so many right now, empty seats remain at their tables.   Personally, I take this moment to thank those working around the  clock for their safe return. Your tireless work provides unwavering  hope.   The resilience of the families is a testament to the human spirit.                            ____________________
