 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a Black  icon in the Fort Worth community, Reby Cary.   Reby lived a monumental life, and as the former Fort Worth Star- Telegram columnist Bobby Ray Sanders expressed: ``He was an activist  from the heart, and he was not afraid.''   He was among the first African Americans to graduate from the U.S.  Coast Guard radioman school in New Jersey and the first African  American to be elected to the Fort Worth Independent School District.  He shared many of the successes of Black pioneers in the community,  many of whom didn't receive the accolades they deserved in what was  then a segregated society.   After serving multiple tours in World War II, Mr. Cary came back to  Tarrant County, where he started teaching history at Dunbar High School  when it was a new high school.   He later became the first Black instructor at Tarrant County Junior  College. He went on to serve three terms in the Texas House of  Representatives, continuing to serve his Carver Heights community and  all of Fort Worth.   Mr. Cary was a proud member of The New Rising Star Missionary Baptist  Church in Fort Worth. He credited God for the many blessings that came  his way and his mother for keeping him on what he called ``the straight  and narrow.''   He wanted to tell Black Fort Worth's story, and he wanted to ensure  that the history of the African American community was documented and  remembered for generations to come. He became a Black historian and  authored 20 books about the history of African Americans in north  Texas.   My condolences go out to his family and friends. His presence will be  missed but never forgotten.   I also want to let all of his friends know in Alpha Phi Alpha  fraternity, his church, and all of the organizations that he  volunteered for in Fort Worth just how important that legacy was for  him.                            ____________________
