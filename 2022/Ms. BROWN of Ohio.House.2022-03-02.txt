 Madam Speaker, last night President Biden  delivered a powerful speech on the state of our Union in this very  Chamber. He outlined the historic achievements of the past year and  spoke directly to the American people about his vision to continue  building a better America.   Despite the progress we have seen, too many of our fellow Americans  still cannot make ends meet. Too many families are struggling to afford  rising food, childcare, housing, and gas prices. And too many of our  neighbors remain locked out of the promise of America.   I stand with President Biden in his call to continue building our  economy from the bottom up and the middle out. It is time to lower  costs for families by reducing prescription drug prices, expanding  access to affordable healthcare, and investing in pre-kindergarten  education.   It is time to increase pay by raising the minimum wage and protecting  the right to organize. And, yes, it is time to extend the child tax  credit.   Last night, I was honored to host Shaneice Ball of Cleveland as my  guest for the State of the Union. As a State-tested nursing assistant  and a mom of three with one on the way, Shaneice is the epitome of  resilience, tenacity, and the American people's ability to persevere  through tough times.                            ____________________
