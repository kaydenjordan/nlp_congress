 Mr. Speaker, I thank Judge Poe for the work that he is  doing this evening to bring attention to a critical problem that  desperately needs our attention and needs our solutions, that of human  trafficking.   The three largest international crime industries are drug  trafficking, arms trafficking, and human trafficking. It is  uncomfortable to talk about, but we can't shy away from talking about  the fact that in the world today, young boys and girls are being sold  across the globe for an average price of $90. It is not just in remote  parts of the globe. More than 14,000 people are trafficked into the  United States each year. It is happening all across America, and in  Lancaster, Berks, and Chester Counties, the district that I represent  in Pennsylvania.                                time  1900    Four out of five people trafficked in the world today are trafficked  for sexual exploitation. Eighty percent are female and half are  children.   Antitrafficking groups gather in our churches, restaurants, and  schools all across Pennsylvania and across the country. Those  individuals, and the victims of trafficking, should know that they have  allies in Congress.   My office has been in contact with organizations in my district like  Safe Berks, the Chester County Anti-Human Trafficking Coalition, and  law enforcement officials to discuss ways that we can work together to  help victims.   I am also very pleased to cosponsor the bipartisan Trafficking  Survivors Relief Act, introduced by my colleague Ann Wagner, who was  here with us this evening, from Missouri, a leader on this issue.   Victims of trafficking are forced to commit crimes like prostitution,  drug dealing, and money laundering. We cannot punish these victims for  crimes committed because of coercion and under the threat of violence  or death.   We must ensure that we are doing all we can to help victims recover  from these unthinkable experiences. This legislation will help to do  that by providing more judicial discretion for victims to clear their  names of any wrongdoing.   I am proud to stand with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this legislation that helps end this barbaric practice.
