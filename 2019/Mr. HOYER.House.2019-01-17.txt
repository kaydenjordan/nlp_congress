 Mr. Speaker, Mr. Aderholt from Alabama has just said this  is ``veto bait.'' What is veto bait? A proposition to open up the  people's government. Veto bait?   What is the Republican position? Unless the coequal branch of  government, the House of Representatives, says ``yes'' to the President  of the United States, you will continue to support, ad infinitum,  closing down the American Government.   Our Russian--I won't call them enemies, but adversaries, at least,  are very happy, I am sure, that the American Government is shut down.   Our Chinese competitors are very happy that the American Government  is shut down.   We look ridiculous on the national and international scene.   I ask one of my Republican colleagues to stand, and I will yield to  them. Tell me which government of the world shuts themselves down.   You are correct. The answer is, I can't find any government in the  free world that shuts themselves down.   Is that what you won't vote for, opening up your government, the  people's government? Is that what this fight is about?   Or is this fight about, Mr. President, you tell us what to do?   Mr. McConnell says he won't put anything on the Senate floor that the  President won't sign. My, my, my, what a coequal branch of government  we are.   Article I says we make the policy. We decide what is rational to  spend $5.7 billion on. Experts tell us this wall won't work. Senator  Cornyn, Senator Graham, Senator Kennedy, other Senators have said this  is not a good investment. By the way, somebody else who said that was  Mick Mulvaney, some years ago. He is now Chief of Staff at the White  House.   This is not a partisan issue, and this is not about the wall, nor was  it about the ACA, nor was it about the level of education funding when  Gingrich shut down the government or when Ted Cruz and the Freedom  Caucus shut down the government.   Thank God for John Boehner, who had the courage to say shutting down  the government does not make any sense. It is a stupid policy. Thank  God for John Boehner, who came to the floor, notwithstanding the fact  only 87 of his Republican colleagues would support it, but with all the  support of the Democrats, we opened up the government after 26 days.   Now, we have exceeded it this time. What happens 2 weeks from now  when the President says: Either you do it my way or no way, or I am  going to shut down the government.   We are paying a high price, Mr. Speaker, for shutting down this  government, not only the 800,000 hostages who have been taken by the  President of the United States, with the complicity of his Republican  supporters in the House and in the Senate. 800,000 people, 440,000 of  them forced to work without getting paid, 360,000 of them sitting home  and saying: How am I going to pay my mortgage? How am I going to pay my  car payment?   They don't know. I talked to a veteran just 3 days ago who represents  a lot of veterans organizations. He said to me: Do you know the highest  reason for veteran suicide?   I said: No, what is that?   Fiscal uncertainty.                                time  1100    We have a lot of veterans in the Federal Government. We have a lot of  veterans who are either laid off or working and not getting paid. We  are creating financial instability and anxiety among our employees.  What a stupid way to run a business.   Yesterday, we had a motion to recommit, and it was to strike opening  up the government of the United States. That was apparently, as the  chairwoman has expressed, a poison pill for my Republican colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I don't get it. We were sent here by our people to make  their government run more efficiently and effectively for them and for  our country, and what have we done? We have said: If the President  won't agree to opening up the government, we won't either.   Yes, we have tried every kind of alternative: opening it up for 7  days, opening it up for 14 days where we can negotiate, and now we are  saying to open it up for a month, put people back to work, give them a  paycheck.   And what does the President's Council of Economic Advisers say just  the other day? We are hurting the economy of the United States, which  hurts everybody and the international community.   I don't get it. I can't think that the American people will get it,  that their Congress sits supine and says we will only pass something if  the President says it is okay.   Have we come to this state where the Article I branch of government,  given the power by the people to make policy, says to the person in the  Second Article, given the responsibility of executing policy, to tell  us: You guys who make policy, don't do it unless I tell you you can?   How sad, how lacking in respect for our own responsibility and duties  to sit idly by while not only 800,000 people are held hostage, but also  millions and millions and millions of others who are served daily by  those 800,000 people.   I plead with my colleagues: Stand up. Reject this policy of shutting  down government whoever does it, whichever side does it.   And we don't do it. We don't believe in it. Mitch McConnell doesn't  believe in it. He said just a few years ago it was a failed policy. And  he, Senator McConnell, was the guy that opened up government. That is  what he said. He has now abandoned that, unfortunately, to the  detriment of our country--not just to the detriment of our Federal  employees, to the detriment of the country.   Mr. Speaker, I would hope every American would call their Member and  say: Look, you guys have differences. That is all right. But don't shut  down my government; don't hurt my economy; don't hurt my neighbor;  don't hurt my mom and dad; don't hurt my child; don't send people to  the border to make us secure when you talk about border security and  then don't pay them and have them worrying about when they are going to  get their next paycheck.  [[Page H691]]    We are better than this. The Congress ought to be better than this.   In a bipartisan way, we ought to say to the President of the United  States: We are for you, against you on this, that, or the other policy,  but we are united in the fact that we do not want to shut down the  people's government.   Pass this bill. Send it to the Senate. Let's open this government. It  is the right thing to do.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I  thank the ranking member for his leadership as well.   Mr. Speaker, I join Mr. Himes in saying this is not a partisan issue.  This is an issue of America and whether or not we are going to hold  accountable those who would threaten and undermine the interests of the  United States.   I thank Mr. McCaul for his principled leadership on this issue, and I  thank Chairman Engel for his continuing focus on making America secure.   Mr. Speaker, I am offering this joint resolution today because it is  deeply concerning that the Treasury Department would terminate  sanctions on companies owned by Oleg Deripaska.   Mr. Deripaska is a Russian oligarch--meaning essential is very, very  wealthy--and is a very close associate of President Vladimir Putin.   The businesses he controls were sanctioned under the Russian  sanctions legislation the Congress enacted through bipartisan action in  2017. As I have sponsored numerous bills with Mr. McCarthy when he was  the majority leader to make sure that the Congress was on record and  had policies which would staunch the attacks on our country and on our  security by the Russians.   I was deeply disappointed that the Republican Senate rejected a  similar resolution yesterday. When I say they rejected it, the majority  of the Members of the Senate--57 to be exact--supported this  resolution.   I talked to Secretary Mnuchin yesterday and the day before, and I  asked Secretary Mnuchin: Given the concerns about this legislation,  about this withdrawing of sanctions on RUSAL, that they give us until  February 28 to have hearings to reflect upon and have further  discussions with the administration and make a determination whether we  thought this action was in the best interests of our country.  [[Page H696]]    Unfortunately, when the Senate failed to get the 60 votes they needed  to bring cloture so that they could get to final consideration of the  bill, the Treasury Department decided to go forward.   It is crucial that the Congress, however, make clear that the allies  of Vladimir Putin, no matter how wealthy or how powerful they are, face  appropriate consequences for their actions against America's security  and democratic institutions. That is what this is about.   As Mr. Himes said, it is not a partisan vote. As a matter of fact, in  my view, if Barack Obama were President of the United States today,  this resolution would receive unanimous support from my Republican  colleagues and overwhelming, if not unanimous, support from my  Democratic colleagues.   Now, I understand the Treasury Department's goal in this instance. It  is trying to remove Mr. Deripaska from control of these companies. That  is a good objective. I am also sensitive to the economic concerns of  our European partners who are dependent on aluminum manufactured by  RUSAL, which is the Russian aluminum company, one of the largest in the  world and almost, maybe not a monopoly, but an overwhelming share of  the aluminum market internationally.   However, I do not have confidence that this specific deal  accomplishes that objective. I believe many of the Members of this  House on both sides of the aisle share this lack of confidence. There  are way too many remaining questions for Congress not to act on this  resolution.    For example, I am not convinced that Mr. Deripaska would fully  relinquish his control of RUSAL under this deal--as a matter of fact, I  think it is doubtful that he would do so--or that the Treasury  Department used its full leverage in this negotiation.   I am also concerned, Mr. Speaker, that Mr. Deripaska would receive  massive financial benefit from this deal--this is supposed to be a  sanction--massive financial benefit, nearly unprecedented for a  sanctioned entity.   Mr. Speaker, I hope our action today will force the Treasury  Department to engage more thoroughly with Congress on explaining its  actions on this deal and to seek a better one. I think their intent was  an honest intent. I am doubtful they achieved it. I therefore urge my  colleagues to join me and, hopefully, in a bipartisan way supporting  this resolution and I call on the Senate to reconsider its position.    Mr. Speaker, I object.    I am not sure what is going on, but I object. It is done.    Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object--I understand  there is a problem--and I intend to object.   We have told all our people to go home. It is not just a question of  being in their offices, with all due respect. They are on their way to  their planes. It is far after the time when we usually leave on a go- away day.   And I feel badly. I am going to look at the TV. I don't, frankly,  think--I was sitting right here. I didn't hear or see anybody asking  for a recorded vote. And, very frankly, you don't usually have to ask  for a recorded vote because, when you were in the majority, it was  always us that had to record the vote because we were losing. Frankly,  I think that is what happened, I will be very honest with you.   But again, I would like to be able to correct this situation. But I  cannot do that in good conscience because people have told me they had  1:30 planes, and they are gone. And I feel very badly about that, but  that is the fact.   I don't think any games were played. I am going to look at the tape-- it is on television--and see. I understand the problem that most of you  were not for the resolution that passed. We didn't stop anybody from  asking for a vote, nor could we have stopped anybody from asking for a  vote. I was surprised that it went without a vote.   The Speaker and the Parliamentarian indicate that the proper  procedure was followed, but the vote was not asked for. Therefore, I  feel badly about it, because I understand the problem you are in. But I  have Members who have left for the airports and they are not going to  be here.   The vote, if it was reconsidered, is equally important on our side as  it is on your side. I cannot expose my Members to missing that vote,  nor will I. And I apologize for that. But I hope you understand that,  given the situation, I cannot let my Members be subjected to missing  that vote, which is a very important vote for them. And, therefore, I  will have to object.  [[Page H701]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the minority whip.    This is a very critical vote. The government is shut down.  We think the government should not be shut down.    And the gentleman says he doesn't think we should go home.  Very frankly, there is nothing we can do, because the majority leader  has said he will not do anything unless the President of the United  States gives him leave to do so, and the President of the United States  wants to keep the government shut down.   This was not a small vote, and I will tell you, had it been on our  side, you would have heard us demand a vote.    We raised an objection at the proper time and we got a  vote. I understand that.   I will tell you--and you know that--you look around the room, all of  your Members are not here. And, like my Members, they are back on the  road going to a plane. I regret that we are in this position.    I yield to my friend.    Reclaiming my time, we are going to have a colloquy in  just a few minutes and we can go through that.                                time  1315    The problem is--and I say this honestly, and I think most Members  know--if I thought you had asked for a vote and the Speaker had not  recognized that vote--I was sitting right here. I was not distracted,  and I was surprised that a vote was not asked for because I understand  that most, if not all, of you were not for opening up the government.   The fact of the matter is that a vote was not asked for. We have now  gone through business, and we put ourselves in a very difficult  position. But I cannot agree to a proposition where I have told  Members: No, you can go catch your plane. Some had 1:30s, and they left  right at the dot of 1. I don't know whether they are going to make it.   And, you know, we are in a bad situation, but I cannot agree to a  unanimous consent that is going to require our Members to come back  from wherever they are. I don't know that they are on planes yet, but  they are going to be on them shortly.   And both sides have that problem. I think you probably have that  problem anyway. And, very frankly, I am absolutely convinced the  outcome would be no different.   The problem is so many of your Members wanted to vote against the  proposition--I understand that--and I would like to give them that  opportunity. I am not in a position to do so, and I feel badly about  that, but that is the position I made.    Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, we are going to be in  session next week. We are going to be back here. It was a recess week.  The reason it is not a recess week is because the government of the  American people is shut down. We have tried now nine times--this was  the ninth time--to open up the government.   Nobody was surprised. Everybody knew. It was debated on the floor. I  spoke on it for, I think, 8 or 9 minutes myself, so there was no  confusion, should not have been confusion on the floor. And I think a  vote should have been demanded. It was not, and I am not in a position  to agree to a unanimous consent. But I am in a position to tell you,  there will be at least two or three votes next week on opening up the  government.   My presumption is those of you who have voted against such motions in  the past will do so again. So it will not be as if you don't have an  opportunity to vote on this same proposition. It was not a complicated  proposition, and I regret, Mr. Speaker, that I am not in a position to  try to cure the failure, in my view, because I didn't hear it, and I  was, as I say, sitting here.   And the Speaker obviously didn't hear it either. I am absolutely  convinced that the judge would not have--if he had heard a request, he  would have honored that request for a vote. So we are where we are.   I would urge the Members--clearly, I will stipulate to the fact that  almost all of you would have voted against the motion if a vote had  been taken, and you can put that in the Record.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, from time to time, for whatever reasons,  people want to vote and, either because they don't get down the aisle  or they don't request a vote, they do not get the opportunity to vote  on issues that they think are important to them.   From time to time, frankly, on our side we have felt that we have  been shut out when the majority was in the hands of the Republicans. We  would  [[Page H702]]  want fairness. In return, we ought to extend fairness.   There are obviously many, many Members who wanted to vote on the  continuing resolution which was the subject of one of the votes, but  from our point of view--and having reviewed the tapes--that did not  happen. That happens.   But because we want to assure Members on both sides of the aisle that  their opinion can be expressed as they would wish it to be expressed-- and I think Mr. Scalise will say that. Mr. Butterfield, former judge,  who is one of our fairest and best Members, I would hope we would  acknowledge that he handled the matter fairly and consistent with the  rules.   Given that, it will be my intention to now ask for unanimous consent  to provide for the opportunity, when we return on Wednesday, so that we  have all Members here--we are going to return on Tuesday. And I would  say that we will return before that. We may return tomorrow if we can  open up government, if we have an agreement on that. But we will return  as soon as that option is available to us.   But we will return, if that does not happen, on the evening of  Tuesday at 6:30, and we will then, as a result of the unanimous consent  request I am about to make, vote--revote--on the issue at hand on  Wednesday at the first of business.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to vacate proceedings  by which the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 28) making further continuing  appropriations for fiscal year 2019, and for other purposes, was  passed, and the motion to reconsider laid upon the table, to the end  that the Chair put the question on passage of H.J. Res. 28 de novo;  and, further, that if a recorded vote or the yeas and nays are  ordered--in other words, requested--on the question of passage of H.J.  Res. 28, further proceedings may be postponed through the legislative  day of January 23, 2019, as though under clause 8 of rule XX.   Again, Mr. Speaker, that will have the effect of allowing a revote on  the resolution so that my Republican colleagues can reflect their view  on whether that measure ought to pass or whether it ought to fail.    Don't say that too strongly, lest I withdraw the unanimous  consent request.    Mr. Speaker, before I end, we have just been through a  very difficult week in which one of our Members was reviewed and  disapproval was passed almost unanimously, I think, with just one vote  opposed to it, on our side.   I must mention: I don't want any argument or we don't need to debate  on this, but, unfortunately, at a height, I know, of a lot of emotion,  one of our Members, a respected Member of our caucus, Tony Cardenas-- who is, by the way, from California--was met with a call from the other  side of the aisle to return to Puerto Rico.   We ought to all be cognizant of the fact that we need to be civil to  one another. We need to be polite to one another, even. We can disagree  very strongly and, obviously, we do on issue to issue.   But we have been sent here by 750,000, give or take, of our fellow  citizens, and I respect all of you for having been selected by 750,000  people. I may disagree with them on selecting the policies that you  pursue, obviously--I understand that--but I would hope that we could  refrain from any implications which have any undertones of prejudice or  racism or any kind of ``-ism'' that would diminish the character and  integrity of one of our fellow Members.
