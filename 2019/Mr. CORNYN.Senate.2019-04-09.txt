 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Domenico nomination expire at 2:15 p.m.;  further, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. today.    Mr. President, I was fortunate to grow up in a military  family. My dad served for 31 years in the U.S. Air Force. He actually  started out at a very young age as a B-17 pilot in the Army Air Corps  before the Air Force was even created.   He was stationed at Molesworth Air Force Base in England and flew  missions across the English Channel into Germany during World War II.  He flew 26 of those missions, and he was successful in completing each  one of them except for the last one. On the 26th mission, he was shot  down and captured as a POW for the last 4 months of the war.   Growing up in a military family obviously means a lot to me. I grew  up with a father who demonstrated every day what it means to be a  patriot. Of course, like most military brats--that is what we called  ourselves--I spent a lot of time traveling around the country. Of  course, I was born in Texas and consider San Antonio home, but we  [[Page S2302]]  lived in Mississippi and in Kensington, MD, right outside the District  of Columbia. I graduated from high school in Japan. This is pretty  typical of a lot of military families because they tend to move around  quite a bit. One of the biggest challenges, being a student growing up  in a military family, is frequently having to change schools. That  requires a little bit of resilience on the part of the student because  they have to learn how to make friends, even in new settings.   Despite the challenges of moving around as a kid, there was one thing  I was always grateful for. I had the privilege of witnessing not only  my dad but so many others of our U.S. military servicemembers in  action. Seeing their courage and sacrifice showed me early on that  there is nothing we can do to adequately repay these men and women for  their service to their country, but you better believe we have to try,  and we are going to keep trying--not just to repay them but to  recognize them and to honor them.   In Congress we accomplished a lot for our military over the last few  years. We restored America's defense with the greatest investment in  the military in decades, including the largest troop pay raise in  nearly 10 years. That is after we tried unsuccessfully to do what we  have done from time to time, which is to cash in the ``peace  dividend.'' Unfortunately, we can't cash in the peace dividend because  there never seems to be peace, as much as we would hope and pray for  that.   But supporting our heroes on the battlefield is only part of our  responsibility toward the military. We are also focused on ensuring  that they get the care, support, and opportunities they need once they  come home and take the uniform off as a veteran.   I have heard from many of my veterans in Texas who are frustrated  with the services provided by VA facilities. They shared stories about  having to travel hours upon hours to receive care, sometimes forcing  them to accept lower quality care or sometimes to forego it entirely.   Both in Texas and across the country, VA facilities have notably been  plagued by inefficiency, lack of accountability, and quality of care  issues. Making matters more challenging, the VA has been hindered by  unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. The Veterans' Administration has more  than 300,000 people working for them. So bureaucracy should be its  middle name. It is not designed to be efficient, but it is incredibly  frustrating and costly for our veterans as they seek to get the care we  promised them and that we are dutybound to provide.   Sadly, in some cases veterans turn to alternative coping mechanisms  that can lead to destructive addictions. We know that self-medication  is a real problem, particularly for mental health issues, and veterans,  unless they are diagnosed properly and receive the correct medical  care, can spiral down as a result of an alcohol or drug addiction,  which is a coping or self-medication mechanism that does not work out  well. Those stories do not end well at all. Those are some of the  challenges we have facing our veterans and trying to provide them with  the services they are entitled to and have earned.   But there is a good news part to this story. Last summer we took a  major step to provide veterans with the healthcare they deserve when we  passed the VA MISSION Act. This legislation will make significant  reforms in the Department of Veterans Affairs and provide veterans with  more flexibility to make decisions themselves regarding their  healthcare. In other words, they don't have to adapt to the system. The  system can adapt to them and be flexible to their needs.   One of the most common frustrations I hear from my Texas veterans is  that it is sometimes impractical to travel to the next VA hospital when  they need care. This legislation, the VA MISSION Act, consolidates and  improves VA community programs. In other words, you can get the care in  your community. It allows veterans to receive care from private  hospitals and doctors.   It also provides funding for the Veterans Choice Program to continue  until the approved Veterans Community Care Program matures and is fully  in effect.   The VA MISSION Act included some of the most substantial reforms to  the veterans healthcare system in years, lowering the barriers to care  for veterans and giving them more treatment options. It has also  provided the largest funding increase in recent history for veterans'  care and services and modernized the VA's electronic health record  system.    My hope is it will provide some needed relief to veterans and their  families who aren't happy with the status quo, and we will continue to  work with them until we get this right, to build on these reforms until  we are able to provide the sort of care all of our veterans need and  deserve. We don't want to just provide for these men and women's  physical needs, we also need to ensure that they have adequate mental  health resources as well.   Last Congress, I was an original cosponsor of the Veteran Urgent  Access to Mental Healthcare Act. Enacted as part of the 2018  Consolidated Appropriations Act, this law now allows those discharged  under certain other-than-honorable conditions access to critical mental  health care facilities. Veterans who are struggling deserve to be  carefully evaluated at the onset of their mental illness and supported  with the VA medical treatment necessary for their recovery.   I was proud to introduce the Mental Health and Safe Communities Act,  which established peer-to-peer services that connect qualified veterans  with other veterans to provide support and mentorship. One of the  things I hear from our servicemembers, when they take the uniform off,  is that what they miss most about the military is the camaraderie and  sense of teamwork and mutual support. This legislation is designed to  try to provide some transitional support for peer-to-peer services, to  connect qualified veterans with other veterans during that period of  time. It will also allow qualified veterans to obtain treatment,  recovery, stabilization, and rehabilitation services.   While providing physical and mental healthcare for veterans is a top  priority, it is only part of providing a smooth transition for those  who leave military life to return to civilian life. We want to ensure  that they have ample employment opportunities as well.   Last month, the veterans unemployment rate was 2.9 percent--down from  4.1 percent in March of last year and lower than the national  unemployment rate. I would like to think that is, in part, a result of  the concerted effort we have made to provide more opportunity to our  veterans to transition into a meaningful career after life in the  military. I am encouraged by those positive numbers. We will continue  to follow them and make sure it is not just a blip on the radar screen.   Last Congress, I introduced the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act,  which is now law. It amended a 1968 law to allow grant funds to be used  to hire and train veterans as career law enforcement officers.  Everywhere I go across the State of Texas, I talk to police departments  that were really having huge challenges trying to fill the vacancies in  their ranks. This will allow more of our veterans who are trained to  serve as career law enforcement officers and use grant funds to hire  and train them further to make sure they have the skills needed in a  specific police department or law enforcement position. This bill makes  sure veterans can get hired by local law enforcement agencies when they  come out of the military with the very skills that are needed by those  police agencies working to keep our communities safe.   I also introduced the Jobs for Our Heroes Act, which was signed into  law last January. This streamlines the process by which Active-Duty  military reservists and veterans receive commercial driver's licenses.   Finally, another bill I will mention was the Harry W. Colmery  Veterans Educational Assistance Act, which made much needed updates for  veterans facing school closures while enrolled. It also increased the  resources and opportunities for educational assistance for veterans  pursuing STEM careers--science, technology, engineering, and math-- something we need more of.   Every piece of legislation I mentioned was signed into law by  President Trump and represents our commitment in the Senate to  supporting America's veterans. I am proud of the  [[Page S2303]]  work we have been able to do together on a bipartisan basis--big and  small--to provide America's veterans with the support and resources  they need as they transition to civilian life.   There is more I would like to accomplish this Congress to provide  greater care and open more doors to veterans. I look forward to working  with all of my colleagues to do exactly that.                Tribute to Lieutenant General Paul E. Funk II    Madam President, finally, I want to take just a moment to  congratulate one outstanding servicemember from Texas who just received  a big promotion. The Senate recently confirmed LTG Paul E. Funk II for  his fourth star and for the position of commanding general of the U.S.  Army Training and Doctrine Command.   Since 2017, General Funk has served as commanding general of the  Third Armored Corps at Ford Hood, where he commands about 100,000  soldiers on five installations across five States. As excited as we  were for him to take the helm at Fort Hood, it felt more like a  homecoming for General Funk.   As a matter of fact, he was born at Fort Hood and is the son of a  previous commander of the Third Corps at Fort Hood. They were the first  father-son duo to command the unit and joined a small but impressive  group of other fathers and sons who have commanded the same corps.   Throughout his career, General Funk has been deployed five times and  led soldiers during Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, twice in  Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation  Inherent Resolve. General Funk is highly decorated and has received  multiple Distinguished Service Medals, the Defense Superior Service  Medal, multiple Legion of Merit awards, and numerous Bronze Stars,  among other medals.   I wanted to say a few words to congratulate soon-to-be General Funk  and his wife, Dr. Beth Funk, on this incredible accomplishment. He is  an outstanding soldier, leader, and patriot, and will do great work at  TRADOC. The State of Texas is sad to say farewell, but we wish him the  very best as he heads to Virginia for this incredible opportunity and  his continued service to our country.
