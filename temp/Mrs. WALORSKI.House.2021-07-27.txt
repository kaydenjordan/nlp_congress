 Madam Speaker, I rise to defend the dignity of life  and the rights of pro-life Americans. We must protect taxpayers from  being forced to fund abortion against their own conscience.   The Hyde amendment which prohibits taxpayer dollars for paying for  abortion has had bipartisan consensus since 1976 and the majority of  Americans still support it today. This pro-life protection has saved  nearly 2.5 million lives.   Driven by a radical agenda, Democrats and the Biden administration  have stripped this vital amendment from these appropriation packages.  It is incredibly disappointing that Democrats want to force American  taxpayers to bankroll the destruction of life.   I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion  Act, which would make this prohibition the law of the land. Pro-life  Americans must stand together to protect the most vulnerable among us.  Lives are depending on us.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and the underlying bill to  prevent taxpayer funding from paying for abortions.
