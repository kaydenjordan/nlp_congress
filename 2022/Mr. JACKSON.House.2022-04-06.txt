 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  471, the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border  crisis.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Indiana for the  time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about two great patriots who I  am proud to call my friends, Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro. These two  men have served our country honorably. Sadly, they are now targets of  the political witch hunt simply because they served our country and  they are loyal to our great former President, Donald J. Trump.   The illegitimate January 6th Committee's ruthless crusade against  President Trump and his close allies is yet another smear on this great  body. It will go down in history as another failed attempt by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to bring down good people  simply because they disagree with their political beliefs.   As someone who has been a target of the left and their ruthless  tactics in the past, I know firsthand how damaging this can be. The  American people are tired of this partisan January 6 circus. It is time  to stop this nonsense now.   I urge my colleagues to stand up against this charade and oppose this  baseless resolution.
