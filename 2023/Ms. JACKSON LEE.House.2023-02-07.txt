 Mr. Speaker, let me just say we will all have an  opportunity to debate this legislation in general debate. I do think it  is important to frame the challenges that all of these particular  initiatives have.   Frankly, let me, first of all, say that I am disappointed that the  Rules Committee did not let a very straightforward amendment which I  think expresses the view of many of us to strike the entire text of  H.R. 185.   During the pandemic, I organized a bipartisan COVID-19 task force. We  worked very hard; included a Republican, a doctor, and other Members.  We held meetings with doctors. We held meeting with scientists,  hospital administrators. They were very grateful.   Many of you may have heard me say that I did over 70-plus testing  sites and over 70-plus vaccination sites, going up to 150 in my  community.   It is about the science. People understood the science and they  gravitated toward vaccines. That means that any elimination of the  requirement of foreign travelers should be on the science, not to be on  the whims of individuals who believe that they are helping to unify  families. It is about the science.   The reason why we are where we are today, even though there are 500  people getting COVID, and there are people dying every single day, is  because more Americans believed in the science than did not. That is  why we developed this protection. So I think this is wrongheaded to  have this legislation.   Finally, H.J. Res. 24 and H.J. Res. 26, disapproving the actions of  the District of Columbia on voting rights and on the criminal code is,  again, undermining local rule, and they have the right to local rule.   Constitutionally, everyone should have the right to equal protection  under the law in the place where they are.   Washington, D.C., Mr. Speaker, should not have the intrusion of the  United States Congress.
