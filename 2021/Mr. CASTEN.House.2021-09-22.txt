 Madam Speaker, I rise to declare for now the end of Hot  FERC Summer.   Sixty-four days ago I kicked off Hot FERC Summer with Megan Thee  Stallion and then Fergie to elevate the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission's critical role in solving the climate crisis, and to urge  the White House to nominate a fifth FERC commissioner.   Some, even in this Chamber, have lamented the bad dad jokes and puns,  and many have asked what does this have to do with climate change?   Here's the thing. For far too long we have just used FERC's mind and  we never gave them credit. And, frankly, allowing the most important  Federal agency to fight climate change to continue to go unnoticed and  short staffed, well, that would have driven me crazy, if I had let it.   I am thrilled to report that the President has embraced that Hot FERC  Summer spirit and nominated Willie Phillips, taking us one step closer  to restoring FERC to its full strength, enabling us to make this  transition to clean energy at the pace the climate crisis demands.   Those commissioners and their hardworking, underappreciated staff,  they are FERCalicious.   But they can't start working yet, and that is why today I am calling  on my Senate colleagues to prioritize the confirmation hearings for Mr.  Phillips so that he can start FERCing 9 to 5.   You see, when you tumble out of bed and stumble to the kitchen, pour  yourself a cup of that ambition, your alarm clock, the lights, the hot  coffee, they are in part, in no small part, thanks to the folks at FERC  who are working to ensure that robust transmission system that we take  for granted every day.   And when you jump in the shower hot enough that your blood starts  pumping and drive out to the street before the traffic starts jumping,  the charging networks for all those electric vehicles that stay cheap  and reliable are also thanks to the folks FERCing 9 to 5.   FERCing 9 to 5, what a way to save the planet. We will not slow down  this rapid acceleration of devastating wildfires, hurricanes, heat  waves and blackouts that have already impacted one in three Americans  this summer until we build out a zero-carbon energy system. With FERC's  help, we can turn this ship around, if we let it.   FERCing 9 to 5, what a way to save the economy. Every day FERC helps  make sure that energy isn't just a rich man's game. They have the  ability and the authority to bring about this clean energy transition  while keeping our energy markets competitive, reliable, and affordable  to make sure that your utility isn't just taking without giving.   So why FERC? Couldn't we just do this in Congress?   Well, as long as the Senate prioritizes the preservation of the  filibuster over the preservation of the planet, a fully staffed,  climate-focused FERC will remain the most powerful, most important, and  maybe the only tool we have to get to a low-cost, zero-carbon economy  at the pace that the crisis demands.   But let's be clear: Getting FERC fully staffed is necessary but  insufficient. Once fully staffed, they have got a lot of work to do. We  need new rules to debottleneck our inter-regional transmission system  to deliver clean, cheap, and reliable energy to all Americans--and  thank you to my friend Senator Heinrich, and fellow nerd engineer, on  that front--to ensure that market rules incentivize clean energy  investments to decarbonize our system and lower the cost of energy,  even as those investments lower the resulting cash flows; to ensure  that the economic gains of zero-carbon energy are equitably shared by  investors, by consumers, and by workers; to make sure that long- subsidized but inherently uneconomic fossil fuel plants can transition  offline without unduly burdening consumers.    That stuff is really complicated. But the simple and important truth  is that we don't have to keep paying too much for dirty energy. We  don't have to accept the fossil-fuel-funded false dichotomy between our  morals and our wallets. There is a better life, Madam Speaker, and you  think about it, don't you?   FERC is the place where we can preserve a livable planet for  ourselves, for our kids, for our grandkids. We are all in the same  boat; and with FERC's help, the tide is going to come in and it is  going to roll our way.   So at the end of Hot FERC Summer, the day after the 21st night of  September, thank you to Megan, Fergie, and Dolly for the inspiration,  and for helping me ensure that my daughters, however embarrassed they  may now be, can inherit a livable planet. Thanks to all who paid  attention, helped me prove that FERC is indeed hot enough to warrant  this level of attention, and moved us a little closer, a little quicker  to a fully functioning Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And thanks  to all the incredibly dedicated  [[Page H4873]]  staff at the Commission for all you do FERCing 9 to 5 to protect our  future.                            ____________________
