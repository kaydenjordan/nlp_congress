 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1316 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1316         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       5376) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of       S. Con. Res. 14, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to       consider in the House, without intervention of any point of       order, a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on the       Budget or his designee that the House concur in the Senate       amendment. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be       considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for three       hours equally divided among and controlled by the respective       chairs and ranking minority members of the Committees on the       Budget, Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means, or their       respective designees. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without       intervening motion.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1316.   The rule provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R.  5376, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It makes in order a motion  offered by the chair of the Committee on the Budget or his designee  that the House concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 5376.   Finally, it provides 3 hours of debate on the motion equally divided  among and controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority  members of the Committees on the Budget, Energy and Commerce, and Ways  and Means, or their respective designees.   Mr. Speaker, for too long too many people in this country have felt  like the work that happens in Washington isn't meant to help them. Like  the people who work in this city are not on their side. You know what?  For a long time they have been right. For decades, corporate special  interests and their out-of-touch friends in the Republican Party have  blocked progress in Washington. They got what was good for the rich and  powerful, not what was right for working families and the middle class.   No more. That time is over. President Biden and Democrats are putting  people over politics. We are fighting to create better jobs, safer  communities, and a brighter future for our planet. This is a historic  bill, Mr. Speaker, and at the end of the day it is not a complicated  vote. It all comes down to what your values are.   Democrats have been fighting for years to lower drug prices, and this  bill lets Medicare negotiate with drug companies to lower the price of  prescription drugs. It caps the out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $35  for people on Medicare. It stops excessive price hikes on drugs and  says, if you are on Medicare you won't have to pay more than $2,000 a  year for your prescriptions. Meanwhile, Republicans oppose this bill  because it will cut into Big Pharma's corporate profits. Boo-hoo. I  mean, really? They oppose this bill because they want to let  pharmaceutical companies continue price gouging. Give me a break.   This bill listens to the climate experts who tell us that melting  glaciers and record heat are not normal. It puts us on a path to  cutting carbon emissions 40 percent by 2030, helping create millions of  new jobs along the way. This is a huge investment in energy security  made in America by American workers that lowers energy costs for  working families. It is the biggest investment in fighting climate  change in history. Ever. This is a turning point in the fight to  protect our planet.   Republicans oppose this bill because they have never given a damn  about pollution or climate change--they are more interested in  protecting Big Oil's bottom line. That is whose side they are on.   Let's look at healthcare costs. This bill cuts healthcare costs for  millions of people by locking in lower Affordable Care Act premiums,  saving people $800 a year on average. Republicans oppose it because  they want insurance companies to make more money by ripping people off.  You can't make this stuff up.   Democrats want a tax code that is fair, where rich and powerful  people pay what they owe, just like everyone else. Honest, hardworking  middle-class families have to pay their fair share, but the top 1  percent dodge $160 billion in taxes each year.   The Republican answer? They want to make it easier for the rich and  powerful to cheat. Whose side are they on?   Mr. Speaker, this is historic. It is bold. Just so everyone  understands, it lowers the deficit, and it is fully paid for with no  new taxes on families making $400,000 per year or less, and no new  taxes on small businesses. Those who oppose this bill don't want to  talk about how it will help people. Instead, they are pushing total  made-up BS.   The money in this bill for the IRS isn't going to result in increased  audits on anyone making under $400,000 a year. Don't take my word for  it.   Who appointed Charles Rettig, the current Commissioner of the IRS?   Oh, it was Donald Trump.   Charles Rettig, Trump's appointee, says the money in this bill will  go towards better customer support, quicker turnaround times, so people  can get long-overdue refunds, and enforcing tax laws against rich  people cheating on their taxes. Don't take it from me, take it from  Trump's own hand-picked IRS Commissioner.   I get calls into my district office every day from people who are  frustrated that their calls to the IRS go unanswered and their tax  returns are late. This bill will help fix it. Look, here is the truth.  This bill puts our government back on the side of working people in  this country.   Like I said earlier, this is about values: Democrats put people over  politics. We are fighting to reduce inflation for the people, lower the  cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, make heating, cooling, and  electricity bills cheaper, combat climate change with green energy, and  lower the deficit.   Let's just tell the truth. Republicans are cheering for inflation.  Every day they come to this floor cheering for us to fail. In my  opinion, they are cheering for this administration and this country to  fail because they think it will help them politically. They don't put  people over politics. They put Big Pharma, oil CEOs, corporate tax  evaders, and greedy insurance companies over everything else. It is  rotten, it is wrong, and it is hurting America.    Enough with the cynicism. This is a great day for America. I am proud  to be here. It is not very often we get to pass bills that are going to  change the course of history for generations to come. I will sleep  better tonight knowing that when we pass this bill we are putting  people over politics to leave a better world for our kids and  grandkids. This is a historic moment. Let's get this bill passed and to  the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I feel as if I just walked into the Festivus  celebration, the annual airing of grievances. There is so much that  needs to be responded to.   Let me just say two things.   On inflation, last week, five former Treasury Secretaries issued a  statement--five former Treasury Secretaries--urging us to pass this  critical legislation to ``help increase American competitiveness,  address our climate crisis, lower costs for families, and fight  inflation.''   Larry Summers was among those former Treasury Secretaries who said  that this bill helps fight inflation. My Republican colleagues love to  cite Mr. Summers but it seems as though they only like to acknowledge  his analysis when he agrees with the point that they are trying to  make.   Just on process, I just have to say this: Perhaps my friends are  forgetting the extensive hearings and markups that we held during  consideration of Build Back Better. The Energy and Commerce markup  alone took 3 days. Almost every piece of the Inflation Reduction Act  was included in some form in the original House bill. Of course, it is  not identical. Unfortunately, we had to let the Senate work its will,  too. Believe me, I wish we could send the House-passed bill straight to  the President's desk. But I don't have the time to go through an  exhaustive list.   Let me just remind my colleagues of just a few of the many provisions  that this body already considered through regular order. The ACA  premium reduction, prescription drug pricing reform, clean energy tax  credits, energy-efficiency rebates, funds to fight wildfires, rural  energy programs, clean vehicle manufacturing, funds to reduce air  pollution, drought assistance, and a lot, lot, lot more.   Now, I understand that my colleagues don't like this bill, but it has  gone through regular order, and it is way past time that we send it to  the President's desk for his signature.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Torres), who is a member of the House Rules Committee.   Mrs. TORRES OF California. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin my comments  by thanking President Biden for doing what he actually had said that he  is going to do and delivering for the people. I also thank our Vice  President from California, Kamala Harris, for being courageous and  splitting that 50/50 Senate. I also recognize the leadership of both  Houses that have brought us to where we are today to consider a Senate  amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act, IRA, of 2022.   This is a critical piece of legislation that will help reduce the  Federal deficit and tackle inflation, lower healthcare and prescription  drug costs, and address the climate crisis. The Inflation Reduction Act  will also help lower energy bills for working families all while  changing the Tax Code to ensure--to ensure the corporations--you know,  Mr. Speaker, the ones that can donate politically and be considered as  if they were humans?   If they are able to give money politically, then they should be able  to also pay their own fair share of taxes, and the filthy rich should  also pay their fair share.   Many families are still struggling to make ends meet with the cost of  goods on the rise, forcing many to choose between basic necessities  like food and lifesaving medication to stay healthy.   Let us not forget that we shut down our economy as a result of a  massive world pandemic. Let us not forget that Russia, the bully, has  declared war on their neighbor; and, yes, China continues to shut down  many of their communities as a result of high coronavirus infections.  So inflation is high.   It is disappointing to see that American families pay nearly twice as  much for their prescription drugs in comparison to other developed  countries.   Why is that?   Because we have been handcuffed because we are not able to negotiate  fair pharmaceutical prices. I have even heard from my constituents that  medication can be so expensive that in many cases they decide to reduce  the recommended dosage and to decline medication altogether.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   With all due respect, my friend asked why we are here in August and  what is the emergency. Well, the Inflation Reduction Act actually  addresses an emergency that a lot of families are faced with right now.   Rising grocery costs, rising fuel costs, those things are  emergencies, maybe not to people on the other side of the aisle here,  but they are to a lot of families in my district and across the  country. Rising prescription drug prices are an emergency.   If that is not enough, addressing the issue of the climate crisis. I  mean, the front page of The Washington Post: ``As U.S. prepares for  climate action, planet isn't waiting around.'' The planet is,  literally, on fire, and we are actually addressing that in a meaningful  way with this bill, the biggest investment ever to combat the climate  crisis. Now, that is an emergency.   You should talk to young people in your district who have been  fighting passionately to try to get Congress to finally address this  issue. Talk to your farmers in your district. They will tell you that  climate change is real.   Maybe my friends would rather be on vacation, but we are here, in  August, to do something meaningful for the American people and for this  planet.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Auchincloss).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a New York Times  [[Page H7566]]  article titled, ``IRS says funding won't mean more audits for middle- income Americans''; an AP article titled, ``IRS plans to hire 10,000  workers to relieve massive backlog''; a TIME article titled, ``Trump  Allies Are Attacking Biden For a Plan to Hire 87,000 New IRS Agents  That Doesn't Exist''; and a New York Times article titled, ``For Older  Americans, Health Bill Will Bring Savings and `Peace of Mind.' ''                  [From The New York Times, Aug. 4, 2022]   The I.R.S. Says New Funding Won't Mean More Audits for Middle-Income                                 Americans                            (By Alan Rappeport)         Washington.--Charles P. Rettig, the Internal Revenue       Service commissioner, told Congress on Thursday that the tax       collection agency would not increase audits of households       earning less than $400,000 if it was given the additional $80       billion that lawmakers were considering in a proposed climate       and tax legislation package.        Providing more funding for the I.R.S. has been a top       priority of the Biden administration and has emerged as key       way to finance some of the policies that Democrats are       proposing without raising individual tax rates. The       additional funding is expected to go toward hiring more       enforcement agents to crack down on wealthy tax evaders and       corporations and to modernize the agency's antiquated       technology.        ``These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit       scrutiny on small businesses or middle-income Americans,''       Mr. Retting wrote in a letter to lawmakers. ``As we have been       planning, our investment of these enforcement resources is       designed around Treasury's directive that audit rates will       not rise relative to recent years for households making under       $400,000.''        That commitment is in keeping with President Biden's       promise not to raise taxes on middle-income Americans.        Mr. Rettig added that better technology and customer       service at the I.R.S. would make honest taxpayers less likely       to be audited.        The I.R.S. funding is projected to raise $124 billion in       additional tax revenue over a decade. Treasury Department       officials believe that this estimate is overly conservative       and that an agency with more robust audit abilities will       deter tax cheats.        Democrats are expected to consider the additional funding       as part of a new package, the Inflation Reduction Act, which       includes raising taxes on corporations and lowering       prescription drug costs, among other provisions. The overall       package has garnered stiff opposition from Republicans and       would need every Senate Democrat to support it in order to       pass.        Among the provisions that Republicans oppose is the I.R.S.       funding. Republicans have a long history of trying to starve       the I.R.S. of funds and have complained for years that it is       being used as a political weapon and unfairly targets       conservative groups.        The agency's scrutiny has crossed party lines, according to       the I.R.S. inspector general. But it came under fire again       last month after The New York Times reported that James B.       Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and his deputy, Andrew G.       McCabe--both perceived enemies of former President Donald J.       Trump--faced rare, exhaustive audits during the Trump       administration. The I.R.S. said Mr. Rettig had not been       involved in the audits.        In assailing the proposed legislation, the Republican       National Committee claimed this week that an ``army'' of       87,000 I.R.S. agents would ``disproportionately target poorer       Americans.''        Mr. Rettig, whose term expires later this year, insisted on       Thursday that those suggestions were unfounded.        ``Large corporate and high-net-worth taxpayers often engage       teams of sophisticated representatives pursuing unsettled or       sometimes questionable interpretations of tax law,'' he said.       ``The integrity and fairness of our tax administrative system       relies upon the ability of our agency to maintain a strong,       visible, robust enforcement presence directed to these and       other similarly situated noncompliant taxpayers.''                       [From AP NEWS, Mar. 10, 2022]        IRS Plans To hire 10,000 Workers To Relieve Massive Backlog                            (By Fatima Hussein)         Washington (AP).--The IRS said Thursday it plans to hire       10,000 new workers to help reduce a massive backlog that the       government says will make this tax season the most       challenging in history.        The agency released a plan to work down the tens of       millions of filings that includes speeding up the       traditionally slow hiring process, relying more on automated       processes and bringing on more contract workers to help with       mailroom and paper processing. Getting it done will be the       big challenge, tax experts say.        The agency faces a backlog of around 20 million pieces of       correspondence, which is more than 15 times as large as in a       normal filing season, according to the agency. And the IRS       workforce is the same size it was in 1970, though the U.S.       population has grown exponentially and the U.S. tax code has       become increasingly complicated.        Additionally, the need to administer pandemic-related       programs has imposed an entirely new workload on the agency.        White House officials have said the agency is not equipped       to serve taxpayers even in nonpandemic years. A senior       administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity       Thursday to preview the new IRS plan, said processing returns       will continue to be a massive challenge so long as the agency       operates on 1960s infrastructure.        The IRS' latest plan to combat the current backlog includes       creating a 700-person surge team to process new returns,       adding 2,000 contractors to respond to taxpayer questions       about stimulus and child tax credit payments and developing       new automated voice and chat bots to answer taxpayer       questions.        There is no plan to extend the current April 18 filing       deadline, the senior official said. The new IRS plan comes as       lawmakers have made persistent calls for additional federal       funding for the agency.        Congress' mammoth $1.5 trillion omnibus package, released       early Wednesday, would provide $14.3 billion to the Treasury       Department, including $12.6 billion devoted to the IRS. That       would be the largest funding increase for the tax agency       since 2001.        However, Republicans have questioned the need for       additional funding. Florida Sen. Rick Scott's ``11 Point Plan       to Rescue America,'' unveiled in February, proposes a 50% cut       in funding and workforce at the IRS.        The White House and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell       have roundly rejected Scott's idea.        Caroline Bruckner, a tax professor at the American       University Kogod School of Business, said the agency is ``at       a competitive disadvantage'' for finding new staff based on       its reputation for employees being wholly overworked. She       said she based this on her own survey of tax students she       teaches.        Bruckner said, ``It's absurd we have put so much work on       the IRS'' without giving it the necessary resources to help       Americans in the way that is expected.        Bruckner says along with increased funding, the IRS also       ``really has to change its narrative and the way it talks       about its mission to one of service and being one of the most       important antipoverty systems that we have in the U.S.''                         [From TIME, Aug. 9, 2022]    Trump Allies Are Attacking Biden For a Plan To Hire 87,000 New IRS                         Agents That Doesn't Exist                           (By Eric Cortellessa)         Since news broke on Monday that the FBI searched former       President Donald Trump's South Florida home, Republican       members of Congress and right-wing media figures have       launched a new line of attack against Democrats: that the       Internal Revenue Service intends to use nearly $80 billion in       new funding to pursue similar intrusions on average       Americans. Those dollars, Trump allies are saying, will go       toward the hiring of 87,000 new IRS agents.        ``Do you make $75,000 or less?'' tweeted House Minority       Leader Kevin McCarthy. ``Democrats'' new army of 87,000 IRS       agents will be coming for you--with 710,000 new audits for       Americans who earn less than $75k.'' Richard Grenell, Trump's       former Acting Director of National Intelligence, wrote on the       social media platform: ``The FBI raids Trump's house and the       Democrats vote to add 87,000 new IRS agents to go after       Americans. Wake up, America.''        Other high-profile conservatives have insinuated that the       Biden administration intends to direct those additional       auditors to dig up dirt on the President's political       opponents. ``After todays raid on Mar A Lago what do you       think the left plans to use those 87,000 new IRS agents       for?'' tweeted Sen. Marco Rubio.        It's a notion that has taken off like wildfire, signaling       what is likely to be a prominent broadside from Republicans       against Democrats in the midterm elections.        There's only one problem. It's not true.        The Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark climate, health       care and tax package that passed the Senate on Sunday and is       expected to head to Biden's desk after the House approves it       on Friday, includes roughly $78 billion for the IRS to be       phased in over 1O years. A Treasury Department report from       May 2021 estimated that such an investment would enable the       agency to hire roughly 87,000 employees by 2031. But most of       those hires would not be Internal Revenue agents, and       wouldn't be new positions.        According to a Treasury Department official, the funds       would cover a wide range of positions including IT       technicians and taxpayer services support staff, as well as       experienced auditors who would be largely tasked with       cracking down on corporate and high-income tax evaders. ``It       is wholly inaccurate to describe any of these resources as       being about increasing audit scrutiny of the middle class or       small businesses,'' Natasha Sarin, a counselor for tax policy       and implementation at the Treasury Department, tells TIME.        At the same time, more than half of the agency's current       employees are eligible for retirement and are expected to       leave the agency within the next five years. ``There's a big       wave of attrition that's coming and a lot of these resources       are just about filling those positions,'' says Sarin, an       economist who has studied tax avoidance extensively and who       was tapped by the Biden administration to beef up the IRS's       auditing power.        In all, the IRS might net roughly 20,000 to 30,000 more       employees from the new funding, enough to restore the tax-      collecting agency's staff to where it was roughly a decade       ago.        The IRS currently has roughly 78,000 employees. According       to John Koskinen, who served as IRS commissioner from 2013 to       2017, that's down from around 100,000 when he  [[Page H7567]]       first started. By the time he resigned four years later, he       said, it was clear that the agency was in the grip of a       systematic attempt by the GOP to weaken it.        ``Nobody loves tax collectors,'' Koskinen tells TIME.        It's an effort that goes back to 2010, when Republicans       took back control of the House of Representatives and       immediately instituted a series of crippling cuts on the IRS.       Since then, overall funding for the IRS has fallen further,       by more than 20 percent, while enforcement funding has       dropped by 31 percent. That's made it easier for high-net-      worth tax cheats and major corporations to avoid federal       taxes to the tune of billions of dollars.        ``The largest corporations in the United States with over       $20 billion of assets have had their rate of audits go from       nearly 100% to 50%,'' says Janet Holtzblattt, a senior fellow       at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. ``Among wealthy       individuals who had a positive income of a million dollars or       more, the audit rate fell from 8.4% in 2010 to 2.4% in       2019.''        Meanwhile, the employee shortage only made it harder for       average Americans to reach IRS customer support, which has       been inundated with requests far beyond what the staff could       handle. ``I used to say there's no Democratic or Republican       way to run the IRS,'' Koskinen says. ``The people who are       significantly disadvantaged are the average taxpayers who       have a simple question and can't get through. Those are       Republicans as well as independents and Democrats.'' As of       last month, the IRS backlog included 10.2 million unprocessed       individual returns.        Funding from the Inflation Reduction Act will also go       toward tech modernization. The IRS currently uses technology       from the 1960s, called COBOL, to process and intake       individual tax returns. According to government officials,       the agency has struggled to find workers who are still       equipped to code under the antiquated system.        The increased funding for the IRS is a key part of       Democrats' plan to pay for the Inflation Reduction Act. By       going more forcefully after tax cheats and increasing       compliance, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the       agency will increase revenue by $204 billion over the next       decade.        Yet while the IRS may be in desperate need of more funding,       it's not exactly most Americans' favorite government       institution. Nobody likes to fork over a big check to Uncle       Sam. Which is a big reason why Republicans are likely to keep       hammering this point in the coming months, and potentially       pointing to 87,000 new IRS agents who will never materialize.        ``I think a lot of people are going to be upset by this       across the country and across the political spectrum,'' Hogan       Gidley, Trump's former White House deputy press secretary,       tells TIME, when asked about IRS funding. He falsely       described the Biden administration's plan as hiring ``85,000       IRS agents to come after mom-and-pop businesses.''        But if Gidley's right, Americans will only be angry because       of what Republicans are telling them about the IRS--not       what's actually happening there.                  [From The New York Times, Aug. 10, 2022]  For Older Americans, Health Bill Will Bring Savings and `Peace of Mind'                 (By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Noah Weiland)         Washington.--After Pete Spring was diagnosed with dementia       in 2016, he and his wife emptied their checking account in       part to pay for his prescription drugs, then ran through       $60,000 in pension payments before resorting to a charge card       to help make sure Mr. Spring had the heart and Alzheimer's       medications he needed to survive--just two of the 11 drugs he       took. Mr. Spring, of Marietta, Ga., died in April, before the       unveiling of the tax, climate and health bill that the Senate       passed over the weekend. The measure aims to lower the cost       of prescription drugs for people on Medicare, like him; his       wife, Gretchen Van Zile, has been left to look back on what       felt like an outrageous injustice.        ``Here seniors are in their golden years,'' said Ms. Van       Zile, 74, ``and the only people seeing gold are the       pharmaceutical companies.''        Nearly 49 million people, most of them older Americans, get       prescription drug coverage through Medicare, yet many find       that it does not go very far. Low-income people quality for       government subsidies, so those in the middle class--people       like Mr. Spring and Ms. Van Zile--are hit hardest by high       drug costs.        The Senate bill, which the House is expected to pass on       Friday, then send to President Biden's desk, could save many       Medicare beneficiaries hundreds, if not thousands of dollars       a year. Its best-known provision would empower Medicare to       negotiate prices with drug makers with the goal of driving       down costs--a move the pharmaceutical industry has fought for       years, and one that experts said would help lower costs for       beneficiaries.        But the legislation would also take more direct steps to       keep money in people's pocketbooks, though they would be       phased in over time.        Beginning next year, insulin co-payments for Medicare       recipients would be capped at $35 a month. As of 2024, those       with costs high enough to qualify for the program's       ``catastrophic coverage'' benefit would no longer have to       pick up 5 percent of the cost of every prescription. And       starting in 2025, out-of-pocket costs for prescription       medicines would be capped at $2,000 annually.        ``This is a huge policy change and one that has been a long       time coming,'' said Dr. Stacie Dusetzina, an associate       professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University. ``For       people needing high-cost drugs, this will provide significant       financial relief.''        Between 2009 and 2018, the average price more than doubled       for brand-name prescription drugs in Medicare Part D, the       program that covers products dispensed by pharmacies, the       Congressional Budget Office found. Between 2019 and 2020,       price increases outpaced inflation for half of all drugs       covered by Medicare, according to an analysis from the Kaiser       Family Foundation.        Perhaps no drug has been talked about as much as insulin,       the diabetes medication that is more than 100 years old.       Prices for insulin and its analogues have risen so fast that       many diabetes patients who rely on the drug put themselves at       risk by taking less than is prescribed to cut costs.        More than three million Medicare beneficiaries take one of       the 42 different types of insulin that are covered by       Medicare, according to an estimate by the Kaiser Family       Foundation, which found that the average out-of-pocket cost       is $54 a month. But for some people, the costs are much       higher.        Evelyn Polay, 82, of Merrick, N.Y., spends more than $1,200       every three months on four different diabetes medicines,       including Humalog and another type of injectable insulin,       which she has been taking for about 30 years.        She still works as a part-time bookkeeper and counts       herself as fortunate. ``It's not a question of do I eat or do       I take my medicine,'' she said.        But she worries about other people, including her own       grandchildren, three of whom also have diabetes. Democrats       tried to apply the bill's proposed $35 co-payment to all       insulin prescriptions, including those covered by private       insurers. But Republican senators forced the removal of that       language--even though seven of them wanted to keep it in the       bill. To hear the voices of older Americans who confront high       drug costs month in and month out is to hear fear and worry,       anger and stress. Many say they are figuring out how to get       by, skipping vacations and other niceties for which they       saved.        For Kim Armbruster, 65, who recently retired after a 40-      year nursing career, keeping down the costs of her       medications for diabetes, psoriatic arthritis and Graves'       disease, an autoimmune disorder affecting the thyroid, has       been a scramble since she started on Medicare in March. Ms.       Armbruster, of Cary, Ill., said she had saved extra insulin       from prescriptions filled when she had commercial insurance,       enough to keep costs down before a monthly cap kicks in. But       her other conditions have caused immense financial strain.        By June, she had reached Medicare's threshold for       catastrophic coverage after paying more than $7,000 for       Enbrel, a drug she takes for the arthritis; Synthroid, which       she takes for Graves' disease; Eliquis, for atrial       fibrillation, insulin and her insulin pump.        ``It's all about thinking ahead, looking for alternatives       and strategizing the home budget to be able to take the       necessary meds,'' she said. Learning to keep up with costs,       she added, had been like ``baptism by fire, to learn       everything I can possibly learn about it to maneuver drug       costs and stay healthy without complications.''        The carousel of medications taken by Mr. Spring, the       dementia patient who died in April, included eye-popping       price tags for drugs including Eliquis, for a heart       condition, and Namenda, an Alzheimer's drug. Mr. Spring also       took an antidepressant and medications to dull the side       effects from Namenda.        Those drugs ran the couple around $1,000 a month. Had the       $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap been in place when her       husband was alive, Ms. Van Zile said, they would have reached       it by March every year. Ms. Van Zile retired from her job       working for Fulton County in Georgia so that she could take       care of her husband, further cramping their savings. ``His       sense of humor put a smile on my face every day,'' she said.       ``The bitter aspect of it was the financial stress.''        Democrats have been promising for years to lower the cost       of prescription drugs. So have some Republicans, including       former President Donald J. Trump. But the Senate bill passed       along party lines, without any Republican votes. In the 50-50       Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris broke the tie vote.        Republicans, and the pharmaceutical industry, insist that       the measure will stifle innovation and reverse progress on       therapies and treatments, including those for cancer care--a       high priority for Mr. Biden. The industry's main trade group,       PhRMA, says the bill, which imposes stiff penalties on       companies that refuse to negotiate, amounts to government       price setting--not negotiation.        At a media briefing last month, Stephen J. Ubl, the chief       executive of PhRMA, warned that Democrats were ``about to       make a historic mistake that will devastate patients       desperate for new cures.''        But backers of the measure say new treatments are       meaningless if patients can't afford them. The promise of       Medicare, enacted in 1965, has always been that it would take       care of older Americans. The prescription drug benefit was       not added until 2003.        It includes the provision for catastrophic coverage, in       which the government picks up the full cost of medicines--      except for 5 percent, paid by the patient--after an       individual  [[Page H7568]]       spends $7,050 a year out of pocket. The Kaiser Family       Foundation says that 1.3 million Medicare beneficiaries hit       the catastrophic threshold each year; 1.4 million have out-      of-pocket costs of $2,000 or more.        ``You rarely hear people complain about turning age 65 and       going on Medicare; it's often a relief,'' said Larry Levitt,       the foundation's executive vice president for health policy.       ``But the way Medicare now works, there can be some nasty       surprises for people with very high drug expenses, and this       bill will provide a lot of relief.''        A study conducted by Dr. Dusetzina highlighted how the       middle class gets squeezed. She examined 17,076 new       prescriptions issued between 2012 and 2018 for Part D       beneficiaries, and found that those receiving subsidies were       nearly twice as likely to obtain the prescribed drug within       90 days as those without subsidies.        Among those who did not qualify for subsidies, 30 percent       of all prescriptions for cancer drugs went unfilled, as did       more than 50 percent of prescriptions to treat immune system       disorders or high cholesterol.        Patti Kellerhouse, a 64-year-old in Henderson, Nev., was       diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in 2017 that had       spread to her liver. On long-term disability through her       employer, she had paid $10 a month out of pocket for the oral       cancer treatment she needed. But when she transitioned to a       Medicare Advantage plan, the medication cost more than $3,100       for the first month.        While she has been able to afford the price jump, it has       stressed her financial planning. She is saving money for a       new car, among other things. She said she has daughters and       grandchildren whom she would like to continue supporting.        ``I worked hard my whole life,'' she said. ``These are high       co-payments. They shouldn't happen when you're at retirement       age.''        Many Americans make tough choices about whether to continue       taking drugs they need. Bob Miller, a 71 year-old multiple       sclerosis patient in Prior Lake, Minn., is among them.        Every other day for 12 years, Mr. Miller took Betaseron, a       brand-name prescription drug that can delay the progression       of his disease by staving off flare-ups of numbness, muscle       stiffness and other symptoms that can leave patients worse       off than they were before. But the drug was expensive; even       with his Medicare insurance, it cost more than $10,000 a       year.        So he quit taking the drug in 2016 after consulting with       his doctors, who told him he could ``roll the dice'' and       survive without it--at least for the time being. Since then,       he has lived with the unsettling worry that he is gambling       with his own health.        ``In the background, you don't know what's going on,'' Mr.       Miller said. 'There might still be some damage being done to       my nerve fibers.''        When a neurologist recently told him it might help to go       back on a disease-modifying drug, Mr. Miller told him he       would like to, if not for the prohibitive cost. The new       legislation, he said, will deliver something he has been       longing for: ``Peace of mind.''     Mr. Speaker, seniors know that this bill will help  bring down their healthcare and prescription drug costs dramatically.  Passing this bill will be a huge sigh of relief for 34 million  Americans covered by Medicare.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Neguse), a distinguished member of the Committee on  Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   For anybody to suggest that the IRS is somehow coming after people is  absurd and dangerous. This fear-mongering has to stop.   Yesterday, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee,  Chuck Grassley, made this outrageous statement that armed IRS agents  will go door-to-door with assault rifles after this bill passes. All I  can say to that is everyone grab your tinfoil hats.   I mean, in response, Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden said: ``It is  unbelievable that we even need to say this, but there are not going to  be 87,000 armed IRS agents going door-to-door with assault weapons.''   This is funding for answering phone calls, upgrading computer  systems, and getting our constituents the refunds that they have been  waiting for, for months and months.   I get it. My Republican friends do not want to give the IRS the  ability to go after wealthy tax cheats, big corporations that are using  every loophole possible to avoid paying taxes. But do you know what?  Our constituents have to pay their fair share. These rich people ought  to pay their fair share, as well.   I get it. My Republican friends, when they were in charge, passed a  $2 trillion tax cut to make it easier for the rich and powerful to  cheat on their taxes. This Democratic majority is going to make sure  they pay their fair share.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to make clear to my colleagues that, actually, in  the Senate bill, there was explicit language that made it very clear  that none of this money would be used for audits for people earning  $400,000 or less or targeting small businesses. But Republicans over in  the Senate insisted that the language be stripped out, and now they are  complaining about it.   But do you know what? I have good news for you.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Treasury Secretary  Janet Yellen that makes it crystal clear that that is not what is going  to happen, along with a letter from Donald Trump's appointed IRS  Commissioner, who is still there, who made it very clear that it won't  be used for that.                                          Secretary of the Treasury,                                      Department of the Treasury,                                    Washington, DC, August 10, 2022.      Charles P. Rettig,      Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service,      Washington, DC.        Dear Commissioner: The Inflation Reduction Act includes       much-needed funding for the IRS to improve taxpayer service,       modernize outdated technological infrastructure, and increase       equity in the tax system by enforcing the tax laws against       those high-earners, large corporations, and complex       partnerships who today do not pay what they owe.        These crucial investments have been a focus of the Biden       Administration since the President's first day in office, and       I was heartened to see the legislation pass the Senate this       weekend.        Notwithstanding the changes that arose because of       Republican challenges during the Byrd process, I write today       to confirm the commitment that has been a guiding precept of       the planning that you and your team are undertaking: that       audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for       households making under $400,000 annually.        Specifically, I direct that any additional resources--      including any new personnel or auditors that are hired--shall       not be used to increase the share of small business or       households below the $400,000 threshold that are audited       relative to historical levels. This means that, contrary to       the misinformation from opponents of this legislation, small       business or households earning $400,000 per year or less will       not see an increase in the chances that they are audited.        Instead, enforcement resources will focus on high-end       noncompliance. There, sustained, multiyear funding is so       critical to the agency's ability to make the investments       needed to pursue a robust attack on the tax gap by targeting       crucial challenges, like large corporations, high-networth       individuals and complex pass-throughs, where today the IRS       has resources to initiate just 7,500 audits annually out of       more than 4 million returns received.        This is challenging work that requires a team of       sophisticated revenue agents in place to spend thousands of       hours poring over complicated returns, and it is also work       that has huge revenue potential: indeed, an additional hour       auditing someone making more than $5 million annually       generates an estimated $4,500 of additional taxes collected.       This is essential work that I know the IRS is eager to       undertake.        For regular taxpayers, as you emphasized last week, the       result of this resource infusion will be a lower likelihood       of audit by an agency that has the data and technological       infrastructure in place to target enforcement resources where       they belong--on the high end of the income distribution,       where the top 1 percent alone is estimated to not be paying       $160 billion in owed taxes each year. That's important as a       matter of revenue-raising, but it's also essential as a       matter of fairness.        Crucially, these resources will support a much-needed       upgrade of technology that is decades out-of-date, and an       investment in taxpayer service so that the IRS is finally       able to communicate with taxpayers in an efficient, timely       manner. I look forward to working with you on creating new       digital tools to allow taxpayers to get information from the       IRS instantaneously and on improving taxpayer service, so the       agency is well-equipped to answer calls when they come in.        This historic investment in our tax system will accomplish       two critical objectives. It will raise substantial revenue to       address the  [[Page H7571]]       deficit; and it will create a fairer system, where those at       the top who do not today comply with their tax obligations       find it far less easy to do so, and where all taxpayers       receive the service from the IRS that they deserve, and that       your dedicated workforce is eager to deliver. The importance       of the work ahead cannot be overstated.            Sincerely,      Janet L. Yellen.                                   ____                                         department of the Treasury,                                        Internal Revenue Service,                                      Washington DC, August 4, 2022.        Dear Member of the United States House of Representatives:       It has been the greatest honor of my professional life to       spend the last four years at the helm of the IRS. I am struck       each day by the commitment of dedicated IRS employees to       helping American families. And our employees have done all       that without the tools to do so effectively. For too long,       the agency has not had the resources that it needs to ensure       the tax laws are enforced fairly and that Americans receive       the level and quality of service they deserve. We are the       greatest country in the world, yet the agency that touches       more Americans than any other continually struggles to       receive sufficient resources to fulfill its important       mission.        The resources in the reconciliation package will get us       back to historical norms in areas of challenge for the       agency--large corporate and global high-net-worth taxpayers--      as well as new areas like pass-through entities and       multinational taxpayers with international tax issues, where       we need sophisticated, specialized teams in place that are       able to unpack complex structures and identify noncompliance.        These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit       scrutiny on small businesses or middle-income Americans. As       we've been planning, our investment of these enforcement       resources is designed around the Department of the Treasury's       directive that audit rates will not rise relative to recent       years for households making under $400,000. Other resources       will be invested in employees and IT systems that will allow       us to better serve all taxpayers, including small businesses       and middle-income taxpayers. Enhanced IT systems and taxpayer       service will actually mean that honest taxpayers will be       better able to comply with the tax laws, resulting in a lower       likelihood of being audited and a reduced burden on them.        Large corporate and high-net-worth taxpayers often engage       teams of sophisticated representatives who pursue unsettled       or sometimes questionable interpretations of tax law. The       integrity and fairness of our tax administrative system       relies upon the ability of our agency to maintain a strong,       visible, robust enforcement presence directed to these and       other similarly situated taxpayers when they are       noncompliant. These important efforts also support honest       taxpayers who voluntarily comply with their filing and       reporting requirements.        The IRS has fewer front-line, experienced examiners in the       field than at any time since World War II, and fewer       employees than at any time since the 1970s. Advances in       technology have been helpful but have not kept pace with the       ever-increasing responsibilities and challenges facing the       IRS. As a result, the IRS has for too long been unable to       pursue meaningful, impactful examinations of large corporate       and high-net-worth taxpayers to ensure they are paying their       fair share. This creates a direct revenue loss from evaders       and lessens the potential to deter others from pursuing a       similar path of noncompliance. Every American should support       a fair and impartial system of tax administration supported       by an appropriately resourced tax administrator. In fact, the       continued success of our country depends, in part, upon the       success of the agency in appropriately, fairly and       impartially enforcing the tax laws and in providing       meaningful, impactful services to every American.        As an extremely proud American, I'm grateful for your       support of the IRS and our dedicated employees. I cannot be       forceful enough in emphasizing that these resources will be       transformative for the agency and for American taxpayers. I       am available to meet with you at your convenience to discuss       the foregoing.        Thank you,                                                 Charles P. Rettig.    Mr. Speaker, let's stop the misinformation and stop the  fear-mongering.   I get it. My Republican friends do not want to lower the costs of  prescription drugs for senior citizens. They don't want to do anything  about climate change. They don't want to pay down the deficit or the  debt. I get it. But we do, and the American people do, and I am proud  of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters), the distinguished chairwoman of the Committee  on Financial Services.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr.   David Scott), the distinguished chairman of the  Committee on Agriculture.                                time  1015     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 15  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please stop the  fearmongering and pandering to the extremists.   People are listening when people speak on this House floor. We had  someone show up at an FBI field office with a nail gun. Enough of the  misinformation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a Washington Post  piece titled, ``Climate change's impact intensifies as U.S. prepares to  take action.''                 [From The Washington Post, Aug. 11, 2022]    Climate Change's Impact Intensifies as U.S. Prepares To Take Action              (By Chris Mooney, Brady Dennis and Sarah Kaplan)         For residents of the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, the       United States' recent success in clinching a major piece of       climate change legislation may feel like too little, too       late.        Over the past 40 years, as the world's largest historical       emitter of greenhouses gases repeatedly failed to take       significant action on the climate, the region surrounding       Svalbard has warmed at least four times faster than the       global average, according to significant research published       Thursday.        The study suggests that warming in the Arctic is happening       at a much faster rate than many scientists had expected. And       while U.S. lawmakers this summer hashed out the details of a       massive bill to speed their nation's shift toward cleaner       energy--the culmination of months of deliberations--the new       findings were just the latest visceral reminder that the       planet's changing climate isn't waiting around for human       action.        Recent studies on subjects including tree mortality in       North America and evidence of weakening ice-shelves in       Antarctica, combined with a stream of extreme weather events       that include last month's European heat wave and torrential       floods of late in Kentucky and South Korea, are providing       steady evidence of global warming's intensifying impact on       the planet.        The Arctic is where some of the shifts are most severe.        Svalbard, a cluster of Arctic islands famed for populations       of polar bears, experienced its hottest June on record. A       record 40 billion tons of ice from the archipelago had melted       into the ocean by the end of July. Melting permafrost and       unstable mountain slopes are threatening homes.        And that's just a sampling from a region that has warmed at       an astounding rate--roughly 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees       Fahrenheit) since 1979.        ``It's a really vulnerable environment in the Arctic, and       seeing these numbers, it's worrying,'' said Antti Lipponen, a       scientist with the Finnish Meteorological Institute who       contributed to Thursday's peer-reviewed study published in       Communications Earth & Environment.        The study provides sobering context for this week's       expected passage by the House of Representatives of the       Inflation Reduction Act. Experts say it is a landmark piece       of legislation that will drive down U.S. emissions of       greenhouse gases by incentivizing the purchase of electric       vehicles and energy-efficient appliances, and a quickening       pace of renewable-energy installations. Recent estimates       suggest that the bill could lower U.S. greenhouse gas       emissions by as much as a billion tons per year by the end of       2030.        But that's still tiny, compared with the more than 2       trillion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide gas that       humanity has emitted since the year 1850--a figure that does       not include any other warming gases, such as methane, which       also is playing a major role in the world's temperature       increases.        The Inflation Reduction Act will mark ``an historic       moment'' for the United States--one that hasn't seemed       plausible since President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al       Gore pushed for significant action in the 1990s, said Bill       Hare, a climate scientist and the chief executive at Climate       Analytics, a prominent science and policy institute. The bill       could have a global ripple effect that spurs other countries       to take more ambitious steps, Hare said.        Yet, Hare noted that the legislation does not bring the       United States to President Biden's goal of cutting emissions       at least in half by 2030 from their 2005 levels. It also       includes provisions for additional oil and gas drilling and       easing permitting processes for fossil fuel infrastructure--      contradicting findings from the United Nations       Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the world must       nearly eliminate coal and significantly slash the use of oil       and natural gas to have a hope of avoiding catastrophic       warming.        At the same time, Hare noted, there is an ongoing ``rush       for gas'' in Africa and Australia ``that is quite       inconsistent with the Paris agreement,'' the 2015 accord in       which nations vowed to progressively lower their emissions to       avoid dangerous levels of warming. And Russia's war in       Ukraine has prompted a near-term scramble for fossil fuels       even in relatively climate-conscious Europe.        These forces continue to push the world off track from       meeting the Paris accord's most ambitious goal: limiting       global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7       degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Beyond that       threshold, experts warn, the world faces a future of chronic       food crises, escalating natural disasters and collapsing       ecosystems.        Already, with the world have warmed by roughly 1.1 degrees       Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit), deadly climate impacts are       unfolding. Europe is broiling amid record-setting heat waves       that have scorched crops and sparked wildfires. At least       eight people were killed in Seoul as the heaviest rainfall in       more than 100 years deluged the South Korean capital.       Droughts have ravaged Mexico and contributed to a spiraling       hunger crisis in East Africa. In the United States, people       are dying of extreme heat, and in overwhelming Hoods and       raging wildfires.        ``This summer is just a horrorscape,'' said Kim Cobb, a       climate scientist at Brown University and the lead author of       the IPCC's most recent report on the science of climate       change. ``And I know it won't be stopping in the near term.''        These disasters underscore what an exploding body of       scientific research continues to show: that adverse climate       change continues to outpace the plodding progress of       political action. Even a historic investment such as the       Inflation Reduction Act, Cobb said, is dwarfed by the scale       of the crisis.        ``There needs to be an infinite acceleration in frequency       of this kind of legislation,'' she said. ``I think the planet       is sending that message pretty loud and clear.''                        Startling trends in the Arctic         Take the new Arctic study, which shows that the amplified       warming occurring at the top of the planet, while long       expected, exceeds what climate models predict by a noticeable       margin. ``We suspect that either this is an extremely       unlikely event, or the climate models systematically       underestimate this Arctic amplification,'' Lipponen said of       the rapid pace of Arctic warming.  [[Page H7574]]         The study takes as its starting point the year 1979 because       of the availability of satellite data covering the Arctic. It       defines the Arctic as the region above the Arctic Circle, and       the authors acknowledge that if longer periods are considered       or if the Arctic is defined more broadly, the rate of Arctic       warming can appear somewhat less.        The warming is most concentrated to the east of Svalbard,       in the Barents and Kara seas, regions that have also seen       some of the fastest loss of Arctic sea ice. This ice has       traditionally reflected a huge amount of the sun's heat back       into space, keeping the planet cool. But as it vanishes from       the sea surface, more sunlight is absorbed by the ocean--and       then the warmer sea surface supports even less ice.        It is one of the most well-known climate ``feedbacks''--a       phenomenon through which an effect of warming contributes to       further warmth. Although scientists try to account for this       feedback in the models they use to predict future climate       change, they might be underestimating it. At the extreme, the       new study finds some regions between Svalbard and the Russian       island of Novaya Zemlya that are warming at a rate of over       1.25 degrees Celsius, or 2.25 degrees Fahrenheit, every       decade,        That's massively disruptive to Arctic life, human and       otherwise.        But interconnections among the ice, atmosphere, land and       ocean mean that no part of the planet will be unaffected. As       extreme temperatures bake the carbon-rich permafrost of       northern landscapes, the thawing earth releases carbon       dioxide gas.        Even as people begin to cut their emissions, nature's       emissions have just begun.                              A sudden collapse         There's also concerning news from the other pole.        NASA scientists, led by Chad Greene, have derived a       technique allowing them to study the enormous, sometimes       country-size platforms of ice, called ice shelves, that       encircle Antarctica. These are Earth's main defenses against       massive sea level rise, acting as a bracing mechanism that       holds back Antarctica's inland ice.        But the shelves are sustaining severe damage. Several, like       Larsen A and B, have collapsed entirely. Thwaites Glacier,       Antarctica's most worrying and perhaps most vulnerable spot,       has lost about 2 trillion tons of ice from its ice shelf,       which has dramatically retracted inland, new research found.       The overall area lost from Antarctic ice shelves since 1997--      about 14,000 square miles--is a little bit larger than       Maryland and represents about 2 percent of the total ice       shelf area.        As a reminder of these ice shelves' vulnerability, the       Conger Ice Shelf in East Antarctica--traditionally thought to       be the coldest and most stable part of the ice sheet--      suddenly collapsed this year.        Conger was not very large for an Antarctic shelf--merely       the size of a large city. But its unexpected collapse--which       appears to have been triggered by a sudden period of unusual       warmth--should prompt alarm, scientist say.        ``It means that Antarctica's ice shelves are vulnerable,       and they can still surprise us,'' NASA's Greene, who works at       the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said of the event.       Greene's study, which appeared in Nature this week, was co-      written with colleagues from NASA and the University of       Tasmania.        ``Conger counters a common expectation that ice shelf       collapse should only occur after a long period of thinning       and weakening,'' he continued. ``Conger tells us that ice       shelves can collapse without any warning signs whatsoever.''                          Imperiled northern forests         In another sign of the swiftly shifting climate, new       research this week also details how tree species that       dominate North American boreal forests--including firs,       spruces and pines--are experiencing growing stress and a       decline in the survival of saplings in response to rising       temperatures and reduced rainfall.        The five-year, open-air experiment details how critical       trees that have populated the southern edge of boreal       forests--a key ecosystem for wildlife, timber production and       for soaking up massive amounts of carbon dioxide--are       suffering profound impacts as the world warms. But the       species that are most likely to replace them, such as maples,       are not poised to expand their distribution fast enough to       fully replace the trees that are on their way toward dying       out.        ``The species that are most abundant there are much more       vulnerable to climate change than I and other scientists had       thought,'' said Peter Reich, a lead author of the study also       published in Nature and a longtime forest ecology professor       at the University of Minnesota.        If current trends continue, Reich said, swaths of boreal       forests ``will be impoverished, and they might even fall       apart or collapse'' over the next half-century unless warming       slows. ``The take-home message for me is that a large part of       boreal forests, one of the largest carbon sinks in the world,       is probably going to take a pretty good hit in the next 40,       50 years, even in a best-case scenario,'' he said.        That's disturbing news, because Earth needs to gain       forests, not lose them, as people try to employ every trick       in the book to get carbon that is in the atmosphere back into       plants, soils, rocks and even underground storage caverns.        Reich sees his most recent findings in a broader context:       While the climate-focused legislation expected to pass in       Congress this week is a positive, the impacts of climate       change will continue to accelerate, and they will require       more far-reaching action.        Reich called the Inflation Reduction Act a ``good first       step'' but added that ``even in the most optimistic scenario,       there's going to be a lot of pain and suffering.''        ``It's going to take an economic toll on poor and rich       alike in the future,'' he said. ``We shouldn't pat ourselves       on the back and say, `Mission accomplished.' ''     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).    Mr. Speaker, I don't see any other speakers on our  side, so I yield to the gentleman for his closing, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The decision before us is simple. I don't know what my friends across  the aisle find so off-putting about making historic investments in  healthcare, cutting costs at pharmacy counters, combating climate  change, slashing energy prices, and reducing the Federal deficit. Maybe  they are just angry that we want to lower costs for the American people  by making the wealthy pay their fair share. Or maybe it is because they  know that this bill will put their Big Pharma and Big Oil buddies on  notice.   Do you know what? I am proud of what we are finally doing here. I am  proud that we are finally allowing drug prices to be negotiated to  lower those costs. I am proud that we are extending the biggest  expansion in healthcare coverage in a decade. I am proud that we are  reducing future energy costs for thousands of families. I am proud that  we are making the biggest investment to combat climate change ever.   Today, we are putting people over politics. People over politics,  that is what Democrats are about. Today, we are delivering.   I know it took a while to get us to this point. It is a testament to  the President and the Vice President. It is a testament to the Speaker  of the House and to the Democrats on both sides of the Capitol that we  are finally pushing this across the finish line. It is a testament to  the climate activists,  [[Page H7575]]  especially the young people who have been fighting for action. It is a  testament to the senior activists, groups like AARP, that have been  fighting tirelessly to get prescription drug costs down lower so  seniors don't have to choose between their prescription drugs and  paying their rent or their utility bills.   We have done it. We have moved the ball.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to seize this opportunity  before us. Vote for this rule and the underlying legislation so that  the American people can truly have a fair shot in the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1316    Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the following:         That immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the Senate       amendment to the bill H.R. 5376) to provide for       reconciliation pursuant to title II of S.
