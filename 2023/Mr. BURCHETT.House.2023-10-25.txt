 Mr. Speaker, let's be honest. If Hamas puts down its  guns, peace will happen. If Israel does that, they will be slaughtered.   In these brutal attacks by Hamas terrorists, they have killed over  1,400 Israelis and taken over 200 hostages, including American  citizens. I thought it was very telling when I saw a Jewish father on  the news celebrating the fact that his daughter had died in the initial  attack because he was afraid that she had been abducted and all these  horrible, horrible things these dirtbags would have done to her.   We have had a few weeks of discontent here in this body, but today, I  think we all stand united with Israel as a body. Israel and the Jewish  people have long been targets. Hamas must understand their time is  over, and they are about to meet their fate and their maker.   We stand in solidarity with the people of Israel in their fight  against these worthless thugs--Hamas, Hezbollah, and any other Iranian- backed terrorist group. Our enemies must know that we are committed to  our allies and that our enemies will die.
