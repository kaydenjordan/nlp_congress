 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 79) expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives that Government shutdowns are detrimental to the Nation  and should not occur, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                 H. Res. 79         Whereas a portion of the United States Government was shut       down from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019;        Whereas the Senate, on December 19, 2018, unanimously       passed legislation to fund Government operations and avert a       Government shutdown but that legislation was not enacted;        Whereas the Government shutdown lasted for 35 days, the       longest Government shutdown in the history of our country;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations deprived Americans of       important services and caused 800,000 Federal workers to go       without pay for more than a month, imposing significant       financial hardships on those workers and their families;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations detrimentally affected       the Federal Government's ability to recruit and retain career       public servants;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations put at risk thousands       of small businesses with Federal contracts and created severe       financial hardship for tens of thousands of employees of       Federal contractors;        Whereas the top economic advisor to the President of the       United States predicted that the Government shutdown would       reduce economic growth by 0.1 percent for each week it       lasted;        Whereas the Congressional Budget Office has estimated the       direct effect of the shutdown to have cost our economy       $11,000,000,000 in lost gross domestic product;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations forced Transportation       Security Administration screeners and air traffic controllers       to work without pay, causing many to be unable to afford to       work and thereby putting at risk the safety and well-being of       the traveling public, leading to flight delays, and harming       airport security operations;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations put the health of all       Americans at risk by curtailing and delaying food safety       inspections;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations made our Nation less       safe by impeding Federal Bureau of Investigation efforts to       crack down on child trafficking, violent crime, and       terrorism;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations resulted in the       shuttering of and, in some cases, damage to, countless       national parks, monuments and other public lands;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations furloughed numerous       Federal employees at the Federal Emergency Management Agency       and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),       limiting the Federal Government's ability to help communities       rebuild after natural disasters;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations resulted in a majority       of Environmental Protection Agency employees being       furloughed, with negative consequences for public health and       the environment, such as halted clean-up work at hundreds of       toxic Superfund sites across the country, a cessation in       inspection and enforcement activities, and a stop to new       chemical and pesticide safety evaluations and approvals;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations delayed payment of       Department of Agriculture loans, operating loan decisions,       planting and marketing decisions and much-needed assistance       for farmers harmed by retaliatory tariffs imposed on American       agricultural exports, prevented the implementation of a new       farm bill with critical support for struggling dairy farmers       and other operations, and cast damaging uncertainty on the       nutrition assistance relied on by millions of vulnerable       Americans;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations delayed the issuance of       tax refunds to America's hard-working taxpayers;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations penalized small       business owners by halting the approval of Small Business       Administration loans;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations impeded the operations       of United States embassies abroad, undermining the ability of       United States personnel to combat terror, enforce sanctions,       and strengthen alliances;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations undermined the ability       of the Department of Homeland Security to respond to       increased cybersecurity threats, natural disasters, and       terror threats;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations delayed approval of       FHA-backed mortgages, putting Americans at risk of losing the       house they were attempting to buy or sell;        Whereas the lapse in appropriations hobbled the ability of       the Department of Housing and Urban Development to administer       the Section 8 low-income housing program that allows for HUD       to provide affordable rental housing to low-income tenants,       including the elderly and disabled;        Whereas Senator Mitch McConnell has called shutdowns ``a       failed policy'';        Whereas Senator Susan Collins said on January 23, 2019,       ``shutdowns represent the ultimate failure to govern and       should never be used as a weapon to achieve an outcome''; and        Whereas Senator Lamar Alexander said on January 24, 2019,       ``it is always wrong for either side to use shutting down the       Government as a bargaining chip in budget negotiations--it       should be as off-limits as chemical weapons are to warfare'':       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of       Representatives that--        (1) the shutdown of the Government of the United States, or       any portion thereof, causes substantial damage to Federal       employees, to every American who benefits directly or       indirectly from Federal services, to our Nation's economy,       and to the reputation of the United States around the world;        (2) shutting down the Government of the United States, or       any portion thereof, is not an acceptable tactic or strategy       for resolving differences regarding policy, funding levels,       or governing philosophy; and        (3) in the future the Congress must ensure the continued,       uninterrupted operations of the Government of the United       States and its services as well as its duty to protect and       promote the security of the American people.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 79.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am relieved and grateful that the longest government  shutdown in our Nation's history has ended. I am sure that many people  share these same feelings, including my colleagues. The American  people, and especially, the 800,000 Federal employees who were  furloughed or forced to work without pay for 35 days, have to be  relieved.   I hope that the one positive thing to come out of this experience is  universal recognition that government shutdowns are almost always  pointless exercises that are harmful to our country and our  constituents.   The Federal Government should be open for business and not closed.  That is why I strongly support H. Res. 79, the measure before us today.   Even though the recent shutdown affected only part of the Federal  Government, its impact was deeply felt throughout the country. The  Departments of Homeland Security, State, Treasury, Commerce, Justice,  Agriculture, the EPA, and NASA, were shuttered.   Operations at these agencies essentially came to a screeching halt:   Phone calls went unanswered as Federal workers were furloughed;   Safety inspections of industrial sites, factories, and power plants,  were halted because EPA inspectors were sent home;   Food inspections at the FDA ceased;   Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and  the Fish and Wildlife Service were furloughed.   Law enforcement officers at the FBI, DEA, Secret Service, and Customs  and Border Protection were the lucky ones. They got to work without  pay. These dedicated men and women, many of whom make only $60,000 a  year, missed more than a month's pay.   Just like other middle-class families, Federal employees have bills  to pay also: food, mortgages, rent, medical bills, student loans, and  car payments. And like so many other Americans, many live paycheck to  paycheck.   It is simply cruel to inflict such financial hardship and unnecessary  stress on workers who just want to do their jobs serving the American  people.   The greatest irony of the last shutdown is that immigration  enforcement and border protection suffered as a result, despite the  President's fixation on a wall, a brilliant 14th century solution to a  21st century problem.                                time  1215    The shutdown closed the immigration courts, contributing to an  already  [[Page H1308]]  significant backlog of cases and delays in deportation.   The harm ripples through our economy, touching everyone from Federal  employees to Federal contractors, to private sector businesses, and,  most importantly, to every American who relies upon the vital services  Federal workers provide.   The CBO estimated that the economic cost of the shutdown is $11  billion--that is $11 billion--almost twice the cost of the funding the  President seeks for his wall.   We must learn from this recent shutdown. We must not let it happen  again in a few short weeks. We can and must do better and work together  to prevent any future shutdowns, which I am certain my friends and  colleagues from North Carolina and Ohio want to do. I am sure they will  have a short response to opening statements and will probably join in  with us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, Missouri, like it is spelled.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am sure my friends on the other side will agree it  does no one good, it does this country no good, when we shut down  government.   I don't know about you, but my friend from North Carolina, I believe  he goes through airports sometimes. I will say this: Over the last 5  weeks, it was quite difficult for me to look in the eyes of my  constituents who happen to be TSA agents and tell them: ``I am sorry,  but you are going to miss a payday,'' or, ``You are going to miss  another payday.''   We are better than that. We are better than that as a Congress, as an  institution, and as a government.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.  Wexton), the sponsor of this legislation and my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank all of the body for engaging in this debate  and for the minority leader bringing forth those names. But let me say  that H. Res. 79 is not about the undocumented, nor is it a political  stunt. It is not messaging for some political purpose. This resolution  is about compassion and respect for fellow Americans who happen to be  Federal workers who deserve to stay on the job and deserve to get a  paycheck, and for the work and the service that they give to the rest  of the country.   My friends on the other side know better. They know better, that  shutdowns are harmful to our economy as well as our national security.  They know that. The Federal Government should always be open for  business, and Federal employees should not be held as hostages.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a favorable vote on the passage of H. Res. 79,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
