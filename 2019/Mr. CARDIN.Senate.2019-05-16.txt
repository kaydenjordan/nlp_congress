 Mr. President, I am going to take this time to speak  about Russia. But if I might, following up on the point by the Senator  from Alaska, first, I want to applaud the police officer you are  honoring this week.   This is National Police Week. I think it is very appropriate that we  recognize those who are serving our country and our community as first  responders.   I want to mention two police officers specifically, both of whom gave  their lives in defense of our community. These law enforcement officers  were young, and they went into danger rather than running away from  danger. We lost two of our officers last year.   Amy Sorrells Caprio from Baltimore County, my home jurisdiction, a  member of the Baltimore County Police Department, died before reaching  the age of 30, pursuing a burglary suspect who struck and killed her  with the vehicle being operated by the suspect. She leaves behind a  husband, parents, and sister. Our prayers are with her.   The second police officer I would like to honor is Mujahid Abdul  Mumin Ramzziddin, a 51-year-old police officer from Prince George's  County, MD, close to where we are right here. He was off duty, and he  observed the need to help a person who was a victim of domestic  violence. He went to help that person and was ultimately killed by the  perpetrator.   He leaves behind a wife and four children, and our prayers are also  with him.
