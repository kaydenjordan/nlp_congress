 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to conclude my remarks before recessing.    Madam President, I come to the floor today, as I have  done twice before over the past month, to sound the alarm about the new  administration's attacks on American energy. Yet there is still more to  talk about.   President Biden has continued this assault on American energy as well  as the American economy. Now he is taking that attack further. He is  taking the attack on energy around the world as well as attacking the  needs for energy of a number of our allies around the world. President  Biden signed an Executive order to cut off all loans for coal, oil, and  gas projects in some of the poorest nations in the world.   Now, some of these nations are our friends that we work with and we  try to help, and these are people who desperately need affordable  energy, and they don't have it.   Democrats close to the administration have reported that what the  administration and President Biden are trying to do is to ``isolate''  the Chinese Communist Party.   The Biden administration thinks that by refusing to make these loans  to folks around the world, that the Chinese Communist Party will be  shamed for using fossil fuels for energy and will shame the Communist  Party of China for loans that they make to countries to develop coal- fired powerplants, natural gas plants, and other projects that use  fossil fuel.   Let me tell you, the Chinese Communist Party will not be shamed.  China has a totalitarian regime; China puts Uighurs in concentration  camps. So I am not sure what makes President Biden and his  administration think that the Chinese Communist Party will be ashamed  of using an affordable reliable source of energy--coal.   In reality, President Biden, by this Executive order, is giving China  a gift. President Biden is giving China another advantage on the world  stage and putting ourselves at a disadvantage, if you think about it.   If the United States and those that we fund through the World Bank  refuse to provide loans to those countries to build the powerplants  that they need, that is going to leave a vacuum. They are going to need  to use the resources that they have--if they have plenty of coal or  natural gas--and the Chinese Communist Party is going to come in and  make the loan.   China already funds 7 out of 10 new coal plants around the world, and  thanks to President Biden's misguided effort, that is likely soon going  to be close to 10 out of 10.   Just like President Biden's other energy orders, this new policy will  make China stronger. It will make America weaker. China will have more  influence, and the United States will have less.   Now, this order is not going to hurt China at all. The people whom it  will hurt are those who look to the United States for help and for  friendship. It is going to especially hurt the 840 million people  around the world who don't have access to electricity today.   Developing countries desperately need the electricity. They need it  to be affordable. They need it to be reliable. So if you help  developing countries in terms of helping them get a stable supply of  energy, it is one of the best things we can do to help people around  the world in their fight against poverty.   Many parts of the world, countries with abundant energy resources,  just need our help and turn to us for our help so they can use the  resources that they have.   And let me give you a good example, Madam President, because you and  I have traveled to various places around the world and had a chance to  see men and women in uniform and thank them for their services, as we  have done, and gone to battlefields, as we have had family members who  have served in the military and defended this country and our freedoms.  And it has been a pleasure to be able to do that with you and share  that with your family because of our united heritage of fighting or our  family history of fighting for the country.   So a good example of what I am talking about is Kosovo. I have been  there on three separate occasions specifically to visit members of our  troops--the men and women in uniform, people from Wyoming who are  serving in Kosovo. I have been there three separate times. I was there  in 2019, was there previously for Thanksgiving, was there on Easter  Sunday one time to be with the troops.   Well, Kosovo is one of the poorest nations in Europe, but it has vast  energy resources. Despite being physically smaller than the State of  Connecticut, Kosovo has the fifth largest reserves of coal in the  world: small geography, massive resources of coal.   So the World Bank has cut off Kosovo's funding for a new state-of- the-art coal-fired powerplant. They have old coal-fired powerplants.  They are burning coal right now.   I have talked to the leaders of the country, and they say: We need to  build a new coal-fired powerplant. We need to borrow the money to do  it.   Well, the World Bank has said it is only going to support new energy  projects from renewable sources. So this is what Kosovo's Minister of  Economic Development is saying. He said: ``In a poor country [like]  Kosovo . . . we don't have the luxury . . .''--the luxury of focusing  only on renewable sources when they don't have that much access to  renewable energy. The wind doesn't blow that much; in terms of sunny  days, not at all during the winter, and they have this incredible  resource of coal.   Well, the Minister of Economic Development is absolutely correct-- because I have been there in the spring; I have been there in the  winter; I have been there different times throughout the year.  Developing countries cannot afford the elitist environmental agendas of  Presidents who become climate elitists, especially those being put in  charge of those issues, former Secretary of State John Kerry.   Let me repeat myself so--I want to just make this absolutely clear:  We, the United States, have peacekeeping troops in the country of  Kosovo. We have them right there in Kosovo. And we, the United States,  are driving the Government of Kosovo into the clutches of the Communist  Chinese Party because of a holier-than-thou attitude of the climate  alarmists in the White House.   So we pay to put our troops on the ground, and then we say: Go to  China if you need help providing power to your country.  [[Page S845]]    People need affordable, reliable energy. Traditional energy projects  are still the most affordable, still the most reliable.   If we really care about the people in developing countries, then we  ought to help them turn on the lights. So I urge the Biden  administration to reverse course, to rethink this, to look at all the  implications of the decisions they are making.   We need to stop this senseless attack on energy jobs. We need to stop  this reckless attack on developing nations. We need to stop pushing our  allies into the waiting arms of the Chinese Communist Party.   The American people and our friends around the world--we are better  than what we are getting right now from this administration, and we  need to reverse course.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
