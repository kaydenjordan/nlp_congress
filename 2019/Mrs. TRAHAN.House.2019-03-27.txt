 Madam Speaker, I rise to offer my strong support for the  rule and for H. Res. 124. We should approve both and send a powerful  message that Congress will not tolerate such a cruel and self-defeating  policy.   Last month, the Armed Services Committee's Military Personnel  Subcommittee held a hearing that was the first of its kind. The  chairwoman, my colleague from California, invited transgender  servicemembers to testify. We heard from an impressive panel of five  dedicated servicemembers. They asked for nothing more than to be  permitted to continue to serve their Nation honorably.   Before the hearing, I met Staff Sergeant Patricia King. Patricia grew  up on Cape Cod. She is a combat-tested and decorated infantry soldier  who has served nobly for over 20 years in the Army. Her life was turned  upside down by a tweet nearly 2 years ago, one that put her military  career in jeopardy.   We should never treat our servicemembers so callously. But if  Patricia's story isn't sufficiently convincing, consider how  shortsighted this ban is as well.   The DOD's total cost for transition-related care in fiscal year 2017  was $2.2 million, which is one-tenth of 1 percent of DOD's annual  healthcare budget for the Active component. Yet the cost to train a  single fifth-generation fighter pilot is $11 million. The retraining  cost of losing just one transgender military pilot would be five times  more than the entire transition-related care for the military for a  year.   Meanwhile, the Army missed its recruitment goal for the first time in  more than a decade last year. Now is certainly not the time to turn  away well-qualified and patriotic soldiers.   Let's approve the rule and the resolution and say ``no'' to  discrimination.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, before addressing the pending amendment, I  want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) for his  leadership and also express my profound appreciation for my friend from  Connecticut. She has been a tireless champion over the years for equal  pay on behalf of those who have been discriminated against unfairly.   Madam Chair, I imagine that most of us agree that unfair pay  discrimination needs to be stopped. Unfortunately, despite the progress  we have made in offering greater opportunities to more and more  Americans, pay discrimination persists, and, at times, it occurs in  stealth ways that cannot be easily detected. That, in fact, is a key  reason why I oppose this amendment.   Keeping this bill intact is necessary to prevent the kind of unfair  discrimination that occurs when one employee is compensated less than  another despite doing the same job just as well for just as long and  with the same credentials.   I worked in the private sector for 13 years before coming to  Congress. I know firsthand that unfair pay disparities still occur.   Across industries, I worked with employers to confront this  inequality, to bring more women to the decisionmaking table and create  work environments where people of any sex, gender, race, or ethnicity  were truly empowered.   Pay discrimination derails a workplace. It holds back talent and  undermines trust, a toxic mix for any business.   A key component of the Paycheck Fairness Act requires that the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission collect wage data, disaggregated by  sex, race, and national origin. This provision is particularly  necessary to respond to the administration's attempt to block the EEOC  from collecting data.   Earlier this month, the National Women's Law Center won an important  case to reinstate the EEOC's ability to collect this data.  Nevertheless, attacks on collecting data of this type continue. We  should not make it easier to hide pay discrimination.   This provision is necessary to ensure that equal work does, in fact,  lead to equal pay. It will reveal trends in hiring, compensation, and  advancement, and it will expose sex-segregated jobs, and unequal  salaries, benefits, or bonuses.   This provision is a critical component of the bill, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose the amendment and keep the bill intact.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Madam Chair, reporting this data allows the EEOC to see  which employers have racial or gender pay gaps that differ  significantly from the pay patterns of other employers in their  industry and region.   To be clear, this pay data will not conclusively establish that any  employer is violating the law, and it isn't intended to. What it will  do is aggregate millions of data points to establish gender and racial  pay patterns within job categories, industries, and localities,  allowing identification of firms that significantly depart from those  benchmarks that may warrant further analysis.                                time  1515    Simply put, we cannot end unfair pay discrimination if we don't have  the data.   I join my colleague from North Carolina in celebrating a record  number of women entering the workforce, but let's compensate them  fairly for their work, and let's use data to inform our decisions.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment and support  the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
