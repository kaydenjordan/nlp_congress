 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce my first bill  as a Member of Congress, the LEAP Act.   This bipartisan piece of legislation aims to create new opportunities  for American workers by supporting apprenticeships and pre- apprenticeship programs. These training programs are a proven way to  address the job skills gap and to get folks ready for careers in  growing industries.   By providing tax credits to small businesses, this bill will both  address the need for more qualified workers and cut educational costs,  a win-win for employers and working people.   I thank former Congressman Rodney Davis, who was the first to  introduce this legislation back in 2013, and I thank Congressman  Mike  Carey for  [[Page H1264]]  partnering with me to build on this proposal by eliminating age limits  and emphasizing pre-apprenticeship eligibility.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  us in supporting career pathways and a chance for everyone to succeed  in our changing economy.                            ____________________
