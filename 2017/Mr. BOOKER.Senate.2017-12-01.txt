 Mr. President, I intend to offer the following motion to  H.R. 1, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Booker moves to commit the bill H.R. 1 to the Committee       on Finance with instructions to report the same back to the       Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate is       not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) would ensure that the bill would not result in cuts to       the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security       Act.
