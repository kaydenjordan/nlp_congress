 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am here  today to object to this unanimous consent request on behalf of the  junior Senator from Texas, Senator Cruz.   As the Senator from Massachusetts knows, Senator Cruz is also deeply  interested in this issue. Both Senators have complementary pieces of  legislation. They have had the language of their legislation agreed to  unanimously by both the majority and the minority of the Commerce  Committee.   So I would ask the Senator from Massachusetts to reach out to the  Senator from Texas, and I understand he is fully willing to work with  the Senator from Massachusetts on amending the House bill to ensure  that it passes the Senate with the Cruz amendment that would not be  objectionable to supporters of this bill.   As a result, I object.
