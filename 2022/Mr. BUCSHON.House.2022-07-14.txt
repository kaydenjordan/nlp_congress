 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the upcoming  150th anniversary of Ascension St. Vincent Hospital, formerly St.  Mary's Hospital, in Evansville, Indiana.   Although the name has changed, its goal of providing quality care for  citizens of the tri-State area has remained constant. I practiced  cardiothoracic surgery there before being elected to Congress.  [[Page H6613]]    Since the Daughters of Charity accepted their first patient on July  18, 1872, Ascension St. Vincent, formerly St. Mary's, Evansville has  remained true to its mission.   They say: ``We have a mission, a reason for being here, to keep  healthcare human; human for our patients, human for our families, human  for our doctors, and human for all our associates. The poor will come,  and the rich will come, if they know they are going to be treated as  people.''   For the last 150 years, this hospital has been a leader in medical  innovation and care. In fact, it was one of the first in the region  with operating room lighting, something that I acutely appreciate  because I am a surgeon myself. It also hosted the first accredited  cancer program and the first level 3 neonatal intensive care unit in  the tri-State region.   I am grateful for Ascension St. Vincent Evansville's continued  commitment to caring for all Hoosiers and wish them a happy 150th  anniversary.                            ____________________
