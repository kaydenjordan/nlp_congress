 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I welcome you and the Senator from  Texas, and all of our colleagues, back after our Thanksgiving break. I  had my parents, 94 and 89, at our Thanksgiving dinner with all of their  children and grandchildren and cousins and ``thises and thats,'' so I  have a lot to be thankful for. I am blessed to have my mom and dad see  their whole family and be so happy about it.
