 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I and then  Senator Menendez be permitted to complete our remarks prior to the  opening of the first vote.    Mr. President, to my colleague from Indiana, I am so glad  to be on the floor with you as we approach a most historic vote, a vote  that has not been conducted in the Senate since 1971, a vote to repeal  a war authorization.   We will start the first procedural steps to formerly end the Iraq  war. Right now, we still have not one but two active war authorizations  against the Government of Iraq that is no longer an enemy, but, in the  Biblical phrase, we have beaten the sword into a plowshare. Iraq is now  a strategic partner of the United States.   The bill that Senator Young and I have worked on in close  coordination with other colleagues would repeal both authorizations. It  is a clean and simple bill, barely a page long. It has attracted  bipartisan support, as my colleague mentioned, not only in the Senate  and House but from stakeholder groups who care about Americans'  military national security and the health and fate of our troops and  veterans and their families. It is a very, very broad ideological  spectrum of America that support this bill. It is a rare coalition, and  it speaks to how painfully evident it is that the repeal of these  authorizations is long, long overdue.   This Sunday, March 19, marks the 20th anniversary of the U.S.  invasion of Iraq in March of 2002. That war ended 12 years ago. The  Persian Gulf war of 1991, Operation Desert Storm, ended 30 years ago.   I want to thank my friend from New Jersey, the chair of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Menendez, for his longstanding  support for this repeal effort. I want to thank my colleague from  Indiana for partnering with me for years and his indefatigable effort  to move us to this day. I also want to acknowledge the ranking member  of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Risch, who does not support  my bill, who voted against it in committee, but who has worked in a  cooperative way on the committee both in the 117th Congress and in the  118th Congress to make sure that this bill would be heard, that there  would be a robust process for amendments in committee, and now that it  can be heard on the floor.   The discussion over Congress's role in determining how and when the  United States utilizes its military power--having that discussion--is  so important, maybe even more important than ultimately how people vote  on this bill, because, too often, the article I branch has deferred on  matters of war, peace, and diplomacy to the article II branch, to the  executive, even though these powers are some of the most specific and  somber powers granted to Congress in article I of the Constitution.  Congress must exercise our article I authority over war, peace, and  diplomacy, and that is what this bill and this debate is about.   I think we need to repeal the Iraq war authorizations, first to  recognize reality: An enemy that we were trying to push out of Kuwait  in 1991, an enemy whose government we voted to topple in 2002, that  enemy no longer exists. Iraq, today, is an American security partner of  incredible importance. Defense Secretary Austin just visited Iraq last  week, had productive meetings with the new Prime Minister, Prime  Minister al-Sudani.   Those meetings included Iraq's request that we stay--we have about  2,500 troops in Iraq right now--and work with them to counter ISIS and  other nonstate terrorist threats that threaten not only Iraq but other  nations in the region. Iraq is asking us to stay so we can help them  check Iranian aggression in the region.   Secretary Austin talked about the value of this strategic partnership  with Iraq. Iraq is no longer a force for chaos. Iraq is now a force for  regional stability, and the United States is their partner of choice.  Why would we want two war authorizations against a nation that has  become a partner of choice?   Our servicemembers had the courage to put their lives on the line,  and everyone in this Chamber knows families, knows servicemembers who  served in Iraq, who were injured in Iraq. Many of us know families of  those who were killed in Iraq. They had the courage to do their job.  How dare we, as Congress, not have the courage to simply say, after 20  years: This war is over; the job is done.   This is partly a way of thanking those who have borne the battle here  at home. We owe it to our servicemembers to fulfill our constitutional  obligations and vote to end endless wars.   Repeal also sends a powerful message to adversaries of the United  States today. Repeal says: You may be an adversary of the United States  today--and we know we have challenges around the world today with  Russia or China or Iran or North Korea. But the repeal of this  authorization sends the message: You may be our adversary today, just  as Iraq once was, but the United States specializes, throughout our  history, in turning adversaries into partners, allies, and friends.   Look at the U.S.-Germany relationship. We fought two wars against  Germany in the 20th century. The relationship now is so powerful, and  that powerful relationship is helping as we try to protect Ukraine from  an illegal invasion by Russia.   Look at Japan. We fought a war against Japan, a devastating war. We  were attacked by Japan in 1941. Yet, now, Japan is one of our closest  allies in the world.   Look at Vietnam. When Vietnam invites the USS John McCain to make a  port call in Vietnam to celebrate the relationship that has been built  between our two nations--a relationship that still has some challenges  but a relationship that few could have predicted during the Vietnam  war--we send a message to the entire world that the United States will  turn a sword into a plowshare, will beat a spear into a pruning hook;  that we will embrace diplomacy. And that is a message that the U.S.  adversaries of today should draw from an action to repeal this war.   The Biden administration has reissued a statement of administration  policy on this particular bill, stating that they fully support it. Let  me just read briefly from it:         The Administration notes that the United States conducts no       ongoing military activities that rely primarily on the 2002       AUMF, and no ongoing military activities that rely on the       1991 AUMF, as a domestic legal basis. Repeal of these       authorizations would have no impact on current U.S. military       operations and would support this Administration's commitment       to a strong and comprehensive relationship with our Iraqi       partners. That partnership, which includes cooperation with       the Iraqi Security Forces, continues at the invitation of the       Government of Iraq [to] . . . advise, assist, and enable       [them].    The Great Seal of the United States, which you can see here on the  wallpaper around this Chamber, was created early in our Nation's  history, and it shows an eagle holding 13 arrows in one talon--those 13  to represent the first 13 American States--and an olive branch in the  other talon. The design was chosen very intentionally. The arrows  signify the U.S. military capacity, might, and will. The olive branch  signifies the American desire to be a peacemaking, diplomatic nation.   On the Seal of the United States, the eagle is facing toward the  olive  [[Page S814]]  branch--facing toward the olive branch--because we want everyone to  know how we define ourselves as a nation--that, yes, we will have the  military capacity to defeat enemies if we must, but, as a nation, our  preference, permanently and always, is to seek peace and diplomatic  solutions with all the nations of the world.   After 20 years, it is time to repeal the Iraq war authorizations. I  urge my colleagues to vote yes on this procedural vote today. It will  begin a robust and fulsome debate that will go into next week. Senator  Young and I and our colleagues are committed that that debate shall  include opportunities for Members to offer amendments. That is being  worked on by Democratic and Republican leadership.   We haven't had a discussion of this kind for nearly six decades. It  is good that we are going to give it the time and attention it  deserves, and I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the cloture motion  later this morning.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my  legislative fellows, Kylie Garber, Kristina Koch, and Kumhee Ro, be  granted floor privileges for the duration of their fellowships with my  office.
