 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Harley-Davidson  Motor Company on its 115th anniversary. I am proud to honor this  historic Wisconsin company and to commemorate this significant  milestone.   In 1903, boyhood friends William S. Harley and Arthur Davidson  completed the first design and manufacture of a motorcycle, and Harley- Davidson Motor Company was born in a small machine shop on Milwaukee's  north side.   Harley-Davidson quickly built its success on the strong foundation of  partnerships with the law enforcement and military communities. In  1907, Harley-Davidson began selling its motorcycles to police  departments, a tradition that remains to this day. In 1917, ``Harleys''  were adopted for military issue during the First World War. The U.S.  military purchased over 20,000 motorcycles from Harley-Davidson for the  war effort. As one of only two American cycle manufacturers to survive  the Great Depression, Harley-Davidson began to produce large numbers of  motorcycles for the Army during the Second World War. Harley-Davidson  received two Army-Navy E Awards for Excellence in Production, one in  1943 and another in 1945.   Today, Harley-Davidson remains one of the largest motorcycle  manufacturers in the world and is famous for its loyal following. True  to its roots, the company has kept its headquarters in Wisconsin's  largest city: Milwaukee. Beginning with the 90th anniversary in 1993,  Harley-Davidson has held celebratory rides to Milwaukee from all four  corners of the United States that are called the Ride Home. There,  Harley owners from around the Nation and the world celebrate Harley- Davidson's success every 5 years at Harleyfest. They can also  experience more than 100 years of Harley-Davidson's rich history at the  Harley-Davidson Museum. The museum was built in 2008 and has quickly  become one of Milwaukee's top tourist destinations.   Anyone who has ridden a Harley knows that they make more than just  world-class motorcycles; they create a sense of freedom that comes from  exploring the roads of the world. In spite of differences in age,  gender, occupation, lifestyle and background, Harley riders all share a  sense of adventure and a passion for the open road.   The Harley-Davidson Motor Company is an American icon, a Milwaukee  staple and a symbol of freedom. I am delighted to see the company  thriving after 115 years and look forward to many more years of success  to come.                            ____________________
