 MALONEY of New York, Messrs. CORREA, KIHUEN, and  SERRANO changed their vote from ``no'' to ``aye.''   So the amendment was rejected.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair     MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my  colleague and good friend Representative Ellison and other members of  the Progressive Caucus to say that healthcare should be a right for  everyone in the United States of America.   I have proudly cosponsored the Medicare for All legislation for many  years because I don't believe a person's economic status should have  any bearing whatsoever on their ability to access quality and  affordable healthcare.   The Affordable Care Act took us a long way toward that goal, and I am  so proud of that vote. I am proud to join all of the Members here who  are supporting it and to fight back against attacks from the Republican  majority and the White House to dismantle it.   But we can't just play defense. We have to move toward ensuring  greater access to coverage, greater affordability, stronger consumer  protections, and higher quality healthcare services. That is why this  bill is so important, and I think its time has come.   What Medicare for All would provide is universal coverage for  everyone. This is something we should be taking up right now. I am  proud to join my colleagues who are supporting it.                            ____________________
