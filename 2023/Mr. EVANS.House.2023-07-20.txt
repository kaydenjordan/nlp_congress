 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to welcome the Reverend Dr. J.  Henry Buck, Jr., from my district as today's guest chaplain.   Reverend Buck is the senior pastor of the Grace Baptist Church, which  has a rich history in Pennsylvania and the Germantown neighborhood. He  has opened an early childhood development center to local parents, and  he has created opportunities for many youth, and to date has sent five  students to study at Howard University.   In addition, Reverend Buck started a pie company to help with  employment for returning citizens. He is also a proud member of Kappa  Alpha Psi fraternity.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Reverend Buck for all that he does for our  community and welcome him to the people's House.                            ____________________
