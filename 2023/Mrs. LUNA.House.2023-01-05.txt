 Madam Clerk, I rise to nominate Byron Donalds as Speaker  of the House.   Madam Clerk, I have known Byron for roughly about 4 years now and  being that he is from the State of Florida, I can tell you that I have  come to know him on both the campaign trail and personally.   But I want to clarify something real quick to my colleagues across  the aisle. What you are seeing with this discussion does not mean that  we are dysfunctional. And in no way, shape, or form will a Democrat  ever hold the gavel to a Republican-controlled House.   These discussions and dialogue have actually been good for the  American people. And although the media tries to pit us against each  other, I can tell you that it has been something that we need as a  country. There are people that are frustrated with this process.   Byron, through this entire time, has done something that leaders  should do more of, and that is listen; respect people when they are  talking; understand the needs of the American people; be willing to  negotiate but also realize when it is proper to stand your ground on  certain things.   I ask my colleagues today to support him. I think he is an incredible  representation of what this country is, and that is exactly why he has  my vote for Speaker of the House.   The CLERK. The Clerk recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs.  Boebert).
