 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7, the  misnamed No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.   Just 2 days ago, our Nation celebrated the 44th anniversary of Roe v.  Wade, affirming that a woman has a constitutional right to make the  decision of what is best for herself and her family. However,  Republicans have been relentless in their pursuit to deny women this  constitutional right, and H.R. 7 is just another reckless example.   H.R. 7 will have devastating consequences on every single woman in  America. The bill would deny women, families, and small businesses tax  credits if they elect an insurance plan that covers abortions. The IRS  would be inserted into one of the most important and private decisions  a woman can make and one that should be solely between her and her  doctor. That is the most egregious and offensive example of government  overreach that I can think of.  [[Page H625]]    Madam Speaker, women are responsible. Women are smart. Women know  what is best for them, and women can make their own choices. Allow them  to do that and vote against H.R. 7.
