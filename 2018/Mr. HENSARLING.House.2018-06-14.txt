 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 5735.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I received a letter not long ago from a constituent,  Jim, from Dallas County. The first three words were: I need help.   In the letter, he talks about his grandson, Joshua, who is a good  kid. Jim became his guardian at age 6, but Joshua took a bad turn at  age 16. It was at age 16 he started using opioids. His life has never  been the same.   Jim writes that at first his grandson started out with pills and  then, later, street drugs and ended up on heroin. No surprise here, Mr.  Chairman: His usage escalated, and he ended up dropping out of school  in the last semester of high school.   Along the way, he found a menial job here, a menial job there, but he  [[Page H5173]]  couldn't hold one down because of the drug usage. Jim tried to help him  every way he could. He said that in the summer of 2014 his opioid usage  brought him almost to death.   I won't say the story has a happy ending, but at least he is now  trying to turn his life around. He is off of opioids, and he is on  other medications: methadone, Xanax. He has actually gone back and  gotten his high school diploma.   He has learned how to operate a forklift, but because of the damage  that has been done, he can't hold down a job. His drug costs are  expensive. He still needs help.   Mr. Chair, you know what is unusual about this story? Regrettably,  nothing. Nothing is unusual about this story. Again, although it  doesn't have a happy ending--and we don't know how this story is going  to end--at least it doesn't have a tragic end, because far too many  stories like it end in the tragedy of death.   And my guess is, Mr. Chair, that every single Member of this body  could read a similar letter as I read from Jim from Dallas.   I have been in this House now for eight terms. Rarely--rarely--does a  week go by that somebody doesn't use the term ``crisis.'' And most of  the time I don't give it much thought. But Mr. Chair, when somebody  says there is a crisis of opioid use in America, I could not agree  more. How negligent this body would be if we didn't declare war on this  crisis and do what is right and what is smart to address this crisis.   So today, out of the House Financial Services Committee, I am  bringing up a bill by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), a member  of our leadership team. I want to thank him for his leadership, because  I know how heartfelt the pain he knows from his district is.   What the gentleman from Kentucky is bringing before us is that we  have seen evidence that transitional housing can be a proven method to  really help thousands and thousands of Americans like Joshua that I  describe, to help them maintain their sobriety after completing rehab  and as they are gaining skills and training and trying to get back into  being independent, productive members of society.   So the gentleman from Kentucky says: It is time for a demonstration  project, because we have some evidence. We have evidence already. And  out of the 2.2 million Section 8 housing vouchers, the government's  largest means-tested housing assistance program, let's take less than 1  percent of them--in fact, 0.5 percent of them--and on a temporary basis  let's allocate some of these Section 8 housing vouchers to people who  are literally dying of opioid addiction every day and need transitional  housing options in a recovery evidence-based program.                                time  1315    I really think, Mr. Chairman, it is the least we can do today. I am  sorry that this is not on the House's suspension calendar.  Demonstration programs are done every single day in the government.   Again, I would hope that this is something that we could join  overwhelmingly on both sides of the aisle to do. Apparently, that is  not the case, but I don't think this House will be deterred. I do not  think this House will be deterred. I think, very soon, people like  Joshua who are getting their life turned around can at least have  transitional housing options to support their recovery. When they do,  we will thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade  Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee and author of the  Transitional Housing for Recovery in Viable Environments Demonstration  Program Act, or THRIVE Act.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the chairman of the Housing  and Insurance Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), chairman of the Capital Markets, Securities,  and Investment Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), vice chairman of our Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investments Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), a valued member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd), a very hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Tenney), another hardworking member of the House  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. Handel), a member of the Judiciary  Committee and the Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I anticipate no more speakers. I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, in my congressional career, I have experienced a number  of surreal moments. I think perhaps I am experiencing another one, and  that is, typically, within my career, next to a study, I think the  least controversial provisions we take up in this body are  demonstration projects.   We do it all the time, and it is good that we do it all the time so  we can find out if what is happening in a small subset within our  society is going to work, and so we will roll out the program  throughout our country. Typically, these receive very strong bipartisan  support.   I couldn't help but notice, there are only two, two Members on the  other side of the aisle, who are against this opioid housing recovery  program, and we had almost a dozen Republicans on our side of the aisle  come to support it.    I listened very carefully to the ranking member who, on more than one  occasion, said we should not rob Peter to pay Paul. Well, what happens  when she or other Members on the other side of the aisle decide to  submit budgets that aren't balanced?   We just had a balanced budget amendment come to this floor, and if  memory serves me right, it was not supported by the ranking member. So  thus, she appears to be robbing Peter to pay Paul. If that is of great  concern, I will certainly be happy to go to our leadership and see if  we can bring that vote to the House floor, so that we might balance the  budget.   I heard it said, well, this demonstration project may take away a  voucher from a veteran, somebody homeless, somebody disabled. Who do  you think these people who are suffering with opioid addiction are?  They are veterans. They are homeless. They are disabled, Mr. Chairman,  and that is why it is so critical that we reach out and we help them.   Then I continue to hear from the ranking member, well, this doesn't  make a dent. This doesn't make a dent in the problem.   So let me get this straight. If we can't help everybody, we ought to  help nobody is, I think, the logic of that argument. Well, we reject  that. We reject that argument, Mr. Chairman.   So, again, I just cannot believe something that should be on our  suspension calendar, something that should be receiving overwhelming  bipartisan support apparently has to come with what we call a rule  bill.   But we know that 42,000 people have died in the last calendar year,  to where we have the data, due to opioid abuse--up tremendously. So  there is just an urgent need to target resources for substance use  treatment services, to make effective treatment more widely available.   We have an opportunity, right here in this House, right now, today,  to say that we have the evidence. Let's take some Section 8 vouchers  and make sure that they are part of the solution.                                time  1415    And so I thank the gentleman from Kentucky. What a wonderful leader  he is on our committee in trying to help--and we are not helping  everybody. I admit it.--to begin to put people in transitional housing.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support the THRIVE Act. We can make  a difference today.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the  time in opposition, although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for  coming and offering this very simple amendment. I thank him for his  kind words for the gentleman from Kentucky, who has been an outstanding  leader in this effort.   The amendment will simply allow Congress to work its will on the  report from the Secretary and allow us to have our own full analysis. I  think it is a helpful amendment. I would urge its adoption.   Finally, I would just echo what my friend from Kentucky, the leader  of this effort, has said. We are an authorizing committee, not an  appropriating committee under the rules of the House, and we authorize  programs based upon priorities.   We do demonstration projects all the time, and if there were ever a  worthy one that should be considered by this body in the midst of,  again, a legitimate crisis on opioid addiction, it ought to be this  program.   We have had several amendments that have been agreed to by the  majority. I think all have probably improved the underlying  legislation. But again, this is something that should have been on the  suspension calendar, I don't understand why we have to take so much  floor time on this. I don't understand the argument that, if you can't  help everybody, then don't help anybody. I don't understand the  argument that, since you are not an appropriating committee, then don't  authorize the help. I simply don't understand that.   Again, we have the opportunity in this Congress, on this floor, at  this moment to make a difference, a huge difference, in the road to  recovery for thousands of opioid addicts who are trying to get their  lives back together. If we believe in their hope and if we believe in  their cause, then we should support the THRIVE Act of the gentleman  from Kentucky.   Mr. Chairman, I certainly support the amendment from the gentleman  from Arizona, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
