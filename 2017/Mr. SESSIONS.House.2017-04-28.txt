 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 289 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 289         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 99) making further continuing appropriations for fiscal       year 2017, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The       joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations;       and (2) one motion to recommit.    The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). The gentleman from Texas  is recognized for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my friend, the ranking member of the committee, pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my friend, the ranking member of the committee, pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule. It is  a fair rule that enables this body to continue working in a bipartisan  fashion to get our work done for the American people. Essentially, it  is to fund the government for one more week as final preparations are  made and as the Appropriations Committee finalizes its work. It enables  us to continue to serve our constituents. It enables the American  people to have confidence not only in what we are doing, but to provide  the necessary resources so that this Nation can continue to protect  itself also.   I also rise in support of the underlying legislation that is in this  rule. This short-term CR, while being far from ideal, is exactly what  we need to do so that we can allow our colleagues in the House, as well  as the Appropriations Committee and this body, to move forth a bill  that will find its way to the United States Senate and to the  President's desk.   For months now, our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, under  the great work of our brand-new chairman, Chairman Frelinghuysen from  New Jersey, have been working towards funding a government agreement  while they are trying to reach a long-term bridge.   Yesterday at the Rules Committee, the young chairman, along with the  ranking member, Mrs. Lowey from New York, came and spoke to the Rules  Committee not only with great confidence about the work that they are  doing, but with great confidence about how they worked well together.  It was once again another opportunity for Members of Congress in the  performance of their duties to have confidence not only in their  working relationship, but in the product that they would wish to move  forward.   The Rules Committee was quite blunt to them that, while we were  pleased to see them, we wanted to see them get their work done a week  from now. I think the American people feel the same way. I think they  are willing to take the time to do it right, but it is now time to feel  a little bit of pressure towards completing the work that needs to be  done.   Mr. Speaker, today we are going to have one of the most distinguished  members of the Rules Committee who will speak with us. He shares a role  not only as vice chairman of our committee, but he also has an  opportunity to sit on the Appropriations Committee; a person  responsible as a cardinal for a massive part of not only the Federal  Government spending, but the authority and responsibility for the  Federal Government to deliver in so many areas in support of the  American people.   I will be introducing the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) in just  a few minutes, who will also provide detail and information not only in  support of the great work that is being done, but why we are doing that  for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I am confident that my colleagues on the Appropriations  Committee are going to continue their work. We are asking this body  today to consider this rule to move forth legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sessions), my good friend, the chairman of the Rules Committee for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin with some good news for my  colleagues here in the House and for the American people, and that is  my Republican colleagues have decided to pull their abysmal repeal and  replace bill with regard to the Affordable Care Act from consideration  this week. We can all breathe a sigh of relief. The American people  dodged another Republican bullet here.   Their bill, as my colleagues all know, would have caused 24 million  Americans to lose their health care. It would have cut Medicaid by over  $800 billion, and then they would have given a trillion-dollar tax  break to the richest people in the country. It would have compromised  Medicare. It would have  [[Page H2948]]  basically denied Americans essential health protections that they  currently are guaranteed in their health insurance; things like  emergency room care, maternity care, mental health care. I can go on  and on.   Then with their latest addition to their abysmal bill, they would  have even allowed insurance companies to once again discriminate  against Americans with preexisting conditions; something that they said  that they wanted to protect, yet their adjustments to their abysmal  healthcare bill would have allowed Americans with preexisting  conditions to be discriminated against.   I mean, when we talk about essential health benefits, I want to  stress the word ``essential.'' They are important, yet they are going  down a road that I think is disastrous for millions of American people.   Let us begin by being thankful that we are not going to do great harm  to our country this week. Now, there is always next week--we have to  worry about that--but at least this week they had the common sense to  pull this terrible healthcare bill that they have been working on for  so long. Let's hope that we never ever see the bill. I think it is  important for people to understand what is at stake. There is an awful  lot at stake for tens of millions of Americans here today all across  the country.   Mr. Speaker, that brings us to today. Let us be clear about why we  are here again with yet another continuing resolution, the 29th--yes,  you heard that right, the 29th--continuing resolution since Republicans  have taken control of the House.    Republicans have nobody to blame for this mess but themselves. They  control the White House, they control the Senate, and, unfortunately,  they control this House. They were even the ones who set this  artificial deadline of April 28 in the first place. That was after  Republicans gave themselves a 2-month extension and then a 5-month  extension.   Mr. Speaker, this should have all been sorted out last fall, but for  7 months Republicans have played games and delayed and bickered amongst  themselves about government funding and health care and other  priorities.   What do they have to show for it?   Nothing.   Now, maybe the delay was caused by this obsession from the Republican  Conference with repealing the Affordable Care Act and ripping health  care away from 24 million Americans. Maybe Republicans have been too  busy trying to defund Planned Parenthood, trying to undo important  consumer protections put in place by Democrats, trying to tear down  commonsense rules to protect public safety and the environment.   Perhaps if Republicans had been responsibly working with Democratic  leaders during the past 7 months, we could have already funded our  government and we could be getting to work on other things that our  constituents sent us here to do, like creating jobs and repairing our  crumbling infrastructure.   We could have avoided events that have transpired during the past 48  hours: an emergency Rules Committee meeting, another Republican martial  law rule, and threats of a Saturday session.   Mr. Speaker, to put it bluntly, this is about Republican dysfunction  and incompetence, plain and simple. If Congress could be sued by the  American people for malpractice, we would be in big trouble. This is  indefensible. I am sure people who are watching these proceedings are  scratching their heads saying: What the hell is going on in the  people's House?   For the life of me, I cannot understand why we are constantly at the  edge of a cliff. This Republican leadership jumps from one manufactured  crisis to the next, and has proven ineffective at carrying out even its  most basic responsibilities, like keeping the government's lights on  and funding programs that help our constituents.   But don't take it from me. Listen to what some of my Republican  colleagues are saying about the priorities of their own leadership.  Representative Rooney, a Republican from Florida, said:   ``I have been in this job 8 years, and I am wracking my brain to  think of one thing our party has done that has been something positive,  that has been something other than stopping something else from  happening.''   Representative Mario Diaz Balart from Florida commented:   ``It is pretty evident that we don't have the votes among Republicans  to, in essence, do anything that is real.''   Mr. Speaker, when you have members of your own party making these  kinds of statements, you really have to question the capacity of the  Speaker and his leadership team to govern effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I very much regret that we are here today to consider  another short-term CR. One week--that is all this bill does, keeps the  government running for one additional week. Our constituents expect and  deserve better from their elected officials.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman, my friend from  Massachusetts, for his words of wisdom about the direction we ought to  be going. That is what we are going to do; we are going to continue  moving.   I find in my job, as I perform my duties, that I have a chance to  really interact with a lot of people in government. Over Christmas, I  had a chance to visit our troops around the world and look at them and  give them the confidence that what we do in Washington will allow them  to keep working for freedom and to represent us.   Dr. Francis Collins at the National Institutes of Health, an  enormously brilliant man who helped with the genome project, who keeps  NIH up and working; and at the National Eye Institute, Dr. Paul  Sieving; and so many others who do count on us getting it right,  whether it be the United States military, whether it is our border  patrol, whether it is our health and human services, but the person who  knows these characteristics of what it takes to get agreements is also  on the Rules Committee. He is a valuable member of our Rules Committee.  He is the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).   Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole), vice chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services,  Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, also I want to recognize the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for another birthday today. The gentleman from  Oklahoma was very silent last night at the Rules Committee. He didn't  let us know, so we didn't say anything. But today is his birthday, and  I congratulate him for that.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have a number of the day for my colleagues. I feel like I am on  Sesame Street. This is the 29th closed rule this year. This is the 29th  CR of this Republican majority. And the government is about to shut  down when the calendar flips after midnight, and it is the 29th. So 29  must be the number of the day.   I want to wish the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) a happy  birthday. Maybe he is 29, so it all kind of fits together.   I would just say to my colleagues, as an indication of how  dysfunctional this place is: How do you get 29 closed rules in 4  months? How do we run a place in such a closed manner?    This is supposed to be a deliberative body. We are supposed to be  debating issues. People are supposed to have a give-and-take on matters  of importance. We have had 29 closed rules in the first 4 months of  this year. It is unprecedented.   As I have been saying time and time again, when you have a lousy  process, you usually end up with lousy legislation. I think that is the  case with regard to the repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act.   Here we are at the last minute trying to keep the government open for  a week so we could have more time to keep it open for the rest of the  year. I mean, this is not the way this place should be run.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Castor), a former member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, last night at the Rules Committee, we had  a debate where we focused our attention not only on the legislation,  but also on the need to get this done.   I appreciate the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern) and their attention to the ideas that they have. They do have  ideas, and they do have decisions that would help make this process  even better. We are here today for the right reasons.    I would advise the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) that I  do not have any further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time  pending his close.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear that there is a lot of frustration  on our side because of what is obviously a dysfunctional House. The  fact that we are here again at the last minute trying to just keep the  government running really is unfortunate. It is sad because it is not  like we didn't know about this date. We have known about it for a long  time.   My Republicans friends set this date. They have had months and months  to figure out a way to keep the government running. They, again, are in  control of the House. They are in control of the Senate. They are in  control of the White House. Once again, we have a manufactured crisis  where we are right at the edge of a cliff, and the best we could do  today is kick the can down the road for a week and we will have this  little debate again next week.   Perhaps if the leadership of this House actually focused on the  people's business instead of on legislation that is about messaging or  press releases, perhaps if they focused on the people's business rather  than trying to undermine basic healthcare protections for people, we  wouldn't have these crises all the time.   I said at the beginning of my remarks that we can breathe a sigh of  relief today because my friends on the Republican side are not bringing  up their abysmal repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act bill.                                time  0945    They have been changing it and changing it, and there was some rumor,  President Trump was saying that they would probably bring a bill up to  pass it in his first 100 days because somehow it is more important to  do something in 100 days than it is to get it right. But, nonetheless,  they added another provision which they claim makes it more palatable  to their Members. But I want my colleagues to understand that what they  have done is made a bad bill worse.   The American College of Physicians sent us a letter to all Members,  Democrats and Republicans, and I will just read one sentence from it.  ``This amendment'' that my Republican friends added to their healthcare  bill ``would make the harmful AHCA even worse by creating new coverage  barriers for patients with preexisting conditions and weakening  requirements that insurers cover essential benefits.''   I include in the Record the letter from the American College of  Physicians.                                 American College of Physicians,                                                     April 24, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Majority Leader       McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer: On behalf of the       American College of Physicians (ACP), I am writing to urge       Congress to move away from the harmful changes to patient       care that would occur if the American Health Care Act (AHCA)       were to become law, and to instead work for bipartisan       solutions to improve the Affordable Care Act (ACA) rather       than repealing and replacing it. We believe that the AHCA,       which would repeal and replace the most important coverage       and consumer protections created by the ACA, is so       fundamentally flawed that it cannot be made acceptable. We       understand that the leadership in the House of       Representatives continues to explore ways to bring a modified       version of the AHCA to a vote, based on a draft amendment       reportedly being developed by Representatives MacArthur and       Meadows, a summary of which was made available to the public       through news organizations. This amendment would make the       harmful AHCA even worse by creating new coverage barriers for       patients with pre-existing conditions and weakening       requirements that insurers cover essential benefits.        The American College of Physicians is the largest medical       specialty organization and the second-largest physician group       in the United States. ACP members include 148,000 internal       medicine physicians (internists), related subspecialists, and       medical students. Internal medicine physicians are       specialists who apply scientific knowledge and clinical       expertise to the diagnosis, treatment, and compassionate care       of adults across the spectrum from health to complex illness.        The draft MacArthur-Meadows amendment would create what is       known as the ``Limited Waiver Option'' that would allow       states to eliminate or severely weaken vital ACA Title I       consumer protections--specifically, community rating and       essential health benefits (EHBs)--returning the country to       the pre-ACA days when persons with pre-existing       ``declinable'' medical conditions in most states were priced       out of the market and the insurance products available in the       individual market did not cover medically necessary services.        Specifically;        The MacArthur-Meadows amendment would create an option for       states to obtain Limited Waivers from certain federal       standards that would gut existing law consumer protections.       Based on a summary of the draft amendment, states could seek       Limited Waivers for:        Essential Health Benefits (EHBs)        Community-rating rules, except for the following       categories, which are not waivable: Gender or Age (except for       reductions of the 5:1 age ratio previously established) or       Health Status (unless the state has established a high-risk       pool or is participating in a federal high-risk pool)        To obtain the waiver, states would only need to ``attest       that the purpose of their requested waiver is to reduce       premium costs,  [[Page H2951]]       increase the number of persons with healthcare coverage, or       advance another benefit to the public interest in the state,       including the guarantee of coverage for persons with       preexisting medical conditions. The Secretary shall approve       applications within 90 days of determining that an       application is complete.'' [Emphasis added in italics].        In other words, as long as a state attested that there was       a ``benefit to the public,'' insurers would be once again       allowed to charge more to people with pre-existing       conditions, or decline to cover needed benefits like       physician and hospital visits, maternity care and       contraception, mental health and substance use disorder       treatments, preventive services, and prescription drugs.        This would take us back to the days when people had to fill       out intrusive insurance company applications to document       their previous health history, even before being advised what       the premium would be based on their individual health risk.       Unlike community rating, which bases premiums based on the       expected costs associated with all persons in the insurance       pool (adjusted only by age, tobacco use, and family size),       the Limited Waiver would again allow insurers in states that       obtain a waiver to again charge people exorbitant and       unaffordable premiums for their pre-existing conditions.        Before the ACA, insurance plans sold in the individual       insurance market in all but five states typically maintained       lists of so-called ``declinable'' medical conditions--      including asthma, diabetes, arthritis, obesity, stroke, or       pregnancy, or having been diagnosed with cancer in the past       10 years. Even if a revised bill would not explicitly repeal       the current law's guaranteed-issue requirement--which       requires insurers to offer coverage to persons with pre-      existing conditions like these--guaranteed issue without       community rating allows insurers to charge as much as they       believe a patient's treatment will cost. The result would be       that many patients with pre-existing conditions would be       offered coverage that costs them thousands of dollars more       for the care that they need, and in the case of patients with       expensive conditions like cancer, even hundreds of thousands       more.        An amendment to the AHCA reported out of the Rules       Committee on April 6th to establish a ``Federal Invisible       Risk Sharing Program,'' which would create a fund that states       could use to reimburse insurers for some of the costs       associated with insuring sicker patients, would not offset       the harm done to patients with pre-existing conditions by       allowing the Limited Waiver of community rating and essential       benefit protections. The pre-ACA experience with high-risk       pools was that many had long waiting lists, and offered       inadequate coverage with high deductibles and insufficient       benefits. Unless a national high-risk pool is supported with       a massive infusion of funding it will not be sufficient to       cover the millions of people with pre-existing conditions       that would be denied or charged more for coverage under the       AHCA. One paper estimates that a national high-risk pool       would cost $178.1 billion a year, roughly $176.4 billion more       than the annual funding provided to the Invisible Risk       Sharing Program. Also, shifting people out of the existing       health insurance marketplace to a high-risk pool would       undermine the assurance that enrollees could keep their       existing coverage.        The Limited Waiver Option will also allow states to seek       waivers from the essential health benefits required of all       plans sold in the individual insurance market, with the       result that millions of patients will be at risk of losing       coverage for essential services like maternity care, cancer       screening tests and treatments, prescription drugs,       preventive services, mental health and substance use disorder       treatments, and even physician visits, prescription drugs and       hospitalizations.        Prior to passage of the ACA, 62% of individual market       enrollees did not have coverage of maternity services, 34%       did not have substance-use disorder-services, 18% did not       have mental-health services and 9% did not have coverage for       prescription drugs. A recent independent analysis found that       the AHCA's repeal of current law required benefits would       result in patients on average paying $1,952 more for cancer       drugs; $1,807 for drugs for heart disease; $1,127 for drugs       to treat lung diseases; $1,607 for drugs to treat mental       illnesses; $4,940 for inpatient admission for mental health;       $4,555 for inpatient admission for substance use treatment;       and $8,501 for maternity care. Such increased costs would       make it practically impossible for many patients to avail       themselves of the care they need. The result will be delays       in getting treatment until their illnesses present at a more       advanced, less treatable, and more expensive stage, or not       keeping up with life-saving medications prescribed by their       physicians.        Allowing states to eliminate the EHB will threaten our       nation's fight against the opioid epidemic. A study concluded       that with repeal of the ACA, ``approximately 1,253,000 people       with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans       with a substance use disorder, of whom about 222,000 have an       opioid disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance       coverage.'' Finally, allowing states to drop important       benefits like maternity, substance use disorder treatment,       and preventive services will do little to reduce premiums. A       report by Milliman found that the main drivers of premium       costs were ambulatory patient services, hospitalization, and       prescription drugs. These are crucial services that form the       core of any health insurance plan.        To be clear: while some younger and healthier persons might       be offered lower premiums in states that obtained a ``Limited       Waiver'' of community-rating and essential health benefits,       it would be at the expense of making coverage unaffordable       for those who need it most, older and sicker persons, and       result in skimpy ``bare-bones'' insurance for many others       that does not cover the medical care they would need if and       when they get sick.        Finally, even without the Limited Waiver Amendment, ACP       continues to believe that the AHCA has numerous other       provisions and policies that that will do great harm to       patients including:        The phase-out of the higher federal match in states that       have opted to expand Medicaid and the ban on non-expansion       states being able to access the higher federal contribution       if they choose to expand Medicaid;        Converting the shared federal-state financing structure for       Medicaid to one that would cap the federal contribution per       enrollee;        Providing states with a Medicaid block grant financing       option;        Eliminating EHBs for Medicaid expansion enrollees;        Imposing work or job search requirements on certain       Medicaid enrollees;        Regressive age-based tax credits, combined with changes       that will allow insurers to charge older people much higher       premiums than allowed under current law;        Continuous coverage requirements for patients with pre-      existing conditions;        Legislative or regulatory restrictions that would deny or       result in discrimination in the awarding of federal grant       funds and/or Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program       funding to women's health clinics that are qualified under       existing federal law for the provision of evidence-based       services including, but not limited to, provision of       contraception, preventive health screenings, sexually       transmitted infection testing and treatment, vaccines,       counseling, rehabilitation, and referrals, and;        Elimination of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which       provides billions in dollars to the enters for Disease       Control and Prevention to prevent and control the spread of       infectious diseases.        The College strongly believes in the first, do no harm       principle. Therefore, we continue to urge that Congress move       away from the fundamentally flawed and harmful policies that       would result from the American Health Care Act and from the       changes under consideration--including the proposed ``Limited       Waiver'' amendment--that would make the bill even worse for       patients. We urge Congress to instead start over and seek       agreement on bipartisan ways to improve and build on the ACA.       The College welcomes the opportunity to share our ideas for       bipartisan solutions that would help make health care better,       more accessible, and more affordable for patients rather than       imposing great harm on them as the AHCA would do.            Sincerely,                                               Jack Ende, MD, MACP,                                                         President.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we have a press release from the American  Hospital Association. Their line here is: ``Our top concern is what  this change could mean for older and sicker patients, including those  with preexisting conditions such as cancer patients and those with  chronic conditions'' could suffer. ``This amendment proposed this week  would dramatically worsen the bill.''   I include in the Record the American Hospital Association press  release.          [From the American Hospital Association--April 27, 2017]                 Statement on the American Health Care Act    (By Rick Pollack, President and CEO, American Hospital Association)         The latest version of the AHCA continues to put health       coverage in jeopardy for many Americans. Our top concern is       what this change could mean for older and sicker patients,       including those with pre-existing conditions, such as cancer       patients and those with chronic conditions. For these       reasons, along with our previously stated concerns about the       AHCA, we cannot support the bill. However, we urge Congress       to continue to work with stakeholders on a solution that       provides meaningful coverage.        The amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen       the bill. The changes included put consumer protections at       greater risk by allowing states to waive the essential health       benefit standards, which could leave patients without access       to critical health services and increase out-of-pocket       spending. This could allow plans to set premium prices based       on individual risk for some consumers, which could       significantly raise costs for those with pre-existing       conditions.        Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has not yet       scored the amendment. However, CBO previously projected that       the AHCA would result in 24 million fewer people covered in       2026. It is unlikely this amendment would improve these       coverage estimates.        As the backbone of America's health safety-net, hospitals       and health systems must protect access to care for those who       need it and ensure that the most vulnerable patients are not       left behind. The AHCA continues to fall far short of that       goal.   [[Page H2952]]         Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the AARP issued yet another statement  saying: ``This harmful legislation still puts an age tax on older  Americans and puts vulnerable populations at risk through a series of  backdoor deals that attempts to shift responsibility to States.''   I include in the Record the statement from the AARP.              AARP Maintains Opposition to Amended Health Bill     Age Tax, Weakening Medicare, Backdoor Cuts to Preexisting Condition                  Population Would Harm American Families         Washington, DC.--AARP Executive Vice President Nancy       LeaMond released the following statement today in response to       the amended House bill that would create an ``Age Tax,''       increase premiums, eliminate protections for pre-existing       conditions, cut the life of Medicare, and give sweetheart       deals to big drug and insurance companies. In a letter sent       to all 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, AARP       restated its strong opposition to the bill and urged each       Representative to vote `No' on the proposed legislation. AARP       believes this legislation will have a significant harmful       impact on the health of millions of older Americans ages 50       to 64, as well as other vulnerable groups, including poor       seniors and disabled children and adults:        ``This harmful legislation still puts an Age Tax on older       Americans and puts vulnerable populations at risk through a       series of backdoor deals that attempts to shift       responsibility to states. Older Americans need affordable       health care services and prescriptions. This legislation       still goes in the opposite direction, increasing insurance       premiums for older Americans and not doing anything to lower       drug costs.        ``AARP continues to oppose legislation that would impose an       Age Tax, eliminate protections for preexisting conditions,       weaken Medicare, erode seniors' ability to live independently       because of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts, and give       sweetheart deals to drug and insurance companies while doing       nothing to lower the cost of health care or prescription       drugs.        ``We intend to let all 38 million of our members know       exactly how their Representative votes on this bill in       newsletters, in our publications, on social media and in       other formats. Our members care deeply about their health       care and have told us repeatedly that they want to know where       their elected officials stand.''        Past statements and releases about this bill can be found       here, here, here, and here. Public policy fact sheets about       the Age Tax and other harmful policies can be found here.       AARP's full letter to the House of Representatives can be       found below:                                                     April 26, 2017.        Dear Representative: AARP, with its nearly 38 million       members in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, Puerto       Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands, is a nonpartisan, nonprofit,       nationwide organization that helps people turn their goals       and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities       and fights for the issues that matter most to consumers and       families such as healthcare, employment and income security,       retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from       financial abuse.        We write to again share our opposition to the pending       American Health Care Act (AHCA) and urge you to vote NO.       Throughout consideration of the AHCA, we have been expressing       serious concerns about the impact that this legislation will       have on older Americans. The Congressional Budget Office       (CBO)'s last estimate further demonstrates the harmful impact       of this bill on older Americans and some of our most       vulnerable. Specifically, we are concerned that the American       Health Care Act will weaken the fiscal sustainability of       Medicare; dramatically increase premium and out-of-pocket       costs for 50-64 year olds purchasing coverage on the       individual insurance market; substantially increase the       number of Americans without insurance; and put at risk       millions of children and adults with disabilities and poor       seniors who depend on the Medicaid program to access long-      term services and supports and other benefits. In addition,       changes under consideration that would allow states to waive       important consumer protections--such as allowing insurance       companies to once again charge Americans with pre-existing       conditions more because they've had cancer, diabetes or heart       disease--would make this bad bill even worse.        Our members and others 50 years of age and older care       deeply about health care and want to know where their elected       leaders stand. Recognizing the importance of the upcoming       vote on the American Health Care Act, AARP intends to inform       our members, and others over age 50, how their elected       officials voted. We'll communicate the results of the vote in       our widely-circulated publications, in email alerts, in our       online channels, and through the media. Again, we urge all       Representatives to vote NO on the American Health Care Act in       its current form.                                   Medicare         Our members and older Americans believe that Medicare must       be protected and strengthened for today's seniors and future       generations. We strongly oppose any changes to current law       that could result in cuts to benefits, increased costs, or       reduced coverage for older Americans. According to the 2016       Medicare Trustees report, the Medicare Part A Trust Fund is       solvent until 2028 (11 years longer than pre-Affordable Care       Act (ACA)), due in large part to changes made in the ACA. We       have serious concerns that the American Health Care Act       repeals provisions in current law that have strengthened       Medicare's fiscal outlook, specifically, the repeal of the       additional 0.9 percent payroll tax on higher-income workers.       Repealing this provision would remove $117.3 billion from the       Hospital Insurance trust fund over the next ten years, would       hasten the insolvency of Medicare by up to four years, and       diminish Medicare's ability to pay for services in the       future.                              Prescription Drugs         Older Americans use prescription drugs more than any other       segment of the U.S. population, typically on a chronic basis.       We are pleased that the bill maintains the Medicare Part D       coverage gap (``donut hole'') protections created under the       ACA. Since the enactment of the law, more than 11.8 million       Medicare beneficiaries who have fallen into the coverage gap       have saved over $26.8 billion on the improved coverage for       prescription drug costs due to closure of the donut hole. We       do have strong concerns that the fee on manufacturers and       importers of branded prescription drugs, which currently is       projected to add $24.8 billion to the Medicare Part B trust       fund between 2017 and 2026, will be repealed by the American       Health Care Act. Rather than repeal this fee for Medicare,       AARP believes Congress must do more to reduce the burden of       high prescription drug costs on consumers and taxpayers, and       we would be willing to work with you on bipartisan solutions.                     Individual Private Insurance Market         About 6.1 million Americans age 50-64 currently purchase       insurance in the non-group market, and nearly 3.2 million are       currently eligible to receive subsidies for health insurance       coverage through either the federal health benefits exchange       or a state-based exchange (exchange). We have seen a       significant reduction in the number of uninsured since       passage of the ACA, with the number of 50-64 year old       Americans who are uninsured dropping by half. We are deeply       concerned that the AHCA would be a significant step backwards       and result in millions of older Americans who cannot afford       their health care, including many simply losing their health       care.        Based on CBO estimates, approximately 14 million Americans       will lose coverage next year, while a total of 24 million       Americans would lose coverage over the next 10 years. This is       especially troubling given that in the CBO and Joint       Committee on Taxation's (JCT) assessment ``the non-group       (individual) market would probably be stable in most areas       . . . under current law.''        Affordability of both premiums and cost-sharing is critical       to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access       health care. A typical 50-64 year old seeking coverage       through an exchange has a median annual income of under       $25,000 and already pays significant out-of-pocket costs for       health care. We have serious concerns--reinforced by the CBO       estimate--that the bill under consideration will dramatically       increase health care costs for 50-64 year olds who purchase       health care through an exchange due both to the changes in       age rating from 3:1 (already a compromise that requires       uninsured older Americans to pay three times more than       younger individuals) to 5:1 and reductions in current tax       credits for older Americans. CBO concluded that the bill will       substantially raise premiums for older people and force many       into lower quality plans.        Age rating plus reduced tax credits equal an unaffordable       age tax. Our previous estimates on the age-rating change       showed that premiums for current coverage could increase by       up to $3,200 for a 64 year old, while reducing premiums by       only about $700 for a younger enrollee. Significant premium       increases for older consumers will make insurance less       affordable, will not address their expressed concern about       rising premiums, and only encourage a small increase in the       enrollment numbers for younger persons.        In addition to increasing premiums from the age rating       change, the bill reduced the tax credits available for older       Americans to help purchase insurance. We estimate that the       bill's changes to current law's tax credits alone could       increase premium costs for a 55-year old earning $25,000 by       more than $2,300 a year. For a 64-year old earning $25,000,       that increased premium rises to more than $4,400 a year, and       more than $5,800 for a 64-year old earning $15,000.        Overall, both the bill's tax credit changes and 5:1 age       rating would result in skyrocketing cost increases for older       Americans. In their analysis, CBO found that a 64 year old       earning $26,500 a year would see their premiums increase by       $12,900--758 percent--from $1,700 to $14,600 a year. In       addition, older workers could also face higher out-of-pocket       costs because the bill eliminates cost-sharing subsidies       which help lower-income Americans with their co-pays and       deductibles. It cannot be overstated how much this bill would       erase recent gains in health care coverage and affordability       for 50-64 year olds, leading to large spikes in the number of       uninsured and financial hardship for millions of older       Americans.        Current law prohibits insurance companies from       discriminating against individuals due to a preexisting       condition. We are extremely concerned that the bill may now       repeal pre-  [[Page H2953]]       existing condition protections and would once again allow       insurance companies to charge Americans more due to a pre-      existing condition. We estimate that 40 percent of 50- to 64-      year-olds (or about 25 million people in this age group) have       a deniable pre-existing condition and risk losing access to       affordable coverage. We strongly oppose any weakening of the       law's pre-existing condition protections which benefit       millions of Americans.                 Medicaid and Long-Term Services and Supports         AARP opposes the provisions of the American Health Care Act       that create a per capita cap financing structure in the       Medicaid program. We are concerned that these provisions       could endanger the health, safety, and care of millions of       individuals who depend on the essential services provided       through Medicaid. CBO found that the bill would cut Medicaid       funding by $880 billion over 2017-2026. By 2026, CBO expects       Medicaid spending to be about 25 percent less than what it       projects under current law. Medicaid is a vital safety net       and intergenerational lifeline for millions of individuals,       including over 17.4 million low-income seniors and children       and adults with disabilities who rely on the program for       critical health care and long-term services and supports       (LTSS, i.e., assistance with daily activities such as eating,       bathing, dressing, managing medications, and transportation).       Older adults and people with disabilities now account for       over sixty percent of Medicaid spending, and cuts of this       magnitude will result in loss of benefits and services for       this vulnerable population.        Of these 17.4 million individuals: 6.9 million are ages 65       and older (which equals more than 1 in every 7 elderly       Medicare beneficiaries); 10.5 million are children and adults       living with disabilities; and about 10.8 million are so poor       or have a disability that they qualify for both Medicare and       Medicaid (dual eligibles). Dual eligibles account for almost       33 percent of Medicaid spending. While they comprise a       relatively small percentage of enrollees, they account for a       disproportionate share of total Medicare and Medicaid       spending.        Individuals with disabilities of all ages and older adults       rely on critical Medicaid services, including home and       community-based services (HCBS) for assistance with daily       activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, and home       modifications; nursing home care; and other benefits such as       hearing aids and eyeglasses. People with disabilities of all       ages also rely on Medicaid for access to comprehensive acute       health care services. For working adults, Medicaid can help       them continue to work; for children, it allows them to stay       with their families and receive the help they need at home or       in their community. Individuals may have low incomes, face       high medical costs, or have already spent through their       resources paying out-of-pocket for LTSS, and need these       critical services. For these individuals, Medicaid is a       program of last resort.        In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person,       this approach to financing would likely result in       overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and       families unable to shoulder the costs of care without       sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to       program eligibility, services, or both--ultimately harming       some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens. In terms of       seniors, we have serious concerns about setting caps at a       time when per-beneficiary spending for poor seniors is likely       to increase in future years. By 2026, when Boomers start to       turn age 80 and older, they will likely need much higher       levels of service--including HCBS and nursing home--moving       them into the highest cost group of all seniors. As this       group continues to age, their level of need will increase as       well as their overall costs. We are also concerned that caps       will not accurately reflect the cost of care for individuals       in each state, including for children and adults with       disabilities and seniors, especially those living with the       most severe disabling conditions. CBO estimates that Medicaid       spending on a per-enrollee basis would grow at a faster rate       than the consumer price index for medical care services (CPI-      M)--3.7 percent for CPI-M versus an average annual growth       rate of 4.4 percent for Medicaid over the 2017-2026 period.       Over time, the difference in the growth rate under the per       capita cap (CPI-M) and the actual cost of care would further       shift costs to states, which could result in even greater       potential harm to some of the most vulnerable individuals.        AARP is also opposed to the repeal of the six percent       enhanced federal Medicaid match for states that take up the       Community First Choice (CFC) Option. CFC provides states with       a financial incentive to offer HCBS to help older adults and       people with disabilities live in their homes and communities       where they want to be. About 90 percent of older adults want       to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as       possible. HCBS are also cost effective. On average, in       Medicaid, the cost of HCBS per person is one-third the cost       of institutional care. Taking away the enhanced match could       disrupt services for older adults and people with       disabilities in the states that are already providing       services under CFC and would result in a loss of about $12       billion for HCBS over ten years.        AARP also has concerns with the removal of the state option       in Medicaid to increase the home equity limit above the       federal minimum. This provision would take away flexibility       for states to adjust a Medicaid eligibility criterion based       on the specific circumstances of each state and its residents       beyond a federal minimum standard. AARP continues to support       critical consumer protections included in current law,       including guaranteed issue, prohibitions on preexisting       condition exclusions, bans on annual and lifetime coverage       limits and allowing families to keep children on their       policies until the age of 26. Also, AARP continues to support       restoring the 7.5 percent threshold for the medical expense       deduction which will directly help older Americans struggling       to pay for health care, particularly the high cost of nursing       homes and other long-term services and supports.        We look forward to working with you to ensure that we       maintain a strong health care system that ensures robust       insurance market protections, controls costs, improves       quality, and provides affordable coverage to all Americans.            Sincerely,                                               Nancy A. LeaMond,                                        Executive Vice President and                             Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the American Medical Association sent  letters to Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi saying that ``We are  deeply concerned that the AHCA would result in millions of Americans  losing their current health insurance coverage. Nothing in the'' so- called ``MacArthur amendment remedies the shortcomings of the  underlying bill.''   And then they say that, basically, this addition that the Republicans  added to the healthcare bill ``could effectively make coverage  completely unaffordable for people with preexisting conditions.''   I include in the Record the letter from the American Medical  Association.                                   American Medical Association,                                        Chicago, IL, April 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: After reviewing the       MacArthur Amendment to H.R. 1628, the American Health Care       Act (AHCA), the American Medical Association (AMA) remains       opposed to passage of this legislation. As we have previously       stated, we are deeply concerned that the AHCA would result in       millions of Americans losing their current health insurance       coverage. Nothing in the MacArthur amendment remedies the       shortcomings of the underlying bill. The amendment does not       offer a clear long-term framework for stabilizing and       strengthening the individual health insurance market to       ensure that low and moderate income patients are able to       secure affordable and adequate coverage, nor does it ensure       that Medicaid and other critical safety net programs are       maintained and adequately funded.        The MacArthur Amendment would allow states to apply for       waivers from critical consumer protections provided in the       Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the age rating ratio of       3 to 1, the requirements that health insurers must cover       certain essential health benefits, and the ban on health       status underwriting. The current ban on health status       underwriting protects individuals from being discriminated       against by virtue of their medical conditions. Prior to the       passage of the ACA, such individuals were routinely denied       coverage and/or priced out of affordable coverage. We are       particularly concerned about allowing states to waive this       requirement because it will likely lead to patients losing       their coverage. Although the MacArthur Amendment states that       the ban on preexisting conditions remains intact, this       assurance may be illusory as health status underwriting could       effectively make coverage completely unaffordable to people       with preexisting conditions. There is also no certainty that       the requirement for states to have some kind of reinsurance       or high-risk pool mechanism to help such individuals will be       sufficient to provide for affordable health insurance or       prevent discrimination against individuals with certain high-      cost medical conditions.        We continue to strongly urge Congress to engage in a       bipartisan, bicameral dialogue with stakeholders to work on       policies that enhance coverage, choice, and affordability.            Sincerely,                                               James L. Madara, MD.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I find all this particularly puzzling  because my friends have said over and over and over and over again that  they agree with Democrats when it comes to protecting people with  preexisting conditions. They said that they do not want insurance  companies to have the ability to discriminate against people with  preexisting conditions. And yet what they have done is they have  created a repeal-and-replacement bill that does just that and then goes  after essential benefits.   Again, we have been talking about essential benefits over and over  and over again. And again, I want to remind my colleagues what the word  ``essential'' means. Go to the dictionary.  [[Page H2954]]  Look up the word ``essential.'' It says, absolutely necessary,  extremely important. That is the definition of essential. And so when  we talk about essential health benefits, that is what we are talking  about.   I have one additional speaker. I was going to close, but I would ask  indulgence.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Massachusetts was  speaking, I rushed to the floor because he was making such eloquent and  important statements, and I wanted to make sure to join him on  recognizing that, though we are pushing the can down the road, we know  what the mindset of the administration is in terms of funding this  country. As a member of the Budget Committee, we received the skinny  budget, and, to my dismay, it was a budget that harmed and hurt and  undermined the governance of this Nation.   I think it is important to match the Affordable Care Act with the  outside needs of living and thriving in this Nation. So my Houston  Housing Authority has now stopped vouchers for families in Section 8  housing for fear of not having the money. They had breaking news 2 days  ago telling those families, don't show up because we have no money to  house you--similar to no money and no room at the inn.   The zeroing out of the community development dollars, which ends our  opportunities for parks and sidewalks and housing and fixing those  hurricane roofs of senior citizens who are living in devastation from  Hurricane Ike.   It is not realizing the importance of the National Endowment for the  Arts or recognizing the EPA and clean air and clean water for those of  us who live near the Gulf or near the border.   It is not recognizing that you are not the President of the 10  percent that may approve of what you are doing, but you are the  President of the United States of America.   And then, for those who work in health care, in a meeting I just had  with the National Institutes of Health, $6 billion cut. Do you realize  that one of the institutes sends 88 percent of their moneys out for  grants so that researchers, young scientists who live here in the  United States, can thrive and provide new kinds of research?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 1  minute.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. There are 27 institutes in the National Institutes  of Health. One of them happens to deal with diabetes. The number one is  cancer. And for those of us who have experienced it, and for African- American women and others who have the triple negative trait, breast  cancer, the research of the NIH is crucial.   Or Dr. Fauci's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  Dr. Peter Hotez, in Houston, head of Baylor Infectious Diseases,  understands Ebola and Zika. We need these resources. What an outrage to  cut, in the skinny budget, $6 billion.   So we may push this to another 7 days, but I can tell you that we are  pushing the hearts and minds of Americans. We are creating a disaster.   And I can't appreciate the fact that law enforcement will be losing  funding. The Department of Justice and the Civil Rights Division, in  spite of who is leading that Department, it is a Department for the  vulnerable.   So I thank the gentleman for providing me with this time, but I  wanted to make sure that we added this long litany of those who will be  negatively impacted and that America is not about that. America is  about serving all of the people of the United States.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. I thank the chairman of the  Rules Committee for his indulgence.   I would just close by saying I think it is sad that we are here at  the last minute trying to kick the can down the road to keep the  government running again for 1 additional week. This could have been  avoided and, again, it could have been avoided if, instead of trying to  take away people's health insurance, instead of trying to take away  people's essential health benefits, instead of trying to cut Medicaid  by $800 billion and taking that money and giving a tax break of close  to $1 trillion to the richest people in the country, that we actually  focused on our job, which is keeping this government running.   But my colleagues on the Republican side are in charge. We are where  we are. We have to keep the government running.   Having said all of that, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts. I want to thank the  gentlewoman from Florida and the gentlewoman from Texas for their  comments about trying to focus us on the activities that perhaps they  would want or not want.   Mr. Speaker, today we are here because Chairman Frelinghuysen and  Ranking Member Lowey came to the Rules Committee yesterday and asked us  to please consider the offer that they were laying on the table, and  that is to fund the government for 1 more week, with an assurance that  they needed 1 more week to complete their work.    You heard the gentleman, the Honorable Tom Cole, distinguished  gentleman from not only Oklahoma, but a gentleman from the  Appropriations Committee, reinforce how important the work is.   We have heard from our colleagues on the Democratic side how  important the NIH is, Francis Collins, the work that he does there; the  United States Military; Secretary of Defense Mattis; the men and women  that protect us; those people that are in Homeland Security. That is  what we are going to do, so that is what we are going to focus on, and  that is just the way it is.   So, Mr. Speaker, I would urge all my colleagues to support this rule  and the underlying legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question  on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 235,  nays 178, not voting 17, as follows:                               [Roll No. 235]                                 YEAS--235       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costa      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Crist      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gottheimer      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
