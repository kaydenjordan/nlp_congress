 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Ruthie and  Connie LGBT Elder Americans Act, legislation I am introducing to  support our country's LGBT seniors.   The LGBT senior population is growing and is estimated to include  nearly 6 million Americans by 2030. Unfortunately, the same generation  of LGBT people who fought for rights in the workplace, equal marriage,  and societal recognition are once again marginalized as they age.   LGBT seniors have fewer support services, higher poverty rates, more  social isolation, and inadequate access to healthcare services compared  to the rest of older Americans. One of the primary barriers to  providing services to LGBT seniors is a basic lack of information.   The Older Americans Act, or OAA, already requires the Administration  on Aging to collect data on the individuals receiving OAA services and  the efficacy of OAA programs; but if we collected data on sexual  orientation and gender identity, we could better understand this  population and provide services that best fit their needs.   Unfortunately, the data we do have shows that the poverty rate is  higher for LGBT seniors, which is likely because many have faced  discrimination while working, they have historically been unable to  legally marry, and they have experienced gender and racial  inequalities. We also know that LGBT elders are less likely than their  peers to have community support and caretakers to help them.   I know from speaking with LGBT seniors that many fear discrimination  when receiving home healthcare services. They are twice as likely to be  single and four times more likely to not have children. These are  complex and important issues that require a personalized solution.   The bill I am introducing today with Colorado Senator Michael Bennet  and Florida Representatives Ted Deutch and Charlie Crist would help  bridge the gap between LGBT seniors and the services they need.   The bill is named for Ruthie Berman and Connie Kurtz, who sued the  New York City Board of Education years ago for domestic partner  benefits, and won their landmark case in 1994. In the decades since,  Ruthie and Connie have continued their advocacy and fight as champions  of LGBT rights.   Our bill would amend the Older Americans Act to improve services for  LGBT seniors and require data collection on sexual orientation so  better decisions can be made.   Additionally, the bill would permanently establish a National  Resource Center on LGBT Aging and provide grants for organizations  working to improve LGBT services, including access to healthcare and  long-term care. The resource centers and the grants will help States  and localities reach out to LGBT older adults and provide culturally  competent support.   By requiring specific consideration for LGBT seniors in the Older  Americans Act, we can provide needed support to a vulnerable yet  overlooked population.  [[Page H8301]]    I thank my colleagues for their work on this important issue, and I  hope many others will join us in supporting this bill to help our LGBT  senior communities.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lipinski for yielding and also  for  [[Page H8377]]  organizing this Special Order for the Climate Solutions Caucus. I also  want to thank the founders of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Congressman  Ted Deutch from Florida and Congressman Carlos Curbelo also from  Florida, where they can see at their doorstep what issues like sea  level rise mean to their communities.   Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to join with my colleagues from the  bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus this evening to highlight the  importance of taking action on climate change, something that matters  so much to my constituents at home in Oregon, but also to the country  and to the planet.   This is an important issue that really is a moral imperative. This is  about preserving our natural resources for our children, our  grandchildren, and for generations to come. Addressing climate change  is also vital to our Nation's economy, as we have had some discussion  about that this evening, and also to national security, but, really,  the health of the planet.   Now, the district I am honored to represent out in Oregon is  breathtakingly beautiful, and it is really full of potential. The  majestic Columbia River is the northern boundary of the district, and  the rugged Pacific Ocean is on the western boundary. It has a thriving  outdoor recreation economy. As my colleague from New York mentioned,  that is an important sector that cares a lot about the changing  climate.   I also have in my district the heart of Oregon wine country. People  in my district fish. They fish in our rivers, our lakes, and our ocean.  They hike in our forests. They ski in our back country and on our  mountains. We rely on those natural resources in our backyard to  support a significant part of our economy, but we are very vulnerable  to the effects of climate change.   My constituents are already experiencing challenges: Our wine and  agricultural industries are concerned about drought as global  temperatures continue to rise. Coastal communities are worried about  the vitality of the commercial fishing and shellfish industries as high  levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere change ocean chemistry.   I was really thrilled that we had an Oregonian from Oregon State  University come to the Climate Solutions Caucus and talk about adapting  to ocean acidification.   Our region has faced higher spring and summer temperatures and  earlier snowmelt, and, as a result, a snowboard shop in my district is  now selling more skateboards and fewer snowboards.   Climate change is not a partisan issue. Nationwide, fishers, farmers,  small-business owners, and our servicemen and -women are changing the  way they do their jobs because of climate change, regardless of  political affiliation.   The economic, health, and environmental consequences of climate  change are well known, and our understanding about how to address  climate change continues to improve.   People in the United States and around the world are facing threats  from rising sea levels, from ocean acidification, from more frequent  and severe weather events from record droughts and flooding and rising  global temperatures. We can no longer sit back and debate whether we  should take action. The time is now. It is critical that we support  scientific research about the climate and that we build on, rather than  break down, decades' worth of progress on this issue.   Now, one important area of research is the connection between extreme  weather events and climate change. Although it is not possible to say  that climate change causes one particular extreme weather event, it is  critical that we know more about climate change and how it increases  the frequency and the severity of these events. Learning more about  this correlation can help families, communities, and businesses make  informed choices and adopt climate strategies.   Now, this year has seen poignant example after example with so many  devastating extreme weather events. We need to do everything we can to  make sure our communities are prepared to keep families safe.   We have had wildfires in the Western United States for a long time,  but since the mid-1980s, they have been increasing in frequency and in  duration, threatening lives, threatening public health and property. It  has been unusually hot and very dry in the Northwest.   Fires and severe smoke create dangerous conditions for all  populations. In Portland, Oregon, on Labor Day, the sky was gray, full  of smoke from wildfire. This is especially problematic for pregnant  women, for seniors, for children, for anyone with chronic health  conditions like asthma. Residents and communities miles away from the  wildfires saw ash falling on their homes, their cars, and throughout  their neighborhoods.   This year's hurricanes have devastated communities, of course, across  Texas, across the Southeast, and in the U.S. islands. About 70 percent  of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico are still without power.   These storms are increasing in frequency and severity, and lives are  being lost every year.   Mr. Speaker, it is so important that we take action, and that is why  I am so pleased to be here today to help highlight the importance of  this issue.   As Representative Lipinski noted and others have, Mr. McNerney and  others, we can take action to address climate change and grow the  economy. It is not an excuse to say this will be bad for the economy,  because we can grow those renewable energy industries. There is so much  potential in wind power, wave energy, solar energy. Those are good,  high-paying, family-wage jobs. We can grow those economies and address  climate change at the same time.   Mr. Speaker, addressing climate change is going to save lives; it is  going to save property. I am so pleased to be part of this bipartisan  group that is working together in equal number of Democrats and  Republicans to call attention to this important issue, and I will  continue to work with the caucus to emphasize the importance of  congressional action.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the bipartisan Climate  Solutions Caucus for their dedication to this effort. I know it is  quite a relief to my constituents back home in Oregon to know that  there are bipartisan Members who are committed to addressing this  critical issue.    Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their dedication to  this effort. I look forward to the progress that we will make together  on behalf of our constituents, our communities, our country, and our  planet.
