 Mr. President, it is my honor today to pay tribute to  five native Utahns who are brothers and veterans of World War II and  Korea: William, Gail, George, Jack, and Bert Alexander.   These five brothers answered the call to defend our freedom and the  freedoms of others from foreign invaders. Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan,  and the North Koreans believed it their right to attack and forcefully  restrict the freedoms of their neighbors, but these brothers recognized  that our freedom as American citizens is inextricably linked to the  freedom of our friends and allies. Remaining safely protected in  Northern Utah was not an option for the Alexander brothers; they  answered the call to take up arms and defend freedom's cause.   One brother, SGT Gail Alexander, was killed in action exactly 75  years ago tomorrow, May 24, 1944, during the Anzio campaign to retake  Rome, Italy. The Anzio campaign and then Operation Neptune--or D-day,  as it came to be known--marked an important turning point in World War  II, with the Allies beginning to liberate and retake German-occupied  Europe, restoring freedom to the French and Italians and subsequently  to the rest of Europe.   Prior to his death, Gail received a Purple Heart and Silver Star  citation for Gallantry when on February 4, 1944, after sustaining a  gunshot injury to his hand, he singlehandedly took out a  [[Page S3101]]  German machine gun position that had held up his entire company. Alone  and the his company under fire, Gail gradually ran 130 yards across the  battlefield, machine guns kicking up dirt on both sides of him and  artillery shells falling all around. He made it to the machine gun  position, knocking it out with grenades, allowing his company to come  out from under cover.   In the official military report of the incident, Gail's commanding  officer said, ``Sergeant Alexander's fearless action under direct  machine gun fire for twenty minutes, enabled our company to obtain the  objective . . . and prevented any further casualties to our own men.''   Gail's brothers William, George, and Jack all returned home after  serving in various capacities more than 2 years each all throughout the  European theater. The youngest brother, Bert Alexander, who just passed  away on April 2 of this year at the age of 87, was too young to serve  in World War II but still answered the call to defend liberty when he  embarked for service in Korea.   So today I, along with the entire U.S. Senate, honor these five  brothers, their Gold Star mother, and their families, both living and  deceased. We remember their tremendous service and sacrifice, and we  express our profound gratitude for their sacrifice in defending freedom  for us and for America's allies.                            ____________________
