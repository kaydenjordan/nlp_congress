 Madam Speaker, I stand before you today, the daughter  of a single mother. I was the first in my family to go to college, an  individual who just 10 years ago was homeless, and now today a Member  of Congress.   A Member of Congress. People like me are not supposed to be here. We  just don't make it to quite this level, typically. And, quite frankly,  I am not supposed to be here breathing. You see, my mom when she was 27  years old suffered a stroke when she was pregnant with my sister. The  doctors told her then that she would never be able to have children  again.   So you can imagine, years later when she found herself pregnant with  me, she was scared and alone, and being told by her doctors that she  would not only die, that the child would die, too, and that she must  abort. But my mom did something incredibly brave that day, she made a  choice against the advice of her doctors, against the pressure of her  own family, and she chose life.   You know, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Madam  Speaker, have been talking about how our constitutional rights are  under attack, and I agree, they are. Because they begin with life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It starts with life.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand and fight for our unalienable  rights and the rights of those little girls yet to be born.
