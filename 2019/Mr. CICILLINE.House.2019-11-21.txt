 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the  tremendous progress House Democrats have made to get government working  for the people.   In less than a year, we have passed nearly 400 pieces of legislation,  including more than 275 bipartisan bills that are currently sitting on  Mitch McConnell's desk.   We passed legislation to protect coverage for preexisting conditions,  to build on the progress of the ACA, and to drive down the cost of  prescription drugs.   We fought to get hardworking folks the good-paying jobs they need to  put food on the table by passing legislation to raise the minimum wage;  to ensure equal pay for equal work; and to invest more than $70 billion  in green, job-creating infrastructure projects.   We fought to clean up corruption in Washington by passing the most  comprehensive anticorruption bill since Watergate.   Yet Mitch McConnell would rather tout himself as the grim reaper than  vote on these bills that will help his constituents and the American  people.   I have a message for you, Senator McConnell: Do your job, or your  constituents will pick someone who will.
