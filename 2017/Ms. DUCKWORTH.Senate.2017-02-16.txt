 Mr. President, I would like to take this time to share  with my colleagues why Scott Pruitt is unqualified to be Administrator  of the EPA and why I oppose his nomination.   I just got a new job here in the Senate when the people of Illinois  elected me last November, and I have a little advice for Mr. Pruitt on  how to succeed in an interview. No. 1, don't go to a job interview and  spend the entire time dodging questions. You don't tell the people  interviewing you to go file document requests, which Mr. Pruitt can  [[Page S1321]]  reject as attorney general, and you don't oppose policies that  strengthen our energy security like the renewable fuel standard. I am  concerned that the RFS will be gutted under a Scott Pruitt-led EPA.   As someone who fought to defend this great Nation, I see firsthand  the price we pay for our dependence on oil imported from our  adversaries. I already fought a war over oil, and I would rather run my  car on American-grown corn and soybeans than oil from the Middle East.  During Operation Iraqi Freedom, 50 percent of all casualties occurred  during convoy operations, and 80 percent of all convoy operations were  conducted to transport diesel fuel. I think it is high time we invest  more energy and more money and more support into development of  biofuels like ethanol.   In addition to risking lives, we are wasting resources. Annually, we  spend approximately $67.5 billion protecting global oil supplies. At  home, Americans are using more gas than ever before. Yet OPEC has made  it clear they are controlling the price we pay at the pump.   For example, in November of 2016, OPEC decided to cut its oil  production to increase prices, and it caused a 10-percent increase in  prices that very day. By December 12, prices had reached an 18-month  high. We should not be risking lives and wasting money when we can use  energy grown right here at home in States like mine. When we are  producing more oil at home than ever before, that doesn't mean we can  gut policies that are helping our Nation become energy independent. We  need an EPA Administrator who will work with Congress to help us find  ways to cut, not increase, our use of oil.   Scott Pruitt called the RFS unworkable. He clearly doesn't know that  the renewable fuel standard is delivering triple bottom-line benefits.  It is good for our security, it is good for our economy, and it is good  for our climate. In my State of Illinois alone, the RFS employs more  than 4,000 people and generates more than $5 billion in economic  impact. Nationwide it is supporting 86,000 direct jobs. Those are good  jobs with good wages. Those are people who are going home and paying  their mortgages, sending their kids to school, and saving money toward  retirement. It has helped to generate $8.7 billion in tax revenues that  go to schools, roads, and first responders.    Mr. Pruitt's failure to support the RFS is not the only reason I  oppose his nomination.   During his confirmation hearing before the Environment and Public  Works Committee, which I sit on, Mr. Pruitt gave vague, hollow, and  evasive answers. It was clear that he either doesn't support or  understand the mission of the very Agency he would like to lead.   Mr. Pruitt, the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency is to  protect the basic ingredients that people need for a good life. It is  to protect our air and our water. These issues, public health issues,  are what he has spent his career in helping Big Oil to dismantle.   Take the issue of lead poisoning. One of the responsibilities of the  EPA is to enforce our lead contamination laws that keep lead out of our  air and water. When questioned at his confirmation hearing, I was  shocked that Mr. Pruitt was unaware that there was no safe level of  lead for children.   As a mom, this terrifies me. I remember sitting in the House  Oversight and Government Reform Committee when we had hearings on the  Flint water crisis. I am a mom of a 2-year-old, and at the time my baby  was just 1 year old. I remember being pregnant and having my daughter.  I looked out into that audience, and I saw a mom holding a baby bottle  that looked exactly like one my daughter drank out of--a little bottle  with a pink top on it. The water in her baby bottle that she had to  make her formula with was brown. It was brown. I thought about what it  would have been like for me to have been drinking that water while I  was pregnant and to have fed that water to my child and to have had the  choice of: Could I have afforded bottled water or would I have to feed  my daughter that water? It is not acceptable, not in the greatest  country on the face of the Earth.   Mr. Pruitt doesn't know there is no safe level of lead allowed in the  drinking water for children? Even low levels of lead can cause  permanent brain damage in kids, lower IQs, and inflict other cognitive  damage. There is no excuse for our Nation's EPA Administrator to not  know that basic fact. That is a serious oversight, especially in the  aftermath of the Flint water crisis. Lead in schools and in public  waterways is a serious problem for Illinois children as well as for the  children of Michigan. It is a problem for families. It is a problem for  families and for children all across this Nation.   The EPA should work proactively to prevent crises like in Flint and  to protect America's water supplies, but Mr. Pruitt's record of filing  lawsuit after lawsuit that challenge the EPA's authority to carry out  its mission doesn't inspire much confidence that his goals are the same  as the Agency's that he seeks to lead. The American people simply  cannot afford to have someone with a well-documented history of putting  corporate polluters' profits before our clean air and water leading the  Agency that is meant to safeguard them--the EPA.   We are only starting to learn the extent of Mr. Pruitt's conflicts of  interest, and we have an opportunity to learn more about these  conflicts now that a State judge in Oklahoma has ordered Mr. Pruitt to  release by Tuesday potentially thousands of emails he exchanged with  fossil fuel interests in his job as the Oklahoma attorney general.  Senate Republicans are forcing us to vote on Mr. Pruitt before Tuesday  because they know the American people will be alarmed and shocked by  what his correspondence will reveal.   Mr. Pruitt has shown he is unwilling and unable to do this job. I  remember, during questioning in committee, he was asked what was the  role of the EPA. He spent the majority of his answer talking about the  Federal Government not infringing on States' rights and talking about  pulling the Federal Government and the EPA out of the States' business.  Only at the very end did he add, almost as an afterthought--oh, yes-- ``and to safeguard the water and the air.'' The name of the Agency is  the Environmental Protection Agency. That should have been the first  thing he said, not the last.   He doesn't understand the central public health and environmental  challenges that face us. Instead of siding with people, he has chosen  to side with corporate polluters. He doesn't have a single  environmental accomplishment to his name. He is unqualified, and I urge  my colleagues to join me in opposing his nomination.   As someone who represents a farming State, I remember when President  Trump came out to the Midwest and promised the American farmers that he  would support the renewable fuel standard. I am deeply disappointed he  has nominated someone to head the EPA who is clearly opposed to the  renewable fuel standard.   I asked Mr. Pruitt several times in committee, in several different  ways, if he would stand by the American farmer. I even told him what  the right answer was--side with, stand with, protect the producers, and  he refused to answer. He gave vague, evasive answers and refused to  commit and refused to support the American farmer.   It is a no-brainer. Support the American farmer. Don't break the  President's promise. Don't back away from the RFS.   Mr. Pruitt is continuing his administration's tradition of using  alternative facts. The alternative to facts is fiction, and we cannot  afford to have an Administrator who questions climate change. Climate  change is an urgent threat to our Nation. Increasing temperatures are  causing extreme weather events at alarming rates. We are witnessing  more intense droughts, wildfires, and extreme weather across this  country. If we put our heads in the sand and fail to curb the pollution  that drives climate change, the effects will be devastating as our air  quality will worsen, which will trigger more asthma attacks and other  respiratory issues for our children; our coastal communities will be  threatened by sea level rise; our national security will be threatened  as climate change creates instability around the world.    ADM Mike Mullen, who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  under the Bush and Obama administrations, had this to say about climate  change:   [[Page S1322]]              Whatever the cause, climate change's potential impacts are       sobering and far-reaching. Glaciers are melting at a faster       rate, causing water supplies to diminish in Asia; rising sea       levels could lead to a mass migration and displacement       similar to what we saw in Pakistan's 2010 floods.    The National Intelligence Council's report, ``Global Trends 2030,''  made similar observations.   Their report states: ``Many developing and fragile states, such as in  Sub-Saharan Africa, face increasing strain from resource constraints  and climate change, pitting different tribal and ethnic groups against  one another and accentuating the separation of various identities.''   Climate change, clean air, clean water, and fighting lead  contamination are not partisan issues. We don't only have these issues  in red States or blue States--they are universal--and the American  people expect us to make sure the head of the Agency that is charged  with safeguarding these vital health priorities will be able and  willing to do the job.   Since Mr. Pruitt was nominated, I have heard concerns from thousands  of my constituents. Let me share a few words that I have received from  my home State.   This letter is from one of my constituents from Illinois.   He writes:         I am asking you to vote ``no'' on Scott Pruitt's nomination       as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.       America's clean water and air are a shining example for much       of the world, and the EPA is their defender. Mr. Pruitt       demonstrates no understanding of ocean acidification and the       urgent risk it poses to American marine life, fishermen, and       the communities that depend on them. Americans must protect       our water and air from further pollution while we work       collaboratively toward win-win solutions to challenges like       ocean acidification. Mr. Pruitt ignores established science,       and he is the wrong choice to lead the EPA. As my Senator,       please vote ``no'' on my behalf.    I hear you, and I share your concerns, and I will be voting no on Mr.  Pruitt as Administrator of the EPA.   As you may know, EPA region 5 is based in my State, in Chicago. I  have heard from a number of EPA employees as well as from  constituents--employees, both past and present--who are worried about  the Agency they have served and loved. Here are some words from a  former region 5 employee.   He writes:         Dear Senator Duckworth, I and many other former employees       of the Environmental Protection Agency want to share our       concern about Attorney General Scott Pruitt's qualifications       to serve as the next Administrator of the EPA. Our       perspective is not partisan. Having served under both       Republican and Democratic Presidents, we recognize the right       of a new administration to pursue new policies that protect       our environment, but the EPA's Administrator must act in the       public's interest and not simply advance the agendas of the       industries that it regulates.        Decisions that affect the public's health or natural       resources should respect the law and reflect the best       scientific evidence available. Mr. Pruitt's record and public       statements suggest that he does not share these values. As       Oklahoma's attorney general, Mr. Pruitt issued more than 50       press releases celebrating lawsuits to overturn EPA standards       to limit mercury emissions from powerplants, reduce smog       levels in cities and regional haze in parks, clean up the       Chesapeake Bay, or control greenhouse gas emissions. In       contrast, none of Mr. Pruitt's press releases refer to any       action he has taken to enforce environmental laws or to       actually reduce pollution.        Of even greater concern, his statements frequently ignore       or misrepresent EPA's authority to regulate or its obligation       to do so under the Clean Air or Clean Water Act. Mr. Pruitt       has shown little interest in the kind of scientific and       factual evidence that must guide EPA decisions. Mr. Pruitt       has said that humanity's contribution to global warming is       subject to considerable debate. That statement is at odds       with the consensus among scientists. Mr. Pruitt fails to       understand the difference between the public interest and the       private interest.    It is just amazing to me that we are even here, that this man was  even nominated--someone who has sued the EPA, someone who has so  clearly been in partnership with the fossil fuel industry and who has  not put the interests of families and children first as opposed to the  interests of the fossil fuel industry, which have been guiding him all  the way.   I, in fact, was shocked to learn that Mr. Pruitt closed the Oklahoma  Environmental Enforcement Unit established by his predecessor. Instead,  he established a new litigation team to challenge the EPA and other  Federal agencies. Let me say that again. When he became the Oklahoma  attorney general, he closed the Oklahoma Environmental Enforcement  Unit. Instead, he chose to start a new litigation team to challenge the  EPA and other Federal agencies.   I did not see any indication from him, in his confirmation hearing,  that he would not do the same once he gets to the Federal EPA. Perhaps  that is the intent of the Trump administration, to bring someone in who  will dismantle the EPA. That is why I am here tonight. That is why I am  opposing him--because I put the needs of our children, the needs of our  environment, and the needs of our national security in front of the  needs of the biofuel industry. We need an Administrator who has the  patience, skill, and commitment to public service in order to steer the  EPA through challenges that are associated with protecting our public  health.   I, too, cannot believe Mr. Pruitt has demonstrated that he has the  qualities needed to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. I hope  you will be happy to know that is why I am opposing his nomination.   A constituent from Deerfield, IL, wrote to me:         I am writing to ask that you raise your voice in Washington       against Scott Pruitt as President Trump's nominee for EPA       Administrator.        The EPA is an organization driven by science and dedicated       to protecting the climate and environment, not just for       Americans but for all citizens of the Earth. Mr. Pruitt, on       the other hand, disagrees with a vast majority of the       scientific establishment as to the extent of climate change       and humanity's role in it. He has made a name for himself by       opposing EPA's policies and missions in the past.        It is beyond me that anyone believes Mr. Pruitt could       effectively head the EPA and lead it further in its mission       to ensure we are responsible stewards of this planet's       environment and resources. I ask that you do your duty as a       citizen of this planet and vote ``no'' on Mr. Pruitt for this       position.        The EPA is an organization driven by science and dedicated       to protecting the climate and environment, not just for       Americans, but for all nations of the Earth. Mr. Pruitt, on       the other hand, disagrees with the vast majority of the       scientific establishment. Vote no on Mr. Pruitt for this       position.        I hope you all do your duty as representatives of the       American people by vocalizing our concerns with Mr. Pruitt to       your fellow Senators, urging them to see the fault in       President Trump's nomination.        Respectfully, Ethan, Deerfield, IL.    Well, Ethan, I am doing exactly that. That is why I am here today--to  make sure that our colleagues understand how poorly suited Mr. Pruitt  is to this job of Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.   Here is a letter from a Ph.D. student from Northwestern University.         As a Northwestern University doctorate student, I have       chosen to devote my life to the pursuit of scientific       knowledge. I am deeply troubled by the nomination of Scott       Pruitt, and I am really concerned about the upcoming Senate       vote.        The head of the EPA must uphold basic science and should       not be colluding with the polluters they are required to       regulate. Scott Pruitt cannot be trusted to head the EPA, an       agency that is charged with protecting all Americans from       threats to their water, air, and health.        Pruitt is also out of step with the vast majority of       scientists, not only those working in the field of climate       change, but also those who have dedicated their lives to       protecting our air and water. As a scientific agency charged       with protecting the public's health according to the best and       most recent science, the EPA deserves to be headed by someone       with a scientific background, or at least an appreciation for       scientific truth.        I strongly urge you as my Senator to stand up for me and my       neighbors, and I oppose this nomination.        Thank you so much, Amanda Cook, from North Lakeview Avenue       in Chicago.    Well, Amanda, I get it. I am with you. I, of course, did not pursue a  Ph.D. in a scientific field, but it doesn't take a Ph.D. in a  scientific field to know that a man who has sued the EPA over a dozen  times is not someone suitable to lead the EPA; that a man who said that  he doesn't know whether climate change truly is scientific fact should  not be the man who is going to head the Agency enforced with dealing  with the effects of global warming. He should not be the person who is  in charge of the Agency that will be protecting our air and our water  supply.   We have not even touched on what the costs will be to this Nation if  we continue to neglect the well-being of our environment. Rising rates  of asthma of our children will mean higher  [[Page S1323]]  medical costs. Lead in the water supply causing cognitive damage to our  children will mean that additional resources must be spent in our  schools in order to provide those children with the best opportunities  that they can have to grow and thrive and will also result in greater  medical bills to treat those children for the rest of their lives.   If you don't believe me, just ask the people of Flint, MI. They are  dealing with it every single day--every single day--those parents of  children who have now been affected by the lead in that water supply.  And Mr. Pruitt chooses to defend and protect the needs of the biofuels  industry over the needs of our children. That is not someone worthy of  representing the American people. That is not someone worthy of heading  this Agency.   Let's just stick to Mr. Pruitt's own words, not the words of others,  not the words of my constituents, but his own words. This is what he  said about the Agency that he has been chosen to lead. Mr. Pruitt  describes himself as ``a leading advocate against the EPA's activist  agenda.'' He said this on his LinkedIn page. We accessed this in  January of 2016.   On the role of the EPA he says:         I believe the EPA has a role to play in our Republican form       of government. Air and water quality issues can cross State       lines and can sometimes require Federal intervention. At the       same time, the EPA was never intended to be our Nation's       frontline environmental regulator.    This was his testimony before the House Committee on Science, Space,  and Technology in May of 2016.   I disagree with you. I disagree with you, Mr. Pruitt, because I was  there at that hearing where there were both State EPA officials as well  as Federal EPA officials trying to explain why they allowed Detroit's  children to be poisoned. And the Federal EPA official knew about the  lead in the water supply--in fact, had discovered it--and they were so  timid about pursuing it that they waited too long and allowed the State  to continue to move forward. Those Federal EPA officials were indeed on  the frontline.   I asked the Regional Administrator, Would you not rather be in front  of this committee today explaining why you acted too quickly to save  the health and the future well-being of the children of Flint than to  be here in front of us today explaining why you allowed them to be  poisoned, and not exercise your right as the Federal EPA to step in  when the health and well-being of American citizens were at stake?   So Mr. Pruitt, I disagree with you. The EPA was indeed intended to be  one of our Nation's frontline environmental regulators.   On climate change, Mr. Pruitt has said:         Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates       of our time. That debate is far from settled. Scientists       continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global       warming and its connections to the actions of mankind. That       debate should be encouraged in classrooms, public forums, and       the halls of Congress.    Really. He is actually arguing that we should be teaching false  science and should be encouraging it in classrooms and public forums. I  can't think of something that would be a greater disservice to America  than for the EPA Administrator to be someone who actually looks at  scientific data--proven scientific data, facts--and rejects them. Yet,  we know why he does. We know from his history. We know from his record  in Oklahoma. He does it because the fossil fuel industry tells him so.   This is what he said about the Clean Power Plan:         The President could announce the most ``state friendly''       plan possible, but it would not change the fact that the       administration does not have the legal authority under the       Clean Air Act to regulate carbon emissions.    Yes, it does. Yes, it does, Mr. Pruitt.   He just said that in August of 2015.   Here is what he said on methane regulation:         My concern is that EPA is employing its flawed methodology       in order to rationalize new and unjustified Federal       regulations to solve a methane emissions problem that simply       does not exist.    This man does not believe in global warming. This man does not  believe in scientific data.   If you don't believe the scientists, at least look at what is  happening with the storm systems, with what is happening to the climate  that is changing and affecting this Nation with increased drought,  increased flooding, more severe weather, and erosion. We had the first  climate change refugees of Louisiana where people who have lived for  generations in the gulf have now seen their islands washed away and  have to be resettled.   Even if you don't believe in the data, believe your eyes and believe  the facts.   Mr. Pruitt also said:         The record does not support EPA's finding that mercury       poses public health hazards. Human exposure to methylmercury       resulting from coal-fired EGUs is exceedingly small.    That is simply untrue.   On legislating, he has said:         Legislation should not be ``we like clean air, so go make       clean air.'' That is what bothers me, that Congress gives       this general authority to EPA.    On Oklahoma's race to the bottom on environmental regulations--this  has to do with the Federal regional haze standards--Mr. Pruitt said:         These standards threaten the competitive edge Oklahoma has       enjoyed for years with low cost and reliable electric       generation. This low-cost energy not only benefits Oklahoma       manufacturers but gives us a considerable edge in recruiting       new jobs.    He would rather increase the haze and the pollution in the  environment. He would rather have an economic edge at the expense of  the people of Oklahoma who must live and breathe more polluted air.   This is what he said on the renewable fuels standard:         The evidence is clear that the current ethanol fuel mandate       is unworkable. The decision by the EPA to lower that standard       is good news for Oklahoma consumers.    What he means is that it is good news for Oklahoma's fossil fuel  producers. In fact, the renewable fuel standards have been a success  and we should be adhering to them and we should be keeping the  renewable fuel standards and supporting the producers.   I will bet on the American farmer any day of the week. Our farmers  work hard. Our farmers produce the corn for ethanol right here in the  United States. I would rather invest in them than in foreign oil. I  would rather invest in them and in a fuel that is clean-burning versus  a fuel that pollutes the environment for the next generation of our  Nation.   Even if you don't believe in the science, believe in the dollars.  Ethanol and biofuels employ tens of thousands of hard-working Americans  all across this great Nation. It accounts for large proportions of the  economies of the farming States, including Illinois, Iowa, Ohio. So  even if you don't believe, you should at least support our farming  communities.   It is a fact that Scott Pruitt is simply too extreme to lead the EPA.  He once wrote an entire op-ed questioning the science of climate  change. He said:         Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates       of our time. That debate is far from settled. Scientists       continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global       warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.    This is according to an op-ed written by Scott Pruitt in the Tulsa  World.   He goes on:         Healthy debate is the lifeblood of American democracy, and       global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates       of our time. That debate is far from settled.    I agree that healthy debate is important to democracy, but when that  debate is over and becomes an item of fact, it is just simply silly,  and in the case of clean air and clean water and climate change, it  gets to be dangerous.   His climate denial goes against the scientific community. Ninety- seven percent of scientists, including those at NASA, agree that human  activities are causing climate change.   The 18 major national scientific organizations issued a joint  statement with the following conclusion:         Observations throughout the world make it clear that       climate change is occurring and rigorous scientific research       demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human       activities are the primary driver.    Mr. Pruitt's climate denial is also against the will of the American  people. In fact, a New York Times/Stanford poll from 2015 showed that  77 percent of Americans support government action to combat climate  change. This poll found that 83 percent of Americans, including 61  percent of Republicans, say that if nothing is done to  [[Page S1324]]  reduce emissions, global warming will be a serious problem in the  future. Seventy-seven percent of Americans, according to this poll, say  that the Federal Government should be doing a substantial amount to  combat climate change.   In a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll from 2009, 67 percent of Americans  stated that they supported EPA action to curb carbon pollution from  powerplants, while only 29 percent opposed them. In that same poll, 57  percent supported requiring companies to cut emissions even if it means  higher power bills. This was an increase from 48 percent in October of  2009 to the poll that was conducted in June of 2014.   Mr. Pruitt's blatantly anti-environment agenda threatens public  health. He is unfit to lead an Agency that he sued at every turn to  block protections for clean air and water. He sued the EPA over the  legality of the Clean Power Plan. He claims that the EPA does not have  the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas  emissions.   Since becoming Oklahoma's top legal officer in 2011, Mr. Pruitt has  unsuccessfully attempted to stop vital protections of public health-- unsuccessfully. This includes standards for reducing soot and smog  pollution that crosses interstate lines; protections against emissions  of mercury, arsenic, acid gases, and other toxic pollutants from  powerplants; and standards to improve air quality in national parks and  wilderness areas. Each time he has done this, he has failed. Yet he  continues to file suit.    He did many of these suits in conjunction with the fossil fuel  industry. Some of those suits are still outstanding. Yet he has said-- he has refused to commit to recusing himself from any of these lawsuits  that may come in front of the EPA while he is the Administrator of the  Agency. That is a conflict of interest. He will simply become the  plaintiff, the judge, and the jury if he does not recuse himself. But  of course that is his goal. His goal is to dismantle the EPA. His goal  is to dismantle the Clean Water Act. His goal is to take away the  authority of the EPA to regulate and protect those activities that  affect our environment.   Mr. Pruitt launched three separate failed lawsuits against EPA's  clean air rules, the regional haze cross-state air pollution rule, and  the mercury and air toxics protections, otherwise known as MATs. The  Supreme Court flat-out rejected Mr. Pruitt's challenges to the EPA's  mercury standards. Thank God, because it protects millions of children  from the effects of mercury, arsenic, and other dangers neurotoxins  from coal plants.   Mr. Pruitt wants to block the EPA's clean water rule, which will  protect the drinking water for over 117 million--that is one in three-- Americans. One in three Americans gets drinking water from streams that  lacked clear protections before the clean water rule.   According to analysis of over 1,200 peer-reviewed scientific reports,  small streams and wetlands play a critical role in the health of larger  downstream bodies, such as rivers, lakes, bays, and coastal waters.   Mr. Pruitt doesn't even want the EPA to study fracking's potential  links to water contamination. As recently as 2014, he sent a letter to  the EPA Office of Inspector General warning against preliminary  research into threats to water resources posed by hydraulic fracturing.  He said he believed EPA's efforts to study whether fracking was linked  to groundwater contamination was politically motivated. He is even  afraid of a study. Not only is he trying to block the EPA's ability to  regulate, he doesn't even want the EPA to study it. He doesn't even  want it to have the chance to develop the data to show that our water  supply is under danger from fracking.   This man doesn't believe in scientific data, but he is afraid of it.  If he weren't afraid of it, he would support these studies because they  would show that he was right. But here is the problem: He is not right.  He is wrong. The scientific data shows that such activities pollute our  water supply.   Mr. Pruitt has repeatedly failed to act to protect the people of  Oklahoma from increasingly powerful earthquakes caused by fossil fuel  extraction through the process of fracking as well. We have had a  string of level 5 magnitude earthquakes hit the State of Oklahoma.  Scientists have indicated that they are being caused by a dramatic rise  in the use of hydraulic fracturing--fracking--to produce oil and gas.  The problem lies in the massive volumes of wastewater unearthed in the  process of unlocking oil and gas. Operators typically dump salty  wastewater, injecting high volumes of fluid into the disposal wells dug  thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, but the pressure from  wastewater is wreaking havoc on Oklahoma's fault lines.   The Oklahoma Geological Survey bluntly concluded last year that it  was very likely that the majority of earthquakes that ripped through  the central and northern regions of the State were caused by this  process of injecting wastewater into disposal wells. This was reported  by NBC News in November of 2016.   In 2016, the National Review reported that Mr. Pruitt compared taking  on Big Oil to offenses committed by the British leading to the American  Revolution. It said:         The United States was born out of a revolution against, in       the words of the Declaration of Independence, an ``arbitrary       government'' that put men on trial for ``pretended offenses''       and ``abolish[ed] the Free System of English laws.'' Brave       men and women stood up to that oppressive government, and       this, the greatest democracy of them all, one that is       governed by the rule of law and not by men, is the product.    Some of our States have forgotten this founding principle and are  acting less like Jefferson and Adams and more like George III.   A group of Democratic attorneys general has announced it intends to  criminally investigate oil and gas companies that have disputed the  science behind manmade global warming. Backed by green energy interests  and environmental lobbying groups, the coalition has promised to use  intrusive investigations, costly litigations, and criminal prosecutions  to silence critics of its climate change agenda. This is from the  National Review.   He is comparing the efforts to take on Big Oil to offenses committed  by the British leading to the American Revolution. I will take on Big  Oil any day. I think it is important for our Nation's future.   As we have heard during the course of this debate, those of us who  are troubled by the prospect of Mr. Pruitt becoming EPA Administrator  believe that the process to this point has been marred by his failure  to provide us with the information we feel we need to evaluate his  suitability to serve in this critical role. Meanwhile, our colleagues  on the other side of the aisle argue that Mr. Pruitt has been fully  forthcoming. So let's put this dispute aside and turn our attention to  a question Mr. Pruitt did answer. It may be among the most revealing of  his responses. Unfortunately, what his answer reveals is the precise  reason so many of us and so many of the people we represent are opposed  to his confirmation and convinced he is absolutely the wrong person to  head the agency.   Senator Carper asked Mr. Pruitt: Are there any other EPA regulations  that are on the books today that you do support?   Mr. Pruitt declined to name a single one. Not one. He has many that  he could choose from. In fact, the question should have been something  of a softball, in my view, giving him a chance to embrace the EPA's  core mission as a public health Agency. He couldn't find a single  regulation that he could support within the EPA. The man who is  supposed to be heading the EPA could not think of a single regulation  of this Agency that he could support.   Instead, what Mr. Pruitt does not seem to grasp is that EPA  regulations are not simply policies to be litigated. In reality, they  are lifesaving protections for so many Americans, and they create  millions of dollars of net benefits.   Let's take a look at some of the public health environmental  protections Mr. Pruitt cannot bring himself to support.   The mercury and air toxic standards have been projected to save up to  11,000 lives annually from premature deaths--11,000 lives annually from  premature deaths, saved because of these regulations. They also prevent  heart attacks and avoid 5,700 emergency room visits. That translates  into over $80 billion in net benefits in a single year. That is a lot  of lives saved, illnesses avoided, and economic benefits created that a  [[Page S1325]]  would-be EPA Administrator can't bring himself to support.    Of course, we should have expected Mr. Pruitt to name that rule since  he has sued to block it twice, the second time being after EPA modified  the rule to address concerns raised by the Supreme Court. Perhaps the  number of rules we could expect Mr. Pruitt to support is a bit smaller  than we might have thought since he blocked so many of them. In case  after case after case, he has sued to block the EPA from working to  save lives, prevent illnesses, and create economic benefits.   He has sued on behalf of Oklahoma to block the cross-state air  pollution rule, otherwise known as the good neighbor rule. That rule  cuts the pollution that leads to dangerous, sometimes deadly, urban  smog and soot. When he sued, he was suing to block the American public  from enjoying the following benefits: up to 34,000 lives saved per  year, along with some $280 billion in health benefits.   When Mr. Pruitt brought an action against EPA's health-based  standards for ground-level ozone, he was standing in opposition to the  protections that would help avoid 660 premature deaths and over 230,000  asthma attacks, while creating $4.5 billion in health benefits net of  cost. Even if you don't believe in the science, you should at least  believe in the dollars and cents of the lives saved. Yet he continues  to sue the EPA to oppose these regulations.   Although Mr. Pruitt has been a tireless litigator, he has not  challenged every one of EPA's public health protections. But still,  when asked, the man who wants to become the Administrator of the EPA  could not name a single regulation of the Agency that he is about to  take charge of that he supported. That means, for example, Mr. Pruitt  probably doesn't support a rule that reduces the sulfur in gasoline so  that emission control devices on cars can work more effectively. Don't  we all want cars to work effectively? I guess he doesn't. This  particular rule stands to create net benefits of up to $17.5 billion by  2030. Those dollar figures include the benefit of saving up to 2,000  lives and preventing 2,220 hospital admissions and asthma-related  emergency room visits.   In 2015, the EPA set standards for the emissions of toxic air  pollutants at refineries. As a result, 1.4 million fewer people will be  exposed to cancer risks, yielding a 15- to 20-percent reduction in  cancer incidents linked to refinery air pollution. According to his  answer, Mr. Pruitt--who is seeking to be the EPA Administrator--doesn't  support those advancements in public health.   He also doesn't support rules that are protecting the brain  development of our children from exposure to lead in both gasoline and  paint. Otherwise, he may have answered my colleague Mr. Carper by  saying that he supported the highly successful gasoline lead phaseout  that dates all the way back to 1988. That regulation produced health  benefits to the tune of over $6 billion. He didn't even indicate that  he supports a rule addressing childhood lead exposure and renovation  repair and painting.   Mr. Pruitt didn't even tell us that he supports rules that put or  keep money in the pockets of families and businesses along with the  environmental benefits they deliver.   EPA's greenhouse gas and fuel efficiency standards for cars and  light-duty trucks are calculated to save families $1.7 trillion--that  is a ``t''--in fuel costs.   The EPA's 2012 rule limiting the emissions of volatile organic  compounds in natural gas production were calculated to create up to $19  million in cost savings in 2015 alone because of the value of the  material recovered in the process of controlling emissions. Those  benefits, however, did not inspire Mr. Pruitt to support them.   The list of health protections Mr. Pruitt does not support goes on  and on. It includes health-based standards for fine particles or soot  which will achieve between $3.7 billion and $9 billion in health  benefits net of cost.   All of the rules I have mentioned are just a representative sample,  nowhere near an exhaustive list.   When Mr. Pruitt declined to name a single environmental regulation he  supported, he showed us how little he supports the central mission of  the EPA, which is not to produce rules and regulations but to take  action that creates health, environmental, and economic benefits for  the American people.   Clearly, along with much of the rest of his record, Mr. Pruitt is  declining to tell us he does support the health and environment  protection EPA has established. It shows why he is not a suitable  candidate to lead this Agency. He has shown throughout his career that  he has a blatantly anti-environmental agenda, and this agenda threatens  public health. He is not fit to lead this Agency--an Agency that he has  sued every single chance he has gotten to block protections for clean  air and water. I wonder why he does that. I wonder why.   Well, this might be a reason why. According to the National Institute  on Money and State Politics--we accessed this in December of last year,  just a few months ago--it appears that Mr. Pruitt has received over  $314,000 from fossil fuel industries since 2002. According to them,  Scott Pruitt has received a total of $314,996. He received $8,201 in  2002, $76,970 in 2006, $112,150 in 2010, and $117,775 in 2014.    It keeps growing and growing. I guess he is being rewarded by the  fossil fuel industry for suing the EPA over and over. I can't imagine  why they would continue to give him more money, other than the fact  that he keeps suing the EPA.   He has used letters written by Devon Energy lawyers to send to the  EPA. According to the New York Times, he sent a letter to the EPA from  his own office that was written by lawyers of Devon Energy, one of  Oklahoma's big oil and gas companies, and was brought to him by their  chief lobbyist. Their chief lobbyist, Mr. William Whitsitt, at the time  directed government relations for the company, and had presented a note  to Mr. Pruitt's office. Mr. Pruitt had taken Devon's draft, copied it  onto State government stationery with only a few word changes and sent  it to Washington with the attorney general's signature.   I don't think that is acceptable, and I certainly don't think that it  is a suitable way for someone who is going to head the EPA to conduct  himself.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a January 17 letter from the African American environmental justice  community leaders.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   January 17, 2017.      Hon. John Barrasso,      Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S.           Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Thomas R. Carper,      Ranking Member, Committee on Environment and Public Works,           U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Barrasso and Carper:        Please name one achievement by Scott Pruitt, as Oklahoma       State Attorney General, that has improved the environment or       protected civil rights. Don't bother to Google it because the       answer is NONE.        As the African American leaders of environmental justice       organizations, we urge the Senators serving on the       Environment and Public Works Committee to oppose the       confirmation of Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the U.S.       Environmental Protection Agency. We are outraged that Mr.       Pruitt promises to set back and dismantle the policies and       programs we have worked for more than 30 years to develop       with community organizations across the nation. These       policies were developed pursuant to both federal civil rights       laws and environmental laws in order to remove racial       disparities in environmental protection.        As you know, the Senate's Environment and Public Works       Committee has scheduled a hearing on January 18, 2017 to       examine the nomination of Mr. Pruitt to the office of the EPA       Administrator by President-Elect Donald Trump. There is       nothing in Mr. Pruitt's record as the current Oklahoma State       Attorney General to demonstrate that he would be dedicated to       the mission of the EPA, which is to protect human health and       the environment. Nor does his career indicate any action to       improve environmental conditions in people of color       communities, who are disproportionately burdened with       pollution.        Mr. Pruitt seeks to rise to the position of EPA       Administrator as a reward for his efforts to block the EPA       from mitigating the harmful effects of pollution ``outside       the fence-line'' of toxic industries.        Let's be clear: the people who live beyond the fence of       polluting industrial facilities and suffer the acute,       chronic, cumulative and synergistic effects of exposure to       pollution are predominantly African American and other people       of color.        Mr. Pruitt appears to relish the opportunity to remove       standards that are protective of our basic rights to a       healthy and safe  [[Page S1326]]       environment. Case in point: Mr. Pruitt's dogged effort to axe       the Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan would have       devastating effects on predominantly African American       communities. The Clean Power Plan requires the reduction of       carbon pollution from power plants. It is the first federal       air quality standard to establish requirements for states to       achieve environmental justice. These requirements are based       on the egregious fact that 78% of power plants are       disproportionately located in close proximity to people of       color and poor communities. The Clean Power Plan recognizes       the vulnerability of people of color and poor communities to       the disastrous effects of climate change, which is brought on       by the burning of fossil fuels. In the U.S., the largest       source of pollution driving climate change is power plants.       Additionally, this air quality standard direct states to       ensure meaningful and effective participation of vulnerable       communities in developing state plans for reducing power       plant pollution.        We recognize that the biggest climate and environmental       threats to our nation and planet are fueled, in part, by       racial disparities in environmental protection. Industrial       sites and major transportation routes are disproportionately       located in and around predominantly African American       neighborhoods, where residents are daily exposed to the       smokestack and vehicle emissions that warm the planet as well       as trigger asthma attacks and cause other severe health       problems. We cannot effectively confront the threats of       climate change by confirming Mr. Pruitt, a climate denier, to       the post of EPA Administrator. We also cannot pursue remedies       for racial disparities in environmental protection with Mr.       Pruitt at the helm of the EPA, as he has shown himself to be       hostile to preventing pollution that occurs       disproportionately in communities of color.        We need an EPA Administrator who will work to remedy the       persistent and pervasive problem of environmental racism that       results in:        79% of African Americans living in polluted neighborhoods;        African American children being three to five times more       likely than white children to be hospitalized or die from       asthma;        African Americans in 19 states being more than twice as       likely as whites to live in neighborhoods with high pollution       levels, compared to Hispanics in 12 states and Asians in 7       states;        more than 68% of African Americans living within 30 miles       of a coal-fired power plant--the distance within which the       maximum negative health effects of the smokestack plume are       expected to occur--compared with 56% of whites and 39% of       Latinos who live in the same proximity to a coal-fired power       plant;        African Americans being more vulnerable than whites to       climate change, and less likely than whites to recover from       disastrous weather events;        the percentage of African Americans living near the fence       line of a chemical plant is 75% greater than for the US as a       whole, and the percentage of Latinos is 60% greater; and        predominantly African American neighborhoods with       households incomes between $50,000 and $60,000 being more       polluted than predominantly white neighborhoods with       households incomes below $10,000.        There is nothing in Mr. Pruitt's record as Oklahoma State       Attorney General to indicate that he would be sensitive to       and willing to help communities throughout the United States,       where African Americans and other people of color       disproportionately suffer and die from unhealthy       environmental conditions, which also contribute to climate       change. For all of the reasons stated above, we urge you to       take a stand in opposing the confirmation of Mr. Pruitt as       EPA Administrator.

Mr. President, as is stated in this letter, it says:         As the African American leaders of environmental justice       organizations, we urge the Senators serving on the       Environment and Public Works Committee to oppose the       confirmation of Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the U.S.       Environmental Protection Agency. We are outraged that Mr.       Pruitt promises to set back and dismantle the policies and       programs we have worked for more than 30 years to develop       with community organizations across the nation.        There is nothing in Mr. Pruitt's record as current Oklahoma       State Attorney General to demonstrate that he would be       dedicated to the mission of the EPA, which is to protect       human health and the environment. Nor does his career       indicate any action to improve environmental conditions in       people color communities, who disproportionately burdened       with pollution.        Mr. Pruitt appears to relish the opportunity to remove       standards that are protective of our basic rights to a       healthy and safe environment. Case in point: Mr. Pruitt's       dogged effort to axe the Obama Administration's Clean Power       Plan would have devastating effects on predominantly African       American communities.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a January 17 letter from the leaders of over 20 regional and nationwide  Latino civic organizations to Members of the Senate.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             [January 17, 2017]             Latinos Oppose Scott Pruitt for EPA Administrator         Dear Senator: As Latino leaders, members and       representatives of the undersigned organizations committed to       efforts that support our communities' health, advancement,       safety and well-being, and on behalf of the concerned       communities we represent, we strongly urge you to oppose the       president-elect's nominee to lead the U.S. Environmental       Protection Agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt.        Mr. Pruitt has made a career of suing the Environmental       Protection Agency, and has used his office to attack       lifesaving public health protections time and time again. His       record exhibits a reckless disregard for public health and a       deeply troubling contempt for the very mission of the agency       he has been nominated to lead. Mr. Pruitt denies the science       of climate change, suing to block national standards to fight       this crisis; he has fought against clean air protections,       opposing the Mercury and Air Toxics standard which would       prevent premature deaths and asthma attacks; he has sued the       EPA to overturn clean water safeguards for more than half of       the nation's waterways, including streams that feed into the       drinking water supplies of hundreds of millions of Americans.       Scott Pruitt is simply unfit to lead the EPA and, if       confirmed, would pose a danger to our communities.        Latinos overwhelmingly support actions to fight climate       change. We recognize the importance of protecting the       environment: 97 percent of Latinos agree we have a moral       obligation to take care of our environment. In December, the       National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a coalition of 40 of the       leading Latino organizations nationwide, voiced their       opposition to Mr. Pruitt's nomination, stating that they were       ``particularly troubled by this choice,'' and pointing to the       prevalence of asthma and other respiratory diseases among       Latinos living near polluting power plants, truck routes, and       factories; as well as the large number Latinos who are       employed in outdoor occupations, including agriculture, where       they are exposed to health hazards, bad air quality, and the       impacts of extreme weather.        Americans did not vote for more air pollution, toxics, or       dirty water, nor did they vote to undo critical protections       that safeguard our children and communities. We did not vote       for more climate change or dirty energy. Putting the EPA in       Mr. Pruitt's hands does just that: he will threaten our       children's health, turn back the clock on landmark efforts to       clean up our air, water and climate, and imperil the United       States' position as a global clean energy leader.        We call on you to publicly declare your commitment to stand       up for our right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and       be protected from pollution. We urge you to vote against all       legislative proposals that would in any way repeal, weaken or       undermine these rights, laws and safeguards. Our community is       counting on you to protect us by voting to reject Scott       Pruitt's nomination for Administrator of the U.S. EPA.     Stated in this letter, it says:         As Latino leaders, members and representatives of the       undersigned organizations committed to efforts that support       our communities' health, advancement, safety, and  [[Page S1327]]       well-being, and on behalf of the concerned communities we       represent, we strongly urge you to oppose the president-      elect's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.       Latinos overwhelmingly support actions to fight climate       change. We recognize the importance of protecting the       environment: 97 percent of Latinos agree we have a moral       obligation to take care of our environment. In December, the       National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a coalition of 40 of the       leading Latino organizations nationwide, voiced their       opposition to Mr. Pruitt's nomination.        Putting the EPA in Mr. Pruitt's hands will threaten our       children's health, turn back the clock on landmark efforts to       clean up our air, water and climate, and imperil the United       States' position as a global lead energy leader.    I am also deeply concerned that we are holding this vote so quickly,  when not all of the evidence of Mr. Pruitt's activities has been  brought to light.   The fact of the matter is that we are still waiting for almost 2,000  emails to be released from his time as the Oklahoma State attorney  general. Only on Thursday afternoon was there a ruling that said those  emails must be released. Yet we are going to hold a vote, and my  colleagues will be forced to make a decision on behalf of the  constituents of their great States based on incomplete information.   I don't understand the need to rush this. I don't understand why we  would hold this vote so soon, so quickly, when there are other nominees  for other positions in the President's Cabinet whom we could vote on,  who do not have 2,000 hidden emails waiting to be released, waiting to  be reviewed.   I served on the Benghazi Committee in the House. I have to tell you  that one of the refrains I heard over and over from my Republican  colleagues, Republican voices, was that they just wanted to pursue  transparency, and they wanted to see all the emails, and yet the very  same people who were so dogged not too long ago now don't care to look  at any emails when it comes to Mr. Pruitt.   Why is that? Why are we so eager to have this vote? Do you just want  him to start dismantling the EPA that much sooner? Can't we wait a  week? I think we are doing a disservice to the gentlemen and women who  serve in this body. They deserve to have complete information before we  hold this vote. I think those emails that would be disclosed deserve to  be looked at. They deserve the light of day--transparency--so that we  can continue to evaluate and truly have more complete information on  Mr. Pruitt and his time as the Oklahoma State attorney general before  we pass this vote.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a February 6 letter from nearly 500 former employees of the EPA to  Leader McConnell.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   February 6, 2017.      Subject: Concerns about Scott Pruitt's qualifications to           serve as EPA Administrator.       Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator McConnell and the U.S. Senate: We write as       former employees of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)       to share our concerns about Oklahoma Attorney General Scott       Pruitt's qualifications to serve as the next EPA       Administrator in light of his record in Oklahoma. Our       perspective is not partisan. Having served under both       Republican and Democratic presidents, we recognize each new       Administration's right to pursue different policies within       the parameters of existing law and to ask Congress to change       the laws that protect public health and the environment as it       sees fit.        However, every EPA Administrator has a fundamental       obligation to act in the public's interest based on current       law and the best available science. Mr. Pruitt's record       raises serious questions about whose interests he has served       to date and whether he agrees with the longstanding tenets of       U.S. environmental law.        Our nation has made tremendous progress in ensuring that       every American has clean air to breathe, clean water to drink       and uncontaminated land on which to live, work and play.       Anyone who visits Beijing is reminded of what some cities in       the U.S. once looked like before we went to work as a people       to combat pollution. Much of EPA's work involves preserving       those gains, which should not be taken for granted. There are       also emerging new threats as well as serious gaps in our       environmental safety net, as the drinking water crisis in       Flint, Michigan, painfully demonstrates.        Our environmental laws are based on a partnership that       requires EPA to set national standards and gives states       latitude when implementing them so long as certain minimum       criteria are satisfied. This approach recognizes that       Americans have an equal right to clean air and water, no       matter where they live, and allows states to compete for       business without having to sacrifice public health or       environmental quality.        Our environmental laws include provisions directing EPA to       allow for a ``margin of safety'' when assessing risks, which       is intended to limit exposure to pollutants when it is       reasonable to expect they may harm the public health, even       when all the scientific evidence is not yet in. For example,       EPA's first Administrator, Bill Ruckelshaus, chose to limit       the amount of lead in gasoline before all doubt about its       harmfulness to public health was erased. His action spared       much of the harm that some countries still face as result of       the devastating effects of lead on human health. Similarly,       early action to reduce exposure to fine particle pollution       helped avoid thousands of premature deaths from heart and       lung disease. The magnitude and severity of those risks did       not become apparent until much later.        Mr. Pruitt's record and public statements strongly suggest       that he does not share the vision or agree with the       underlying principles of our environmental laws. Mr. Pruitt       has shown no interest in enforcing environmental laws, a       critically important function for EPA. While serving as       Oklahoma's top law enforcement officer, Mr. Pruitt issued       more than 50 press releases celebrating lawsuits to overturn       EPA standards to limit mercury emissions from power plants,       reduce smog levels in cities and regional haze in parks,       clean up the Chesapeake Bay and control greenhouse gas       emissions. In contrast, none of Mr. Pruitt's many press       releases refer to any action he has taken to enforce       environmental laws or to actually reduce pollution. This       track record likely reflects his disturbing decision to close       the environmental enforcement unit in his office while       establishing a new litigation team to challenge EPA and other       federal agencies.        He has claimed credit for an agreement to protect the       Illinois River that did little more than confirm phosphorus       limits established much earlier, while delaying their       enforcement another three years.        In a similar vein, Mr. Pruitt has gone to disturbing       lengths to advance the views and interests of business. For       example, he signed and sent a letter as Oklahoma Attorney       General criticizing EPA estimates of emissions from oil and       gas wells, without disclosing that it had been drafted in its       entirety by Devon Energy. He filed suit on behalf of Oklahoma       to block a California law requiring humane treatment of       poultry. The federal court dismissed the case after finding       that the lawsuit was brought not to benefit the citizens of       Oklahoma but a handful of large egg producers perfectly       capable of representing their own interests. To mount his       challenge to EPA's rule to reduce carbon pollution from power       plants, he took the unusual step of accepting free help from       a private law firm. By contrast, there is little or no       evidence of Mr. Pruitt taking initiative to protect and       advance public health and environmental protection in his       state. Mr. Pruitt's office has apparently acknowledged 3,000       emails and other documents reflecting communications with       certain oil and gas companies, but has yet to make any of       these available in response to a Freedom of Information Act       request filed more than two years ago.        Contrary to the cooperative federalism that he promotes,       Mr. Pruitt has suggested that EPA should refrain from trying       to control pollution that crosses state lines. For example,       he intervened to support a Farm Bureau lawsuit that would       have overturned a cooperative agreement between five states       and EPA to clean up the Chesapeake Bay (the court rejected       the challenge). When asked how a state can protect its       citizens from pollution that originates outside its borders,       Mr. Pruitt said in his Senate testimony that states should       resolve these disputes on their own, with EPA providing       ``informational'' support once an agreement is reached. But       the 1972 Clean Water Act directs EPA to review state water       quality plans, require any improvements needed to make waters       ``fishable and swimmable,'' and to review and approve plans       to limit pollutant loads to protect water quality. EPA's       power to set standards and limit pollution that crosses state       lines is exactly what ensures every American clean air and       water, and gives states the incentive to negotiate and       resolve transboundary disputes.        We are most concerned about Mr. Pruitt's reluctance to       accept and act on the strong scientific consensus on climate       change. Our country's own National Research Council, the       principal operating arm of the National Academies of Science       and Engineering, concluded in a 2010 report requested by       Congress that human activity is altering the climate to an       extent that poses grave risks to Americans' health and       welfare. More recent scientific data and analyses have only       confirmed the Council's conclusion and added to the urgency       of addressing the problem.        Despite this and other authoritative warnings about the       dangers of climate change, Mr. Pruitt persists in pointing to       uncertainty about the precise extent of humanity's       contribution to the problem as a basis for resisting taking       any regulatory action to help solve it. At his Senate       confirmation hearing, he stated that that ``science tells us       that the climate is changing, and that human activity in some       manner impacts  [[Page S1328]]       that change. The ability to measure with precision the degree       and extent of that impact, and what to do about it, are       subject to continuing debate and dialogue, and well it should       be.'' This is a familiar dodge--emphasizing uncertainty about       the precise amount of humanity's contribution while ignoring       the broad scientific consensus that human activities are       largely responsible for dangerous warming of our planet and       that action is urgently needed before it is too late.        Mr. Pruitt's indulgence in this dodge raises the       fundamental question of whether he agrees with the       precautionary principle reflected in our nation's       environmental statutes. Faithful execution of our       environmental laws requires effectively combating climate       change to minimize its potentially catastrophic impacts       before it is too late.        The American people have been served by EPA Administrators,       Republicans and Democrats, who have embraced their       responsibility to protect public health and the environment.       Different administrators have come to different conclusions       about how best to apply the law in view of the science, and       many of their decisions have been challenged in court,       sometimes successfully, for either going too far or not far       enough. But in the large majority of cases it was evident to       us that they put the public's welfare ahead of private       interests. Scott Pruitt has not demonstrated this same       commitment.        Thank you for considering our views.     The unemotional appeal lays out the facts directly and  clearly and, as such, reads as a scathing condemnation of the Oklahoma  attorney general. Stated in this letter it says:         Our perspective is not partisan. . . . Having served under       both Republican and Democratic presidents, we recognize each       new Administration's right to pursue different policies       within the parameters of existing law and to ask Congress to       change the laws that protect public health and the       environment as it sees fit.        In the large majority of cases it was evident to us that       they put the public's welfare ahead of private interests. . .       . Scott Pruitt has not demonstrated this same commitment.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
