 Mr. Speaker, as I speak, the Trump  Republicans wrestle another child from the arms of a refugee parent at  our southern border, but I still rise today to honor World Refugee Day.   Every year, thousands of refugees journey to the United States of  America in search of safety, be it from human rights violations,  warfare, natural disasters, or the war on drugs.   We pride ourselves on being a nation of immigrants. I am proud that  Clarkston, Georgia, known as the Ellis Island of the South, is in my  district. But Trump Republicans have lain waste to our custom of  welcoming asylum seekers as they commit the inhumane practice of  separating children from their parents at the border.   America is weakened in the eyes of the world, and separating families  is our national shame. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the Keep  Families Together Act. Congress must act now on this important  legislation.                            ____________________
