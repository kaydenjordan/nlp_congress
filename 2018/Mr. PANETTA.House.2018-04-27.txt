 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National Day  of Silence, a day of silence to bring attention to the discrimination  and harassment faced by our LGBT youth across our country.   Eight out of ten LGBT students are harassed because of their sexual  orientation or gender identity by the time they graduate from high  school, students like Annie Hsu, at Santa Cruz High School in my  district on the central coast of California, who has said that ``we  must be unafraid to stand up against marginalization.''   This month, those of us on the LGBT Equality Caucus took that stand  by introducing the Student Non-Discrimination Act. This bill would  prohibit discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived  gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity, and it would protect  students from the intimidation and violence they may receive.   By standing up and speaking out, Annie and other LGBT students give  us motivation to push forward and pass laws that will protect every  student in every school across every community so that they are not  afraid to be themselves.                            ____________________
