 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  continued leadership and for the opportunity to rise today to join him  and this group in this urgent discussion regarding solutions for our  Nation's healthcare crisis.   I do appreciate the opportunity to be with my colleagues tonight and  the sense of urgency that I feel from this group to address a very  important issue.   Mr. Speaker, since the 2,700-page healthcare law was enacted in 2010,  when our colleague from across the aisle absurdly rose and declared  that we would know what was in it as soon as we passed it, young  adults, families, and seniors have been punished and their policies  canceled.   We have seen skyrocketing costs, poor coverage and, clearly, a lack  of choices. I hear from constituents every single day who say that the  law has not made health care more affordable, as President Obama  promised it would.   Instead, healthcare insurance premiums have skyrocketed and are  slated to increase again and again and again--significantly--regardless  of what Congress is able to do about the law this year. In fact, those  who currently have a plan can expect an average premium increase of 73  percent, while individuals who are just joining will see a 96 percent  increase in premiums. Job providers are getting smothered as well.   Prior to joining Congress, I was a member of the private sector, and  I can tell you firsthand that small businesses are cutting hours. They  are letting go of workers. All of these things they are doing to make  room for the ever-expanding healthcare law. It is preventing the  economy--small business, which is the backbone of our economy--from  growing to its fullest potential.   For all of these reasons, 8 out of every 10 Americans now favor  changing ObamaCare significantly or replacing it altogether. What we do  know is that doing nothing is not an option. Leaving this alone will  result in further costs, further struggles by our families and small  businesses, and we will see this whole healthcare law collapse upon  itself. I do not believe and I don't think my colleagues believe here  today that doing nothing is an option.   Last year in Michigan, deductibles went up an average of $492 across  all bronze, silver, and gold plans. This year our exchange rates will  jump 17 percent in the State of Michigan. Families have a budget just  like everybody else and they simply cannot absorb that kind of cost  increase.   Complicating matters further, insurers like UnitedHealth Group are  leaving the exchanges. Private practices are folding and doctors are  being forced to retire because they can't financially stay afloat.                                time  1915    I can tell you, from a personal perspective in my own family, I have  seen my doctor disappear recently this past year. Seemingly overnight,  he retired  [[Page H376]]  and moved away because he could not keep up with the costs of staying  in business as a private practitioner.   I had a rheumatologist in my district. He is a very well-respected  man who treats many rheumatoid patients in our district. It is a very  sad fact. These people count on him every single day of the week. They  have been forced out of his practice because they no longer fit into  the network. He is forced with compliance costs--overwhelming  compliance costs. He has to hire new people to cover the compliance  requirements. He doesn't have the same reimbursement rates.   After all is said and done, a private practitioner, a specialist like  this, can no longer stay in business; and families like ours, people  like you and like me, can no longer continue to have that relationship,  that doctor-patient relationship, that very personal relationship that  we have had for years. These are real people, doctors, but also  families and small businesses in our local communities that are  struggling to stay financially afloat. The end result is we are losing  good doctors because of the failures of ObamaCare.   Mr. Speaker, when a law has unintended consequences, Congress has an  obligation to step up and make things right. In 2017, this will require  a collaborative, bipartisan approach to address the issue. This is  about finding a pain-free way to move forward with health care in our  Nation to ensure our neighbors and our families don't have to struggle  to make ends meet because of failed law.   We must act, Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Chairman Walker for his  continued support and his continued leadership on this important issue.
