 Madam President, along with my colleagues Senator  Jim Risch, Representative Mike Simpson and Representative Russ Fulcher,  we honor Idaho's community colleges in recognition of Community College  Month and commend them for contributing to the success of Idahoans.   The designation of April as Community College Month by the American  Association of Community Colleges and the Association of Community  College Trustees provides an opportunity to acknowledge the important  role Idaho's community colleges have in enhancing Idahoans' quality of  life and contributing to Idaho's economic growth.   Idaho's community colleges prepare young people and adults throughout  our great State for postsecondary education, successful careers, and  productive lives. We are fortunate to have community colleges working  hard to fuel the ingenuity and skill to advance students to Idaho's 4- year institutions and provide dual enrollment opportunities for  students pursuing advanced learning while in high school. According to  statistics from the Idaho State Board of Education, nearly 142,000 dual  credits were earned at our 2-year institutions in fiscal year 2022,  meaning community colleges are giving Idaho high school students  considerable opportunities to kickstart their higher educations.   They also help keep pace with an ever-changing job market as they  help grow the skills needed to prepare students to meet the  requirements of progressing in Idaho's workforce. The Idaho State Board  of Education found a notable 75 percent of graduates from 2-year  institutions are employed in Idaho 1 year after graduation, and Idaho  residents with an associate's degree earn $41,197 more than those  without a degree.   Our State is brimming with innovators and cutting-edge businesses.  Community colleges are central partners in our communities fostering  ideas and helping to meet the needs of area students and small  businesses. Thank you to Idaho's community colleges for the important  role they play in fueling Idaho achievement and growth.                            ____________________
