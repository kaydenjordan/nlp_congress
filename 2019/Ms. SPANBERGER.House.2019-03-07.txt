 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R.  1.   This week, we are focused on fighting for the public interest,  fighting for transparency, and fighting for accountability. We have a  rare opportunity to restore faith and trust in our system of  government.   Mr. Chair, I thank all those who have fought to bring us to this  point and for our upcoming major historic vote on H.R. 1.   As we speak, I am working under a mandate from the people of central  Virginia. They expect me to fight back against a broken Washington and  to work to protect our democracy, whether from special interests,  barriers to voting, or foreign influence.   Right now, we are seeing an uptick in hostile attacks against  election systems across the globe, with the rise of the internet,  anonymous hackers, non-state actors, and foreign intelligence  operatives, as they rise as formidable and dangerous adversaries.   Our elections are the bedrock of our democracy.  [[Page H2568]]    If our voting infrastructure is compromised or attacked, the entire  integrity of our electoral system could come into question.   This was especially clear following Russia's interference in the 2016  election, and it is almost certain that nefarious actors will continue  their deliberate attempts to attack our elections or put in doubt the  outcome of those elections.   During this time, it is critical that the U.S. election officials  have accurate and up-to-date information about where our election  security systems are most vulnerable.   This amendment pushes back against foreign attempts to interfere in  our electoral process and helps identify any potential threats that may  exist.   This amendment would use the invaluable expertise of public servants  in the intelligence community and Department of Homeland Security to  strengthen the security of Federal and State election systems.   My amendment would require a Federal assessment of the scope of  potential threats to the security of America's election system,  including cyber, terror, and state actor threats.   This assessment would happen 180 days prior to every general election  to allow the States the opportunity to respond and strengthen their  voting system.   Additionally, this legislation would direct the Director of National  Intelligence and DHS to update Federal and State officials on possible  vulnerabilities and to provide assessments on how best to stop these  threats.   As a former CIA case officer, I greatly appreciate the objective and  nonpartisan work of the national security and intelligence communities.  With their help, we can fight back against foreign interference, we can  safeguard our elections.   The dedicated men and women of our national security agencies and of  our intelligence agencies have demonstrated their ability to collect  information on foreign actors' intentions and provide election security  assessments that are intellectually rigorous, objective, timely, and  useful to the States they would provide them to.   As we are having an important discussion about safeguarding the  integrity of the vote, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment  to H.R. 1.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis) for his comments and for his support of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren),  my colleague.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1930     Mr. Chair, I am ready to close, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    May I reclaim my time, Mr. Chair?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Mr. Chair, I am ready to close, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
