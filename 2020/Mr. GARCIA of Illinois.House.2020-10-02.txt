 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  Congresswoman Jayapal's resolution to condemn unwanted and unnecessary  medical procedures without the full, informed consent of individuals.   From the 1930s to the 1970s, Puerto Rican women were sterilized in  order to control population growth. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s,  anti-immigrant sentiment resulted in the highest number of recorded  state-sanctioned sterilizations of Mexican women in California.   Now, in 2020, we learn of allegations that immigrant women in ICE  custody are being subjected to forced hysterectomies.   The stories we have heard from Georgia's Irwin County Detention  Center are horrendous but, sadly, not new. They are a reminder of our  country's dark history of forcing women of color to be sterilized.   Robbing Black and Brown women of full autonomy over their bodies and  reproductive freedoms is white supremacy in action. In any other  country, we would denounce these horrific incidents as violations of  human rights.   I stand with my colleagues in strong support of the resolution to  condemn these atrocities and hold those involved accountable.   I am disgusted but not surprised. This administration has dehumanized  immigrants time and time again. Those seeking asylum have been stripped  of their dignity, and some are now scarred for life. This is a  violation of human rights, a violation of human dignity, and an  atrocious violation of privacy and safety.   What happened in Georgia is criminal and must be condemned so that it  may never happen again. I strongly urge adoption of this resolution.
