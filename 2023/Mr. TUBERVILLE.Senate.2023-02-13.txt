 Madam President, before I get into the topic of my  speech today, I just put a tweet out about what I think about the  surveillance balloons, which are very, very concerning, being on the  Armed Services Committee.   You know, the Chinese surveillance over our skies is very concerning  but also the fentanyl from China pouring across our borders every day  that is killing 300 Americans a day, that is also very concerning and  also the 800-percent increase in Chinese nationals crossing our border  every day.   So I think we have got a lot of problems other than just balloons  flying around our sky. We need to recognize that. We need to start  understanding we have an adversary in China that is our biggest, and  the President of the United States--he obviously needs to protect our  air, but he needs to protect our borders. We are having people die  every day.   What is the most important? The most important thing is protecting  the sovereignty of our country, and that is our borders and the sky and  protecting our people on the ground, especially from this deadly drug.   So I just wanted to say that before I get into my speech because I  know it is important. China is our No. 1 adversary, and we need to  start watching every part of it and still watch these balloons fly  around the sky that we have no clue of what they are doing or why they  are here.
