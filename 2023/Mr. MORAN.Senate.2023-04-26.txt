 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to address the Senate for up to 5 minutes.    Madam President, the legislation that is before us, the  Veterans Programs Improvement Act, just came out of the Senate Veterans  Affairs' Committee. It is S. 326, as amended.   We are here on a motion for cloture, and this bill will be, as  amended, a  [[Page S1360]]  combination of bills that are both Republican and Democratic bills,  including one from the Senator who is presiding today. It includes a  bill from Senator Rounds of South Dakota dealing with the loan process  for Native American veterans. It includes a couple of pieces of  legislation: the RESPECT Act, to help veterans with mental health or  neurological conditions to get caregiver care; the Elizabeth Dole Act,  to expand home- and community-based, long-term care programs so that  veterans have more choices as they age; and the bill of the Presiding  Officer that provides grants to county veterans service officers for  outreach to veterans. In addition, it includes what has been perhaps  the most discussed aspect of this piece of legislation: a bill that  creates the authorization to allow for medical research for marijuana  to be conducted--for cannabis to be conducted by the Department of  Veterans Affairs. But it requires retrospective research to take a look  at the research that has already been conducted and to go and conduct  research with veterans who are currently using cannabis. The outcome of  that study is unknown, but this is an effort to make certain that  veterans are not doing something that is harmful to them and to make an  informed decision several years from now about the relationship between  veterans and cannabis.   The point I would like to make in my few comments today is that I  have encouraged my colleagues to offer amendments. There are a lot of  items that my particularly Republican colleagues--I understand there  are Democratic colleagues who have amendments. While we have had some  success this year in amendments coming to the Senate floor, I want to  make certain that is the opportunity Republican colleagues and  Democratic colleagues have as this bill--if it proceeds, that we have  that opportunity.   I had those conversations with both the majority and the minority,  and I look forward to enforcing as best I can the capability to make  certain my colleagues have that opportunity. If that is not the case, I  reserve the right to then oppose this legislation.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
