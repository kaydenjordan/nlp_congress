 Madam President, today, it is my pleasure to name  Valley Queen Cheese Factory of Milbank, SD as the Senate Small Business  of the Week. Valley Queen Cheese is a prime example of the important  role small businesses play in their local economies and communities.   In 1929, Alfred Nef and Alfred Gonzenbach decided Milbank, SD was the  perfect home for their business and founded Valley Queen Cheese. Four  generations later, Valley Queen remains a family-run operation and is  still owned by the Nef and Gonzenbach families. Today, it operates less  than half a mile from the original location. It is a recognized leader  in the South Dakota business community and the greater dairy industry.  Since 2017, Doug Wilke has served as CEO of Valley Queen. With guidance  from the board of directors, he currently oversees the largest cheese  plant in South Dakota and the largest employer in Milbank.   More than 90 percent of all milk Valley Queen uses comes from South  Dakota cows, and they make a conscious effort to continue South  Dakota's leadership in this important industry. Thanks to a recent  expansion, Valley Queen now has the capacity to produce 200 million  pounds of cheese from 2 billion pounds of milk each year. Their cheese  can be found in most local grocery stores, as it is sold to some of the  best-known food brands in the world. To meet the growing demand, Valley  Queen recently invested in a business expansion project that increased  the factory's output by twenty-five percent.   Valley Queen is an active leader in the Milbank community, where it  has grown to employ 300 people. In 2017, the Valley Queen Charitable  Foundation was established to advance positive change by supporting  local organizations and initiatives. In its first 3 years as a  nonprofit, the foundation has contributed more than $900,000 to local  charities that have a community, educational, or humanitarian focus.  Since 1990, Valley Queen has awarded high school and college students  over $300,000 in scholarships. In addition to the business's own  philanthropy, Valley Queen makes an annual contribution to the Milbank  Community Foundation, which seeks to improve the quality of life of  residents in the community.   Valley Queen has been recognized for their continuous improvement and  exceptional process control through several awards. Earlier this year,  Valley Queen won two awards and received near-perfect marks at the U.S.  Championship Cheese Contest for their reduced fat cheddar and Monterey  Jack jalapeno cheeses. Valley Queen's sustained efforts toward improved  research and development does not go unnoticed by the industry.   Valley Queen is an excellent example of how small businesses fit the  shared values and ideals of their community and give back in a  multitude of ways. I am proud to highlight Valley Queen and its team  for their integral social and economic contributions to South Dakota.  Although many years removed from being a startup company, Valley Queen  remains committed to the legacy of its founders. Furthermore, Milbank,  South Dakota continues to serve as the perfect home for this thriving  business. Congratulations again to the entire team at Valley Queen  Cheese Factory for being named Senate Small Business of the  Week.                            ____________________
