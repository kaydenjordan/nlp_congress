 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 9, the Climate  Action Now Act, which would prevent the President from rightfully  withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement and codify  President Obama's misguided and, frankly, over-the-top emissions  reduction commitments.    There are two principles, I believe, that should guide our  international agreements.   First, they should be fair and beneficial to the American people.   Second, they should not put the United States at a disadvantage vis- a-vis other nations of the world.   The Paris Agreement fails on both counts.   As already noted, if we implement the commitments made by the Obama  administration as part of this agreement, it could cost the U.S. gross  domestic product $250 billion and eliminate 2.7 million jobs. That is  hardly fair and beneficial to the American people.   As it is, the Paris Agreement allows countries to determine their own  commitments, without regard to their emissions. Should this remain the  case, the United States will forever be at a disadvantage to self- interested countries, like China and Russia, whose emissions continue  to grow. Meanwhile, our emissions were the lowest in 2017 since 1992.  Despite this, our commitments far outweigh those made by the worst  greenhouse gas offenders.   I submitted an amendment that would have, at the very least,  addressed the disadvantage of this agreement. My amendment would have  changed the enacted date of H.R. 9 to whenever the Secretary of State  could certify that Russia and China were making commitments equivalent  to ours.   I regret that it was not made in order and that my colleagues across  the aisle denied us the opportunity to do right by the American people.  H.R. 9 is an outrage, Mr. Chairman, and I urge my colleagues to vote  against it.                                time  1500
