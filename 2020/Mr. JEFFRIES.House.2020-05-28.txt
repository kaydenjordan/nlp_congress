 Madam Speaker, I respect those police officers in every  community who are there to protect and serve and those who have fallen  in the line of duty, but we cannot tolerate police violence, and we  cannot tolerate police brutality.   George Floyd was murdered by an out-of-control police officer. When  will it end?   Amadou Diallo, 42 shots, police officers found not guilty.   Sean Bell, 50 shots, police officers found not guilty.   Eric Garner, choked to death, police officers let go by the grand  jury.   Decade after decade after decade, when will it end?   This time must be different. Those perpetrators must be prosecuted to  the full extent of the law, and Congress must do everything in its  power to stop this type of tragedy from ever happening again.                            ____________________
