 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a historic  opportunity that will soon be before this body. It is an opportunity to  bring real relief to the American people. It is an opportunity to jolt  our economy into a higher gear and bring real, tangible benefits to  America's hard-working families.   It has been over 30 years since this country last reformed its Tax  Code. Over those 30 years, we have seen a lot of change. We have seen  the country move from Ataris to smartphones and Wi-Fi. This photo shows  a Ford LTD station wagon, which rolled off the assembly line 30 years  ago. It is a car that any of us would have been excited to drive 30  years ago. Today we have cars that drive themselves. Unfortunately, we  still have a tax code that is made for this LTD.   So while the world has changed around us and other countries have  learned to craft tax codes to entice businesses to grow, our code has  gotten more and more out of date and more and more laden with special- interest giveaways. Our Tax Code has turned Main Street into a dead end  and our overseas growth into a one-way street.   Reforming the code is not only a way to give us an opportunity to end  those giveaways, but it can also boost our economy. I applaud our  colleagues in the House, who last week introduced and are working on a  proposal to overhaul the tax system. In the coming days the Senate  Finance Committee will introduce their own legislation.   While I will mostly focus my comments today on one aspect of tax  reform, I will note that on Friday the Tax Foundation released its  analysis of the House tax proposal. This analysis concluded that the  House proposal would create 975,000 full-time-equivalent jobs and push  GDP 3.9 percent higher than it would otherwise be. Taking into account  the economic feedback from the proposed reforms, this means taxpayers  would end up with 4.4 percent higher income. In other words, they will  make greater, higher income as a result of the bill that the House is  working on today. Indeed, the Tax Foundation concluded that the total  after-tax gain in income for a middle-class family would be nearly  $2,600.   Importantly, for my constituents in my home State of Colorado, the  gain would be over $3,000. These are serious gains that will bring  real, meaningful benefits to hard-working Americans. This is just the  starting point for our reform. This number is over $3,000 of impact to  the people of Colorado of additional income and tax relief. When a  significant segment of Americans don't even have access within 24 hours  to just a few hundred dollars, a $3,000 a year gain is a significant  amount of money.   Today I would like to focus on one part of the tax reform package,  and that is the lowering of taxes on America's job creators. Because we  have this clunky Atari-era Tax Code--this Ford LTD station wagon Tax  Code, our tax rates are no longer competitive. They encourage companies  to invest abroad rather than right here at home in the United States.  Back in 1986, when this car rolled off the assembly line, our corporate  rate was competitive. It didn't discourage companies from investing in  the United States.   Things have significantly changed since 1986. Foreign countries have  figured it out. They lowered their tax rates, and now the United States  has the highest corporate tax rate in the  [[Page S7095]]  developed world--indeed, one of the highest tax rates in the world,  period. Consequently, businesses have moved abroad more and more. They  invested more abroad, and in the United States they have invested less  and less.   It is not in the Republicans' view alone. I would draw your attention  to this quote right here. President Obama noted this gradual  deterioration of the corporate tax code in his 2011 State of the Union  Address, saying:         [O]ver the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax       code to benefit particular companies and industries. Those       with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up       paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one       of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes       no sense, and it has to change.    Those are the words that President Barack Obama spoke to a joint  session of Congress in 2011 in his State of the Union Address.   The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that just moving the tax  rates on corporations from the uncompetitive 35 percent to the middle- of-the-pack 20 percent and adding permanent full expensing of capital  investments would increase GDP from 3 percent to 5 percent above what  is currently forecasted. That increase would not just happen in a  decade or two, it would be front-loaded, meaning that we would see a  fast response from this economy, with 2.4 percent to 3.2 percent higher  GDP in the first 3 to 5 years under this proposal. That boost will not  just be to the corporate bottom line. It will increase the average  American household income by $4,000.   Let me say that again. It will increase average household income in  America by $4,000.   Since these estimates were released, since those numbers, statistics,  and analysis have been done, opponents of pro-growth tax reform have  thrown everything they can at the proposals and estimates to see what  will stick to try to bring it down. They said these numbers are too  rosy. They said that we can't possibly get a $4,000 increase in average  household income because that would mean more money would end up in  bank accounts of American households than is raised in revenue by the  corporate income tax.   They said that corporations have been ``rolling in money'' for a long  time. So if they wanted to invest in America they already would have.  Some opponents say we should tax corporations more--take the profit  that is sitting overseas and spend it as the government wishes. When  opponents of tax relief see a company with money, their reaction is to  take it--to take it like it is the Government's money. But we know that  doesn't work. Even our European friends, whose residents tend to be far  more open to socialist experiments, have rejected this notion. They  know that tax reform is about creating the environment that will cause  companies to invest in America, not attempting to seize profits from  companies that can easily move elsewhere. That is why France, Germany,  Spain, Italy, and Greece--not exactly bastions of open economic  innovation--have lower corporate tax rates than we do.   The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, told  the Joint Economic Committee recently:         This is not about right wing parties throwing money at rich       corporations. It is about economically literate governments       understanding that if we want wages to be higher, than we       have to give workers capital to work with.    Let me say that again. This effort for tax relief is about  ``economically literate governments understanding that if we want wages  to be higher, then we have to give workers capital to work with.''   Let's go back to the first response we heard from opponents of tax  relief: It is ``absurd'' to think the average American household will  get $4,000 more in income because that is more than the country raises  in tax revenue.   In other words, if we took every dollar raised from corporate tax and  handed it over to American families, they wouldn't get $4,000. That is  the argument opponents of tax reform are saying, but this response  simply doesn't get it.   What is the economically literate perspective?   Recall that a lot has changed over the last 30 years, but one thing  hasn't changed, and that is the U.S. corporate tax rate. As you can see  on this chart, the average OECD tax rates have dropped over time. You  see the blue OECD line, and the orange line on the chart is straight  across. The average OECD tax rates have dropped over time, but the U.S.  rate stayed right where it is. The U.S. advantages that made it the  place to invest in 1986 have slowly faded away. Other countries have  used their tax rates to become more competitive, and companies have  responded.   Business investment now is unfortunately low. Indeed, Chairman  Hassett warned that there is a crisis in our country because of the  lack of what is called capital deepening, which is just an economist's  term for the impact of capital stock--things such as equipment,  structures, and intellectual property--on worker productivity.   Worker productivity is, in turn, what drives up wages. That is what  makes wages increase. The more productive a worker is, the more the  employer is willing to pay that worker to keep him or her in the job  with rising wages.   Going to another chart, we can see the effects of that. Prior to  1990, when corporate profits were going up by 1 percent, workers' wages  went up by more than 1 percent. Since that time in the 1990s, we have  seen change. From 2008 to 2016, a 1-percent increase in business  profits corresponded with only a 0.3 percent increase in workers'  wages. One of the biggest culprits in this is the corporate tax rate.  It is what causes that disconnect between corporate profits and  workers' wages.   When a company decides whether and where to invest in new buildings,  equipment, and research, they look at the tax rate to know what return  is needed to make that investment profitable. The higher the tax, the  higher the needed return. So companies facing higher taxes either don't  invest at all or they invest in another country. That is why experts  say that workers bear 45 percent to 75 percent of the burden of  corporate taxes, because businesses invest in them less and less, the  higher the tax. It is as if the corporate tax rate casts a shadow on  the entire economy.   We can see that shadow here. This is the way economists model the  market for capital--factories, equipment, buildings, IP. The higher the  price, the less the companies demand. The lower the price, the more the  companies demand. This is a simple concept.   Suppliers of those things are the reverse. If they have to sell at a  low price, they don't make very much, but if they can sell at a high  price, they make more. These two should meet in the middle, but they  don't meet in the middle today because the government has come in and  imposed a corporate tax. So each unit of capital costs more than it  should because of this tax system. That means businesses only want this  much. The producers only get this much. The government takes the rest.   What is left? We can see right here what the government is taking. We  can see the effect that taxes have on the economy. What is left is this  dark-shaded triangle. This is what economists call deadweight loss.  That is the stuff that doesn't happen because of the tax. This is the  tax shadow--the deadweight loss. It is deadweight in our economy. In  that shadow, business activity just doesn't happen, and workers just  don't get the capital they need to be more productive.   Remember, businesses are deciding whether and where to invest that  next dollar. If the cost is too high--reflected here--they won't  invest, at least not here in the United States. They will decide not to  expand at all, or they will expand in a country that has a lower tax  rate, or they will simply shut down entirely.   I don't think the American people would be surprised by this. This is  not news to them. They lived this for a long time. They know it well.  They know businesses are not expanding here. They have seen businesses  close. They have seen a slowdown in the startup of new businesses. They  know wages haven't gone up in many years.   They understand this shadow. Businesses don't expand. Workers are  laid off. Money moves abroad. It is because of this high tax that  doesn't leave us with decreases in costs, creating a deadweight loss on  our economy. They understand it, and they know that corporations pass  that tax on to them in the form of lower wages.  [[Page S7096]]    But here is the good news. Help is on the way. Lowering the corporate  tax rate lowers the rate of return needed to make investments work. It  removes the shadow that blocks the economic sunlight. Suddenly  businesses are operating here in the green.   More investment in factories, buildings, equipment, and IP means more  Americans are more productive, and that makes total sense. You get more  done when you have a new computer than when you have an old clunky one.  You produce more when you have a new machine on the line. Workers  become more productive, and the companies pay them more both because  they are bringing in more and because they want to keep those workers  to do more. That is what happens when you lift that economic shadow  that we talked about that corporate taxes impose and cast on our  economy. You create more jobs, and wage competition grows income.   This isn't just economic theory. As you can see here on this chart,  wage increases are significantly higher in countries with lower  corporate tax rates. We don't need just simple economic theory; we need  economic results, and that is what this chart shows us. High-tax  countries like the United States have weak wage growth. The United  States is down here on this chart representing the highest statutory  corporate rate countries. High-tax countries like the United States  have weak wage growth--less than 1 percent, even close to zero percent.  You can see that here. Low-tax countries--these are the lowest  statutory corporate rate countries. These are the bottom 10 lowest  rates. Low-tax-rate countries see a wage growth of 1 percent, 1.5  percent, 3.5 percent, even 4 percent, and that is because they don't  live under that economic dead weight, that tax shadow, that deadweight  loss zone of high corporate taxes.   It also matches my experience in talking with companies in Colorado.  U.S. multinational corporations doing business in Colorado have told me  that they want to expand here, but they just can't justify it when they  look at the tax rates we have here versus around the world, especially  in Europe. I have even heard from some foreign-based companies that do  business in Colorado that this sort of reform--I ask unanimous consent  to complete my remarks.    Mr. President, it would entice them to invest more in  the United States. This is real, and the American people need it.   It is good television to say that it is absurd to think that American  families will get more money from lowering the corporate rate than the  tax raised in revenue, but it is wrong. It is tempting to look at a  stash of corporate profits and think that corporations just must not  want to invest here or ``let's just take that money,'' but that is  wrong too. The right move is to create the tax environment that tells  businesses that they should invest here because they can make more  money. That is why President Obama called for corporate tax reform.  That is why former Treasury Secretary--and one of President Obama's  economic advisers--Larry Summers said that reducing the corporate tax  rate and lowering the competitive disadvantage faced by American  multinationals is ``about as close to a free lunch as tax reformers  will ever get.'' That is what we do by lowering the tax rate. That is  how American families end up with $4,000 more in their pockets--and not  just one time; once this fully takes effect, that increase is  permanent.   Mr. President, we have a historic opportunity. The American people  need and deserve a new and better Tax Code, a modern one designed for  today's world, not an Atari world or a Ford LTD world.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with us as we  modernize our Tax Code and deliver real results for the American  people.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tom Kourlis,  a member of my staff, be given floor privileges for the rest of the  day.
