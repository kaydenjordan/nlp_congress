 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the Laurinburg- Maxton Army Air Base in Scotland County, North Carolina, which played a  vital but little-known role in World War II.   From 1942 to 1945, Scotland County helped prepare glider pilots for  the invasions of North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. Generals Dwight  Eisenhower and George Marshall visited the base during the war to  observe glider training.   On June 6, 1944, when more than 160,000 Allied troops landed during  the Invasion of Normandy, glider pilots trained in Scotland County were  among the vanguard as American soldiers silently soared down the French  coastline through the thick fog powered only by the prevailing winds.   The brave glider pilots who trained at Laurinburg-Maxton Air Base  helped secure Allied victory on D-day. Today I ask you to join me in  honoring those soldiers as well as the Scotland County community, which  supported these efforts.                            ____________________
