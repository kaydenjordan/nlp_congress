 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize how critical it  is for the Senate to protect the DACA program and the more than 800,000  Dreamers in America.   Brought here as children through no fault of their own, Dreamers have  gone to our schools, grown up in our neighborhoods, served on the front  lines for the pandemic, and are just as American as all of us in this  room. Yet, the DACA program hangs by a thread because of right-wing  politicians and judges.   Mr. Speaker, 75 percent of Americans already support Dreamers  obtaining a path to legal citizenship. So I call on the Senate to act.  America wants action. We must pass legislation this Congress, or our  Dreamers will suffer. We must put people over politics, Dreamers over  rhetoric. It is now or never for America's Dreamers. We must act.                            ____________________
