 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges  of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   House Resolution 40. Condemning and censuring Representative Steve  King of Iowa.   Whereas, on January 10, 2019, in an interview published by the New  York Times, Representative Steve King asked, ``White nationalist, white  supremacist, Western civilization--how did that language become  offensive? Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our  history and our civilization?'';   Whereas Representative King's comments legitimize white supremacy and  white nationalism as acceptable in today's society;   Whereas Representative King's comments are abhorrent to the founding  principles of our Nation and our rich history of diversity and  tolerance of those whose backgrounds and beliefs have made America the  envy of the world; and   Whereas Representative King's comments reflect negatively on the  House of Representatives.   Now, therefore, be it resolved, that   One, Representative Steve King of Iowa be censured;   Two, Representative Steve King forthwith present himself in the well  of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure; and   Three, Representative Steve King be censured with the public reading  of this resolution by the Speaker.
