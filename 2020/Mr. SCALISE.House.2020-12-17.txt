 Mr. Speaker, I also wish my friend from New Mexico well  in the next phase of his life. I thank him for his service to our  country.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to make a bittersweet announcement, and  that is to say thank you to a member of my staff who has given 31 years  of his life to this great institution. I am talking about Bill Hughes.   Bill Hughes has decided to retire at the end of the 116th Congress.  More than one person has remarked over the years that Bill Hughes comes  with the building. Bill has been my policy director since I became the  Republican whip in 2014. He was my very first hire in that office. But  his career was already legendary when I asked him to unretire and to  join the whip team.   Bill's career embodies the American Dream. He grew up in South  Dakota. He didn't have connections in Washington. He just had a dream.  He was drawn to public service, and his breaks came through hard work.  He became an expert on the Federal budget and the legislative process.   For 31 years, Bill has been part of some of the biggest policy  debates, legislative achievements, and history-making events of our  time. He retires still doing what he dreamed about doing as a young kid  growing up in rural South Dakota.   Bill has served as policy director for a Speaker of this House. He  served as staff director for a committee, as Chief of Staff for a  Senator, and a staff director for the Senate Republican Policy  Committee.   He began his career at OMB under David Stockman back in the Reagan  administration.   When I hired Bill, I hired the institutional memory of this place  dating all the way back to the 98th Congress. He has an encyclopedic  memory of budget accounts, past appropriations battles, Senate  procedures, and, yes, also the history of American music. You can  imagine some of those conversations that we have had through some of  the battles we have had up here.   His colleagues respect and admire him; and more than one generation  of staffers have sought his advice, guidance, and mentorship.   We have all been involved in dropping a bill right over there on the  House floor, but very few of us have dropped a bill the way that Bill  Hughes has.   One day, when he was working for the legendary Bud Shuster, Bill came  running down to the floor with a 1,700-page infrastructure bill to get  it introduced so it could get voted on, and he literally dropped the  bill on the floor. It took some time to put it back together and, of  course, with Bill's attention to detail, he made sure that every page  was back in the right place. But he never once ``dropped'' a bill for  me.   Bill is a consummate staffer and a humble public servant. He works  endless hours to ensure that I have the best information and the most  important facts about key legislation. He never made himself part of  the story. He is that kind of person who deflects attention and credit.   In doing so, Bill Hughes has earned the confidence, not only of me,  but of all the leaders that he has worked with. Speaker Boehner,  Speaker Ryan, Leader McCarthy all have sought Bill's advice and counsel  during his tenure as my policy director in the whip office.   I am sad to have to say good-bye to Bill. We will miss the House  Republicans' ``Senate whisperer,'' as we refer to him. But very few  have earned the thanks and best wishes that Bill leaves this  institution with.   Bill stands out among his peers and colleagues. He came to Washington  nearly 40 years ago with a servant's heart. He came here for a career  in public service, and he leaves the House with more than 33 years of  legislative and executive branch experience. It is truly a remarkable  run.   Bill is retiring to spend more time with his wife and kids and the  greener pastures of his cabin in the mountains. If Bill wanted to  continue to work, it would be right here in the House that he loves,  and the House that will be forever indebted to his sacrifice, his  wisdom, and his great love for the United States of America.   Bill, we were lucky to work with you, and America is a richer Nation  thanks to your service. You will be deeply missed here, but you have  more than earned the opportunity to enjoy this next chapter in your  already rich life.   Thank you to Bill Hughes, and God bless you.                            ____________________
