 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington for  yielding.   This farm bill is a win for Montana's farmers and ranchers who work  the land, feed our country and the world.   As they know too well, weather and markets bring uncertainty. This  farm bill gives our farmers and ranchers a strong safety net that  protects them against the impact of natural disasters and  unpredictable, unfair trade practices of other countries.   Mr. Speaker, this farm bill has Montana's fingerprints on it, and it  addresses many of our key priorities. It protects Montana's sugar beet  growers and processors, and it supports the Agricultural Research  Service, which includes several experiment stations in Montana.   It helps Montanans throughout the State by providing a grant for  rural emergency services, training, and equipment, particularly in our  rural areas. It improves how we manage our forests by empowering county  governments to improve management of neighboring national forest lands.  It also improves rural broadband that is so important to our small  communities.   Mr. Speaker, this farm bill works for Montana. I urge my colleagues  to give America's farmers and ranchers the certainty they need and vote  for the farm bill conference report.
