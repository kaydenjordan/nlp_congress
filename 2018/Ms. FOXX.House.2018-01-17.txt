 Mr. Speaker, each year we commemorate National School  Choice Week to celebrate a family's right to select the best school for  their children. This year we are starting the celebration on January  21.   Americans like to have options, and when it comes to options in  postsecondary education, there are more opportunities than ever. School  choice is  [[Page H416]]  also about bringing those options to America's children in elementary  and secondary schools.   One of the best examples of options is the expansion of school  choice. In the expansion of school choice is the growth of charter  schools. Over the last 12 years, public charter school enrollment has  tripled, and America now has 3 million students attending these  schools.   Along with the growing demand for charter schools, homeschooling and  private school choice programs are increasing. There are 2.3 million  students being homeschooled, and enrollment in private school choice  programs has increased more than 100 percent.   Making school choice available to more families should be a priority  for all of us. It is clear that parents are looking for options, and we  want opportunity for them to be open to everyone.                         Honoring Crystal Winebarger     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to wish Crystal Winebarger of the  Fifth District a very peaceful and happy retirement. For the last 16  years, Ms. Winebarger selflessly served as the Hunger and Health  Coalition director of operations located in Watauga County, North  Carolina. The Hunger and Health Coalition's mission is to lift up the  community by providing resources such as food, medications, and heat in  the winter to those in need.   Crystal worked with members in the faith community and local churches  to ensure the well-being of many individuals and families. It is my  belief that North Carolina will benefit from her tireless efforts for  years to come.   A lasting legacy of service is something that is becoming all too  rare in our neighborhoods today. I will remain forever grateful to Ms.  Winebarger for her service to our community. I wish her a happy  retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to  join my colleagues who all thank the gentleman tonight for the  fantastic leadership that he has given to this issue for so many years.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to affirm the dignity of the estimated 59  million children whose lives have been terminated by abortion in the  United States since 1973. This Friday, tens of thousands of Americans  will bear witness to the value of the unborn at the 45th annual March  for Life, united in opposition to the life-degrading Supreme Court  decision, Roe v. Wade.   The right to life is first among the inalienable rights of the  Nation's Declaration of Independence. It is imperative to safeguard  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; those necessary conditions  for people to flourish. Unfortunately, as evidenced by Roe v. Wade, our  society too often values happiness at the expense of human life.   However, amid this culture of death, the pro-life movement fights for  life  [[Page H464]]  with love. And this year's March for Life theme, ``Love Saves Lives,''  truly embodies the spirit of the pro-life movement. Look no further  than the 2,200 pregnancy centers across the country dedicated to  serving pregnant women and new mothers. There are many in my district  and I am very proud of them.   These pregnancy centers empower women with life-affirming options and  offer medical testing, prenatal care, and ultrasounds. They also  provide parenting classes, baby supplies, and financial assistance to  help meet the emotional and material needs of pregnant women.   Many offer information about the beautiful option of adoption and  provide referrals to connect birth mothers with loving families for  their babies. The babies cared for in these clinics are loved before  they are even born and the women are offered the love and support they  need. These clinics recognize life as a precious gift and embrace a  life-affirming option despite adverse circumstances.   We live in a society that mistakes choice for liberty. But the beauty  of living in a free country is that we can use our liberty for love. On  Friday, the march will speak for the unborn, but the pro-life movement  is more than just words. It is love in action every day, affirming the  value of life at all stages, no matter the difficulties it presents.   Striving to love daily is not easy, yet it is the greatest exercise  of our freedom, and there is no life unworthy of that love.
