 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  the amendment to H.R. 7608 proposed by my colleagues, Mr. Perry and Mr.  Joyce from Pennsylvania. The amendment would prohibit the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) from fulfilling the role outlined in an  agreement that the Agency entered into--along with six states and the  District of Columbia--to restore the Chesapeake Bay. Like the rest of  the Bay's 64,000 square mile watershed, in my district in Hampton  Roads, Virginia, healthy tributaries and a healthy Chesapeake are vital  to the environment, the economy, recreation, wildlife and our way of  life.   Despite the vital importance of the Bay, how to best address its  deterioration was a concern for almost half a century. Prior to the  states' agreement with the EPA, their individual efforts were largely  unsuccessful. In 2010, however, the Environmental Protection Agency  established Total Maximum Daily Load, limits on nutrient and sediment  pollution  [[Page H3798]]  to improve the Bay's water quality. Though the work continues, this new  level of coordination and federal-state cooperation has been very  successful. Beyond the Chesapeake region, this level of coordination  provides a unique precedent for other restoration efforts across the  country. Unfortunately, this amendment would prohibit the EPA from  fulfilling their crucial role, one that the watershed states have  agreed is necessary. History makes it clear that the collaboration and  partnership of state, local, Federal, and non-governmental partners  will be required to restore this national treasure. I urge my  colleagues to vote no on this amendment.   I also rise in support of the amendment that my colleague Ms. Speier  has introduced. I share the gentlewoman's concern about forcing non- federal entities that have faithfully worked with the EPA to secure  funding for the very successful Water Infrastructure Finance and  Innovation Act (WIFIA) Program to reapply. In my district in Hampton  Roads, the SWIFT project--or the Sustainable Water Initiative for  Tomorrow--is currently very close to closing a loan to move forward  with their work to replenish the Potomac aquifer. Changing the  application process for non-federal applicants that are already so far  along in the process is wasteful and would unnecessarily delay projects  that support access to safe and affordable water for our communities.   In the case of the innovative SWIFT project, the WIFIA program  supports my community's access to clean drinking water not only now,  but also in the future as it recharges an aquifer on which most of  eastern Virginia depends for their drinking water. In addition to  limiting the amount of treated water that would otherwise be discharged  into the James, Elizabeth, or York Rivers, this project would also  yield enormous benefits to the entire region by slowing land  subsidence, which is compounded in the Hampton Roads region by sea- level rise. Importantly for agricultural producers, the project also  promises to slow the intrusion of saltwater into groundwater in the  region.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the WIFIA program and  the many benefits that it provides.                                time  1515
