 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a great American, World War  II veteran Seaman First Class Ed Diaz.   Mr. Diaz, a native of New York, enlisted in the Navy in 1944 and was  subsequently assigned to the USS Columbus heavy cruiser. During World  War II, he served in the South Pacific and participated in Operation  Road's End, a campaign in which 24 Japanese submarines were sunk and  which led to the final destruction of Japan's submarine fleet.   Mr. Diaz was discharged after the war but continued to serve in the  Naval Reserve for another decade. He later worked as a machinist in  Pennsylvania until a promotion relocated him to the heart of Florida  District 15. In total, he served with Hazleton Pumps for 42 years.   Like many from the Greatest Generation, Seaman First Class Ed Diaz  humbly and sacrificially served this country in one of its darkest  hours. He looked evil in the eye and stood up to it in the name of  democracy and freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Diaz for his service and his dedication. He  showed us how to live and gave our State and Nation a better future.  Today I salute him.                            ____________________
