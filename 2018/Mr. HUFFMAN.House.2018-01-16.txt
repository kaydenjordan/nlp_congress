 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for S. 117,  the Alex Diekmann Peak Designation Act. Although I didn't work with  Alex Diekmann personally, I am very familiar with the work that the  Trust for Public Land has done across the West, and I have been told of  all of Alex's individual achievements in protecting important wildlife  corridors, fly-fishing streams, and ecosystems across Montana and the  Northern Rockies. He spent the better part of two decades making the  American West better, protecting landscapes within the Greater  Yellowstone Ecosystem and securing places for our children's children  to enjoy. This legislation is a fitting memorial to Alex Diekmann's  life and legacy, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.
