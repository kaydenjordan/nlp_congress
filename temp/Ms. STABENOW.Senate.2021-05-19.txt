 Mr. President, first, before my friend from Iowa leaves  the floor, and he is my friend, I didn't come to debate the Line 5  Pipeline that goes under the Great Lakes of Michigan, but I will say  that this is an aging pipeline under a precious resource called the  Great Lakes, 20 percent of the world's freshwater. The Governor is  really balancing right now what are issues that relate to safety and  trying to make sure that we don't have a spill in the Great Lakes that  would just devastate not only our economy and way of life but the  country's as well.                                   S. 1260    Mr. President, I always say that the people in Michigan can outwork,  outbuild, and outimagine anybody. Whether we are building the new Ford  all-electric F-150 truck that President Biden rode yesterday when he  was in Michigan or whether it is armored vehicles that keep members of  the military safe in war zones; whether it is solar panels and wind  turbines and appliances and furniture or dollies strong enough to move  helicopters, Michigan's manufacturing workers are the best in the  world, period. Their hard work makes our Nation stronger.   Unfortunately, there are times when our Nation hasn't returned the  favor. Each year, Federal Agencies spend billions of dollars in  taxpayer money on products from the private sector, everything from  vehicles, to office furniture, to electronics.   The Buy American Act, which was signed back in 1933, says the Federal  Government should give preference to high-quality products here in  America. Common sense, right? American taxpayer dollars should go to  American manufacturers, American businesses, and American workers.  Unfortunately, loopholes and waivers and outright noncompliance by  Federal Agencies mean that, too many times, American taxpayer dollars  instead go to foreign companies that compete against American  manufacturers and American workers.   Back in 2018, I released a report that showed that between 2008 and  2016, exceptions and waivers to the Buy American Act allowed Federal  Agencies to spend about $92 billion on foreign-made products. That is  $92 billion in missed opportunities for American businesses and  American workers.   That is why Senator Braun and I introduced the Make It in America  Act, along with Senator Peters, Senator Portman, and Senator Baldwin. I  am grateful that Chairman Peters and Ranking Member Portman got this  commonsense bill into the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee as part of the bill in front of us today, the Endless  Frontier Act.   I also want to thank President Biden. His administration reached out  to me and asked to be briefed on the report that we had done, and  initial executive orders that they put in place were very much in line  with our recommendations, and I know they are very supportive of this  bill.   My legislation ensures that we are holding Federal Agencies  accountable when enforcing Buy American Act activities. It adds new  guardrails to the waivers. Right now, we have waivers, but there has  been no transparency, no accountability, and over the years, no  training really for how to administer it. Sometimes it is just easier  to do a waiver than it is to do an extensive search about whether there  are businesses in America that could do this work or provide a product.   It also calls on products purchased by Federal Agencies to  incorporate more domestic content. The supply chain is so important. So  much of our job creation is in the parts that go into the product. And  it helps ensure that American companies aren't undercut by cheap  foreign products.   Of course, rules don't matter if nobody enforces them, so, again, it  is important that this legislation makes the Made in America Office a  permanent part of the Office of Management and Budget. It will ensure  that American workers and businesses receive preference regardless of  who is in the Oval Office.   It is important to emphasize that the legislation doesn't just  benefit big businesses, and this is important. It calls for Agencies to  use a wonderfully successful entity called the Manufacturing Extension  Partnership so that small businesses and medium-sized manufacturers  have more opportunities to sell their products to the Federal  Government or provide materials for federally funded infrastructure  projects. And, by the way, there is oftentimes a situation where a  company could retool pretty quickly to provide a product if they knew  that we were interested, if we were going to purchase, and we should  give them the opportunity if there is an American company that can step  up and be able to create that for us.    Everyone says we need to make more things in America, and here is an  opportunity to put those words into action. I urge colleagues to pass  the Endless Frontier Act, to get the Make It in America Act signed into  law, and use our American tax dollars to purchase great American  products that support great-paying American jobs.   I yield the floor.
