 Mr. Speaker, it has been estimated the  Paris Accord adopted by President Joe Biden will destroy 2.7 million  American jobs.   The Washington Examiner, on January 26, exposes more dangers to  American families:   ``President Biden's decision to rejoin the Paris climate accord  immediately delivered . . . a gift to China.  [[Page H552]]    ``It commits the United States . . . that will entangle American  businesses and jobs in new lengths of red tape, and will also probably  increase electricity prices.   ``China, which emits twice as much carbon each year as we do, has  given the rest of the world nothing but empty promises.   ``Biden is giving away the store for nothing . . . he should demand  external verification of emissions data. . . .''   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never  forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   I appreciate President Biden last night recognizing the lives lost by  the Wuhan virus, joining President Trump last year, who took the first  action to ban travel from China.                            ____________________
