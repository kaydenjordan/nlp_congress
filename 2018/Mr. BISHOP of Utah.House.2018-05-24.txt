 Mr. Speaker, June 1 will mark the end of an era  in Utah broadcasting. For the past 40 years, Utahans have heard Doug  Wright inform, uplift, and bloviate--that is his word, not mine.   On Fridays, he reviewed movies, crowned losers, and gave prizes worth  up to dollars. For the callers, it was telephone torture, but for the  listeners, it has been a friendship through the airways.   The Doug Wright Show is ``Where Utah Comes to Talk.'' In Utah, it is  not news until you hear it on Doug's show. Doug got exclusives, and he  did it through hard work, fairness, and being worthy of the trust  Utahans placed in him.   Doug wasn't always cooped up in a studio. From the back of a Harley  and with a microphone in his hand, he raised the money to bring street  lamps to his adopted home of Eureka. His motorcycle rally, the Ride to  Light up Eureka, set records, and continues to grow each year.   Doug has earned awards and accolades and has been at the top of the  ratings, but he will tell you the best thing to come from the newsroom  was his wife, D. With her, he grew a family and shared with his  audience all the joys and trials that come with a family.   As Doug advised us at the close of each day's program: Tonight, when  you go home, make sure you hug the people you love.                            ____________________
