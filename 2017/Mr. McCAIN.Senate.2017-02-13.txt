 Mr. President, I am proud to support Dr. David Shulkin's  nomination for Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Department of  Veterans Affairs, VA, faces massive challenges in delivering care to  our veterans, but I believe that Dr. Shulkin is well equipped for the  task at hand.   Dr. Shulkin has committed to fully implementing the Veterans Choice  Program as Secretary and will work to expand this program to provide a  network that meets the needs of veterans, their families, and providers  in the community--every veteran deserves access to care, whether that  be at the VA or in the community.   Through the Veterans Choice Program, we have seen more than 7 million  appointments made for veterans in their communities, a network expanded  by 350,000 providers and over 1.5 million veterans that have benefitted  from using the Choice Card. I will seek to build and expand upon this  progress and look to Dr. Shulkin's support for legislation that would  bring care in the community under an integrated and coordinated system  that utilizes a Veterans Choice Card. This will ensure access to  timely, flexible, and quality care that our veterans have earned and  deserve.   I believe that Dr. Shulkin is the person that can repair the culture  of the VA to focus on the veteran and restore honesty and  accountability to the Department. I thank him for accepting this  challenge to serve our Nation and look forward to working with him in  the days ahead.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I rise today in fond memory of Robert  Justin Stevens, a former staffer of mine who recently passed away-- entirely too young--after a long, arduous fight with cancer.   Justin was exemplary in his desire to serve and his love for public  policy and politics. He was a dedicated public servant who worked  tirelessly to improve the lives of Americans. Over the last few years,  Justin managed Federal policy and advocacy for homeland security,  public safety, and military-related issues as legislative director with  the National Governors Association.   Before that, Justin worked with me, and later with Senator Scott  Brown, as a professional staff member at the Senate Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management,  Government Information, Federal Services, and International Security.  There, he helped us to identify and address waste, fraud, and abuse in  government spending and financial improvement, audit readiness, and  business transformation at our Federal agencies. During my 2008  Presidential campaign, Justin served as a senior advance team lead. It  was in that context that I was first introduced to Justin's boundless  love of life and energy.   Justin also served as the director for candidate operations and  advance for the Scott Brown for Senate 2012 campaign; a financial  systems analyst with the EMCOR Group; and a Navy/NASA university  faculty fellowship program manager with the American Society for  Engineering Education, ASEE.   Justin never took his young life for granted. An avid runner and  adventurous soul, Justin sought to improve himself by taking courses in  furtherance of a master's in national security and strategic studies at  the U.S. Naval War College, after having received a B.S. in business  administration from the University of Florida and graduated East Lake  High School. Also, unbowed by his continuing struggle with cancer and  always filled with hope, Justin married the love of his life,  Elizabeth.   Justin will be forever remembered for the joy he brought to the lives  of his family, friends, and colleagues with his humor, energy, and  selflessness. Throughout his young life, Justin always made sure that  those closest to him knew how important they were to him.   Cindy and I extend our warmest condolences to Justin's wife,  Elizabeth; his mother Jean Nowakowski; his stepmother Karen Stevens,  with whom Justin was exceptionally close; his siblings Bryan and Damon;  his niece Magdalena and nephew Jackson. Thank you.                            ____________________
