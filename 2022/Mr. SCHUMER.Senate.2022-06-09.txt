 Madam President, this year we have already seen more  mass shootings in America than we have had days in the year--more than  one a day on average. The prevalence of guns, their ease of access, and  the hateful motivations of mass shooters have all mixed into a toxic  brew that is tearing America apart. People are asking, what is going  on, and why can't Congress protect us?   Yesterday, our House colleagues heard from those affected most: the  parents of a young girl murdered in Uvalde, a student who played dead  by covering herself in her friend's blood, and the mom of a Buffalo  survivor who painted the gruesome picture of the bullet holes on her  son's neck, back, and leg.   These were harrowing, gut-wrenching testimonies. That Congress has  not acted in decades in response to these acts of violence is shameful.  It used to be different. About 30 years ago, I was the author of the  Brady bill and worked with Republicans and law enforcement to get  strong gun safety laws passed. That was a different era. But the lesson  from back then remains clear today: The right laws can make a real  difference in reducing gun deaths. Because those laws were on the  books, it is very likely that tens of thousands of people are alive and  healthy who would not have been.   Right now, the Senate is trying to break that streak of inaction--the  30-year streak of inaction since we were able to pass Brady and the  assault weapons ban--by working toward meaningful legislation on gun  violence.   Yesterday, a bipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans met again  to continue working toward a bipartisan compromise. This morning, my  colleague Senator Murphy reported that the group is making good  progress, and they hope to get something real done very soon. As soon  as the bipartisan group comes to agreement, I want to bring a measure  to the floor for a vote as quickly as possible.   The overwhelming consensus of our caucus, of gun safety advocates,  and of the American people is that getting something real done on gun  violence is worth pursuing, even if we cannot get everything that we  know we need.   The work of curing our Nation of mass shootings will continue well  after  [[Page S2876]]  this debate concludes. But at this moment, we have a moral obligation  to try for real progress because taking tangible steps to reduce gun  violence is critically important.   Americans are sick and tired of going through the same grieving cycle  over and over again, only for Congress to do nothing. They are enraged  that even after shootings in Sandy Hook, Parkland, San Bernardino, El  Paso, Boulder, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and so many others, that nothing-- nothing--has changed.   We hope this time around something will change at last. I hope that  very soon we can see a deal come together. I encourage my colleagues to  keep their talks going so we can act on it very quickly.                              January 6 Hearings    Madam President, on the January 6 hearings, tonight, the Nation will  tune in to the House Select Committee on January 6 as they begin their  first public hearings on the Capitol insurrection. Tonight's hearings  will be a watershed moment in the fight to protect our democracy from  the Big Lie of the hard right.   The committee will lay bare the truth that the American people must  know; first, that there was tremendous violence. There are still many  out there who say there wasn't violence. There was. The pictures show  it. The eyewitnesses testify to it.   And the committee will lay bare the truth that the American people  must know; that Donald Trump was at the heart of a coordinated effort  to overturn the 2020 elections, to overturn our constitutional order,  and inflict permanent damage upon our democracy. It will be essential  viewing.   But in one of the most cowardly journalistic decisions in modern  memory, FOX News--one of the biggest amplifiers of the Big Lie about  January 6, about Donald Trump, and about the election--will not  broadcast tonight's hearing.   FOX News's decision not to air the biggest hearing in modern history  should end any debate that they are not a real news organization. FOX  News is rapidly becoming a propaganda machine of the hard right, and it  is as plain as day that they are scared of their viewers learning the  truth about January 6.   FOX News's decision not to air the January 6 hearings is dangerous,  cowardly, and shameful, given that they have spent more than a year  spreading the Big Lie and misinforming their viewers.   Instead of telling the truth, they have isolated their viewers in an  alternative reality of conspiracy theories that is immensely damaging  to our democracy. Even the so-called liberal media which FOX News  regularly attacks tries to tell both sides.   FOX News is afraid of telling both sides because they are afraid of  the truth, and they are afraid their viewers may learn that FOX News  has lied to them.   I urge FOX News to change course very soon. The press has an  obligation--always has had that obligation--not to hide the truth from  the American people, no matter how painful or inconvenient.   And as a nation, we have a duty to never forget what happened on  January 6. The direct assault on our democracy and the dangers of that  day, sadly, remain still with us.                        Honoring our PACT Act of 2021    Madam President, now, on the PACT Act, a happier note, today, the  Senate will continue consideration of the most important veteran  healthcare expansion in decades, the PACT Act, authored by my  colleagues Senators Tester and Moran--bipartisan.   We want to get this bill done as soon as we can. We can't have  dilatory or destructive amendments to this bill because it is too  important for our veterans' well-being to delay or destroy it.   For years, I have worked extensively with veterans, veterans service  organizations, and advocates, including Jon Stewart and John Deal, who  all say that the VA rules must be changed to ensure sick veterans get  the care they need.   They volunteered, went off to war, and were exposed to toxins. That  is a cost of war, and the American people cannot let them down.   The bill, which could benefit 3.5 million veterans who have been  exposed to toxic chemicals in the line of duty, represents that change.  For the sake of our veterans, there is no reason--no reason--not to  pass this bill A-S-A-P, and I hope that is precisely what we can do.                                   Shipping    Madam President, on shipping, next week, the House is to vote on a  much needed bill, passed unanimously by the Senate in April, to lower  costs and relieve supply chains by reforming unfair shipping practices  that hurt exporters and consumers alike.   Rising costs are top of the mind right now for the American people,  and one of the more flummoxing causes of inflation is the crushing  backlog that we are seeing at our ports. We have all seen the pictures  of scores of ships lining up in ports, from Los Angeles to Savannah, to  Seattle, to my home port of New York and New Jersey.   These backlogs have created serious price hikes. According to one  study from earlier this year, the price to transport a container from  China to the west coast of the United States costs 12 times--12 times-- as much as it did 2 years ago, and the American consumer is paying the  price. And it hurts both ways when shipping costs go up: It affects  exports that we send overseas and imports that come back. It is a  double whammy, whacking the American people's pocketbooks and wallets.  At the end of the day, the American consumer ends up paying the higher  price.   So I am very glad that the House will finally act on the Senate- passed shipping bill next week. The shipping reform bill will help us  lower costs. It will clear our ports, relieve our supply chains, and  American families will feel the benefit.   I want to thank my colleagues Senators Klobuchar and Thune, the  authors of the legislation, as well as the fine work of Senator  Cantwell, for leading this legislation earlier this year out of  committee, onto the floor, and passing here in the Senate.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, this week, the Senate has worked  towards passing the largest expansion of healthcare benefits for our  veterans in a very long time. Millions of veterans today face the  flabbergasting indignity. They served our country valiantly, were  exposed to toxic chemicals in the line of duty but cannot get the  healthcare benefits they need because of outdated rules at the VA.   This needs to change, and the PACT Act would provide the fix. Many on  both sides want to get this bill done as soon as we can. We cannot have  dilatory or destructive amendments to the PACT Act because it is too  important for our veterans' well-being.   To that end, Democrats have spent the day working with Republicans on  a list of amendments, and these negotiations are ongoing. But while we  work on an agreement and to keep the process moving, I will be filing  cloture so we can take the next step towards passing the PACT Act next  week. We hope to get an agreement--and we are making good progress  there--so we hope to get an agreement before that, but the legislative  process must move forward.   So for the sake of our veterans who have made the ultimate sacrifice  serving our Nation and defending our freedom, there is no reason we  can't pass the PACT Act ASAP. Our discussions continue with our  Republican colleagues in an effort to get that done, and I am hopeful  that we will succeed.                              Amendment No. 5076     Madam President, I have an amendment to the underlying  bill at the desk.    Madam President, I ask to dispense with further reading  of the amendment.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, Thursday,  June 9, be waived.
