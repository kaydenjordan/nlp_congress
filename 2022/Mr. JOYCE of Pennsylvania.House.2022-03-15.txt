 Madam Speaker, we are facing multiple  crises in our country. Inflation is surging, gasoline prices are  skyrocketing, and the Biden administration is still refusing to act.   In Adams County, Pennsylvania, a gallon of gas costs $4.43. That is  $1.40 more than it did just 1 year ago.   Rural Americans should not be forced to pay the price for President  Biden's failure to drill American oil, a failure that has led to the  highest gas prices in our Nation's history.   In a recent survey that I conducted in my weekly newsletter, over  3,000 of my constituents responded, and 96 percent of them reported  that the rising cost of goods has affected their individual budgets.   It is time for President Biden to take responsibility for what his  reckless spending has done to our country. Because of this reckless  spending, Americans are forced to make difficult choices about what  they can afford to buy, about what medications they can afford, and  about which bills they are able to pay each month.   It is time for President Biden to care more about the families in  Pennsylvania, more about the families in America, than he does about  the Green New Deal. It is time to drill American oil. It is time to  utilize and expand Pennsylvania's wonderful energy resources. It is  time to use the resources that are under the feet of my constituents:  the coal, the natural gas, and the Marcellus shale.   Biden welcomed a pipeline to Putin, and yet he shut down the Keystone  XL pipeline. It is time to return to American energy independence and  American energy dominance. It is time to get to work for the American  people.                            ____________________
