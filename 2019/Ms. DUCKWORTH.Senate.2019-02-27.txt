 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor in opposition to  Andrew Wheeler's nomination to lead the Environmental Protection  Agency.   Americans across this country depend on EPA to protect their public  health, yet under this administration, EPA has failed again and again  to reassure my constituents that their basic rights to breathe in clean  air and sip clean water are being prioritized.   Listen, I am proud that EPA's Region 5 office is headquartered in  Chicago. Region 5 has led the country in enforcing the Clean Air Act,  the Clean Water Act, and other bedrock environmental policies that  Congress has passed. But under Mr. Wheeler and this administration, EPA  has made it harder for the scientists, engineers, and public health  experts in Region 5 to do their jobs.   EPA is severely understaffed and underfunded, and in 2018, major  enforcement actions dropped to their lowest levels in more than 10  years. Last year, EPA competed fewer than 11,000 inspections and  evaluations of polluters across the country--the lowest number in  almost two decades.   In 2018, EPA sent just 123 civil pollution violation cases to the  Justice Department for prosecution. That is about 40 percent less than  the annual average during the Obama administration. So, sadly, it  should come as no surprise that a report from the Environmental  Integrity Project this month found that communities across the country  are now being put at risk of exposure to dangerous contaminants.   To make matters worse, the EPA's enforcement workforce has been  shrinking for years, and the Trump administration wants to cut it back  even further.   These cutbacks are leaving communities, especially low-income  communities and those of color, exposed to public health risks.  Meanwhile, polluters are being let off the hook for serious violations  of the law.   I have seen firsthand what happens when EPA fails to enforce our laws  and protect public health. It causes fear and confusion. For months,  residents in Willowbrook, IL, have lived in fear that the air they  breathe in has been making their family sick.   Here is a little background. A facility in their community has been  releasing cancer-causing emissions for decades. Unfortunately, even  since EPA discovered just how toxic this chemical was years ago--years  ago--they have refused to issue new regulations updating safety  standards based on the latest science.   Making matters even worse, EPA officials refused to notify local  public health or elected officials about their discovery, leaving  communities in the dark even while their health is at risk, leaving  more families more likely to get sick, leaving more children more  likely to die.   As a mother, this is heartbreaking. As a Senator, this is outrageous.   When Willowbrook residents first started to raise concerns, EPA  wasn't the least bit transparent. The Agency had to be pushed by  Senator Durbin, other Members of the Illinois congressional delegation,  and me just to hold community forums.   My office also received alarming information alleging that senior  political appointees instructed EPA personnel not to inspect any  facility in Region 5 that emits the same carcinogen found at this  facility. If true, this type of political interference is beyond  unacceptable. If true, it is happening on Mr. Wheeler's watch.   I have asked EPA to take several steps to fix this crisis, and I am  still waiting for their response.   In the absence of leadership from EPA, Senator Durbin and I have  authored two pieces of legislation to ensure that this kind of crisis  never happens again.   Here is what Gabriela, a resident of Willowbrook, said when she saw  the list of health problems associated with this facility: ``It was  like reading our medical history.''   Since she moved to her home in 2009, Gabriela has suffered from  intense headaches, dizziness, nausea, inability to concentrate, and  memory loss. She has found it difficult to read through briefs and  almost instantly forgets movie plots and even some conversations.   Both of her children, who have lived in the house for most of their  lives, have had respiratory problems since they were little. Her 12- year-old daughter has often coughed to the point of vomiting and has  developed a bone cyst.   One of her 9-year-old daughter's classmates was recently diagnosed  with leukemia, as was Gabriella's next-door neighbor, an otherwise  healthy man in his early fifties.   Another woman I have gotten to know from Willowbrook is named  Neringa. She told me that when she and her husband were moving to  Chicago 5 years ago, they picked their home because it seemed like a  place where their children would be safe.   She went on:         You look for sexual predators, good schools, taxes. You       don't think you would have to look at air and water. You feel       like it is the one thing in our country we wouldn't have to       think about.    Exposure from toxic pollution is a matter of life and death for these  residents. It was uncovered only when career civil servants did their  job and flagged a risk they observed in a routine model that EPA  publishes.   I am extremely concerned that other areas in Illinois could face  similar issues and that other kids in other communities could be  breathing in air full of cancer-causing chemicals when they are playing  on the swings at recess or walking home from school later that  afternoon.   I need EPA to respond to the requests I have made on behalf of Lake  County and actually conduct the kind of monitoring that exposed the  problem in Willowbrook there and in every community that may be at  risk.   Not far from Willowbrook, residents in Chicago have also been facing  several public health threats for decades.   Chicago, IL, is the birthplace of Hazel Johnson, the ``Mother of the  Environmental Justice Movement,'' a pioneer of environmental justice  activism on the South Side of Chicago.   She founded People for Community Recovery in 1979 in an effort to get  asbestos out of the buildings in her community. Soon she managed to  trace air and water pollution in her community to nearby industry,  which was using the predominantly lower income African-American  community as a dumping ground.   Hazel Johnson knew what I know: Every American has a right to breathe  in safe air, drink clean water, and live  [[Page S1524]]  on uncontaminated land, no matter where they live, no matter the color  of their skin, no matter their tax bracket.   Yet I still hear about manganese pollution, petcoke, particulate  matter, and lead exposure from these residents on a daily basis.   Chicago residents deserve--no, they need--environmental justice. But  for some reason, this administration has dismantled the office that is  supposed to lead this work, even trying to eliminate EPA's  environmental justice funding and drive out the office's top talent.   Lead exposure is an issue that impacts low-income families and  communities of color disproportionately. I had high hopes that I would  be able to work with Mr. Wheeler on the administration's response to  this crisis. Yet after months and months of delays, I am very  disappointed by their so-called plan.   Mr. Wheeler's lead action plan falls short of what was promised and  the ``war on lead'' his predecessor declared. This is not a plan with  goals, strategies, and deadlines. Instead, it is a repackaged version  of a report published under the Obama administration. Little has  changed, other than the window dressing.   What disappointed me most was that the administration appears to be  walking back our goal of eliminating lead exposure, settling simply for  reducing it. That is unacceptable.   Even to this day, in a post-Flint crisis world, too many in power are  sitting idly by as countless Americans are exposed to lead. More than 6  million homes get water from lead service lines, and 24 million homes  have lead hazards in paint, dust, or soil. Nearly half a million  children have elevated levels of lead in their blood.   Let's be clear. For children, there is no safe level of lead  allowable in drinking water. Even low levels can cause permanent brain  damage in kids, lowering IQ, and inflicting other cognitive damage.  Imagine if your child were one of those who had gotten sick because the  EPA refused to take action on such an obvious crisis. Imagine how  infuriating, how devastating that would be.   We must make meaningful progress in tackling sources of exposure, and  EPA must take up an aggressive, comprehensive, and practical strategy.   I know we can make real progress in reducing lead in our society, but  the new lead action plan is a missed opportunity to advance those  efforts.   I also believe that Mr. Wheeler has far too many conflicts of  interest to be running the EPA. As a former lobbyist for Murray Energy,  Mr. Wheeler has worked closely with the industries he would regulate as  the leader of the EPA. It is well reported that Mr. Wheeler's former  firm lobbied the EPA on efforts Wheeler now oversees.   Even after he took temporary reins of the EPA, he made no secret of  meeting with former clients and fossil fuel industry representatives.  CNN and Reuters have both reported that Wheeler is heavily prioritizing  meetings with industry over anyone else and has attended more than 50  meetings with companies or industry groups that EPA regulates.   If this news doesn't alarm you, it may be because corruption is  becoming routine under this administration. After all, just earlier  this week, the Washington Post reported that the Assistant  Administrator for Air and Radiation, Bill Wehrum, has been routinely  meeting with former clients in the fossil fuel industry from his not- so-long-ago lobbying days.   I placed a hold on Mr. Wehrum's nomination because I did not think he  could be trusted with our Nation's air. I feel the same way about Mr.  Wheeler's leading the EPA.   According to the Sierra Club, every third day during his first 100  days as Acting Administrator, Mr. Wheeler either, one, rolled back a  new climate policy; two, ignored or contradicted science; three, met  with big polluters; four, limited the EPA's ability to protect us from  pollution; or, five, gave in to corporate polluter demands--all of that  in just his first 3 months and change. Imagine what would happen if we  gave him the reins for good.   Mr. Wheeler's position on climate change policy alone is  disqualifying. Consider, for example, his attack on the Clean Power  Plan. Climate change is a major threat to our environment, our economy,  and our national security--something that even Donald Trump's own  intelligence officials admit.   My home State of Illinois is already experiencing the consequences of  inaction. Growing seasons are changing, heat waves are increasing, and  extreme floods are becoming more frequent and more severe. Just this  December we had a hurricane. Mitigating these effects will require  sensible policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in  clean energy.   Under the Clean Water Act, EPA is legally required to limit carbon  pollution from powerplants, pollution that we know is the primary  driver of climate change.   That is why the Obama administration established a Clean Power Plan-- to provide States the flexibility they need to meet a national goal of  32 percent reductions in carbon pollution by 2030. This plan was the  culmination of robust and rigorous public participation, and EPA  received millions of comments supporting the program from States,  through its utilities, communities of color, Tribes, environmental  groups, labor unions, and the public at large.   The Clean Power Plan was not only good for the environment; it was  good for the economy, too. In Illinois, residents are expected to save  an average of up to 4 percent on electricity bills by 2030. Illinois  energy efficiency investments alone are estimated to grow our economy  by $2 billion in that same year, and we lead the Midwest in clean  energy jobs.   But no matter the obvious global, national, and economic benefits,  Mr. Wheeler has led the administration's efforts to roll back the Clean  Power Plan. His replacement proposal would adversely impact public  health and lead to as many as 1,400 premature deaths from increased  soot, up to 15,000 new cases of upper respiratory problems, and 100,000  missed school and work days annually by 2030.   Internationally, this proposal would leave the United States further  behind our allies that have taken aggressive action on climate change.  The proposal also fails low-income communities and communities of  color, which bear the brunt of our environmental and public health  burdens. Unlike the Clean Power Plan, this platform doesn't even  require States to engage environmental justice and community groups in  their plan development processes. It also fails to encourage States to  conduct environmental justice analysis of their own as they develop  implementation plans.   EPA should be working to strengthen policies like the Clean Power  Plan. It is more than troubling that Mr. Wheeler and the Trump  administration are instead seeking to repeal them entirely. Now is not  the time to move backward.   Here is what Evan, who grew up in Libertyville, IL, shared with me:         I write because I am concerned about the future. The future       of the world, the future for the United States and my own       future. At this time, I feel that perhaps the greatest threat       to that future is climate change. The current       Administration's stance towards the issue has discouraged me       to no end, and I can't help but despair as the President       makes light of this existential threat to the wellbeing of       the planet.        I know, of course, that not all lawmakers share the       President's stance towards this issue. Please, make some       noise.    Evan, I hear you. I hear your fear, and I want you to know that I  believe the Nation should be focused on building a clean energy economy  and a climate-safe future for your generation. I hear you, and I am  going to make that noise for you.   I am also angry at EPA's abuse of the small refinery waiver program  under the renewable fuel standard. The RFS includes a policy to help  small refineries that cannot afford to comply with the RFS. Before  Donald Trump took power, this policy was rarely used. Under the Trump  administration, however, nearly every exemption application has been  secretly granted. This includes applications from large, multibillion  dollar companies like Exxon and Chevron that are earning record  profits. These companies' CEOs have even pointed to hardship waivers on  earnings clauses as contributing to their profitability.   The administration's stance reduces incentives for blending--slashing  demands for biofuels and feedstocks--actively hurting farmers and  biofuels  [[Page S1525]]  companies. These waivers could hurt the markets for years to come,  holding back homegrown biofuels while creating windfall profits for  large oil refiners--the exact opposite of this administration's promise  to voters.   Let's be blunt. EPA is taking money out of farmers' hands and giving  it to billionaire oil companies. These actions come at a time when  biofuel producers and farmers across our country are already hurting.  Farm income is at its lowest since 2006, and retaliatory trade measures  from China threaten to deepen the crisis.   Yet early reports indicate that the small refinery waivers EPA has  granted under President Trump and Mr. Wheeler will reduce demand for  biofuels by billions. Over the past 6 months, we have seen more ethanol  plants sold, idled, or closed than ever before. When I asked Mr.  Wheeler during the confirmation hearing about EPA's apparent change in  policy to now seemingly granting every exemption application, he made  excuses justifying them. We need a leader at the EPA who is going to  stand up for our farmers, not capitulate to the demands of Big Oil.   We also need a leader at the EPA who is going to protect the Great  Lakes. The 1,000 employees in Region 5 work tirelessly to protect the  environment, health, and safety of Americans living in Illinois,  Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. They live, work, and  raise their families in the communities they protect, and they are  leaders in the fields of water quality, Superfund cleanup, and Great  Lakes restoration.   Region 5 is also home to the Great Lakes Program Office, which  ensures that we keep the promises we made to Canada under the Great  Lakes Water Quality Agreement. It also leads the Nation's Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative, which has funded more than 2,000 projects that  improve water quality, protect wildlife, and clean up toxic pollutants  that threaten our water supply.   To date, the program has invested more than $2.2 billion in Great  Lakes restoration projects. Coordinated in both the United States and  Canada, GLRI sets the standards for interagency and international  cooperation. Every $1 invested in Great Lakes restoration results in a  $2 return in the form of increased fishing, tourism, and home values.  But in addition to enduring a shutdown, the employees in Region 5 who  lead these programs have been bought out, undermined, and reorganized  into positions they are not suited for, and that is unacceptable.   What is also unacceptable is Mr. Wheeler's attacks on science and  science integrity. Science does not have a political affiliation.  Science is about learning, and it never stands still. It gives us the  building blocks to help us increase our knowledge over time and to find  ever-better solutions to the challenges we face. Unfortunately, this  EPA has led the administration's attacks on science when it doesn't fit  with their pro-polluter agenda.   What is at stake is not just our health and future but also America's  standing and influence in the world. Just this month, EPA released the  names of eight new members of its science advisory board. I am  concerned that several of the new members represent interests who seek  to undermine the independence and quality of the scientific advice  given to the EPA. University researchers are now in the minority on the  board, while the number of industry-affiliated members and members  listed as consultants has increased.    Here is how the Union of Concerned Scientists summarized the new  appointments made by Wheeler to the Science Advisory Board. Take Dr.  John Christy. He has a reputation for controversial climate research  and denying the evidence of global warming.   Then, there is Dr. Brant Ulsh, a consultant who argues that radiation  at low doses isn't a big deal, contrary to the conclusions of the  National Academy of Science.   New member Dr. Richard Williams has received compensation from the  American Chemistry Council's formaldehyde panel, which was set up to  obfuscate the health impacts of this carcinogen. He is also on the  board of trustees of the International Life Sciences Institute, an  industry-funded organization that is notorious for pushing out shoddy  nutrition science.   Dr. Barbara Beck is a consultant with Gradient, which has itself  earned a reputation for helping industry defend their products with  favorable scientific studies. Beck herself helped to write a paper  arguing that exposure to lead at low doses is not necessarily harmful  to children, which is in stark contrast to the CDC's assessment that  there is no safe level of exposure to lead.   The common thread among these individuals is that they are  practitioners of the widely used disinformation playbook. They  frequently work to inject uncertainty into science by criticizing risk  assessments and underlying models. They argue that exposure to  pollutants at low doses is not worth worrying about. That is not true.  Pollution is pollution, and it is bad for communities, and it is bad  for public health.   I also want to spend some time discussing the administration's new  clean water rule. For more than 45 years, the Clean Water Act has  preserved, protected, and restored our Nation's most important natural  resource and radically transformed how our Nation uses water. That is  why admirers of CWA appropriately labeled this law as one of the most  successful public health initiatives ever enacted. Continued success of  the CWA requires developing a clear, concise rule for determining which  bodies of water are protected by the Clean Water Act. However, Mr.  Wheeler and the Trump administration have proposed a rule that fails to  provide the clear-cut certainty requested by my constituents. It would  cancel protections for drinking water sources of tens of millions of  people. It would also cancel protections for streams and wetlands that  provide habitat for wildlife and protect communities from flooding.   Communities across the country, particularly low-income communities  and communities of color, already struggle to access clean water. Mr.  Wheeler's proposed rule will make it even harder for these communities.  Mr. Wheeler's water rule puts the profits of corporate polluters before  our health and clean water for our families.   Alan, from Wheeling, IL, wrote to me and said:         This is insanity. There is nothing more important than       protecting the sources of water that many people in this       country drink from.        No source of drinking water should be open for pollution or       destruction, but that is exactly what this proposal does by       stripping protections from critical streams and wetlands       across the country.        Senator Duckworth, please do anything that is possible to       protect our environment and industries that depend upon clean       water.    Alan, thank you for writing to me. I agree with you. This rule makes  no scientific, legal, public health, or fiscal sense.   Another constituent, Dave from Rockford, shared with me similar  concerns. He wrote:         Clean water is not a political issue. Protecting our       watersheds and ensuring that clean, fresh water is available       for fish, farms and communities is not an option--it's a       responsibility.        I cannot think of a more enjoyable satisfaction [than] just       standing in a clean river, seeing all the life teaming in it,       and knowing that our hard work is paying off.    Dave is right. Streams and wetlands work as natural filters and  sponges, keeping our drinking water supplies safe, while reducing the  impact of floods.   Like our water, I am concerned by this administration's attacks on  clean air. One group that comes to mind that has been fighting for our  clean air is Mom's Clean Air Task Force. They are a group of moms who  know how painful it is when their child can't play outside because they  have asthma or there is smog outside. They are fighting for cleaner air  and stronger kids.   They list ten reasons they oppose Mr. Wheeler, and among those  reasons are his attacks on rules to control mercury pollution, to make  our cars more fuel efficient, and to reduce smog.   Mr. Wheeler's attacks on these priorities hits close to home for me.  Currently, the rate of asthma in Illinois is 13 percent higher than the  national average. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America ranks  Chicago in the top 10 percent of the most challenging places to live  with asthma. Asthma is hitting the frontline neighborhoods in Chicago  harder than in many other  [[Page S1526]]  places in the Nation, with asthma rates in some neighborhoods soaring  as high as 33 percent. As the climate gets hotter, air pollution,  allergies, and temperatures will trigger more asthma attacks in  children.   I want to end on a high note. I commend Mr. Wheeler for following  through on his promise to make himself accessible and to conduct  proactive outreach. Compared to Mr. Pruitt, he is an upgrade in terms  of professionalism, but that is an incredibly low bar.   At the end of the day, my constituents are depending on me to protect  them from pollution, even if it upsets some in industry. I believe we  need an Administrator who is ready to fight for our kids, to fight for  the Great Lakes, to fight for the civil servants that work at EPA, and  to fight for every American's right to clean air, clean water, and a  healthy environment. I believe EPA will achieve its mission when it  requires rigorous enforcement when human health is at stake.   Mr. Wheeler believes that public health must be balanced against the  health of corporations and industry interests who always want less  rules, less oversight, and certainly less enforcement. That is why I  must vote no.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
