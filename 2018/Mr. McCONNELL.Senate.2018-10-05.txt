 Madam President, it was 88 days ago that President  Trump announced his nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill the  current vacancy on the Supreme Court.   Judge Kavanaugh is a nominee of the very highest caliber, a brilliant  legal mind and an accomplished jurist with a proven devotion to the  rule of law. Today, the Senate has the opportunity to advance his  nomination. Every one of us will go on record with one of the most  consequential votes you ever cast in the Senate.   The stakes are always high for a Supreme Court nomination, but,  colleagues, the extraordinary events of recent weeks have raised them  even higher this time. When we vote later this morning, we will not  only be deciding whether to elevate a stunningly well-qualified judge  to our highest Court. Not anymore. Not after all this. The Senate will  also be making a statement.   We will either state that partisan politics can override the  presumption of innocence, or we will reaffirm that in the United States  of America, everyone is innocent until proven guilty.    We will either state that facts and evidence can simply be brushed  aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and  mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the Senate and that the  mob can attack and the Senate will cave, or we will stand up and say  that serious, thoughtful, fact-based deliberation will still define  this body.   We will either give notice that totally uncorroborated allegations  are now officially enough to destroy an American's life, or we will  declare that our society cannot, must not, will not set the bar so low.   Today is a pivotal day in the nomination process of this excellent  judge, but it is a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well. The  ideals of justice that have served our Nation so well for so long are  on full display.   So let's step back and sample a few of the choice moments that the  Senate and the American people have been treated to during the  disgraceful--absolutely disgraceful--spectacle of the last 2 weeks.   The very night Judge Kavanaugh was announced as the President's  choice, we heard the junior Senator from Oregon declare that this  nominee would ``pave the path to tyranny.'' His audience? Crowds of  far-left protesters, still filling in the blanks on their picket signs.  They weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yet.   We heard the junior Senator from New Jersey describe Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination as a great moral struggle in which there are  just two camps: ``You're either complicit in the evil . . . or you are  fighting against it.''   More recently, we heard the junior Senator from Hawaii argue that her  personal disagreement with Judge Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy  meant--now, listen to this--he deserved less of a presumption of  innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct. If you agree with  her, you are not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes  to allegations of misconduct. That is from a member of the Judiciary  Committee? That is the definition of ``due process''? Apparently, you  get due process only if you agree with her.   Even more recently, we saw the junior Senator from Rhode Island hold  forth with great confidence--great confidence--offering his expert  interpretations of goofy jokes in a high school yearbook from the early  1980s. That was incredibly enlightening. Innocent jokes? Beer-drinking  references? Oh, no. Our colleague was quite positive there must be some  other hidden or sinister meanings at play--until, of course, a number  of Judge Kavanaugh's classmates set him straight earlier this week.   So stop and consider these snapshots. The absurdity. The absurdity.  The indignity. This is our approach to confirming a Supreme Court  Justice? This is the Senate's contribution to public discourse?   Before the ink had dried on Justice Kennedy's retirement, our  Democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process would  be about: delay, obstruct, and resist.   Before the ink had dried on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, colleagues  across the aisle--including Democratic members of the Judiciary  Committee--were racing to announce they had made up their minds and  were totally opposed to his confirmation.   Mere hours after Judge Kavanaugh was nominated, my friend the  Democratic leader promised--``I will oppose him with everything I've  got,'' he said hours after he was nominated. It was thus abundantly  clear that his No. 1 political goal was to defeat the nomination by any  means necessary.   It was right there from the beginning, a clear declaration, plain as  day: Nothing--nothing--could get most  [[Page S6564]]  Democrats to consider this nominee with an open mind. It would be  delaying tactics, obstruction, and the so-called resistance until the  final vote was called.   For a few weeks, their efforts played out along the lines that have  sadly become somewhat ordinary around here. There were excuses for  delay. Those fell flat. There were gross distortions of Judge  Kavanaugh's record that were batted down by outside fact-checkers.  There were all the usual phony, apocalyptic pronouncements that are  shouted whenever a Republican President dares to nominate a Supreme  Court Justice. It happens every time. Hostile to women. Hostile to  vulnerable people. Hostile to workers. The same old tricks. The same  old playbook. But here was the problem: The old plays weren't working.  The distortions were being literally drowned out by the facts.   Senators received and reviewed more pages of background materials on  Judge Kavanaugh's nomination than for every previous Supreme Court  nomination combined. We read Judge Kavanaugh's 12-year record of  judicial rulings from our Nation's second highest court--300-plus  opinions. We heard sworn testimony and written accounts from hundreds  of character witnesses from all stages of Judge Kavanaugh's life and  career. The picture painted by these facts was nothing like the  caricature--nothing like the caricature.   So it was clear that the old tactics weren't working and weren't  going to get the job done. The resistance demanded more. Try something  new, they said. Well, we all know what happened next. Uncorroborated  allegations of the most sensitive, most serious sort were quickly  sharpened into political weapons.   One such allegation, shared by Dr. Ford in confidence with the  Democrat side of the Judiciary Committee, somehow mysteriously found  its way into the press. Chairman Grassley immediately set out on a  sober, focused search for the truth. The committee collected testimony,  organized a new hearing, and most recently asked for a supplemental FBI  background investigation, Judge Kavanaugh's seventh--seventh--FBI  investigation.   By any fair standard, the facts--the actual facts--proved to be  straightforward: no corroborating evidence. None--none--was produced to  support any of the allegations leveled against Judge Kavanaugh. There  was no corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiry or from anywhere  else. Nothing.   Well, that wasn't enough for our Democratic colleagues, of course.  The facts were not exactly the point. After all, we sort of get it by  now. When the very FBI investigation for which they had been clamoring  turned up no new evidence, the Democrats moved the goalposts yet again.   I believe the latest story is that the whole investigation is  invalid--listen to this--because individuals who had only recently been  told secondhand or thirdhand about nearly 40-year-old allegations  weren't treated as essential witnesses.   Let me say that again. The latest story is that the whole  investigation is invalid because individuals who had only recently been  told secondhand or thirdhand about nearly 40-year-old allegations  weren't treated as essential witnesses--never mind that they didn't  actually witness anything. They didn't witness anything.   So let's be clear. These are not witnesses. These are people  supposedly in possession of hearsay that they first heard 35 years  after the supposed fact. What nonsense.   The people whom Dr. Ford claimed were witnesses have spoken with the  FBI. We know that because they, through their attorneys, put out public  statements saying so. What we know now is what we knew at this time a  week ago: There is absolutely no corroborating evidence for these  allegations--the same thing we heard a week ago. If there were, you bet  we would have heard about it, but there isn't.    Notwithstanding that, the leak of Dr. Ford's letter--in violation of  her privacy and against her wishes--opened the floodgates. The feeding  frenzy was full-on. The weaponization of her letter by the left led to  a torrent of other, equally uncorroborated allegations. They were  dumped on Judge Kavanaugh and his family, and, breathlessly, the media  seized on them--the more outlandish, the better.   Americans were informed that Judge Kavanaugh masterminded violent  drug gangs as a young teenager, until that accuser walked her story  back. We were informed that Judge Kavanaugh beat someone up on a boat  in a Rhode Island harbor, until that accuser totally recanted. We heard  another tall tale of physical assault, until that account was  thoroughly debunked by a sitting Federal judge. Oh, and, yes, we were  informed that juvenile jokes in his high school yearbook were actually  sinister secret references.   Oh, the Keystone Kops were on the case, and Senate Democrats cheered  them on. They read parts of this uncorroborated, unbelievable mudslide  into the Senate Record. They cited them in an unofficial letter,  demanding that Judge Kavanaugh's nomination be withdrawn.   Were they true? That was quite beside the point, so long as they were  convenient. Every effort was made to ensure the fact-free verdict of  the mob and the media would win out over the actual evidence; make sure  the mob prevails. The uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the  physical intimidation of Members in the Senate will not have the final  say around here. The Senate will have the final say.   We are almost at the end of the runway. The crosswinds of anger and  fear and partisanship have blown strong these past weeks. They have  harmed a good man and his family. They have tarnished the dignity of  this institution, but all of it can end today. The time has come to  vote. The Senate stands on the threshold of a golden opportunity.   We have the opportunity to advance the nomination of an incredibly  well-qualified and well-respected jurist to a post that demands such  excellence. We have the opportunity to put Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the  Supreme Court, where his distinguished service will make us and our  Nation proud for years to come. We have the opportunity to do even  more.   Today, we can send a message to the American people that some core  principles remain unfettered by the partisan passions of this moment.  Facts matter. Fairness matters. The presumption of innocence is  sacrosanct. The Senate has turned its back on these things before but  never for long and never without deep regret.   This institution does not look back proudly on the era of Joseph  McCarthy nor on any of the other times when the politics of personal  destruction poisoned its judgment. No, the Senate looks back on those  things with shame and with the conviction that we cannot go down that  road again. We know the Senate is better than this. We know the Nation  deserves better than this.   By confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, this  brilliant jurist will be charged with upholding the rule of law and  honoring American justice. We must hold ourselves to that very same  standard. We must seize the golden opportunity before us today, to  confirm a Supreme Court Justice who will make us proud, and to reaffirm  our own commitment to the justice that every single American deserves.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Mr. President, in listening to the Senator from  Tennessee, I am reminded that he and I were here in those days as young  staffers. I was working for the Senator from Kentucky when Margaret  Chase Smith was still here. She had already made her reputation by  being the first Member of the U.S. Senate to take on Joseph McCarthy  and his tactics. It took the Senate a couple of years to finally  develop the courage to stand up to this demagogue and the tactics he  employed.   Those of us who are in the Chamber today have had a unique  opportunity to listen to a great statesman from Maine once again talk  about this institution and how it ought to treat matters like this and  to think about how we can rise above the depths to which we have sunk  during this process.   I want to thank the Senator from Maine. I have not heard a better  speech in my time here, and I have been here a while. It was absolutely  inspirational.    Mr. President, ``the Constitution of the United States  was made not merely for a generation that then existed, but for  posterity.''   Those are the words of Henry Clay, Kentucky's own. They underscore  that the decision U.S. Senators will make today will echo in the  history of our Nation.   The very survival of our constitutional form of government requires  an expert and independent judiciary. Without fair and impartial  ``courts of justice,'' as Alexander Hamilton put it in the Federalist  Papers, ``all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would  amount to nothing.''   The courts guard our rights and the Senate guards our courts. That is  why today is such an important day. That is why the vote we take this  afternoon--a vote to confirm a new Associate Justice of the Supreme  Court of the United States--represents one of the most consequential  decisions a Senator ever makes.   The Members of this body are duty bound to ensure we confirm Justices  of the Supreme Court who are men and women of the highest character and  the most superlative qualifications. Fortunately, that is just the sort  of nominee who stands before us today.   Twelve weeks ago, the President nominated a jurist who has been  described by legal peers of all political stripes as ``a superstar''  and a ``serious scholar'' who is ``legendary for his preparation'' and  possesses ``the qualifications, the temperament, and judicial  philosophy to be an excellent Associate Justice.''   The President nominated a brilliant student of the law. Those who  taught and knew the nominee at Yale say ``it is hard to name anyone  with judicial credentials as strong as Judge Kavanaugh.'' They describe  a ``true intellectual,'' ``a leading thinker,'' and a ``wonderful  mentor and teacher.''   Those he has mentored--a diverse group of bright young lawyers who  clerked for Judge Kavanaugh--talk about his work ethic, his  ``unflinchingly honest advice,'' and his ``fundamental humility.''   For 12 weeks, the Senate has seen that this is not empty praise. We  have seen the legendary preparation of a tireless judge. We have seen  the patience of a committed mentor and teacher. We have seen the  humility of a true intellectual who let his record speak for itself.   Each of us has seen this for ourselves. Every Senator who came into  this process with an open mind has seen that very same Brett Kavanaugh  firsthand.   We have seen his brilliance, his painstaking thoroughness on display  in the 300-plus opinions he issued on the DC Circuit. For 12 years,  Judge Kavanaugh excelled on the bench that many experts see as the  second most important court in our Nation.   We have seen his geniality and kindness firsthand in our private  meetings with the nominee--precisely the collegial approach that is so  necessary on the Court.   We have seen his professional excellence as we reviewed more pages of  documents pertaining to Judge Kavanaugh's career than for any other  Supreme Court nomination in our history--pages that depict a meticulous  and dedicated public servant. And, yes, we have now studied the results  of seven--seven--FBI background investigations--inquiries that have  produced no evidence whatsoever to corroborate any prior misconduct but  rather are consistent with all we know about this nominee's sterling  character.   This historically tall mountain of evidence adds up to one clear  message: Judge Brett Kavanaugh is among the very best our Nation has to  offer. He will make the Senate and the country proud. He will serve  with distinction on our highest Court.   He unquestionably deserves confirmation and the country deserves such  a Supreme Court Justice.   Now, as I have explained, the stakes are always high--always high-- where a Supreme Court confirmation is concerned, but this time--this  time--the stakes are higher--a lot higher than they have been in the  past.   I can't sum this up better than our friend and distinguished  colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, put it in her historic  remarks yesterday. This is  [[Page S6697]]  what the senior Senator from Maine said: ``It is when passions are most  inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy.'' She said, ``when passions  are most inflamed'' is when ``fairness is most in jeopardy.''   We all know that the events of recent weeks have strained the  country's comity and fanned the flames of partisan discord. But, even  more critically, our very commitment to the basic principles of  fairness and justice is also being tested. The basic principles of  fairness and justice are being tested right here.   A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh today is also a vote to send a  clear message about what the Senate is.   This is an institution where the evidence and the facts matter. This  is an institution where the evidence and the facts matter. This is a  Chamber in which the politics of intimidation and personal destruction  do not win the day.   This is the body whose Members themselves uphold the same commitment  to American justice that we seek in the judges we examine.   A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh today is a vote to end this brief,  dark chapter in the Senate's history and to turn the page toward a  brighter tomorrow.   The Chamber we are privileged to occupy is often called the world's  greatest deliberative body for good reason. We are called the world's  greatest deliberative body for a good reason. When the rubber meets the  road, when the hour is critical, when a historic precedent needs to be  set, the U.S. Senate most often finds its way to doing what is right.   Today, we can honor that history. We can vote to turn away from the  darkness. We can vote to set a precedent about fairness and judgment  that will define this body for the better. We can vote to confirm an  excellent Supreme Court Justice who will make the Senate and the  American people proud.   I yield the floor.   The VICE PRESIDENT.
