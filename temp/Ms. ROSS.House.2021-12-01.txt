 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Courthouse  Ethics and Transparency Act. This commonsense, bipartisan, bicameral  legislation would serve to fill a transparency void that plagues our  current Federal judicial system as recently exposed in a Wall Street  Journal series of reports.   According to these reports, 131 Federal judges broke the law by  hearing cases where they had a financial interest. From 2010 to 2018,  these judges failed to recuse themselves from 685 lawsuits involving  firms in which they or their families held stock, and today the number  could be much higher.                                time  1400    This failure has real-world repercussions for the American public and  American families.   Take, for example, Jacob and Jeanetta Springer. They were foreclosed  upon in 2018 after Jeanetta's ailing father missed one mortgage payment  3 months before his passing.   Upon inheriting the property, the Springers sought to challenge the  foreclosure in Federal court, believing they were behind on fewer  payments than the bank had claimed. The case was dismissed on the  recommendation of the magistrate judge and again on appeal. But the  Springers were soon notified by the court that their judge had  purchased the bank's stock before issuing the ruling.   As a result, their case was reopened and assigned to a different  judge. In frustration, Jacob Springer asked: ``How was I supposed to  know the judge owned the stock?''   The Springer family's experience demonstrates the importance of  ensuring both justice and the appearance of justice in our courtrooms.  The impression of impropriety threatens the trust litigants place in  judges to be impartial and disinterested arbiters of justice and the  very institutional legitimacy of our judiciary.   The Springer family's experience was not the first time a litigant  has had their faith in the promise of blind justice shaken by the lack  of transparency in our judiciary. But today, we can move toward making  it the last by passing the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act.   This bill will make Federal judges more accountable, transparent, and  ethical, and restore confidence in our Federal courts. The legislation  will ensure Federal judges face the same financial transaction  disclosure requirements as members of the legislative and executive  branches, eliminating an unwarranted transparency gap.   It also requires the online publication of judges' financial  disclosures on a publicly accessible database. This online database  will add another layer of protection from potential conflicts.   Litigants like the Springer family would be able to identify  conflicts sooner instead of solely relying on the ineffective recusal  processes that currently are in place. This bill does so without  compromising the safety of Federal judges or their families because it  incorporates existing confidentiality rules that enable judges to  redact sensitive information. The database will simply streamline  access to information already legally required to be available to the  public.   I want to thank Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler, Subcommittee  Chairman Johnson, cosponsor and Subcommittee Ranking Member Issa, and  Representative Chip Roy for working with me to introduce this crucial  legislation. We must restore trust in the American promise of free and  fair administration of justice in our courtrooms.   For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to  increase transparency and accountability in our courtrooms.
