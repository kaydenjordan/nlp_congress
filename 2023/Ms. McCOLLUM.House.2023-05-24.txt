 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 45 a  Congressional Review Act resolution that would overturn the pause on  federal student loan payments and block President Biden's student debt  relief plan.   This CRA resolution would abruptly force tens of millions of  borrowers into unplanned repayment and lead to thousands of dollars in  payments and interest being added back onto their loans. In the  aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with global inflation,  overturning the payment pause would prove disastrous for borrowers at a  time when they can least afford it.    According to the Student Borrower Protection Center*, more than 43  million borrowers continue to suffer under the crushing weight of $1.6  trillion of federal student debt. In Minnesota alone, the pause on  student loan repayments saved 641,004 borrowers $495 million. Thanks to  the pause, borrowers around the country have been able to accomplish  things that had previously been beyond reach-such as saving for  retirement, affording necessary medication, or simply having some  breathing room to make ends meet.    Additionally, overturning the payment pause would impact the over  156,000 public service workers nationwide who received student debt  cancellation through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. These  nurses, educators, first responders, and other public servants could  see their loans reinstated if these CRA efforts are realized.   Not only would this CRA resolution have a disastrous impact on  borrowers in the here and now, it would also preclude the government  from installing a repayment pause for borrowers in the future. We  cannot know what lies ahead, and we must be able to react and provide  borrowers with options should our country endure another pandemic,  economic downturn, or other catastrophic event.
