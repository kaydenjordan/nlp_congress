 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it shall  not be in order in the Senate to consider H.R. 1628 or any amendment  offered to H.R. 1628 unless the Director of the Congressional Budget  Office certifies that H.R. 1628 or any amendment offered to the bill  will not cause a single veteran to lose health insurance coverage as a  result of the bill's Medicaid cuts, potential loss of marketplace tax  credits for veterans, or removal of critical patient protections.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Mr. McCONNELL. I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Pennsylvania.
