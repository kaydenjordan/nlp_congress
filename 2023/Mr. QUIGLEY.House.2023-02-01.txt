 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about what has been  and should always be a bipartisan issue, raising our Nation's debt  ceiling.   Raising America's debt ceiling ensures we do not default on our  financial obligations to those we have borrowed from and prevents  economic catastrophe in the process. Don't take my word for it.   Listen to American businesses, economists, and financial institutions  who know the drastic consequences a debt default would have for the  U.S. economy and working Americans.   The business roundtable, which represents the CEOs of some of the  Nation's largest companies, has said about raising the debt limit:  ``Failure to lift the Federal debt limit to meet U.S. obligations would  produce an otherwise avoidable crisis and pose an unacceptable risk to  the Nation's economic growth, job creation and financial markets.''   If you don't want to take their word for it, I recommend heeding  these words:   ``The full consequences of a default--or even the serious prospect of  a default--by the United States are impossible to predict and awesome  to contemplate.'' Those are the words of President Ronald Reagan.                            ____________________
