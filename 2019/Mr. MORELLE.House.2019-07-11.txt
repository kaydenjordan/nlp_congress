 Mr. Speaker, my district in Rochester, New York, has the  second-highest rate of childhood poverty in America.   Children in poverty face overwhelming barriers to academic success  because it is impossible for them to learn when they are hungry or  suffering from family trauma. These barriers are exacerbated in the  summer when children lose access to educational opportunities, causing  them to fall further and further behind academically.   Low-income children lose 2 or more months of reading achievement  every  [[Page H5594]]  summer. By the fifth grade, children without summer learning  opportunities are 2 years behind their peers.   Students need a safe, stable place to learn over the summer. That is  why I am so proud to have introduced legislation to help close the  achievement gap and reduce food insecurity.   The Summer Meals and Learning Act will help fund summer reading  programs at schools that already serve as summer meal sites, providing  the support and stability at-risk youth need to grow and thrive. Every  child deserves the opportunity to achieve their goals. It is my hope  that this legislation will help students stay on the path to success.                            ____________________
