 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that the House immediately bring the  Debbie Smith Act up for consideration before the program expires later  this month. As a former prosecutor in Virginia, I know all too well how  critical DNA evidence is for achieving justice for victims of sexual  violence.   Debbie Smith's courage to share her story with the world has changed  the  [[Page H7918]]  lives of millions, and no person should ever have to experience her  trauma firsthand. Thanks to this program, incredible progress has been  made to reduce DNA backlogs, and we cannot take a step backward by  allowing it to lapse. The importance of DNA evidence in criminal  investigations and prosecutions is unquestionable. In my home State of  Virginia, the FBI's National DNA Index contains more than 447,000  offender profiles and has aided in over 11,000 criminal investigations.   This program has been reauthorized previously with bipartisan  support, and there is no excuse for it to be politicized now. S. 820  has been languishing in the Judiciary Committee for months. This  failure to act enables violent criminals to remain at large and in our  society.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker to bring this bill to the floor and  put it up for a vote so we can protect people from violent sexual  predators and allow justice to be served through our legal system.
