 Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago yesterday, the Affordable Care  Act, or ObamaCare, became law. Since then, this law has resulted in  canceled plans, higher premiums, fewer choices, increased deductibles,  and less freedom for the American people.   Don't just take my word for it. Former Democratic President Bill  Clinton said this about ObamaCare:   `` . . . the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours  a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in  half, and it's the craziest thing in the world.''   I tend to agree with President Clinton on this. ObamaCare is crazy.  But for far too many Americans, it is the crazy reality they face every  day.   So today is about a rescue mission. Today is about bringing relief to  the families who are struggling under this failed law. Today it is  about passing the American Health Care Act.   ObamaCare is on a collision course with disaster. If Congress were to  sit back and do nothing, ObamaCare would implode. This would leave  millions of Americans with no insurance and the overall insurance  market in a dangerous condition for the rest of us. So Congress must  act.   That is where the American Health Care Act comes into play. This bill  repeals ObamaCare along with its costly taxes and burdensome mandates.  By doing this, we can lower premiums for hardworking Americans.   Most importantly, this bill gives Americans the freedoms, choices,  and control they desperately want and deserve.   So, Mr. Speaker, the vote today is for the family in Monroeville who  can't afford their premiums. The vote is for the small-business owner  in Daphne who had his plan canceled. The vote is for the mother in  Mobile whose deductible is too high. The vote is for the people in  southwest Alabama and across all of America who are struggling under  ObamaCare.   This is our chance. This is the bill. We have got to get this done.
