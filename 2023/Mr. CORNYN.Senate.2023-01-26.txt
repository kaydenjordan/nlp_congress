 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, January is National Human Trafficking  Prevention Month, and it is a great opportunity to improve awareness  about the scourge of human trafficking and redouble our efforts to end  it.   Throughout my career, I have worked with law enforcement, nonprofits,  and advocates of all stripes to try to crack down on human trafficking  and strengthen support for human trafficking survivors. These experts  have helped me identify steps that we together can take in Congress to  end modern slavery.   I am proud that one of those bills was signed into law earlier this  month. The Abolish Trafficking Reauthorization Act, which I introduced  with Senator Klobuchar, the Senator from Minnesota, is officially the  law of the land. This law extends critical support to survivors of  human trafficking, provides resources for law, funds prevention  research, and promotes increased reporting to prevent human  trafficking. It is a step in the right direction in our fight to end  modern slavery, and I was glad to discuss the importance of this law  with advocates and experts in Texas just a couple of weeks ago.   On January 11, National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, I had the  pleasure of sitting down with some remarkable people in Dallas who are  leading the fight. We gathered at the Letot Residential Treatment  Center, which provides a full range of services to human trafficking  survivors, specifically girls between the age of 13 and 17. Letot  offers safe shelter, which I have learned is perhaps the most important  thing, a safe place for these survivors to actually live. But it also  provides education, job training, and mental healthcare to these young  victims to help them find a clear path forward one day at a time.   I had visited the same facility a few years ago to learn about the  work they do, and I was encouraged to note their continued impact in  Dallas County, one of our largest counties in Texas.   I also learned about the dedicated work of New Friends New Life,  which helps exploited girls, women, and their children to rebuild their  lives and to move forward toward a brighter future. The organization  also promotes a men's advocacy group, which raises awareness and  mobilizes men to take action against sex trafficking and exploitation.   In addition to learning more about the impact of these organizations,  I was able to hear from local law enforcement, including Dallas  District Attorney John Creuzot. John noted that Texas is No. 2 in the  Nation when it comes to human trafficking and added that Dallas is a  major hotspot because it is at the crossroads of so many interstate  freeways.   Rescuing victims of human trafficking, disrupting trafficking  operations, and pursuing justice is a major focus for law enforcement.  For sex trafficking in particular, they are working with groups like  Traffick911 to free young people from this terrible life. I am blown  away by the incredible work being done in North Texas to support  survivors and ensure justice is served. What I heard from these  survivors really underscored how critical these efforts are.   One of the women I heard from was Dr. Tanya Stafford, an inspiring  and passionate advocate for survivors of human trafficking. Tanya told  us she was only 13 when her mother sold her to a man for drugs. You  heard that right. When she was 13 years old, her own mother sold her to  a man for drugs. Then, for 10 years, she was hidden in plain sight  until, finally, a neighbor intervened. As Tanya put it, ``she saw  something, she said something, and she did something.''   Every single day, concerned neighbors and friends call tip lines and  help victims like Tanya escape from human trafficking. Incredible  organizations like Letot Residential Treatment Center and New Friends  New Life help these victims of human trafficking rebuild their lives.  Law enforcement and groups like Traffick911 help to free victims from  human trafficking.   The brave survivors are what have impressed me most of all. To have  these survivors talk about their own personal story, with all of the  potential for embarrassment that suggests, speaks to me to the courage  of these survivors, who are willing to use their own personal example  to help save others from a similar fate.   It was inspiring to hear them talk about overcoming the incredible  trauma and adversity. Their stories are a reminder of why it is so  important for us to continue this fight, and that includes everything  from awareness and education to legislating here in Congress. There is  no better time than Human Trafficking Prevention Month to build on  these efforts.   I want to thank the experts, the advocates, and the survivors, as  well as all of our Senate and congressional colleagues who are leading  on this fight.                       Respect for Child Survivors Act    Madam President, the day after my conversation in Dallas, I traveled  to Houston, another one of our major metropolitan areas, to discuss a  new law that will have a big impact on child sexual abuse victims. The  seed for this legislation was first planted in September 2021, when the  Senate Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on the repeated  failures of the FBI's investigation into the Larry Nassar case.   U.S. gymnasts delivered powerful testimony about the FBI's  mishandling of their investigation and inspired a bipartisan push to  fix the broken process that failed them and countless other victims.   Again, Senator Klobuchar and I worked with law enforcement, victims'  rights groups, and all our colleagues here in the Senate to identify  reforms that would actually make a difference. Those discussions  eventually led to the Respect for Child Survivors Act, which was signed  into law earlier this month. This law mandates the use of multiple  disciplinary teams, or MDTs, in FBI interviews with child victims.   Just by way of footnote, most of these kinds of cases are  investigated at the local or State level, and, frankly, most local  level law enforcement have worked with the child advocacy centers  around Texas and around the country to try to minimize the repetition  of the trauma on these child victims and to help preserve testimony  needed to convict their abuser. But the FBI has a much bigger portfolio  and, generally, is not trained in how to deal with these victims of  sexual assault, particularly child victims. Now this new law mandates  training for the FBI.   These MDTs, the multiple disciplinary teams, that they will now work  with, include mental health and medical professionals, caseworkers, and  other individuals who advocate for a child's well-being. The primary  goal, of course, is to protect these young victims and ensure that they  are not retraumatized during the investigation, which is going to be  intrusive by its very nature.   There is a mountain of evidence, thank goodness, that this approach  actually works. During the discussion in Houston, I sat down with a  full range of  [[Page S111]]  experts on this topic at the Children's Assessment Center, which is a  pioneer in the successful use of MDTs. For more than 30 years, it has  cared for sexually abused children and, in the process, established the  gold standard for the right way to protect victims of child sexual  abuse.   The folks I spoke with and listened to that day stressed the  importance of this approach. For example, Houston Police Lieutenant  John Colburn said that the partnership between law enforcement and the  Children's Assessment Center makes a ``tremendous difference.'' He said  that children are able to share their experiences in a more comfortable  way, and law enforcement can take peace in the knowledge that these  incredibly difficult conversations are happening with trauma-informed  experts who are equipped to handle them properly.   That is why this legislation is important.   One of the individuals we heard from was Rebecca Whitehurst, a former  U.S.A. gymnast and one of the hundreds of survivors of the Larry Nassar  episode.   She said:         It is deeply gratifying to know that you have listened to       our voices and learned from our experience to ensure that       systems improve and that justice is served.    Rebecca concluded her comments by saying:         Children should be totally protected from those who [would]       harm them, and those who [would] fail them should be held       accountable.    I couldn't say it better myself.   With this new law on the books, I am confident that the FBI will be  better prepared to handle similar investigations in the future with  compassion and efficiency and ultimately bring perpetrators to justice.   This was all possible because of the brave gymnasts who testified  before the Senate Judiciary Committee a year and a half ago. They  showed tremendous courage by speaking out, by talking about personal,  intimate matters that were necessarily embarrassing to them, but they  overcame that, knowing that they could well make a difference for some  future gymnast or some other child sexual assault victim in the future.  I hope they will take some comfort in knowing that their stories  brought about this change.   We need to ensure that the FBI's mistreatment of these victims and  their reports is not repeated in the future, and this law will help  make sure that goal is accomplished.   Like so many of us--we learn from our constituents. We learn from men  and women who take the time to share their experiences with us, and I  am grateful to those who did so in Dallas and Houston and, again,  especially the survivors. They are doing incredible work to root out  human trafficking and support survivors and ensure that justice is  served.   I am proud of what we were able to accomplish last Congress to  strengthen their efforts, but there is still more work for us to do. I  appreciate all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and both  sides of the Capitol who have worked together on these efforts in the  past, and I am eager to accomplish even more this Congress.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
