 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here as a member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee, and I rise, as we all know, during one  of the most challenging moments in the history of our country and, I  would say, the world.   Americans are hurting, and families are suffering. The calls that are  coming to my office, and I am sure to yours, too, are just  heartbreaking.   But today, we will pass a bill that will provide critical relief to  begin the healing in our communities. Despite, I have to say, the  failure of leadership from our President, Congress has, in fact,  stepped up.   Thanks to the unity of House and Senate Democrats, we pushed the  initial Republican proposal from corporate-first to families-and- workers-first.   We fought for and won a $100 billion investment in hospitals and  healthcare systems for our doctors and nurses on the front line  fighting the coronavirus, often without the equipment that they need.   I am imploring the President to fully invoke the Defense Production  Act so that our frontline workers will have the protective gear that  they need and right now are not getting.   The CARES Act will also provide double the unemployment insurance  benefits that Republicans initially proposed. This will help countless  restaurant workers and small business employees who call my office and  say: ``We need help.''   Thanks to Democrats, the small business owners in my district will  now be able to make payroll, with their mortgages and utility costs  eligible for Small Business Administration loan forgiveness.   Sadly, this bill isn't all that it could be. I am deeply disturbed  that my Republican colleagues are trying to exclude local Planned  Parenthood clinics from this small business financing, especially since  they are helping people every single day to be able to get the  healthcare they need.   I am also really disappointed that they took this opportunity to  irrelevantly add to this the Hyde amendment.   I especially want to take the time to thank the people who are  working today, and I am glad to be here among you doing just that. But  we are seeing people who are outside here, the Capitol Police, the  people who are helping to clean our environment, the people who are now  working at jobs like the people in my grocery store, the Jewel Food  Store in my neighborhood, the people who are bagging my groceries, who  are loading my shelves, who are  [[Page H1829]]  taking my money in order to buy the food that all the people in my  community need. They are risking their lives, too, and deserve the  thanks.   I want to thank my Governor, Governor J. B. Pritzker, who has  actually created a response fund that will put money into community  organizations and not-for-profits that can help people who aren't  covered here, who need to be covered in the next bill. I am talking  about immigrants and undocumented people.                                time  1040
