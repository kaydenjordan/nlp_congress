 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the committee and the  [[Page H3445]]  ranking member for their strong work in crafting this national defense  authorization bill. I am always proud to support the defense of this  Nation and the airmen and women at Little Rock Air Force base and the  members of the Arkansas National Guard.   This legislation comes at an important time. It protects us and our  allied interests from a rapidly expanding China and from increasing  Iranian and Russian influence in the Middle East.   While we continue to do our focus on Russia's illegal invasion of  Ukraine, countering the Chinese Communists, we must not lose focus on  our strategic interests and our allies in the Middle East and our  continued fight against a toxic mix of radical ISIS, al-Qaida, and Shia  militia that are threatening the communities of the Gulf and our  military assets. I am delighted that my amendment countering the  Iranian assaults on our military was ruled in order.   I thank Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Smith for this important  work on this legislation and our 63rd annual successful year in  supporting our military strategy and our troops.
