 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 2023 School  Librarian of the Year, Wake County's own Julie Stivers.   At the Mount Vernon Middle School, she is the librarian and has  worked to create an environment where students not only learn and  thrive, but also where they can express their creativity and see their  identities and interests represented in literature.   Outside her library, a sign boldly reads: ``In This Library, We Don't  Shush, We Roar.''   Children's socioeconomic status should not determine their  opportunities to learn, which is exactly why the library holds two book  fairs a year where students can choose new books at no cost.   As others have worked to ban books from schools across the country,  Julie has fought against harmful proposals that will ban LGBTQ+ books  in Wake County.   Julie cultivates a welcoming space to ensure her students feel at  home.   Congratulations on this well-deserved achievement.                            ____________________
