 Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate the service of  Brigadier General William ``Robbie'' Robertson on his retirement from  the Illinois Air National Guard.   A Peoria native, General Robertson served 41 years in the Armed  Forces, much of it as a member of Peoria's 182nd Airlift Wing of the  Illinois National Guard. He served in various capacities as a security  policeman, a pilot, a forward air controller, chief of operations, wing  commander, and chief of staff for the Illinois Air National Guard.   General Robertson was integral in making the 182nd one of the best C- 130 units in the country. During General Robertson's time at the 182nd,  the unit earned five Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards, and nine times  reached the highest C-130 Hercules mission capable rates in Air  Mobility Command.   General Robertson is known throughout the Peoria community for his  steady leadership and integrity. He is beloved by those who worked with  him and know him.   I want to thank him for his service to our country and to our  community and wish him well in his retirement.                            ____________________
