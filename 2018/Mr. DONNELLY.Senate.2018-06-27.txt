 Mr. President, I am here to talk about the bipartisan,  commonsense farm bill that we are working on in the Senate this week.   Agriculture is an essential part of the fabric that defines my home  State of Indiana. Hoosier farmers are growing the food that feeds our  families. Biofuel producers are making the ethanol and biodiesel that  drive our economy. Ag students and researchers are developing the  technologies of tomorrow. Together, they represent the best of Hoosier  values.   Right now, Hoosiers farmers in our communities are navigating  significant challenges. They need us to work together to help provide  solutions. Our farmers are dealing with turmoil on the international  marketplace, uncertainty in Federal policies, like the RFS, and low  commodity prices that, in many cases, are below the cost of production.  This farm bill can provide our ag community with some stability, and we  need to ensure that we do our part to get it across the finish line.   Here is how Indiana Farm Bureau president Randy Kron described the  situation:         Farmers are relying on the Senate to pass a farm bill that       will allow them to plan for their operations with some level       of certainty for the next five years and provide a safety net       in case extreme weather or a natural disaster damages their       crops. Indiana's farmers are facing a lot of uncertainties       right now.        The dairy industry is facing low prices and lost contracts,       there are fears over potential retaliatory tariffs and their       impacts, there is a grain surplus that has brought commodity       prices down drastically as well as the uncertainty of the       Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).        Net farm income is down more than 50% compared to just five       years ago, and the agriculture community is depending on the       passage of this farm bill.        If our nation's farmers have the programs and assurances       they need, all U.S. citizens will reap the benefit of       quality, affordable food in our grocery stores.    Phil Ramsey, a corn and soybean farmer from Shelbyville, IN, and the  chairman of membership and policy for the Indiana Soybean Alliance,  described the challenges farmers are facing by saying:         After a spring that has challenged our farms from nearly       every angle, Hoosiers and rural Americans need a Farm Bill       now more than ever. With farm income down . . . input costs       skyrocketing, the ethanol industry constantly under attack,       and disrupted trade relations sharply driving down prices,       the stability and safety net provided by the Farm Bill are       critical to our farmers and ranchers across the nation.    Randy and Phil are right. Now, more than ever, farmers need us to do  our job, to put together a farm bill that makes sense and gives them  the opportunity to succeed.   A farm bill that gives us the best opportunities to be successful  will help farmers manage the risks outside of their control, but it is  about much more than that. It is also about helping rural communities  thrive and also about fighting food insecurity. It is about investing  in tomorrow's farms and the most advanced technologies. It is about  ensuring that Hoosiers have the resources and the tools to develop new  markets for their products anywhere in the world. It is about promoting  conversation so that farms and natural habitats remain healthy,  generation after generation, and doing the conservation work to make  that possible.   Because there is more wisdom in Indiana than in Washington, DC, I  firmly believe a good farm bill is one that is written with input  directly from Hoosiers and that addresses issues important to our  State. From Wayne County to Evansville to Washington, IN, to DeKalb  County, to Jasper County, to Rensselaer, across our State there are  great ideas, great leadership, and great entrepreneurial skills that  can help us build the best farm bill possible. That is why I took every  opportunity to listen to the priorities and concerns of Hoosiers who  are involved in nearly every segment of our State's agriculture  community during my farm bill listening tour and in meetings over the  past year-plus. From student groups and researchers to anti-hunger  advocates, to soybean and corn growers, to pork and dairy farmers, and  to just about everyone in between, I wanted to hear from all of them  about what this farm bill should do.   I am not hired help for the people of Indiana. I work for all of our  citizens. I took what I heard from Hoosiers, and I worked with my  colleagues to develop this bill, to work this bill, and to successfully  secure provisions that would include risk management tools for our  farmers, while still ensuring full planting flexibility; to expand  market opportunities for Hoosiers products; to  [[Page S4484]]  promote impactful, voluntary conservation activities; to help fight the  opioid epidemic, which is a scourge on our State and our country; to  support rural communities with investments in high-speed internet and  waste and drinking-water infrastructure; to fight against food  insecurity; and to invest in the research necessary for tomorrow's  technologies.   I would like to highlight a few of the Hoosiers priorities in this  bill. One of my top priorities was helping to fight the opioid epidemic  in rural communities. We know it will take all of us, working together,  to confront this opioid epidemic--this horrible nightmare that we have.  We have more work to do to stem the tide of this public health crisis  in our rural communities.   I am pleased this bill includes three of my bipartisan provisions  that combat the opioid epidemic by targeting telemedicine and community  facility investments for substance abuse treatment as well as by  investing in prevention and education programs. We want all of our  families to be safe. We want all of our citizens across this country to  avoid this scourge. We lost over 60,000 of our fellow brothers and  sisters across this country to drug abuse last year. We do not want to  lose one more, and we want this farm bill to help end this.   These provisions I have discussed were developed from my bipartisan  rural opioids package I introduced with my friend, Chairman Pat  Roberts, then-Senator Strange, and with Senator John Hoeven from North  Dakota in 2017. I thank all of them for partnering with me on these  efforts.   I have also advocated for efforts to ensure that farmers are provided  the tools they need to be good stewards for our environment, to hand  off to our children and grandchildren, and an even safer, better,  stronger planet.   This bill will eliminate potential disincentives for voluntary  conservation practices like cover crops and supports soil health  improvement programs.   It also allows States to increase cost sharing for the most impactful  conservation practices. Soil health and clean water are a passion for  many Hoosiers, and for many Hoosier farmers, and this bill helps in  those efforts. The need to expand market opportunities has also come up  in my conversations with our farmers. I am fully committed to expanding  market opportunities for our ag products.   This farm bill will increase opportunities for Hoosier farmers  through export promotion programs. I worked with my colleagues on  proposals to open up more markets for American exports, including my  bipartisan bill that increases investments in two important export  promotion programs: the Foreign Market Development Program and the  Market Assistance Program. This is legislation I introduced in  September of 2017 with my friends and Senators Joni Ernst of Iowa,  Angus King of Maine, and Susan Collins of Maine.   I have also worked to ensure full planting flexibility for our  farmers who want to plant fruits and vegetables. This ensures that  farmers can diversify their farms without worrying about losing access  to commodity support programs in the future. It may sound a little bit  technical, but it is critically important, and we have to make sure it  gets done.   Ensuring planting flexibility is a strong passion of mine. It builds  on the bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Todd Young, my  colleague from our home State, in December of 2017, and it also builds  on my work in the 2014 and the 2008 farm bill.   Another important issue I care deeply about is helping those  struggling with food insecurity. I am really proud that this bipartisan  bill strengthens the oversight of the SNAP program and helps to fight  food insecurity by reforming food assistance programs while protecting  access to benefits and maintaining the integrity of the programs. It  makes it easier for seniors to access food assistance by reducing  burdensome paperwork. This is based on legislation I worked on with my  friend Bob Casey from Pennsylvania.   Providing for the future of agriculture by making the investments in  vital research and extension activities is another priority. This bill  contains a provision of mine that reauthorizes and revamps the New Era  Rural Technology Program to help our community colleges fund efforts to  develop a workforce trained in the precision agriculture technologies  that are expected to continue to improve the efficiency of modern  farming.   I have a few more amendments I am hoping we can get adopted this  week, including one that increases funding for the Emergency Food  Assistance Program. This helps food banks and pantries respond to the  needs of their local communities.   I have also introduced a bipartisan amendment with Senators Smith and  Fischer. It allows community colleges serving rural areas to receive  funding through USDA's Essential Community Facilities Program. This  helps ensure rural communities have the local educational opportunities  that can help our children thrive, that can help our friends and  neighbors thrive, and that can help create success in every county in  my State and across our country.   Finally, I thank all of my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture  Committee for their efforts to ensure that we had strong bipartisan  support for getting the farm bill to this point. Everybody worked  incredibly hard; everybody focused on doing what was right for America  and not worrying about politics; and everybody focused on how we can  help our ag community be stronger, have more success, and do even  better in the future.   Our farmers need us to continue working together as advocates for  agriculture and for a farm bill that supports their hard work.   The ag community gets up in the dark, works all day, and goes home in  the dark. They are an incredible example for everybody in our country  about dedication to family and faith and community and country.   I know the farmers of Indiana and in Hoosier rural communities are  tired of being pawns to partisan politics. They have been dealing with  depressed commodity prices, chaotic trade markets, and the uncertainty  of Federal policies, whether it was the previous administration's  expansion of the WOTUS rule or this administration's efforts to  undermine the RFS.   It is time for us to do our part to make sure this is a strong  bipartisan bill and that it is an example of us working together--not  as Democrats or as Republicans but as Americans--to do good things for  our economy and for our people.   I urge the Senate to promptly pass this bill so we can conference  with the House and get this to the President's desk as quickly as  possible. Farmers and rural communities in Indiana and across our  country are counting on us. It is an incredible privilege to represent  our ag community on the Agriculture Committee and to work with the farm  bill to make the lives of everybody in our farming communities better,  stronger, and even more successful.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
