 Madam Speaker, we know that President  Trump withheld needed military aid to Ukraine. We know that he used it  to demand Ukraine interfere in the 2020 election for his own benefit,  and we know that Ukraine knew. None of these facts have been disputed.  Instead, the White House has tried to hide the truth. But the President  is not above the law. Nobody is.   Corruption and obstruction; the President is guilty of both. The  blatant abuse of power was made clear from over 100 hours of testimony  before three committees and was clear in the call summary released by  the White House. The obstruction has been made clear by the President's  refusal to cooperate at every turn, even when ordered by a court.   Setting a precedent that any President can abuse their power to  interfere in our elections is an existential threat to our democracy.  It is also a betrayal of the oath of office and the Constitution.   Therefore, in fulfillment of my own oath of office, it is with solemn  purpose today that I vote to impeach President Donald Trump.
