 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Guthrie for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 382, the Pandemic is Over Act.  As Representatives of the American people, we owe it to them to assess  our country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and look to better  prepare for future pandemics. Most importantly, the American people  deserve honesty and normalcy.   The pandemic is over. Even President Biden said as much last  September. That level of honesty from the President is a step in the  right direction, but after the President publicly declared the pandemic  over, he extended the public health emergency not just once, but two  more times. Today marks 3 years since the original public health  emergency declaration.   Our country has been through a lot in the last 3 years but it is time  to get back to normal. It is time to give power back to the people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 382.
