 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor John Arthur, Sr.,  a beloved San Fernando Valley leader whom we lost earlier this year.  Pops, as many of his students called him, was known by Men's Journal  Magazine as the toughest man in America.   Born in Starkville, Mississippi, Pops attended Clark Atlanta  University with an athletic scholarship. He met the love of his life,  Jeraldine, and they had a beautiful daughter, Jonvette. He worked as an  underground bare-knuckle fighter with a black belt in various martial  arts. He also worked as an undercover FBI agent and had various public  safety roles.   After the passing of his wife, Pops moved to southern California with  his beautiful daughter. There, he worked as a trainer with fitness  personality Billy Blanks and trained various world champion fighters  such as James Toney.   However, after a vibrant career training some of the world's most  recognizable names, Pops found his true calling when he began coaching  at-risk youth for free. He impacted countless families in our community  by training their little children about life--not about fighting, but  about life.   Pops dedicated his life to helping others and creating champions. A  legend himself, Pops was truly a force of good in our community and in  our world. For many reasons, I honor the life of the toughest man in  America, John ``Pops'' Arthur.                    United States Remains a Beacon of Hope     Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to  speak before the House, and it is an honor to be a Member of this  prestigious body. With that, I would like to take the opportunity to  explain and exclaim how our hearts in America go out to the people of  Ukraine as they fear for their lives and they flee this tragedy that is  caused by Russia and Vladimir Putin.   It is unfortunate that there are many people around the world right  now as we speak who have, unfortunately, had to flee their country,  flee their homes, in fear of people like Vladimir Putin and others who  create atrocities on them, their communities, and their country.   I want to just remind everybody that the United States of America  continues to be the beacon of hope, light, and life for everyone who  needs to seek asylum. There are opportunities for us and many, many  great countries around the world to embrace these people who are  fleeing these unspeakable horrors.   It is very important for us to understand that we are great when our  arms are open. We are great when we receive those who are less  fortunate. We are great, and our greatness comes from so many of us who  come from families who fled their country, who left atrocities so that  they can have a new life for them, but more importantly, for the next  generation, the next, and the next.   Once again, the United States of America shall always remain the  place where people can seek refuge when they are fleeing atrocities  like we are witnessing in Ukraine and other parts of the world.                            ____________________
