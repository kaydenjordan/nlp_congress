 I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for yielding, for  hosting this Special Order, and for granting me this opportunity to  speak.   Since the first nomination was announced by President-elect Trump's  transition team, phones in my office have been ringing off the hook;  and not a day goes by when I do not hear from my neighbors, friends,  and constituents of their angst, frustration, and discontent. I share  their anger and dread--that feeling of being punched in the gut--as  name after name has been released. Each nomination from President-elect  Trump has put the fox in charge of the henhouse.  [[Page H463]]    We are not talking about simple differences in partisan ideology. We  are talking about nominees who have devoted much of their professional  lives to undermining the small-d democratic institutions that are the  foundation of our country. This new administration is so extreme that  we cannot, in any good faith, give this President-elect the traditional  deference to name a cabinet that represents his governing philosophy  because the appointments show it to be a philosophy that seeks to  corrupt, if not fully destroy, our institutions, traditions, and  values.   Senator Jeff Sessions, the nominee for Attorney General, was  considered too racist to serve on the Federal bench by a Republican  Senate, much less to head the Justice Department, and is someone who  has so little respect for women's rights he voted against the Violence  Against Women Act and called Roe v. Wade a colossal mistake.   Ben Carson, the nominee for HUD Secretary, said today in his  confirmation hearing that he was against protecting LGBT Americans from  housing discrimination because protecting them from housing  discrimination would be granting them extra rights, refusing to  recognize that LGBT Americans deserve equal rights.   Tom Price, the nominee for HHS Secretary, wants to eliminate Medicare  and Medicaid as we know them, repeal the Affordable Care Act without a  second thought for the millions of Americans who would lose coverage or  would be subject to limits on preexisting conditions and would be  subject to lifetime and annual limits, and has so little understanding  of women's health that he insisted that not a single woman would lose  access to contraception if contraception coverage were eliminated.   Betsy DeVos, the nominee for Education Secretary, advocated for years  to move taxpayer dollars away from public schools and towards for- profit, private schools that would leave behind low-income students,  minority students, and children with disabilities.   Scott Pruitt, the nominee for EPA administrator, does not believe in  climate change and is so linked to the fossil fuel industry that he has  sued the EPA a dozen times to block environmental regulations designed  to protect us from the effects of climate change.   The list goes on and on, each more horrifying than the one before.  These are not the values the majority of Americans voted for in  November, and I don't just mean because Hillary Clinton won the popular  vote by 3 million. I cannot imagine that the voters who wanted to drain  the swamp and voted for Mr. Trump for that purpose and have the needs  of working people represented are thrilled to see him name the  wealthiest cabinet--with the greatest collection of Wall Street  insiders--in American history.   The fact is, President-elect Trump and the Republican Party do not  have any mandate from the people to carry out the dystopian horror show  this cabinet presents. Rather than rubber stamping the most extreme  cabinet I have seen in my 25 years in Washington, the Senate should  reject these extreme nominees, and then both Houses should do their  constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the administration.   I am ready to do that work. Over a month ago, along with my  Democratic Judiciary Committee colleagues, I sent a letter to Chairman  Goodlatte asking him to hold hearings on the conflict of interest and  ethics provisions that apply to the President of the United States. I  have not heard a response. Every Democrat in this House signed on to  the Protect Our Democracy Act, legislation to create an independent,  bipartisan-appointed commission to investigate Russian hacking in the  2016 election and to make recommendations to ensure nothing like that  happens again. It is interesting that not a single House Republican has  joined us.    I join my constituents and millions of Americans in wanting to know  why Republicans are working so hard to protect President-elect Trump  from having to answer questions about Russian influence in this  election. Why are Republicans working so hard to support President- elect Trump's extreme and out-of-touch cabinet? Why aren't Republicans  asking the same questions about how President-elect Trump will avoid  conflicts of interest?   I have served in this body for nearly 25 years. I have seen this body  take on the big questions of our time--the role of government in the  lives of everyday Americans, the threat of terrorism in the city I call  home and around the country, the right of every American to marry  whomever they love, the right of every American to vote free of  intimidation, and the right of every American to make their own  healthcare choices. I have seen us come through those battles bruised  and battered but stronger.   That is why I refuse to despair. I refuse to put my head down and  hide. I refuse to give up on America. I will stand here and fight for  the country we all believe in. I will do everything in my power to  represent the strong progressive values of the men and women who sent  me here.   I will work with my colleagues here in the House and the Senate to  stand united against any effort to undermine the rights we have fought  so hard to achieve, whether it comes from the other end of the world or  the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.   But if there is to be any check on this administration, congressional  Republicans will need to join in that fight, and it starts with  rejecting the shameful slate of nominees.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank my colleague for sharing his insights  and his experience with us. We have a lot of work to do, and we are  ready to do it.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to those that my colleague has mentioned, I  would like to bring attention to some of the other nominees that we  should be considering here.                                time  1930    We haven't mentioned the Department of Energy and the nominee,  Governor Rick Perry, who disregarded this agency so much that he  couldn't even remember that he wanted to eliminate it when he was  running for President, or even Linda McMahon, who is the wife of a  billionaire. It seems to me that this litany of nominees belongs to the  millionaire-billionaire club. They know each other well, and the one  thing that they are committed to is ensuring that their interests and  the interests of this President-elect, in his private life, are  advanced. I think that the people in this country need to understand  how troublesome this is.   I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke), the co-chair  of the Caucus on Black Women and Girls and a fighter for the rights of  all working families and all vulnerable families.   Ms. CLARKE of New York. I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs.  Watson Coleman).   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Betsy DeVos as  Secretary of Education.   I know that my colleagues have been talking about their concerns with  regard to the troubling nominations of Donald Trump, and I want to add  my voice with respect to the Secretary of Education.   About 90 percent of Americans--Republicans and Democrats alike--send  their children to public schools; and as a proud graduate of the New  York City public school system, I, myself, know firsthand of the  importance of both primary and secondary education as part of early  childhood and young adulthood. Most public schools in the United States  are operated by the city, town, or county for the benefit of the  public, and all of the resources that are allocated to public schools  are used to support the development of students and to prepare them for  success in the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I believe Betsy DeVos has a very different approach to  education, and that is extremely clear. She and her family, over the  years, have devoted millions of dollars to replacing public schools in  Michigan with charter schools, most of which have recorded test scores  in reading and math that are well below the State average. Let me  repeat that--most of which have recorded test scores in reading and  math that are well below the State average.   Recently, the Detroit Free Press released an article that explained,  while families in Detroit have the choice of many different charter  schools, few of these choices actually offer a quality education.   Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that Betsy DeVos has used donations to  provide to Republicans in the Michigan  [[Page H464]]  State Legislature to prevent State agencies from investigating as to  whether charter schools are providing students with a comprehensive  education that will prepare them for the future. I am alarmed that the  system that was developed by Betsy DeVos, which allows for-profit  corporations to operate charter schools, realigns those resources  intended for schoolchildren into the pockets of shareholders--making a  profit off the backs of children.   Since 1959, the DeVos family has operated Amway, which is a business  that has been labeled as a pyramid scheme--paying out millions of  dollars in fines and cheating working families. We cannot allow Betsy  DeVos the chance to extend those same basic principles used during her  time at Amway to affect our education system--enriching wealthy  investors at the expense of our children's education. It is not a  solution. It is a problem.   I thank my colleague for giving me the time. I hope that the American  people are watching very closely as to what is taking place here  because, indeed, it is a travesty.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank my friend and my colleague.   Mr. Speaker, defending the sanctity of American democracy is more  important than any partisan consideration. We are at a juncture at  which we will experience a President-elect who has displayed  breathtaking ignorance about the powers and the basic functions of  government and who has identified the nominees for these cabinet  positions who, if confirmed, will dismantle equality, equity, and  opportunity at every turn, capped off by a Republican-controlled  Congress that would rather make good on divisive rhetoric instead of  working in the best interests of Americans.   There is just so much at stake as we go forth in the next couple of  weeks and as the President-elect identifies and puts forth his  nominees. Whether it is in the Department of State or in the Department  of Education or in Energy or in HUD or in Health and Human Services or  in Justice or in the Environmental Protection Agency--where a nominee,  as Attorney General, spends his time dismantling and litigating against  the Environmental Protection Agency--or whether it is Labor, where the  Labor Secretary doesn't seem to care about working individuals and  protecting workers' rights, or whether it is an SBA administrator who  doesn't have any idea what it is to be a part of a working class or a  middle class, or whether it is even the Treasurer of the country, who  comes from massive wealth and Big Business, each of these  illustrations, in combination with there being the decisions already to  dismantle--to take health care away from millions of families, to  create the loss of jobs as a result of dismantling the Affordable Care  Act without placing anything in its place--represent the dismantling of  the democracy that we have fought so hard to sustain.   If we are going to watch these serious attacks on the equality and  opportunity for all people, then we must make sure that the people in  this country see these things. I have a question for all of us to  answer. As we look toward all of these issues, either individually or  collectively, at what point do we conclude with the question: Is what  is happening in America un-American?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Higgins of Louisiana). Members are  reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the  President-elect or a sitting Senator.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee; Ranking  Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland  Security, and Investigations, and the Congressional Voting Rights  Caucus, I rise today to express my views regarding the more troubling  nominations made by the President-Elect to fill the important Cabinet  posts at the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and  Energy.   Let me begin with the nomination of U.S. Senator Jefferson Beauregard  ``Jeff'' Sessions III of Alabama to be the next Attorney General of the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, those of us who oppose the nomination of Senator  Sessions to be Attorney General owe a responsibility to the public to  clear and forthright in stating the reasons they believe he should not  be confirmed as the Attorney General of the United States.   Many of the senator's supporters, ranging from his Republican  colleagues in the Senate to current and former staffers to home state  friends and constituents, praise the senator for his modesty and  courtesy and manners.   The four-term senator and former state and federal prosecutor is, we  are told, learned in the law, a person of deep faith, a good man who  loves his family, his state, and his country.   We can, as the lawyers say, stipulate that these assertions are true.   But that does not make him an appropriate and deserving candidate to  be Attorney General of the United States.   And that is because the office of Attorney General and the Department  of Justice he or she leads is different in a very fundamental way from  every other Cabinet department.   Unlike the Secretary of Transportation or Commerce or Education, or  even the Secretary of Defense or State, the Attorney General leads a  department that is charged with administering the laws and enforcing  the Constitutional guarantees and protections that directly affect  every American, all 320 million of us.   To quote then-Senator Joseph Biden during the 2001 confirmation  hearing of Attorney General nominee John Ashcroft:   ``This Cabinet position is the single most unique position of any  Cabinet office.''   ``For it's the only one where the nominee or the Cabinet officer has  an equally strong and stronger, quite frankly, responsibility to the  American people as he does to the person who nominates him.''   At that same confirmation hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois  observed that ``the attorney general, more than any other Cabinet  officer, is entrusted with protecting the civil rights of Americans.''   The Attorney General is not the lawyer for the President; the  Attorney General is the lawyer, and the Department of Justice the law  firm, for the American people.   That is why I agree so strongly with then-Senator Biden when he said  in 2001:   ``[F]or the office of attorney general, first, the question is  whether the attorney general is willing to vigorously enforce all the  laws in the Constitution, even though he might have philosophical  disagreements.''   ``[The second question is] whether he possesses the standing and  temperament that will permit the vast majority of the American people  to believe that you can and will protect and enforce their individual  rights.''   Put another way, the U.S. Attorney General and Justice Department is  not only the instrument of justice but also the living symbol of the  Constitution's promise of equal justice under law.   Mr. Speaker, the nation's greatest Attorney Generals conveyed this  commitment to equal justice by their prior experience, their words and  deed, and their character.   Think Herbert Brownell, Attorney General for Republican President  Eisenhower, who overaw the integration of Little Rock's Central High  School.   Think Robert Jackson, Attorney General for Democratic President  Franklin Roosevelt, who led the prosecution team at the Nazi War Crimes  trial in Nuremburg, Germany.   Think Robert F. Kennedy, for whom the Main Justice Building is named,  bringing to bear the instruments of federal power to protect  Mississippi Freedom Riders and to stare down Governor George Wallace in  the successful effort to integrate the University of Alabama.   The nomination of Alabama Senator Sessions as Attorney General does  not inspire the necessary confidence.   As a U.S. Senator from Alabama, the state from which the infamous  Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder originated, Senator  Sessions has failed to play a constructive role in repairing the damage  to voting rights caused by that decision.   He was one of the leading opponents of the reauthorization of the  Violence Against Women Act.   He is one of the Senate's most hostile opponents of comprehensive  immigration reform and was a principal architect of the draconian and  incendiary immigration policy advocated by the President-Elect during  the campaign.   And his record in support of efforts to bring needed reform to the  nation's criminal justice system is virtually non-existent.   In 1986, ten years before Senator Sessions was elected to the Senate,  he was rejected for a U.S. District Court judgeship in view of  documented incidents that revealed his lack of commitment to civil and  voting rights, and to equal justice.   And his Senate voting record and rhetoric has endeared him to white  nationalist websites and organizations like Breitbart and Stormfront.   As a U.S. attorney, Senator Sessions was the first federal prosecutor  in the country to bring charges against civil rights activist for voter  fraud.   Senator Sessions charged the group with 29 counts of voter fraud,  facing over 100 years in prison.  [[Page H465]]    Senator Sessions has repeatedly denied the disproportionate impact of  voting restrictions on minorities and has been a leader in the effort  to undermine the protections of the Voting Rights Act.   Senator Sessions has spoken out against the Voting Rights Act,  calling it ``a piece of intrusive legislation.''   Senator Sessions criticized Attorney General Eric Holder for  challenging state election laws, claiming they are necessary to fight  voter fraud.   However, evidence supports that voter fraud is almost nonexistent,  with 31 confirmed cases out of more than 1 billion ballots cast.   As Attorney General of the state of Alabama, Senator Sessions fought  to continue practices that harmed schools predominantly attended by  African-American students.   Senator Sessions led the fight to uphold the state of Alabama's  inequitable school funding mechanism after it had been deemed  unconstitutional by the Alabama circuit court.   In the state of Alabama nearly a quarter of African-American students  attend apartheid schools, meaning the school's white population is less  than one percent.   Although Senator Sessions has publicly taken credit for desegregation  efforts in the state of Alabama, there is no evidence of his  participation in the desegregation of Alabama schools or any school  desegregation lawsuits filed by then Attorney General Sessions.   Mr. Speaker, The United States has been blessed to have been served  as Attorney General by such illustrious figures as Robert Jackson,  Robert Kennedy, Herbert Brownell, Ramsey Clark, Nicholas Katzenbach,  Eric Holder, and Edward H. Levi.   Nothing would do more to reassure the American people that the  President-Elect is committed to unifying the nation than the nomination  and appointment of a person to be Attorney General who has a record of  championing and protecting, rather than opposing and undermining, the  precious right to vote; the constitutionally guaranteed right of  privacy, criminal justice reform, and support for reform of the  nation's immigration system so that it is fair and humane.   Regrettably, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama is not that person and he  should not be confirmed by the Senate to be the nation's 84th Attorney  General.                            ____________________
