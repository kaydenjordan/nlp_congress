 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the beginning  of Black History Month and highlight the contributions and impact of  Black Americans in my community.   When I was elected to Congress in 2018, I became the first Black  woman to represent the 14th District and the youngest Black woman in  Congress. I am honored to hold a place in Illinois 14th's Black history  alongside the trailblazers that came before me--like Batavia-native  Charles Edward Hall, whose 35-year career at the Census Bureau  fundamentally changed our national understanding of Black communities;  or Civil War veteran, Henry Beard, and his wife, Julia, who after  escaping slavery, became the first Black residents of Sycamore in 1871;  and Dr. Lloyd from Elgin, who revolutionized food, drug, and cosmetic  preservation with the creation of a sterilization process.   These are just a few of the Black Illinoisans who have made a mark on  my community and our country, and I am very proud to honor them.                            ____________________
