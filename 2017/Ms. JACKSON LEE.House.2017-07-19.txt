 Mr. Speaker, many of us are engaged in the budget  process today.   A budget for Americans should be the playbook for improving the  quality of lives for all Americans. Yet this draconian budget, which is  worse than the Trump budget, cuts $250 billion-plus out of quality of  life issues for Americans. It cuts education, healthcare, Medicaid,  Medicare, and the environment, undermining the fight against climate  change.   Where is the relief for the American people?   We have the fact that wages are slow in growing. Mr. Speaker,  corporate America is doing well, and all that is needed, as some  corporations have already done, is to raise the salaries of Americans.   We also need to make sure the government does what the American  people need, to shore up the Affordable Care Act, but not cut billions  from it. Shore up national defense, but not cut from diplomacy and  engagement in peacekeeping activities, as well as USAID. Shore up  America's national security. Give a quality of life to our young people  so that jobs are created.   How do you do that?   You do that, Mr. Speaker, by ensuring that the climate and quality of  life issues are there for corporations to grow. Growth is important for  the American people, not draconian cuts to leave Americans without  healthcare, without good climate, and without education. We want a  budget for the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, yesterday, on Tuesday, July 18, I was  unavoidably detained on constituency business.
