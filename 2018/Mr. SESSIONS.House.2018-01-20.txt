 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 708 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows                                H. Res. 708         Resolved, That the requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII       for a two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee       on Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is       waived with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of January 29, 2018.        Sec. 2.  It shall be in order at any time through the       calendar day of January 28, 2018, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and  the underlying legislation.   This resolution, which we will present today, is necessary. It is  necessary to provide the House with the flexibility necessary to  address Senate Democrat's inaction while they continue to impede  funding the United States Government and the important instruments of  government.   Mr. Speaker, last evening, Senator Chuck Schumer from New York and  Senate Democrats made what I consider to be a reprehensible decision to  allow the United States Government to shut down. By voting against the  bill that funds our military and the pay of men and women in uniform,  they voted against a bill that would extend children's healthcare for 6  years, not because they opposed anything in the bill, because you would  really be hard pressed to be opposed to anything that was in this  legislation. They voted against the bill to manufacture a crisis in a  purely political move based upon an unrelated issue that is not facing  an imminent deadline.   I would like to thank the five Senate Democrats and six House  Democrats who voted with Republicans to keep the government open.   Senator Schumer should have headed the rest of his Democrats and  encouraged them to do what he did even back in 2013, when he said:   We--and I say ``the Democrats''--could say we are shutting down the  government. We are not. We are going to raise the deficit ceiling until  you pass immigration reform. It just would be government chaos not to  do the right thing and open up the government.   Yet, Mr. Speaker, these wise words heeded more than ever now; this is  just a political game. As President Trump  [[Page H590]]  said last evening, Senate Democrats own this. It is a Schumer shutdown.   They put politics above national security.    Mr. Speaker, I think Republicans are on the floor of  the House today to show what we are attempting to offer to the American  people. Mr. Speaker, things are sensitive here on both sides. The  government shut down.   Republicans are going to offer, today, advice to the American people  about where we stand about getting this back to where we not only open  up the government, but doing it in a way that is favorable, not only to  the American people, but favorable to the people who protect this great  country, including those children of this country who need healthcare,  which Republicans had attempted to pass in the House and the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Thornberry), the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, there was a question about the President. The President  does not vote in the House or the Senate. Those people who voted  ``yes'' were for funding the government, those who voted ``no'' were  for shutting down the government.   The President of the United States, through what is called a  Statement of Administration Policy, advised the Rules Committee on  January 17 that he would be signing the bill. The President said he was  for the bill.   Mr. Speaker, the Armed Forces Network is operated by the U.S. Armed  Forces, which broadcasts popular television programs to the United  States Government, civilians, and their families, especially those at  bases and overseas, including ships at sea.   Because of the Schumer shutdown, Armed Forces Network services will  go off the air. That means that tomorrow--the NFL championship Sunday-- our servicemen all around the globe will be unable to participate in  the things that we do here in the United States, yet another example of  why a ``yes'' vote would have been for the men and women of our  military.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), the distinguished majority leader.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Fairhope, Alabama (Mr. Byrne), a member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I will not.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Hood River, Oregon (Mr. Walden), who is the chairman of  the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Hood River, Oregon (Mr. Walden), who is the distinguished chairman of  the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, we know who voted ``yes'' and we know who  voted ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden) to defend the Republican position.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Lewisville, Texas (Mr. Burgess), th distinguished chairman of the  Subcommittee on Health of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and from  the Rules Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Butler, Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I would remind the gentlewoman from Texas  that this body passed the bill, this body did its work, and this body  got its work done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms.  Cheney).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H598]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Sunnyside, Washington (Mr. Newhouse), the gentleman from the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 15  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer).    Mr. Speaker, Mac Thornberry is right. The chairman of  [[Page H600]]  the Armed Services Committee cares very much about the men and women,  not only of the military, where my son serves in Pearl Harbor in the  United States Navy, but about every one of our people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Clarendon, Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we know why we are here. We are here because Republicans  respectfully passed a bill that responsibly took items before the  American people and answered the question--we answered the question  about funding the government; we answered the question about the  Children's Health Insurance Program. We made sure that we did not have  a tax on medical devices that hurts so many people and so many seniors.  We have made sure that we delayed for yet another year the devastating  effects that would be mostly on union workers' paychecks related to the  Cadillac plan.                                time  1830    We further, then, said, ``We are going to delay the $70 insurance tax  that would be on every single American.''   Mr. Speaker, the Republicans did this because we considered this to  be the right thing to do. But most importantly, what we have done is  passed our bill. We convinced our body that it was important to avoid  shutting down the government.   We voted ``yes.'' It was real simple: either ``yes'' or ``no.'' Mr.  Schumer made sure that the answer from the Senate would be ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I want you to know that we deeply believe not only in  what we are doing, but we are going to stand for the people in the  United States military.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  statement of Administration Policy:                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.J. Res. 125--Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018--Rep.                            Frelinghuysen, R-NJ         The Administration supports passage of H.J. Res. 125, the       Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018.        This legislation funds the Federal Government at current       spending levels through February 16, 2018, providing more       time for the Congress and the Administration to reach a       longer-term funding agreement. The Administration supports       the bill's multiyear funding extension of the Children's       Health Insurance Program (CHIP). It also supports the       legislation's delay of harmful Obamacare tax increases,       including the medical device tax.        The Administration believes that looming defense spending       cuts are harmful to our national security and military       readiness, and supports responsible efforts to undo the       defense sequestration in the context of a two-year budget       agreement. As funding discussions continue, the       Administration will continue to reject arbitrary demands for       lower priority domestic funding that jeopardize critical       defense funding.        The safety and security of our Nation depends on a strong       military. Short-term funding measures are not ideal, but a       lapse in funding for the Federal Government would be even       more harmful for our military and our national security.        If H.J. Res. 125 were presented to the President in its       current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the       bill into law.    The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows            An Amendment to H. Res. 708 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       4871) making continuing appropriations for military pay and       death benefits in the event of a Government shutdown. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4871.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to  [[Page H601]]       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . . . [and] has       no substantive legislative or policy implications       whatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said.       Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative       Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th       edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the       previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is       generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority       Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, I yielded back the balance my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 4 of rule XVI, I move  that when the House adjourns this legislative day, it adjourn to meet  at 2 p.m. on Sunday, January 21, 2018.
