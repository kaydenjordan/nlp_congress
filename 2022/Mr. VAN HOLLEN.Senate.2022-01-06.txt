 I want to thank my colleague from Colorado for  reminding us of how important it is for us to come together as  Americans to protect our communities and to protect our country. That  is really why we are all here today on the floor of the Senate because,  1 year ago today, we witnessed a violent attack on this Capitol and on  our democracy itself.   It was not a sneak attack by a foreign power, like Pearl Harbor. It  was not an attack by a foreign terrorist group, like 9/11. It was an  attack from within, and it was orchestrated and instigated by the  former President of the United States.   One year later, while we have improved the physical security of this  Capitol, we have not secured our democracy. Our great American  experiment remains under as much threat today as it did a year ago, and  we as Americans have a duty to come together to take action to protect  it.   The violent mob unleashed by Donald Trump a year ago stormed and  sacked this Capitol. Insurrectionists scaled the ramparts, tore through  the barricades, and breached this building. They used flagpoles to beat  Officer Michael Fanone and used chemical spray to assault Officer Brian  Sicknick, who tragically died the next day. A gallows was built outside  of this Capitol while rioters chanted ``hang Mike Pence.'' Like many  others, I recall watching horrifying television footage of a rioter  pulling down an American flag and raising up a Trump flag in its place.  Confederate flags and banners of far-right extremist groups were  paraded through these halls. This citadel of our democracy was  violently attacked. The Capitol Hill community was traumatized and so  was the country.   But in that dark hour when our democracy was under attack, members of  the U.S. Capitol Police, the National Guard, and the DC Metropolitan  Police stepped up and answered the call.   There were many stories of bravery from that day, but I want to draw  attention to Officer Eugene Goodman, a Marylander who protected our  democracy by diverting the mob away from this Senate Chamber. His  actions on January 6 saved lives, and Maryland is proud to call him one  of our own. It is because of the courage of Officer Goodman, his fellow  officers, and many other heroes that the mob was ultimately forced to  retreat and the Senate and the House were able to reconvene to finish  the certification of the electoral count. That was the job that we had  all come here to do on January 6, 2021, and that was the job the  rioters had tried to stop.   They were driven to violence by Donald Trump's Big Lie that the 2020  election was stolen, and they were hell-bent on answering his call to  overturn the results of that election and overturn the will of the  American people. They failed in that effort. On that day, all of us  were determined not to leave this place until we got the job done and  certified the vote. And that is what we did.   And when we returned to the Senate floor after the attack on our  Capitol, I really believed, for those few hours, that most Members of  this Senate appreciated the gravity of the moment we had just lived  through.   I had real hope that all of us, regardless of party or politics, felt  the weight of history upon us. I had hoped that most of us grasped the  idea that the machinery of our democracy does not operate  automatically; it is not self-executing, that institutions are  ultimately only as strong as the people who safeguard them, that it is  up to each and every one of us to nurture and protect our democracy,  that we are the current stewards of our Republic's tradition of the  peaceful transfer of power.   I really believed that night that that was a shared belief in this  Senate. In my remarks when we returned that evening, I described the  attack as a wake-up call to the country for all of us as Americans.  That day showed us exactly what can happen when we fail to come  together--not as Republicans or Democrats but as Americans, to stand up  for the truth, to stand up for  [[Page S71]]  our democracy, and to stand up against lies that undermine public  confidence and faith in our elections.   That day showed us, in a violent and undeniable way, that if we  allowed the poison of the Big Lie to continue to spread, our democracy  would continue to be under threat. I hoped we would heed the warning of  that horrible day.   And I was pleased to work with colleagues here, including the Senator  from Minnesota and others, to help fortify the physical security of our  Capitol Building. We have delivered additional resources to the Capitol  Police. We selected a new Sergeant of Arms and a new Chief of the  Capitol Police.   And we are continuing to implement the other key recommendations that  have been made to strengthen the security of Capitol Hill. While we are  improving the physical security here on Capitol Hill, we are failing in  our larger duty to the American people.   We have failed to stop the spread of the Big Lie and its corrosive  impact on the confidence in our democracy. We know that Joe Biden beat  Donald Trump in a free and fair election, and yet too many of our  Republican colleagues put political convenience ahead of country and  ahead of our Constitution.    Too many are afraid to state the facts and tell the American people  the simple truth. And because of that fundamental failure, the Big Lie  has metastasized and represents a clear and present danger to the  democratic process throughout the country.   When the violent mob failed to overturn the election results in this  Chamber a year ago today, the Big Lie did not end. It materialized in  other forms to undermine our democracy. As we speak, Republican- controlled State legislatures, fueled by the Big Lie, are passing laws  making it harder for people to vote--especially people of color, people  with disabilities, and younger voters.   In addition to putting up barriers to voting, proponents of the Big  Lie are stripping power from election officials who dared to challenge  Donald Trump's plot to falsely claim victory in the 2020 election. The  Georgia General Assembly removed Georgia Secretary of State Brad  Raffensperger as head of the State election board after he denied  Trump's request to ``find 11,780 votes,'' the exact number he needed to  defeat Joe Biden in Georgia. It was not enough that Raffensperger, a  loyal Republican, had voted for Donald Trump. His offense was failure  to implement the Big Lie.   In Michigan, Republicans are moving to saturate election wards with  Big Lie loyalists in an effort to control the counting of ballots. And  across the country, other laws are being passed at the State level that  would authorize partisan officials to change or overturn the results of  elections, even after votes have been cast and counted.   What we are witnessing is an all-out, continuing assault on our  democracy. And the longer we wait, the more the threat grows. The clock  is ticking. Now is the time to act.   That is why we must establish uniform national standards to protect  access to the ballot box and ensure that our elections reflect the will  of the American people, not the political wishes of any party or any  one person.   That is exactly what the Freedom to Vote Act does and why we must  pass it. This bill would defend every American's right to the ballot.  The Freedom to Vote Act also helps protect election officials from  unfair removal and guards against attempts to tamper with or change  election results.   In addition, the bill contains provisions to keep our elections fair  and honest, including crucial campaign finance reform and a ban on  partisan gerrymandering. An enactment of the Freedom to Vote Act should  go hand in hand with the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to  restore the full protections guaranteed by the Voting Rights Act of  1965.   While I had hoped that action to preserve our democracy would be a  bipartisan endeavor, it is clear that our Senate Republican colleagues  are not willing to join us in passing these bills.   Efforts to strike a compromise have been met with virtually zero  support on the other side of the aisle. Democrats are willing to move  forward ourselves to protect our democracy, but our Republican  colleagues have weaponized the current filibuster rule and are using it  to thwart progress. They have even blocked our attempt to have a debate  on voting rights when we raised the issue 6 months ago.   Those actions are undermining the very spirit, the tradition, and  function of this Senate. The Senate was designed to promote vigorous  and long debate while also respecting the ultimate will of a majority  of Senators and a majority of the American people.   Today, we see the opposite: very little real debate on the Senate  floor and the denial--the denial--of a majority vote to resolve the big  questions of the day, resulting in the denial of the will of the  American people.   We can change that. We have to change that. We can change it by  adapting the current rules of the Senate to restore the original intent  of the Framers. We must do that for the health of our institutions and  the good of our democracy.   James McHenry, Maryland's delegate to the Constitutional Convention,  wrote in his diaries about a famous exchange between Elizabeth Willing  Powell and Benjamin Franklin. He wrote:         A lady asked Dr. Franklin Well Doctor what have we got a       republic or a monarchy--A republic replied the Doctor if you       can keep it.    A year ago today on this floor, I quoted this exact exchange. And  now, on the 1-year anniversary of January 6, we are still met with the  same question and same test of whether or not we can muster the will to  do what must be done to keep our Republic. There is still time. We can  still repair and sustain our democracy.   One year ago, we did not allow a violent mob to prevent us from  staying right here to do our job. We completed the certification of the  Presidential election, but our job is not over. We have not finished  the job of security or democracy.   Now is the time for us to do that. Let's come together and do what is  necessary and right for our Republic, for our democracy, and for the  American people.   I yield the floor.
