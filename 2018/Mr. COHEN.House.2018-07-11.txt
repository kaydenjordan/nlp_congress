 Mr. Speaker, today, the House passed a resolution which I  authored with the help of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of which Ed  Royce is the chairman supporting NATO and the NATO countries that are  endangered by Russian aggression, particularly Estonia, Lithuania,  Latvia, and the Baltic area. The Balkan countries also have been  threatened, including Montenegro, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.   The resolution speaks of our support of the sanctions against Russia.  And the sanctions should remain until Crimea is returned to Ukraine and  the Donbas no longer has war. Then we continue to support the Baltics  who have their airspace invaded by Russian aggression.   I am pleased that Speaker Ryan allowed this resolution to come to the  floor and was passed by voice vote unanimous consent as the Senate had  passed a similar resolution 97-2. The House and the Senate stand  together in support of NATO and our allies in Eastern, Central, and  Western Europe.                            ____________________
