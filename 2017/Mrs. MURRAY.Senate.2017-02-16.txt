 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge my  colleagues to vote no on the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the  Environmental Protection Agency, a nomination that marks yet another  broken promise from the new President to put the needs of American  families first over the wishes of big corporations and special  interests. And just like we have seen with Betsy DeVos at the  Department of Education or Steve Mnuchin at Treasury, we have yet  another Trump nominee whose record demonstrates a direct conflict with  the mission of the agency they wish to lead. On the EPA's website, that  mission is pretty clear--``to protect human health and the  environment''--and EPA achieves that by enforcing regulations based on  laws passed by Congress. So I will be voting no on this nomination.   I want to make two points on why Mr. Pruitt heading up the EPA would  be wrong for our country and why it would be wrong for the families I  represent in Washington State. It starts with his record and clear  conflicts of interest.   During Mr. Pruitt's term as the attorney general for Oklahoma, he  filed no less than 19 cases to overturn environmental regulations,  including one to topple the EPA's Clean Power Plan. These regulations  specifically seek to protect public health by reducing harmful air and  water pollution and are projected to save tens of thousands of lives  each year.   As if it wasn't bad enough that Mr. Pruitt spent so much time filing  lawsuits in court and fighting policies designed to protect the health  of the environment as well as people, it is pretty shocking that at the  same time, he was collecting millions of dollars from the very  industries he will regulate if he is confirmed. This is no small  conflict of interest between his former and potentially future  position, and that he was still nominated to be EPA Administrator is  mind-blowing to me.   I echo the sentiments of so many who have expressed serious concerns  about Mr. Pruitt's conflict of interest, that his ties to the fossil  fuel industry make him more indebted to backing policies that loosen  environmental regulations, benefiting big oil and gas companies, rather  than backing policies that protect the American people.   Mr. President, I want to voice another concern my constituents have  shared with me. It is unnerving to think the President would choose a  climate change denier to set our national environmental policy. I don't  see how someone who has openly denied the existence of climate change-- the devastating effects of which we are already beginning to see in  Washington State and around the country--will effectively protect human  health or the environment.   This is about more than just the environment. A report by the  Congressional Budget Office last year found that climate change is a  serious threat to our economic stability. As the occurrence of national  disasters continues to rise, the cost of disaster assistance and  rebuilding rises too.   If we want to be responsible about tackling our fiscal challenges-- which I would think the President and Mr. Pruitt would agree on--we  need to take the impacts of climate change seriously. At a time when we  are already seeing the very real effects of climate change in my home  State, from longer, more devastating wildfire seasons to ocean  acidification and rising sea levels, it is more important than ever.  This brings me to how Mr. Pruitt's confirmation would be devastating  for my home State of Washington.    As someone who personally spends a great deal of time fishing and  hiking in my home State of Washington, I am committed to conservation  and preservation efforts so generations to come can appreciate the high  quality of life we enjoy and experience the splendor of America's  natural spaces, one of the most important being the restoration and  recovery of salmon runs and habitat throughout the Pacific Northwest,  which is a vital part of our Northwest economy and its heritage.   I am deeply concerned about whether this support would continue under  an EPA Administrator like Mr. Pruitt. I have similar concerns about the  Hanford cleanup, a critical part of our State's history that EPA plays  a very important role in to protect the health and safety of our Tri- Cities community, Columbia River, and Washington State.   I will fight against any EPA nominee or an Administrator who will not  join us in the fight for a better future for generations to come. I  sincerely hope the President and Mr. Pruitt truly understand the  enormous responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency, not  only in protecting our environment for future generations but for the  families we represent who rely on clean air and clean water right now.   For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we need to act now to  avoid lasting, irreversible damage to our health, our environment, our  economy, and our country's future. I am not confident in putting that  future in Scott Pruitt's hands.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the remainder of my postcloture debate time to Senator  Carper.    Additionally, I yield the remainder of my time beyond  that, of my postcloture debate time, to Senator Schumer.    Thank you very much.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a  close friend, ally, and devoted public servant as Gary Petersen retires  from a more than 50-year career in support of our national security,  environmental cleanup, and furthering the ever-changing missions of the  Hanford Nuclear Reservation and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,  PNNL, in my home State of Washington.   A graduate of Omak High School in Okanogan County, Mr. Petersen first  came to what is now known as the Tri-Cities in January 1960 as a  servicemember stationed with the Nike Ajax missile site at the top of  Rattlesnake Mountain. After a duty station transfer to Korea, he came  home to Washington and attended Washington State University. With a  communications degree in hand, Mr. Petersen had a job lined up with  Ford Motor Company in 1965, but in a great stroke of luck for  Washington State, he chose not to move to Detroit and instead got a job  with Battelle, a company that had recently won a contract to operate a  research and development lab--now PNNL--at Hanford in 1965. One could  say that Mr. Petersen got in on the ground floor at PNNL when its  scientists were providing critical support to win the cold war.   While at Battelle, Mr. Petersen worked in communications and was the  manager of the news service. One of his chief responsibilities was to  give tours of the Hanford site to new employees, elected officials and  dignitaries, and later, foreign visitors. Congresswoman Catherine May,  the first woman elected to Congress from Washington State, was the  first Member of Congress Mr. Petersen gave a tour to, but she was  certainly not the last. Senator Warren Magnuson, Speaker Tom Foley, and  I, to name a few others, have all crisscrossed the Hanford site with  Mr. Petersen. He even helped with President Richard Nixon's visit. By  now, Mr. Petersen has probably given thousands of tours of Hanford, and  many, including myself, have heard the stories from years past, from  bumping into the woman who he would later marry during a tour, to the  alligators, to bringing moon rocks from the Apollo 11 mission to  Hanford for public display.   Mr. Petersen's work with nuclear management began in 1974 for  Westinghouse on the construction, start-up, and operation of the Fast  Flux Test Reactor and then the Washington Public Power Supply System,  which is now Energy Northwest. After spending some time on the  International Nuclear Safety Program through the U.S. Departments of  Energy and State, Mr. Petersen returned to Battelle as the director of  communications and administration at PNNL in the late 1980s.   When he retired from Battelle in 2002, Mr. Petersen was quickly  recruited by Sam Volpentest to help him at the Tri-Cities Washington  Economic Development Council in a part-time, volunteer capacity to  travel to Washington, DC, to secure funding to support Hanford and  PNNL. This part-time job quickly became a full-time job, and Mr.  Petersen has been advocating on behalf of the Tri-Cities ever since.  Since my first days in the Senate, I have worked with Mr. Petersen, and  he has been a key ally during many a funding battle. He knows the  budget as well as any staff member on the Appropriations Committee, and  this isn't just limited to nuclear waste cleanup, but also includes  research and development capabilities that support the PNNL mission,  transportation, agriculture, and so much more.   It is clear to me that Washington State has benefited greatly from  Mr. Petersen's vision and passion for sharing what the Tri-Cities  community, its workforce, the Hanford site, and PNNL have to offer. I  have seen this firsthand at home and here in the other Washington. His  work is evident in the progress that has been made on environmental  cleanup at Hanford, to charting out a future vision for the Tri-Cities  that looks past cleanup operations to preserving history through  designating the B Reactor as a National Historic Landmark and the  Manhattan Project National Historical Park, to growing the workforce  safety mission at the Volpentest Hazardous Materials Management and  Emergency Response Federal Training Center, and to seeking out new,  emerging opportunities like small modular reactors. Through it all, he  has remained as committed as they come. Last October, when I had the  good fortune to get one more tour with Mr. Petersen at the Hanford  site, I saw that he still carried the same enthusiasm and pride for his  work as what I had seen in him on my very first tour years ago.   Mr. Petersen has been critical to my work in the Senate and has made  a tremendous impact on the Tri-Cities community, Washington State, and  our Nation. Today I join with others throughout the State of Washington  in thanking him for his many years of service. I congratulate Mr.  Petersen on his retirement and wish him and his wife, Margaret, the  best of luck as they write their next chapter.                            ____________________
