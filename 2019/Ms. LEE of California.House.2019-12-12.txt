 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   This bill takes on Big Pharma to help lower the cost of prescription  drugs for everyday families. It is beyond outrageous that the U.S.  government is not currently allowed to negotiate drug prices through  Medicare. And it is shocking that Big Pharma is charging people in the  United States, hundreds of times more than what they charge in other  countries.   But H.R. 3 will help fix that. It allows the government to negotiate  drug pricing through Medicare, and expands Medicare to cover vision,  dental and hearing for the first time, while also investing in  community health centers and critical research.   I'm especially pleased that this bill incorporates key provisions  championed by our Progressive Caucus Co-Chairs Pramila Jayapal and Mark  Pocan that increase the number of drugs that Medicare is able to  negotiate and protect 150 million Americans with private health care  plans from being price gouged by Big Pharma.   I urge a YES vote on this important bill named for our beloved,  departed colleague Elijah Cummings who fought day in and out for the  people. We miss him.
