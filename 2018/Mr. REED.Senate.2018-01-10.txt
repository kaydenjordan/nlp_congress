 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my thoughts on  recent protests in Iran and the important upcoming decisions by the  President with respect to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or  the JCPOA.   While I am mindful that we have limited visibility into Iran and  continue to learn more about the circumstances and motivations of the  recent protests, one thing is clear: A significant portion of the  Iranian people are not satisfied with their government and are  increasingly willing to make their dissatisfaction heard. It is  important that we support their right to peacefully express their views  and demand that the Iranian Government respond with constructive  dialogue, rather than force.   It was notable that Iranian President Ruhani implicitly recognized  the validity of the protests earlier this week when he reportedly said:         It would be a misrepresentation and also an insult to       Iranian people to say they only had economic demands. . . .       People had economic, political and social demands    That is according to President Ruhani.   Acknowledging the need for reform, Ruhani continued:         We cannot pick a lifestyle and tell two generations after       us to live like that. It is impossible. The views of the       young generation about life and the world is different than       ours.    Now is the time to support the Iranian people in their quest for a  government that is more representative and supportive of their  interests. Unfortunately, some have suggested that our response should  be to withdraw from the JCPOA, an action that I believe would only  serve to embolden the hardliners in Iran and leave the United States  more isolated from our allies. Withdrawing from the JCPOA and  reimposing nuclear-related sanctions on Iran would immediately change  the narrative inside of Iran, uniting reformists and hardliners alike  in their opposition to what they view as a hostile United States.   While some would argue that the recent protests in Iran are  symptomatic of what they view as a flawed JCPOA, I would suggest  otherwise. In reality, the nuclear deal exposed one of the Iranian  regime's central vulnerabilities--namely, that the regime can no longer  simply blame sanctions imposed by the United States and the  international community for its economic woes at home. It is becoming  clearer to the Iranian people that it is actually the regime's  corruption, financial mismanagement, funding of malign activities, and  hegemonic ambitions that are at the root of their government's  inability to enable job creation and to ensure that necessities like  food and gasoline remain affordable.   In the coming days, the President has several important decisions to  make with respect to the JCPOA. In October, President Trump  acknowledged that Iran is meeting its commitments under the JCPOA, but  he chose not to certify that continued sanctions relief is  ``appropriate and proportionate'' to the actions taken by Iran with  respect to terminating its illicit nuclear program. By the end of this  week, President Trump is again required to decide whether to issue such  a certification. I expect he will again choose not to do so.   The more consequential decision for the President this week will be  whether to continue waivers of nuclear-related sanctions, as he is  required to do under the JCPOA. Choosing not to continue such waivers  would immediately snap back U.S. nuclear-related sanctions, thereby  putting the United States in violation of the JCPOA. Let me be clear.  This would be a unilateral action on behalf of the United States that  would put us in violation of an international agreement, not just with  Iran but with the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China,  as well.   By all accounts, the JCPOA is working as intended, and Iran is  verifiably meeting its commitments under the deal. It is important to  remember what the JCPOA was designed to do and what it is now  achieving. The JCPOA commits Iran to never seeking to develop or  acquire a nuclear weapon; effectively cuts off all pathways for Iran to  achieve a nuclear weapon during the period covered by the agreement;  and increases the time it would take for Iran to acquire enough  material for one nuclear bomb from 2 to 3 months to at least 1 year.  When this agreement was signed, they were within months of having that  capability. It dramatically reduces Iran's stockpile of enriched  uranium and the number of installed centrifuges. It has prevented Iran  from producing weapons-grade plutonium and has subjected Iran to robust  monitoring by the IAEA to verify its compliance.   Withdrawing from the JCPOA at this point would provide no benefit and  would actually leave us more isolated and less able to deal with the  various challenges posed by Iran. The crippling sanctions regime that  brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place only worked  because the international community was united in its determination to  keep Iran from achieving a nuclear weapon. If we withdraw from the  JCPOA unilaterally--and in the absence of a clear violation of the deal  by Iran--there is no reason to believe that our partners in the P5+1  would join us. In fact, French President Macron has said that there is  ``no alternative'' to the JCPOA and told the U.N. General Assembly that  ``renouncing it would be a grave error.''   General Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the  Armed Services Committee last year:         I believe that the U.S. would incur damage vis-a-vis our       allies if we unilaterally withdraw from the JCPOA. Our allies       will be less likely to cooperate with us on future military       action to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and       less likely to cooperate with us on countering other       destabilizing aspects of Iranian behavior that threaten our       collective interests.    Our sanctions may snap back but not those imposed by the rest of the  world, many of whom have begun building economic ties to Iran since the  JCPOA was signed. Our international partners would then blame us, not  Iran, for the failure of the deal.   Some, including President Trump, have argued that we can and should  dissolve the JCPOA and renegotiate a better deal. This is a highly  unrealistic proposal. We were only able to achieve the JCPOA after  years of sustained multilateral diplomatic efforts and the imposition  of aggressive international sanctions in concert with our partners. It  will likely be impossible to replicate those conditions if the United  States unilaterally withdraws from the JCPOA.   Contrary to President Trump's belief, threatening to walk away from  the  [[Page S127]]  deal actually weakens our ability to address the JCPOA's perceived  flaws by alienating our partners. Instead, we should remain committed  to the JCPOA and lead the international community in imposing  additional sanctions, where necessary, to change other Iranian  behaviors--namely, their respect for human rights, ballistic missile  development efforts, and other malign activities.   We must also seek to help enable the Iranian people to make their  choices heard, including by encouraging the adoption of social media  and other means of communication. We could start by building upon  general licenses issued by the Obama administration designed to  encourage the export of communications technology to Iran.   Secretary Mattis told the Armed Services Committee at his  confirmation hearing: ``When America gives her word, we have to live up  to it and work with our allies.''   If the President decides this week not to continue nuclear-related  sanctions relief for Iran, he will be effectively choosing to restart  the Iranian nuclear program, thereby making military conflict with Iran  more likely.   Withdrawing from the deal would also be a devastating blow to our  efforts toward diplomacy with North Korea--and for that matter, any  future diplomatic efforts to constrain aggressive behavior by our  adversaries. Why would any nation engage with us in serious dialogue to  resolve differences if they fear we will later withdraw unilaterally,  even when the other parties are complying with the agreement?   Regardless of whether you supported the JCPOA before it was signed,  the truth is that it has removed the greatest threat we faced from Iran  while also preserving all other means to address Iran's malign  activities. Let there be no doubt--Iran continues to be a state sponsor  of terrorism and an abuser of human rights. Iran continues to  destabilize the region through its development of ballistic missiles  and support of proxies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and elsewhere.  If Iran behaves this way without a nuclear weapon, imagine how much  worse a nuclear-armed Iran would be.    Fortunately, our nonnuclear sanctions on Iran remain in place and are  unaffected by the JCPOA. In fact, Congress authorized additional  sanctions in July to help deal with these issues. The administration  should work with our international partners and use all tools at its  disposal, including by ramping up nonnuclear sanctions, where  necessary, to counter Iran's unacceptable behavior in these other  areas.   Abrogating the JCPOA only invites another nuclear crisis like the one  we are currently facing with North Korea--a concern echoed by General  Dunford when he appeared before the Armed Services Committee and said:  ``It makes sense to me that our holding up agreements that we have  signed, unless there's a material breach, would have impact on others'  willingness to sign agreements.''   Many have criticized the JCPOA as a ``flawed deal.'' For example,  concerns have been raised that certain provisions sunset after a period  of years, thereby delaying rather than permanently preventing Iran from  achieving a nuclear weapon. If the concern is that Iran may seek to  resume nuclear weapons development activities after these sunsets--a  concern that I share--the appropriate course of action is not to throw  out the deal but to work with our international partners to ensure that  necessary restrictions on the JCPOA are appropriately extended or  supplemented.   As I noted before, Iran has committed in perpetuity not to develop or  seek to acquire nuclear weapons. We should not take them at their word;  we should verify their adherence to this commitment, just as we are  doing under the JCPOA. If at any point in the future we have evidence  to suggest Iran is taking steps that would indicate a violation of that  commitment, we should use that information to rally the P5+1 and other  international partners to take a unified stand against such efforts.  Unilaterally withdrawing from the JCPOA would seriously damage our  ability to exert such leadership in the future.   Again, according to General Dunford, in the absence of the JCPOA,  Iran would likely resume its nuclear weapons program and ``a nuclear- armed Iran would likely be more aggressive in its actions and more  dangerous in its consequences.'' General Dunford also told the  committee that ``the intel community assessment is, in fact, that Iran  is in compliance right now [with the JCPOA], and therefore, I think we  should focus on addressing the other challenges: the missile threat  they pose, the maritime threat they pose, the support of proxies,  terrorists, and the cyber threat they pose.'' I wholeheartedly agree  with General Dunford's assessment.   Our troops in Iraq and Syria are operating in close proximity to  Iranian-aligned militias, including those who previously targeted  American troops. Unilaterally withdrawing from the JCPOA could embolden  these hardline militias and possibly result in Iran giving them a green  light to begin targeting U.S. forces once more.   Furthermore, while I have full confidence in our military's ability  to fight and win wars when necessary, we cannot escape the reality that  military contingencies to respond to both a nuclear-armed North Korea  and Iran would result in massive loss of life and national treasure and  greatly stress our military's capacity and capabilities.   In conclusion, I will return to where I began. Now is not the time to  impose a self-inflicted wound upon our foreign policy and standing in  the world. Unilaterally withdrawing from the JCPOA would empower  Iranian hardliners and dramatically undermine the reform-minded  protests we should be seeking to empower. Worse still, it would leave  us more isolated in the international community and, by extension, less  able to address the range of national security challenges posed by  Iran, North Korea, and our other potential adversaries.   We must not abdicate the JCPOA or American leadership on these  issues. Therefore, I urge the President to stay the course with respect  to the JCPOA, while also rallying the international community to take  effective actions intended to change other unacceptable behaviors by  the Iranian regime to suppress dissent at home and sow instability  abroad. We must not squander this opportunity by making the story about  the United States rather than the courageous Iranians who at great risk  to themselves have taken to the streets to demand a better future.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Summer  Lockerbie and Stephen Popick, fellows in my office, be granted  privileges of the floor for the remainder of this session of the  Congress.
