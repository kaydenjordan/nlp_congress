 Mr. President, as we move forward on tax reform, I  think the one great potential for absolute agreement is that we should  lower the burden for middle-income taxpayers, and as we move forward,  the one thing we absolutely should not do is in any way increase the  tax burden for middle-income taxpayers. This amendment is about  guaranteeing that no one who makes under $250,000 sees his taxes  increase in any kind of legislation, including in any tax reform  proposal.   I have heard from teachers, nurses, and veterans. They all want to  know what this means for them. To guarantee people an absolute bright  line that their taxes will not go up is absolutely essential as we move  forward.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305(b)(2) of  that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.
