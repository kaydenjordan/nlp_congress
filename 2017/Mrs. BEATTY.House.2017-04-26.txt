 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my Ohio colleagues to  congratulate Congressman Steve Stivers on his promotion from colonel to  brigadier general of the Ohio Army National Guard.   His promotion comes after more than 30 years in the National Guard.  He is now one of the highest ranking National Guard members to also  serve as a Member of Congress. Congressman Stivers served the United  States overseas during Operation Iraqi Freedom in Kuwait, Iraq, and  Djibouti where he was awarded the Bronze Star for leadership throughout  the deployment.   We are proud to have him leading the National Guard soldiers who  protect us at home and abroad.   Congressman Stivers, on behalf of the Ohio delegation and the  citizens we represent, congratulations on this distinguished honor. Mr.  Speaker, I am proud to call Steve a colleague and Ohioan and a friend.                            ____________________
