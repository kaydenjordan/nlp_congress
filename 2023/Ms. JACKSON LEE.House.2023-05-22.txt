 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman as well, Mr.  Takano, for his vision and leadership and the years of service that he  has given to the Veterans' Affairs Committee. We could not have a more  stalwart champion for the veterans of America.   I thank my friends on the other side of the aisle and certainly, our  colleague from California, who made a very important point. For this to  work it has to be bipartisan. I hope we all will lean into the  bipartisan efforts that need to be done to ensure not only its passage  but its implementation.   As the ranking member indicated, I am on the Homeland Security  Committee and the Budget Committee. Many times in those committees we  see the concerns of domestic security. We also see the concerns of  effectively utilizing all of our tools to ensure the proper budget for  the people of the United States of America.   I cannot think, as we approach Memorial Day, and as we commemorate  the accomplishments of Asian Americans in this great month of May,  interacting with all of our community, that we would not find an  appropriate time to honor those Korean-American soldiers who fought  alongside of our fellow Vietnam soldiers in a battle that was for  democracy and protecting, if you will, the sense of equality,  protecting the people of that era and of that war.   These soldiers bled. They rescued. They stood in front of our  soldiers in terms of being comrades and fighting alongside. They saved  lives. They lost lives.   I think that it is important to take note of those who served, who  were members of the armed forces of the Republic of Korea and are  considered veterans of the Armed Forces of the United States, for  purposes of the provision of healthcare by the Department of Veterans  Affairs.   For so long, I would listen to my Vietnam vets before we really  answered their call on Agent Orange and saw them get very sick, saw  many of them pass away, talking about Agent Orange over and over again,  and it just seemed that it was not being heard.   Thank goodness we have done so many different things, such as the  PACT Act, Agent Orange Act, all during my tenure as a Member of the  United States Congress. We finally understood the truth of what the  veterans were saying, and every time they speak, we should listen.   I was with veterans over the weekend, and I thank them everywhere I  go. Every speech I make in my community, I ask veterans to rise, and I  say thank you.   In this instance, title 38 is a special pay authority used to recruit  and retain employees in certain healthcare occupations. It allows NIH  to be competitive with other healthcare facilities.   However, this would expand the eligibility of these benefits, this  Korean American VALOR Act, to veterans who served in the armed forces  of the Republic of Korea during the Vietnam war and have since become  naturalized citizens, almost 300,000, and how many others served.   So this legislation is clearly evidence of our relationship between  the Republic of Korea and the friendship that we have established.                                time  1645     As we heard from the South Korean President who  spoke to a joint session just a few weeks ago, he talked about  patriotism, democracy, and the unity of our nations. It is absolutely  imperative that we support these Korean war vets who stood alongside of  us and acknowledge that they served in Vietnam. They are now  naturalized citizens, and they, in fact, have the evidence of the  illness. It is so important to call them Korean American Vietnam  veterans, naturalized citizens. We want them to get the honor of the  Korean American VALOR Act. I ask my colleagues to support it.  [[Page H2474]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 366 the Korean American  Vietnam Allies Long Overdue for Relief (VALOR) Act.   H.R. 366 would amend title 38, United States Code, to treat certain  individuals who served in Vietnam as a member of the armed forces of  the Republic of Korea as a veteran of the Armed Forces of the United  States for purposes of the provision of health care by the Department  of Veterans Affairs.   Title 38 is a special pay authority used to recruit and retain  employees in certain health care occupations. It allows NIH to be  competitive with other health care facilities in the area.   The Korean American VALOR Act would expand the eligibility of these  benefits to veterans who served in the armed forces of the Republic of  Korea during the Vietnam War and have since become naturalized U.S.  citizens.   This bipartisan legislation, when enacted into law, will provide  veterans who served between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, and  became U.S. citizens during or after such service, access to hospital  and domiciliary care and medical services through the VA.   Approximately 3,000 Korean American Vietnam veterans are naturalized  citizens--and the number of surviving veterans continues to dwindle.   As a result of their time in Vietnam, these veterans are falling ill  from the diseases caused by exposure to Agent Orange and other toxins  and are not receiving adequate care.   Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) fully supports the passage of the  Korean American VALOR Act H.R. 366.   The Korean American VALOR Act will protect our veterans that served  in Vietnam by providing them with the healthcare relief they deserve.    Mr. Speaker, I thank very much the ranking member;  Mr. Bost; my good friend from Texas; the ranking member, the gentleman  from New Hampshire; and, of course, in the other body, Senator Tester  for a very instructive and important initiative dealing with the cost  of living for our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, if my colleagues are embraced and engaged with  veterans--which many of us do every time we are home in the district-- they realize that they, in many instances, continue their service in  the kinds of work that they do. Realize, however, that they have any  number of additional challenges in many instances. That, of course,  includes some of the health issues, housing issues, and ability-to- support-family issues.   The cost of living is, in essence, something that we should make as a  commitment for the service that they have given.                                time  1730    I know that we often say thank you for your service, and we often  have a smile on our face. I want it to be well known, well known, that  it is by our action and our deeds, not just by our words.   The veterans that we see across our districts and across America have  fought in many wars. Many of them believe that they have not been given  the full amount of their veteran benefits.   They believe that they are still trying to petition for a level of  disability, if you will. Some are at a certain percentage and feel that  they deserve another percentage because they are in a financial  condition that causes them to wonder about their service and their  service-connected disability. We get all of those questions.   I think the overall statement that has been made about the cost of  living is to recognize the difficulty our veterans have, the increasing  amount of moneys that it requires for us to take care of our veterans,  and that this is a responsible and respectable way of doing so.   I hope that we will pass this quickly. I hope that it will go to the  President's desk. I hope that when we see our veterans, we will be able  to be an exhibitor of deeds, that we stood on the floor of the House to  say thank you.   We stood on the floor of the House to say we recognize the needs that  you have from the veterans hospitals, veterans clinics, and certainly  for the need of increased compensation.   This is an important statement not only for veterans but for their  families.  [[Page H2481]]  It is an important statement for the young men and women who put on the  uniform today unselfishly.   They will ultimately be veterans, and we hope that they will be able  to serve, and they will be able to come out as veterans.   Please be reminded as we celebrate Memorial Day there are those who  put on the uniform unselfishly, and they never made it home.   We want to be able to honor those, but as well, we want to honor  living veterans. I support this legislation that provides for a  veterans COLA of 2023.    Mr. Speaker, we have a serious challenge in this  country, a challenge that requires us to act with broadness, swiftness,  and, of course, understanding.   I rise today to introduce legislation, the Comprehensive Response to  Fentanyl-Related Substances and Fentanyl-Laced Substances Act.   Mr. Speaker, 8.4 million fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills  exist. The seizures were directly linked to at least 39 overdose  deaths. Between 2019 and 2021, more than 2,200 adolescents overdosed.  Ninety-six percent of them were between the ages of 15 and 19. This  legislation will look that squarely in the eye and demand that it cease  and desist.   We need to increase funding for prevention and treatment programs,  programs that provide education and treatment for people who are at  risk. Get them while they are subject to being enticed. We need more  school-based programs and community-outreach programs. We need to  expand access to naloxone, the medication that can reverse the effects,  which should be in all schools. We need to crack down on trafficking  the little pink pills.   Mr. Speaker, we have to save our children, and we have to save them  now. Join Congresswoman Jackson Lee and my original cosponsors to  support this legislation, the Comprehensive Response to Fentanyl- Related Substances and Fentanyl-Laced Substances Act. Let's save our  children.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida  and the gentleman from Illinois, and I join Mr. Horsford in expressing  my appreciation to them both for their continuing leadership.   Mr. Speaker, this is a particularly important Special Order, honoring  our veterans far and wide; and then telling the stories of our Black  veterans, who often have been at the wrong end of the history of this  country.   It should be noted that African Americans, some enslaved, have fought  in every war since the Revolutionary War, and it is extremely important  to recognize that sometimes their stories have not been told.   I was very pleased today to support the legislation that supported a  veterans' COLA, cost of living increase. As I indicated previously, we  all know that veterans have been victims of homelessness, been  discriminated against in terms of not being appreciated for their  service, taking their service where they are commanding thousands and  giving them an entry-level job. I think it is important that we  recognize the importance of their work.   We also know that there have been many who have had service-related  injuries who have not been fully compensated. We continue to fight for  those who have had exposure to Agent Orange. Certainly, we are more  than excited about the passage of the PACT Act brought in the House,  where I introduced the Jackson Lee amendment, which would require a  report on the feasibility of modifying the individual longitudinal  exposure record. That act, of course, even without changes, was, in  fact, to add to providing protection to our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, tonight I emphasize the stories of veterans who have  fought and who have been in every war, and that includes the wars of  the 1800s, the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean war,  and Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan.   I acknowledge our friend and colleague, the Honorable Charlie Rangel,  who was a Korean war vet in the worst of time, and the coldest of time,  and an ugly war. He reminded us during his tenure here that the Korean  war was not a conflict. It was, in fact, a war.   We honor the generals who fought in World War II and who still came  home to a segregated America, and we must remember those individuals,  some who fell out of the skies in World War I and World War II.   We have come full circle. There were 50,000 who died in the Vietnam  war, with large numbers of African Americans who lost their lives.  General Colin Powell fought in that war. He was wounded, and I pay  tribute to him tonight. He ultimately became the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs and, as well, ultimately Secretary of State. He had a passion  for peace. He believed in peace. Though he was a warrior and a combat  leader, he understood the value of peace. We thank him for his service.   My own constituent, Sergeant Williams, he is a Buffalo soldier who  fought in the Vietnam war, who lives today exhibiting the bravery of  that time. I thank him for his service.   Now we have come full circle in Iraq and Afghanistan, where many  African-American men and women rose to the ranks of lieutenant and  major. Globally, I thank them. There are many of them who served in my  congressional district.   This is an important moment, as we approach the Memorial Day weekend,  for those who wore the uniform unselfishly and then lost their lives.   Also, as I supported this COLA increase for our veterans, I remind  everyone that there are many homeless veterans, many of whom are Black.  I particularly say to them that their status today does not diminish  their bravery and service to this Nation.   It should be our commitment that we should not leave any veteran  behind and not any veteran homeless. That  [[Page H2488]]  will be my commitment, that we continue to fight against that scourge  of homeless veterans who want to be reunited with their family members  who are in need of the services that will make them whole.   Finally, let me say this: As this Nation deals with default, we  cannot forget the veterans who will lose 30 million healthcare  appointments and will, in fact, suffer and not have a COLA. Remember  what happens when there is no bipartisan effort, and our friends  continue to insist on hostage taking. The people who lose out will be  the people who are, in fact, our very special veterans. I thank the CBC  for honoring our veterans in this way.                                time  1945    Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Waters).
