 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment. For  my constituents and my area, it is very important to them.   The amendment would prohibit permits for hunting and killing  endangered lions and elephants for trophies in various countries in  Africa--Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania.  [[Page H4955]]    Both the African elephant and lion are endangered species on the  verge of extinction. We have seen lion populations decline by 50  percent in the past decade. In Tanzania, the elephant population  declined by 60 percent between 2009 and 2014.   This amendment is critical to help ensure these creatures do not  become extinct. President Trump has called elephant hunting a ``horror  show.''   There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that trophy  hunting aids in helping to manage the population of these animals. If  this were the case, we would see an increase in the species, not a  dramatic decline of the elephant and lion populations.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), my co-chair of the Congressional Animal  Protection Caucus.                                time  1345     Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the chairwoman of the subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
