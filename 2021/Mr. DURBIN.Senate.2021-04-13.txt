I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, over the past several weeks, all eyes  have been on Georgia and the State legislation that is being considered  on voting rights of Georgia's citizens. In response to the new voting  restrictions the State's Governor signed into law last month, American  leaders from many walks of life responded. It has really brought the  issue of voter suppression to the forefront at the beginning of a  national debate.   We are told that hundreds--hundreds--of bill changes and amendments  are being offered in State legislatures across the country, all modeled  after the Georgia goal, the Georgia outline, of reducing the  opportunity to vote in America.   If you have a functioning democracy where people actually count  votes, the number of people who show up is as important as how they  vote, and I think the people in Georgia have realized that with this  new approach they are taking. There has been a broad condemnation of  the Georgia voting law, and it has inspired a display of unity in  support of our fundamental right to vote across America. It seems that  some of my Republican colleagues would rather silence the law's critics  than address the very real issues that the law creates.   Over the recess, the minority leader, Senator McConnell, issued a  warning to the leaders of corporations who were voicing their  opposition to the Georgia law. He said to them: You stay out of  politics. He apparently did not say ``Keep your money out of politics''  because he has been a fan of the Citizens United decision, which gives  those same corporations not only the opportunity but the experience of  spending millions of dollars in every election cycle to affect the  outcome.   I appreciate the Republican leader's newfound passion for addressing  the influence of big corporations, but rather than silencing leaders in  the private sector from speaking their minds, which is their  constitutional right, I would invite my Republican colleagues to join  Democrats in taking more meaningful steps to protect our political  system from corporate overreach.   They can join us if they wish in supporting the For the People Act,  the democracy defense bill. The For the People Act would limit the  influence of dark money and special interests in our politics, require  big money contributors and special interests to actually drop the veil  and show us who they are, and tighten the rules that affect the super  PACs. It is a commonsense solution for protecting every American's  First Amendment right to free speech, and it would level the playing  field of the political system so that everybody has an equal say.   I would also invite my Republican colleagues to revive the bipartisan  spirit of the Voting Rights Act. I can remember a time when renewal of  the Voting Rights Act was a virtually unanimous bipartisan effort.  Unfortunately, that changed, and the Supreme Court decision didn't make  it any easier. So we are trying with the John Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act to return to the days of bipartisanship in addressing  the issue of race and politics. It is especially important given the  scourge of voter suppression laws we have seen in State legislatures  across the country, Georgia being the most recent example.   This new Georgia law isn't new at all. It emerges from the playbook  that is over 120 years old. It goes all the way back to the 1890s, when  Reconstruction was followed by the Jim Crow era in the South, with the  creation of something known as the Mississippi Plan. Historian Dr.  Carol Anderson, who teaches at Emory University, has referred to the  Mississippi Plan, a template of State law, as ``a dizzying array of  poll taxes, literacy tests, understanding clauses, newfangled voter  registration rules, and `good character' clauses--all intentionally  racially discriminatory but dressed up in the genteel garb of bringing  `integrity' back to the voting booth.''   A politician who sought to replicate the Mississippi Plan in the  State of Virginia noted that their goal--he was very blunt in what he  said--noted their goal was to ``[eliminate] every [Black] voter who can  be gotten rid of, legally, without materially impairing the numerical  strength of the white electorate.''   Today's voter restrictions might not involve poll taxes, literacy  tests, or counting the number of beans in a jar, but like the laws  passed during the Jim Crow era, Georgia's new voting law is a  deliberate effort to suppress voters, particularly voters of color.  There is no other way to describe it when the law includes provisions  that make it harder for Georgians to vote.   Let me give you some examples. I read an article last week in the New  [[Page S1883]]  York Times, April 11. Nick Corasaniti and Reid Epstein did an analysis,  page by page, of what the Georgia law would do, and it was pretty clear  why they did it. President Biden won Georgia by just 11,779 votes-- 11,779--out of 5 million.   The new law that has been proposed and has been signed by the  Governor of Georgia will curtail ballot access for voters in booming  urban and suburban counties, home to many Democratic voters.   Another provision makes it a crime--a crime--to offer water to voters  waiting in line. Of course, those waiting in line tend to be in densely  populated communities and largely minority communities.   Some of the things that the Georgia law will do:         Voters will now have less time to request absentee ballots.        Georgia has cut by more than half the period during which       voters can request an absentee ballot, from . . . six months       . . . to less than three.        This will most certainly reduce the number of people       [seeking] absentee ballots and the number of people who       actually vote. In the last Presidential election--        And this is the key sentence that defines the goal of the       Georgia legislation.        In the last Presidential election, 1.3 million Georgians--      about 26 percent of the state's electorate--voted with       absentee ballots. Of those who returned absentee ballots last       year in 2020, 65 percent voted for [Joe] Biden and 34 percent       chose Donald J. Trump.    Do you understand why the Republican legislature wants to put an end  to the absentee ballot?         The shorter window will limit opportunities for get-out-      the-vote efforts and put strain on new local election boards,       which . . . have less time to process ballots.        There are strict new ID requirements for absentee ballots.        Previously, Georgia law required voters to simply sign       their absentee ballot applications. Now they . . . have to       provide a number from a driver's license or an equivalent       state-issued identification. This is virtually certain to       limit access.        It is now illegal [under the new Georgia law] for election       officials to mail out absentee ballot applications to all       voters.        When the coronavirus pandemic hit last year, Georgia's       [Republican] secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, . . .       mailed absentee ballot applications to every registered voter       in the state ahead of its June primary. This led to absentee       voting by record numbers of Georgians.        When Mr. Raffensperger didn't mail applications again for       the general election, several local government agencies did       so, particularly in Georgia's large urban counties.    This is a move that is now being made illegal by the law created by  the legislature and signed by Governor Kemp.         With the loss of automatically mailed applications, some       voters will invariably not request a ballot, since the       application served as a reminder to people that were eligible       to vote.    Keep in mind, it wasn't the ballot that was sent without  solicitation; it was an application that had to be returned by the  voter before they actually received the ballot. It was a reminder, one  that the Georgia legislature would like to drop   Speaking of dropping, ``drop boxes still exist for absentee ballots .  . . but barely.''         For the 2020 election in Georgia, there were 94 drop boxes       across the four counties that make up the core of       metropolitan Atlanta: Fulton, DeKalb--    They pronounce it ``DeKab''; we call it ``DeKalb.''       --and Gwinnett.    The new law limits the same 4 counties to a total of 23 drop boxes,  from 94 to 23. And it won't just be fewer drop boxes to deposit your  ballot. ``Instead of 24-hour access outdoors, the boxes [are] placed  indoors at government buildings and early-voting sites and will thus be  unavailable for voters to drop off their ballots'' in the evening and  nonbusiness hours, which means more reliance on mail and the  uncertainty of that.   With mobile voting centers--as they say in the New York Times, think  about ``an RV where you can vote''--``more than 11,200 people voted at  the two vehicles at Fulton County in the last election.'' These  vehicles traversed the county during voting periods, effectively  bringing polling sites to people. ``Georgia has now outlawed this  practice.''   Under the Georgia law, early voting has expanded at a lot of small  counties but not the most populous ones. The strict rules will affect  Georgians who actually work traditional hours for a living. They will  have less flexible schedules and fewer opportunities to vote.   I spoke to you about the single greatest outrage:         Offering food and water for voters waiting in line now       risks [criminal] misdemeanor charges.        Long lines for voting in Georgia are an unfortunate       reality, and are often found in the poor, densely populated       communities that tend to vote Democratic. During the primary       election last June, when temperatures hovered above 80       degrees with high humidity, multiple voting locations across       the State had lines in which voters waited more than two       hours.    Now they will be denied access to water and food.         If you go to the wrong polling place [under the new Georgia       law], it will be . . . harder to vote.    It put strict requirements there.         If election problems arise, a common occurrence, it is now       more difficult [even in court] to extend voting hours.        With a mix of changes to vote-counting, high-turnout       elections will probably mean long, long waits for results.    And we remember what happened last year when, during that period of  calculating, President Trump went to town with all sorts of bizarre  theories rejected by scores of courts as to voter fraud that never was  found.         Election officials can no longer accept third-party       funding, (a measure that nods to rightwing conspiracy       theories) [that President Trump is also peddling].        With an eye toward voter fraud, the state attorney general       [manages] an election hotline.        The Republican-controlled legislature has more control over       State Election Board.    The secretary of state, for his audacity in challenging Trump's vote  fraud theories, has been officially removed as a voting member of the  State election board by the legislature in Georgia.         The GOP-led legislature is empowered to suspend county       election officials.    The bottom line is this: The Georgians didn't waste any time taking a  look at the voting results where they lost two Senate seats for the  first time in history and decided that they had to change the rules.  Too many voters showed up, the wrong voters, so they decided to change  the rules and make it more difficult for those, particularly minority,  voters who wanted to come and express themselves by the right to vote.   So the question now is, What are we going to do about it? Well, the a  local chamber of commerce, Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines, and others have  made it clear that this is an outrage. It is one that we shouldn't  countenance or accept in the 21st century.   This, unfortunately, was an exercise in the 19th century to reenslave  African Americans after the Civil War. Sadly, vestiges of that  continued, right up until the 1960s when the new Civil Rights Act ended  up banning some of the most outrageous conduct that came out of the Jim  Crow era.   Now the Republican Party nationally, the Georgia Republican Party,  the Governor, and the legislature have decided to return to those days.  What a sad commentary it is on Mr. Lincoln's Republican Party.   It was embarrassing enough as a Democrat to realize that the earliest  stages of Jim Crow were created, conceived, and enforced by the  Democrats of their day. For the Republicans, they fought that effort,  as they should, in the name of Lincoln and what he brought to their  party nationally. Now, today, the tables have turned 180 degrees. It is  the Democrats who are trying to bring to the public's attention what is  happening in Georgia and in other States. It is sad that the  Republicans have decided that the only way to win an election is to  control the vote, that their ideas can't be sold anymore to voters  across this country.
