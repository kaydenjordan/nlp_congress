 Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Jimmy  Stringer, a dedicated member of my personal staff who left my office  recently to return to my home State of Mississippi. Jimmy merits  commendation for his contributions and dedicated service throughout his  role in public service, as well as a member of my personal office  staff.   A native of Madison, MS, Jimmy earned his bachelor's degree from  Mississippi State University. Jimmy's  [[Page S1291]]  humble beginnings in the U.S. Government started as an intern for the  late Senator Cochran, my predecessor.   Following that, Jimmy's career turned to the Pentagon, where he  supported the Air Force in its day-to-day operations. His outstanding  service there earned him the Secretary of the Air Force Technical and  Analytical Support Top Performer Award.   After 2 years at the Pentagon, Jimmy decided to focus his service  closer to home, accepting an opportunity to serve as military  legislative assistant in the office of Congressman Gregg Harper of  Mississippi.   Jimmy's service in the House of Representatives led him to the U.S.  Senate, where he became the military legislative assistant for my  office, where he excelled and eventually earned the additional title  and responsibilities of deputy legislative director.   Jimmy's contributions throughout his tenure in public service have  been truly invaluable to the legislative and administrative functions  of my office, and his insightful input will be missed.   I, along with the rest of my office, have benefited from Jimmy's  knowledge, experience, and leadership.   Anyone who has had the opportunity to meet and visit with Jimmy would  agree he is a hard-working, courteous, and intelligent young man.   Jimmy's strong sense of responsibility, good judgment, and a pleasant  demeanor set him apart as a leader in our office and proved time and  time again to be an asset for the people of Mississippi.   In fact, Jimmy has always put Mississippi first. No matter the  situation or how high the stakes, the needs of the State came first.  While many have been caught up in the demands of Washington, DC,  politics, Jimmy's focus has always remained hundreds of miles south of  the beltway. Mississippians knew if they had a problem, Jimmy Stringer  would help them find a solution.   Mississippi and our Nation have been well-served by the diligence,  dedication, and commitment to excellence Jimmy Stringer provided on a  daily basis. He has put forth his best efforts to reflect credit on our  military, the House of Representatives, my State, and the U.S. Senate.   I will miss Jimmy's astute counsel. He has my appreciation and  gratitude for the notable job he has done throughout his time here in  Washington, especially within my office.   I wish Jimmy, his wonderful wife Frances, and beautiful daughter  Price God's continued blessings and all the best in their future  endeavors.                            ____________________
