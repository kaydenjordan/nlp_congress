 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the chairman of the  House Foreign Affairs Committee, for yielding, and I am glad that I  made it.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 311, which I did  introduce, to honor 75 years of friendship between the United States  and Israel.   The decades-long partnership between our nations underpins security  in the Middle East and promotes economic growth throughout the region.   Tonight marks the beginning of Israel's 75th Independence Day, a  remarkable milestone that celebrates the establishment of a democratic  Jewish homeland.   I have had the privilege to travel to Israel several times as a  Member of Congress; from Jerusalem to the West Bank.   I met so many wonderful and welcoming people there: parents and  businesspeople who simply yearn for peace in their region. Being on the  ground in the Holy Land was among the most moving experiences of my  life.   The United States was the very first Nation to stand in recognition  of Israel at its founding in 1948, and I am proud of what our countries  have accomplished together.   The signing of the Abraham Accords more than 2 years ago heralded an  unprecedented opportunity for growth in the Middle East and beyond.   Already, the Abraham Accords have proven to be enduring and fruitful,  contributing to regional stability and a sense of kinship between  Israel and its neighbors.   As a founding co-chair of the Abraham Accords Caucus, I have been  delighted to meet so many young people, entrepreneurs, innovators, and  leaders who are working to establish relationships of trust and  appreciation and lay the foundations for a prosperous future.   These efforts will have region-wide implications, encouraging  sustained economic growth, peace, and stability.   This resolution urges other nations to normalize relations with  Israel and ensure that existing agreements continue to reap tangible  security and economic benefits for all peoples in the region.   We must all, however, be frank in recognizing the immense security  challenges facing Abraham Accords countries.   Iran is closer than ever before to joining the ranks of nuclear  powers, a terrifying prospect for us all, but especially so for Israel  and its neighbors.   H. Res. 311 calls for continued support for United States security  assistance to Israel so that Israel can defend herself.  [[Page H1931]]    However, security cooperation must be accompanied by real and  sustained progress on eliminating anti-Semitism, an abhorrent ideology  that continues to impede expansion of the accords and poison  international institutions.    To secure universal acceptance of Israel's inherent right to exist,  my resolution calls for Israel's robust participation in the community  of nations.   Israel is a force for peace and a beacon of democracy in a  challenging region. At a time of heightened anti-Semitism across the  globe, it is more important than ever that we maintain our strong  connection to this very key ally.   I thank my colleagues, Representatives Manning, McCaul, and  Schneider, for joining together in introducing this resolution.   They are all true champions of the U.S.-Israel alliance, and I have  had the pleasure of working with them for many years to advance this  essential relationship.   I congratulate the people of Israel on their 75th anniversary of  their independence, and I urge each of my colleagues to support H. Res.  311.                                time  1700
