 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his leadership in  guiding the Financial CHOICE Act through the Financial Services  Committee and the House.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Arkansas  State Bank Department, and an article by the Arkansas Bankers  Association entitled ``Disappearing Community Banks.''                                                      Arkansas State                                                 Bank Department,                                                        May 1, 2017.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, House Committee on Financial Services, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Financial Services,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: I am       writing in support of H.R. 10, the ``Financial CHOICE Act of       2017.'' As a state bank regulator, I have seen the huge       burden Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 has placed on community banks.       Since the financial crisis, several community banks in       Arkansas have curtailed or discontinued lending activities--      particularly, residential mortgages--which has been       detrimental to the consumers they serve. In addition, the       number of small community banks in our state and across the       country has decreased, primarily through mergers with larger       banks better equipped to handle Dodd-Frank's onerous       compliance regimen.        I believe the Financial CHOICE Act will address a number of       issues which will improve the business climate for community       banks. In particular, providing broad regulatory relief to       banks with an average leverage capital ratio of at least 10       percent will enhance our community banks ability to serve the       public. With fewer financial and employee resources allocated       to compliance issues, community banks will be able to       increase lending to businesses and individuals, which will       stimulate much-needed economic growth in their communities.       Additionally, I strongly believe the leverage capital ratio       is a better standard by which to assess a bank's health than       risk-based measures.        Thank you for your work in advancing the Financial CHOICE       Act. I greatly appreciate your efforts to help community       banks.            Sincerely,                                                 Candace A. Franks,      Commissioner.                                   ____                    [From the Arkansas Banker Association]                        Disappearing Community Banks      (By Bill Holmes, President & CEO, Arkansas Bankers Association)         In 1994 I was working for the original Twin City Bank. We       were in a bank wide campaign to break a billion dollars in       assets. There were 260 banks headquartered in Arkansas.       Today, there are 103. If we continue to lose community banks       at the same pace our small businesses, home buyers and       farmers will have only a third of the bank choices they       enjoyed in 1994. This is a problem for our mostly rural       state. And it is not just a local problem, it is happening       across the country.        There are any number of reasons for this decline in       community banks. For the last ten years, the reason I hear       more than any other is the increasing cost of the federal       regulatory burden. The costs of complying with regulations       that should never have been intended for rural banks, the       costs of training more and more staff for compliance issues,       the cost of newly required software to feed a never ending       appetite for data.        I will grant you that after the financial crisis some       regulatory changes were necessary to improve financial       stability. But ten years later we've ended up with too many       regs that don't improve our banks, but do limit our bankers'       discretion and look to drive credit decisions to a score       sheet designed inside the beltway. Our community bankers have       decades of history on their customers, and have always been a       key to the economic growth in their communities. I don't       think the intent of these regulations was to limit the       growth, or limit the home buyers, in our state. But the fact       is it does. And, it is time to fix this.        Chairman Hensarling's The Financial CHOICE Act was recently       sent to the floor for a vote. It includes multiple changes       that our banking industry endorses, and we feel we need these       changes to help spur the economy. This legislation would ease       some requirements on mortgages that banks hold in their own       portfolios. This would let our bankers make many more loans       to self-employed businessmen, or entrepreneurs with unstable       incomes. The Act looks to tailor the regs and requirements       based on the risks and business types of each bank. We need       this to continue to give our customers more diversity and       more choices of where and how to bank.        The U.S. economy is unique. We need a healthy and broad mix       of banks to meet our customers' needs. From international       corporations, to the startup food truck, our bankers are       involved and are integral parts of our economy. If we cannot       get sensible reform in Washington, Arkansas's banking sector       will continue to shrink and become less diverse. Arkansans,       and all Americans, will pay the price in terms of less       lending and fewer opportunities for growth.     Mr. Chairman, in this debate today, let's hear what a  commissioner of banking from Arkansas says:   ``I am writing in support of H.R. 10, the `Financial CHOICE Act of  2017.' As a State bank regulator, I have seen the huge burden Dodd- Frank Act of 2010 has placed on community banks. Since the financial  crisis, several community banks in Arkansas have curtailed or  discontinued lending activities--particularly, residential mortgages-- which has been detrimental to the consumers they serve.''   That is a compelling endorsement of this bill from a regulator, Mr.  Chairman, not from a Member of Congress.   And when you look at working families in Arkansas, recently I was  told about an Army National Guard member from north Little Rock, in my  district, who was informed that he would not receive a home to purchase  a manufactured home that would have been twice as large and less  expensive than the 60-year-old house he was renting for his family.   Or a hairstylist from Nevada County, who I received a letter from.  She and her husband, a welder, were denied a loan to purchase a new  home, despite having verifiable income.   That is why we need to repeal, replace, and pass the Financial CHOICE  Act.
