 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to  recognize and thank a friend and confidant who has been by my side for  the last 15 years.   I first met my chief of staff, Robert Colby Hale, when he was 22  years old. I was the commencement speaker at his graduation ceremony at  Hardin-Simmons University, and he introduced me on stage.   In that moment, I never imagined so many years later our paths would  take us to the Texas secretary of state's office in Austin and now to  the U.S. House of Representatives.   I gave Colby his first job and watched him grow from a recent college  graduate into the husband, father, and professional that he is today.   He has been my right-hand man since before I decided to run for  Congress in 2012. He believed in me, and he encouraged me every single  day.   There is no one's counsel that I have trusted more. Colby will be  missed around our office, but he is leaving his legacy in the capable  hands of those he trained and those he mentored.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 25th Congressional District of Texas  and the United States Congress, I thank Mr. Colby Hale. I thank him for  his years  [[Page H1253]]  of service to this district and to the American people.   I am excited to see where life takes him next, and he should know  that he will always be on the home team.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
