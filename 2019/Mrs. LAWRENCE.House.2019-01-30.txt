 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 790, the  Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019.   Our federal civilian workforce, who continued to work without pay  through a record-long 35-day shutdown, deserves to be fairly  compensated for their dedication to our country.   Often unnoticed, this group includes TSA agents who ensure our  airports and air travel is safe, the FBI, which actively combats  terrorism, and CBP agents, who diligently protect our borders. These  heroic employees deserve to see their salary reflect the important and  selfless work they do on behalf of the United States.   The civilian federal workforce also includes FDA personnel who ensure  the food we eat is safe, National Park rangers who patrol and maintain  our beautiful national parks, and IRS employees who work tirelessly to  process and distribute tax refunds to Americans all over this country.   Mr. Chair, these federal workers dedicate their lives to serving the  American people and this great nation--it is about time we return the  favor by ensuring they are fairly compensated for their hard work.
