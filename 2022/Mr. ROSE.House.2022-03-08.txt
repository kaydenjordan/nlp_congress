 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of every American  being negatively affected by inflation caused by President Biden and  congressional Democrats' reckless spending policies over the last year.   Inflation isn't something that happens overnight. It occurs as a  direct result of the bills passed right here in this body and the  President's executive actions. Since President Biden stepped foot in  the Oval Office and Democrats gained control of both branches of  Congress, their actions have directly resulted in the highest inflation  levels in 40 years, since the year I was a junior in high school.   I recall when President Biden and congressional Democrats' first  legislative priority was a $1.9 trillion bill disguised as COVID  relief, but in reality, only 9 percent of funds went directly to  combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, it was a Progressive wish  list of socialist ideas designed to transform American society from one  of capitalism to socialism. Even the White House called it the most  progressive piece of legislation in the history of the United States.    After that, Democrats wasted the entire legislative year using the  budget reconciliation process to bypass the Senate filibuster and to  pass their so-called infrastructure bill which was, in  [[Page H1343]]  reality, another piece of legislation costing more than $1 trillion,  that builds more debt than it builds bridges or roads.   When the bill passed the House, inflation was already on the rise,  and gas prices had increased 50 percent over the prior year. Instead of  addressing these issues before they got out of hand, Democrats have  used their political capital in an attempt to reshape the very fabric  of our society and take another giant leap toward the United States  becoming another socialist country. As a consequence, the cost of  everything has continued to rise while inflation rages on with reckless  abandon and no end in sight.   Unfortunately, the madness did not end there. Despite already passing  two bills with price tags over a trillion dollars, President Biden and  congressional Democrats saved the worst of all for last--their build  back broke bill that was thankfully defeated in the Senate but would  have added a staggering $5 trillion in new spending.   In just 1 year, House Democrats passed legislation equating to almost  $10 trillion which, unbelievably, amounts to a full one-third of the  current U.S. national debt. They acted like kids in a candy store with  their parents' credit card. But in reality, their actions are even  worse than that because in this case they are actually using their  children's and grandchildren's and great-grandchildren's credit card,  and even though they have more than maxed out the credit card, new  purchases are never declined.   Economists warned of an impending recession as we got closer to  reaching the debt limit last year. America's fiscal house was flooding,  and the Democrats chose to raise the roof rather than stop the  flooding. On a party-line vote, Democrats voted to impose the largest  nominal increase in the debt cap in the history of our country, and in  doing so, once again denied all reality that their out-of-control  spending would directly result in inflation, the steep and cruel tax  levied on all Americans.   You would think that after passing so many spending bills in the  trillions of dollars that they would be able to pass a standard  government funding bill, but you would be wrong. Congressional  Democrats and President Biden have not achieved this once; in fact, we  are already almost halfway through the current fiscal year and, in an  ironic twist, are still operating under the spending priorities of  President Donald Trump; that is, until the House votes on the  Democratic appropriations bills tomorrow, which we have yet to read and  will likely cost taxpayers additional trillions of dollars.   Trillions of dollars spent, and what do we have to show for it?  Higher prices on everything, real wages for all Americans declining,  and an economy dependent on government expenditures. We are getting  exactly what President Biden and congressional Democrats want:  Socialism. These are not the ideals on which America was founded. Every  step they take diminishes capitalism, the engine of our economy and the  engine of our standard of living, and it also diminishes freedom, the  engine of our national soul. But regrettably, that is President Biden's  America.   The fact of the matter is that President Biden's administration will  stop at nothing to satisfy their far-left base.                            ____________________
