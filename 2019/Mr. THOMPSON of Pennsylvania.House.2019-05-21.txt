 Madam Speaker, exactly 100 years ago  today, this House passed the 19th Amendment. On June 4, 1919, the  Senate approved it.   The women's right to vote began the race to ratification, requiring  three-fourths of the 48 States to ratify it before it was added to the  Constitution. That happened on August 26, 1920.   Madam Speaker, a woman having the right to vote is not at all  controversial today. However, in 1848, when the first women's rights  convention was held in Seneca Falls, New York, the issue was so  contentious that the group of mostly women only narrowly passed  including voting rights in their Declaration of Sentiments.   We know some of the leaders of the movement, like Susan B. Anthony,  Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Ida B. Wells, but there are thousands of  other women whose names will never be known. They also gave heart and  courage to ensuring equality for women.   The passage of the 19th Amendment ensured that all Americans were  included in steering our Nation toward the future. One hundred years  later, it remains just as important.                            ____________________
