 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  Healthcare     Mr. President, our Constitution begins with three simple  words: ``We the People.'' The Founders wrote that in supersized font to  remind us that this is what our Nation is all about. It is not about  power by the privileged. It is not the elite. It is not to make the  wealthy wealthier. It is not to add more to the abundance of those who  already have much. It is to establish government that reflects the will  of the people or, as President Lincoln put it, ``of the people, by the  people, for the people.''   In this age where vast sums are spent on campaigns by a few  billionaires to basically substitute government of, by, and for the  people with government of, by, and for the powerful, we have an  enormous challenge to maintain the integrity of the mission of our  Constitution and the responsibility of this Senate.   We probably haven't seen a challenge to ``we the people'' in years  like the equivalent of TrumpCare. Certainly, it is designed to plan for  massive tax giveaways to the wealthiest Americans of hundreds of  billions of dollars and to rip healthcare away from 20 to 30 million  ordinary working families.   What a travesty that is of our responsibility under our Constitution.  What amazingly misguided effort to do damage, rather than to assist and  provide a foundation for families to thrive.   A few years ago, a woman came up to me at a fundraiser for multiple  sclerosis--a walk--and she said: Things are so different this year,  Senator, than they were last year.   I asked her: How so?   She said: A year ago, if our loved one was diagnosed with MS and they  had  [[Page S6166]]  insurance, they were likely to have an annual cap or a lifetime cap and  run out of coverage.   That was a terrible situation to be in because MS is a mysterious and  expensive disease.   She said: If the individual didn't have insurance, they now had a  preexisting condition, and they wouldn't able to get insurance.   She said: Now, we have the peace of mind that if our loved one gets  an MS diagnosis, that individual will be able to get the care they  need.   Isn't that the summary of what we should be seeking in our healthcare  system--the peace of mind that if our child or our loved one becomes  ill, if our child or our loved one becomes injured, he or she will get  the care they need? Shouldn't that be what we are fighting for?    Instead, we had the opposite. We had the TrumpCare bill that was  designed to rip peace of mind away, destroy peace of mind, trample all  over peace of mind so the wealthy could have more giveaways from the  Federal Treasury.   We had that House bill, and it was estimated that 23 million people  would lose healthcare over 10 years and that our hospitals and our  clinics would have a lot less funding to be able to provide care to  everyone. Yet it passed the House. Then President Trump got briefed on  what was in the bill after he held a champagne party at the White House  and celebrated its passage. He said: Oh, wait. This bill is mean and  heartless.   Over here in the Senate, the Senate's secret 13 went to work to try  to produce a bill without holding any public hearings or having any  discussions with stakeholders. They were secreted away in a room, and  no one could find out where they were in order to be able to offer any  insights. They did not hold any townhalls back home, and they had no  meetings here. The public was totally blocked out. The secret 13,  amazingly, came up with an almost identical bill to the House bill. Oh,  the estimate was instead, maybe, of there being 23 million people who  would lose insurance, 22 million people would lose insurance.  Fortunately, the secret 13 bill was defeated--but just barely--here in  this Chamber.   Then came another version of this called the fake insurance bill.  This fake insurance version said: Hey, let's let the insurance  companies put out policies that are really, really cheap but that do  not actually cover anything. Won't that make us feel good that everyone  in America will be able to afford a policy that only costs $40 or $50 a  month.   Of course, fake insurance is fake; that is, when you go to the  emergency room, it does not cover the visit. When you get a blood test,  it does not cover the blood test. When you get an x ray or an MRI, it  does not pay for it. Oh, don't even begin to think about its covering  hospitalization or any other normal medical service because it is fake  insurance. The fake insurance bill failed by a few votes on the Senate  floor.   Then we had repeal without replacement, and that failed. Then we had  the skinny bill, and that failed by a single vote.   How is it possible that we came that close to passing a bill that is  completely the opposite of the vision of our Constitution--to legislate  for the foundation, for the American people, not the American  privileged and not the American powerful. Yet it came within a vote of  passing.   This week, we have the block grant version--the block grant version  that proceeds to destroy immediately the exchanges, the healthcare  marketplaces. Of course, the great irony is, that was the Republican  idea: Let's create a marketplace within which people can compare  individual policies, pick the ones best for their families, and get tax  credits to be able to buy them. So the Republicans came out against  their own plan.   In addition, it wiped out Medicaid expansion. In my home State of  Oregon, the exchange is responsible for roughly another 100,000 people  getting access to insurance, the marketplace, and 400,000 people  gaining access through Medicaid expansion. There are a half a million  Americans in just my State, my humble State of Oregon. Yet here was a  bill that said: We do not care. We are going to wipe out healthcare for  a half a million Oregonians and untold millions across the country--20  to 30 million across the country.   We owe a big thank-you to grassroots America. We owe a big thank-you  to ordinary citizens who believe in the vision of this country. They  proceeded to connect with Capitol Hill--to fill the streets and to  flood the phones and to overflow our inboxes--saying: What are you  doing? Please stop. Please stop trying to destroy the peace of mind of  Americans. They said: Make healthcare work better, not worse.   Is that really too much for us to ask?   As we ponder how to make healthcare work better, those in grassroots  America have expressed a lot of ideas. They have said: We have a really  complicated system that creates all kinds of obstacles for ordinary  families, for working families.   For example, consider whether you have a job that provides you with  insurance and your family with insurance but then the company changes  the policy and only covers you. How are you going to get your children  covered? Are you going to be able to get them signed up right away in  the Children's Health Insurance Program? How do you go about doing  that?   Then your employer says: By the way, you now have to start paying us  in order for us to provide you with healthcare.   You say: Wow. That is a huge chunk out of my check. Can I possibly  afford that and still pay my rent? Am I going to have to choose between  healthcare and homelessness? It is not a choice families should have to  make.   Then, perhaps, people are working several part-time jobs, and their  employers have no healthcare programs at all, so they sign up for the  Oregon Health Plan or the equivalent Medicaid plan across the country.  They might like that, but it is complicated to apply, and they have to  reapply periodically. What happens if their incomes go up just a  little, and now they are over the line for eligibility? As a result of  being over the line, they now have to go back into the individual  markets. How do you do that in the middle of the year when it is not an  open enrollment period?   There is such complexity, such difficulty. That is why it is so  appealing to think about the vision of a seamless, simple healthcare  program that you have that will provide quality healthcare when you  need it--portable healthcare--just by virtue of your being an American.  That is a beautiful vision, and it is not out of reach. Every other  developed country has found some version of that and made it a reality.  We need to ponder as to how to have that seamless, simple system down  the road, but right now we have a more immediate task.    That immediate task is to stop the sabotage of the healthcare system  we have. President Trump has engaged in many maneuvers to try to force  the collapse of the insurance markets. One is to withhold the cost- sharing payments from insurers so they no longer have the funds they  were promised. That uncertainty has caused many companies to say: Do  not count on us to be in that market in the future if we cannot count  on you, the Federal Government, to honor your obligations.   Why isn't the Senate body demanding that the President honor the  obligations of those cost-sharing payments?   In addition, we have the President shutting down advertising during  the open period so people will not know they can sign up. We have  President Trump cutting the enrollment period in half. We have a plan  now from the administration to cut the funds for consumer outreach and  enrollment assistance, which enables folks who need to get healthcare  to find out how they can actually get through the complicated  application process.   Most recently, the administration announced it is actually going to  shut down the website periodically on weekends during the open  enrollment period, which is when people will have the time and effort  and ability to apply. They are going to shut down the website so people  will not be able to apply during portions of the weekend.   All of us should unite--100 Senators should unite--and tell President  Trump: Enough of this sabotage. If you want to drive up insurance  policies by 20 percent over any other increase they might otherwise  have and if you want  [[Page S6167]]  to be responsible for millions of people not gaining access because of  your irresponsibility, then we are going to hold you accountable for  it. Everybody in grassroots America is going to hold you accountable  for it.   Fortunately, we have a bipartisan process that has been underway to  remedy these conditions. I, profoundly, thank Lamar Alexander, chair of  the HELP Committee, and Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the HELP  Committee, for saying: Let's have the normal, rational process that we  go through to try to understand how we can improve the healthcare  system.   They have held a series of hearings. They have brought in the  experts, and they have brought in the stakeholders. They have done it  in front of the public so the public can weigh in. They have consulted  constituents and encouraged all of us to consult with our constituents  and be part of that conversation. Pragmatic, experienced legislators  are gaining expertise from those on the frontline so they can make the  system work better. Isn't that the way the Senate is supposed to work?   Their work shows a lot of promise. There are some very  straightforward things they have heard from those experts.   They have heard we need to lock down the cost-sharing payments. No  insurance companies are going to be in the insurance markets if they do  not know they are going to get paid what they have been promised or  they are going to raise their premiums incredibly high to cover the  risk that they will not get paid. Then, of course, people will not be  able to afford that insurance.   They have heard from the experts that you have to have reinsurance.  If you want to have this private marketplace in which people can  compare policies and use tax credits to buy the policies, an insurance  company will not enter that market unless it has its own insurance  policy against getting the disproportionate share of the really sick  people. Of reinsurance, they have heard.   They have also heard we must not suppress outreach to those who need  insurance but increase outreach--outreach to younger, healthier people  to make sure they are part of the exchange as well as outreach to those  who are often working several part-time jobs and have little time to  focus on this question unless someone reaches out and says: Here is  your opportunity. We are now in the open period. Here is how you sign  up, and we can make sure you get that done.   In that set of hearings, they heard other things. They heard we need  to do more to take on the challenge of mental illness in America. They  heard we need to do more to take on drug addiction, the opioid epidemic  in America.   There it is--a list of a modest number of things we could do together  to make our healthcare work better. Wouldn't that be a beautiful  closing chapter to the nightmare, the repeated horror stories we have  been playing in the Senate that threaten to rip healthcare from  millions of people and simply awaken from that war over healthcare and  work together to address these fundamental questions.   We actually have had public hearings in the HELP Committee, which we  have not done before. We have actually listened to the experts, which  we have not done before. We have actually encouraged people to consult  with their constituents rather than to hide from their constituents.  The result would be a significant strengthening of what we have--lower  premiums as a result, more competition in the exchanges, more awareness  of how to sign up, more and healthier young people getting involved in  the exchanges, which means the premiums will come down.   I think, as we ponder the goal of our healthcare system--the question  of peace of mind--that is our best immediate step forward to provide  peace of mind, to end the sabotage of the system we have, and address  the shortcomings the healthcare experts and the people of America have  pointed out.   Let us be that mission statement under this vision of a ``we the  people'' government, in that we pursue healthcare that is designed for  the people of America in order to create peace of mind, so when their  loved ones become ill or when their loved ones are injured, they will  get the care they need, and they will not end up bankrupt. We should be  able to make that happen.   Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Jessica Rosenblatt, be granted privileges of the floor for the  remainder of the day.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
