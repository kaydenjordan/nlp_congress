 Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to talk about a  constituent in my district, Jacki Dixon Marsh. Jacki is an  entrepreneur. She owns a historic storefront in downtown Loveland. In  fact, she is the only woman who owns commercial space in the  neighborhood. She runs a gallery featuring the work of over 100 local  artisans, actively supporting jobs and contributing to our community.   Jacki was also a competitive long-distance runner. In 1972, she won  the first women's only road race in New York, and she continues to run.   Finally, she has a pacemaker. She suffers from cardiomyopathy, a rare  heart disease she developed after contracting the flu. While the doctor  gave her only 2 years to live, she exceeded that prognosis by three  decades, but her health depends on replacing her pacemaker every 7 to 8  years.   Jacki is one of countless Americans for whom insurance through the  Affordable Care Act is literally a matter of life or death. She says  she pays a lot for her coverage, about 900 a month, but she told me she  is excited to pay it. Before the Affordable Care Act, her precondition  meant no coverage at all.   When I asked Jacki what message she wanted me to share with my  colleagues in Congress, she made clear that I should share the message  that her situation is not unique. We need to act to make sure that  people like Jacki continue to have healthcare coverage rather than  ending the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that they rely on.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentleman for the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying  bills.   I start by, again, mentioning the fact that we have before us, under  this rule, H.R. 238, the Commodity End-User Relief Act, and H.R. 78,  the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act. I will talk about them in a  minute.   There are 56 Members of this body who are new Members and who had no  chance to participate in marking up  [[Page H318]]  these bills in their committees of jurisdiction. Sure, I am back and  Mr. Newhouse is back, but 56 people who were in that Congress in  December are not here now, and there are 56 new people.   Again, a regular order process would allow these bills to go through  committee and have ideas and the participation from Democrats and  Republicans, who represent, collectively, tens of millions of people in  this country, in improving these bills. We did not allow it. These  bills just appeared fait accompli in the Rules Committee yesterday.  Here we are on the floor. None of the new Members had a chance in their  committees to offer them.                                time  1245    In fact, I am not sure where the Republicans are in their process,  but Democrats are still finalizing our committee assignments. We have  some of them, and the rest will be completed shortly.   For Congress to work well, we need to have regular order. And for  regular order to work, we need to make sure that the 56 new Members who  represent tens of millions of people are not disenfranchised in this  process.   Now, getting to the bills. H.R. 238, the Commodities End-User Relief  Act, has been brought to the floor even before the Agriculture  Committee convened or held its organizing meeting. It reauthorizes the  Commodities Futures Trading Commission through 2021. It makes a lot of  changes to internal changes and modifies a number of provisions that  were designed to prevent financial meltdowns.   Additionally, H.R. 238 includes language on issues that the  Commodities Futures Trading Commission has already addressed through  its own efforts. For example, the Commodities Future Trading Commission  has acted on 16 of 22 provisions in titles I and III. Particularly,  many of us are concerned by the cross-border language in the bill,  which would undercut efforts already underway by the Commission to  negotiate an international system of safe and robust derivative rules.   H.R. 238 would actually require the Commodities Futures Trading  Commission to create a rule that would automatically allow U.S. banks  and foreign banks conducting business in the U.S. to do so under the  rules imposed by foreign jurisdictions, which can be substantially  different than those of our own, removing the confidence in the  marketplace that is needed for a commodity market to work.   Finally, as you know, Congress passed a number of reforms to enable  regulators to respond quickly to changing markets. The provisions in  title II would weaken the CFTC's ability to respond in a timely and  effective manner.   The financial services industry continues to innovate. It is  important that regulators keep pace and prevent systemic risks, prevent  meltdowns, prevent bailouts. This bill would make it harder to do that.   An example of how the Commission is engaged with and talking about  innovation is how to fully embrace emerging technologies like  blockchain and decentralized distribution ledgers. They are doing that  because many financial firms are focusing on how to incorporate this  technology into their business models. Therefore, it is imperative the  Commission is given the ability to stay involved and understand the  implications of new technology and innovations and is not hamstrung by  this overly prescriptive law.   Now, the Commission does need reauthorization, and I would love the  opportunity to work with my colleagues on the other side to do so. It  should be in a thoughtful, bipartisan manner that gives the agency the  ability it needs to effectively look at incredibly complicated  financial transactions, make sure that consumers and users of  commodities that hedge their risks are not abused in the process. We do  not want to hamstring the agency by unnecessary and counterproductive  requirements as this bill does.   The other bill, H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act, also  was brought forward before the Financial Services Committee got  organized. This bill was not even considered by the House last  Congress, and it stalled in the Financial Services Committee. So you  actually have a bill that didn't even clear committee last Congress. I  was complaining about how the 56 Members that are new to this body  didn't have a chance to put their imprint on the first bill. The second  bill didn't even make it through the Financial Services Committee and  didn't even pass the House floor last session. Yet, here it is without  the appropriate committee consideration, depriving new Members  representing tens of millions of Americans--Democratic and Republican-- the ability to improve this bill.   Under the guise of regulation changes, H.R. 78 would actually require  the SEC to conduct enhanced cost-benefit analysis in order to ensure  that benefits of their regulation justify the cost. In effect, the bill  directs the SEC to look at things like market liquidity and small  businesses, which, of course, it already does as part of its economic  analysis. So, again, it is a bill that would bury the SEC in regulatory  paperwork.   H.R. 78's cost-benefit analysis is weighted toward helping large  financial institutions save money. I support reducing costs for  financial institutions. Who wouldn't? But that is not the primary drive  of our regulatory structure. We should put consumers and our systemic  risks first and foremost and, of course, where we can reduce the  unnecessary costs for our financial institutions in the hope that those  would be passed along to those they serve.   I, therefore, oppose both of these bills. I oppose the rule that  limits the opportunity for Members to offer amendments to these two  pieces of legislation. I oppose this process that disenfranchises our  new Members.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   When we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to  the rule to bring up legislation that would require the President and  Vice President of the United States, their spouses and dependent  children to disclose and divest any personal financial holdings that  could create a conflict of interest by placing them in a blind trust.  This has been standard for previous Presidents, and this legislation  ensures that that precedent continues.   In today's news conference moments ago, President-elect Trump said  that he did not plan to follow with precedent and place his assets in a  blind trust and would continue his direct ownership interest in them.  President-elect Trump has refused to release his tax returns, refused  to resolve conflicts of interest related to his business dealings. The  American people expect the President to do what is best for the country  and not what is best for his business or his pocket.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 5 minutes to  the distinguished gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the lead  sponsor of the bill that I am proud to cosponsor.    Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 5 minutes to  the distinguished gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the lead  sponsor of the bill that I am proud to cosponsor.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   I just want to emphasize how important it is that we defeat the  previous question. There are so many questions that have been raised.  Not only is it in keeping with longstanding precedent for the President  to divest and place their assets in a blind trust, but it is more  important than ever with this President who has a complex web of  assets, nationally and internationally, which are rife with conflicts  of interest for the incoming administration.   I truly hope we can act in a bipartisan way to defeat the previous  question and bring forward Ms. Clark's simple, straightforward bill. It  affects future Presidents, Republican and Democratic, and it is a very  simple, commonsense piece of legislation simply saying that they will  divest and place their assets in a blind trust, something that is  important for both the appearance of propriety as well as for the sake  of propriety.   And yet instead of focusing on legislation to investigate foreign  powers undermining our recent election, instead of focusing on  preventing conflicts of interest for the incoming administration,  instead of focusing on legislation that would create jobs, reduce our  deficit, or improve on health care, instead we have partisan  legislation that hasn't gone through regular order. It has left 56 new  Members representing tens of millions of Americans on the sideline.   The House passed a lot of legislation last Congress. That does not  mean that we should bring every bill directly to the floor and skip the  committee process, because there are 56 new Members who should also  have a chance to put their imprint on legislation. The way the majority  is bringing bills to the floor, it ignores the concerns of the American  public; it ignores pressing issues related to the incoming President.   We have this window of time under the outgoing President to send a  bill to his desk to require disclosure and divestment from the new  President, but that window is rapidly closing. We will only have  President Obama in the White House for another week, so time is running  short.   If we act now and defeat the previous question, hopefully the Senate  will act within a few days, and we can get the bill to President Obama.  But the timeline is very, very short to do this. I do not expect that  Mr. Trump would sign a bill that puts additional requirements on  himself, although he would perhaps change that bill to affect future  Presidents because it needs to be done. It is kind of shocking that we  relied on precedents rather than law in this area.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the previous question  so I can bring forward Ms. Clark's bill as my amendment. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on the underlying bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be  followed by 5-minute votes on agreeing to the resolution, if ordered;  and suspending the rules and passing H.R. 39.
