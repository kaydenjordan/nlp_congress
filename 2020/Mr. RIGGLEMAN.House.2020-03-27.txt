 Mr. Speaker, it wasn't so long ago that our country  experienced an event that would bring Americans together to fight a  common enemy and help those in need.   On September 11, 2001, America experienced the worst act of terrorism  in its history. The resolve and patriotism I felt that day, as a  warfighter, is so very similar to the resolve and patriotism I feel  today.   Government can do some things for the American people. The CARES Act  is not perfect, but it provides much-needed funds for medical  equipment, support for small businesses, and additional tools to fight  the crisis. This bill is a step forward, and when combined with the  same American spirit that brought us through 9/11 and crises past, we  can come out of this stronger.   The true strength of our great Nation is what people do for each  other. Rugged individualism turns into compassionate sacrifice. The  charity of American spirit expands and envelops all others. We see  those in need. We act. We volunteer. We lead. We step into the breach.   Almost nothing perfect comes out of government. Service, however,  demands that we put forth a perfect effort to do the best we can.
