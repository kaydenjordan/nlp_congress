 Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 3, 2021, on page H1036, the following appeared:   Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     [[Page H1037]]      Madam Speaker, what happened to George Floyd is  atrocious, it is criminal, and the policeman will be held accountable;  he has got to be.   But that has nothing to do with eliminating immunity for countless  policemen across the country. This bill does not properly address or  prevent what happened in poor George Floyd's case.   Why would we have a bill that eliminates immunity for anybody  charging the Capitol, breaking in illegally? They would be able to sue  the police in the future, tie them up in court. Why would we do that?  Because if we do this--follow the money--then the unions will be  selling a lot of liability insurance; it will be the biggest fundraiser  they have ever had.   Let's get together and come together on a bill that will not just  raise money, not just hire more lawyers, but will solve the problem of  the death, as criminal as it was, of George Floyd.    Madam Speaker, there needs to be comment about the way  the schedule was totally transformed, once again.   What drove this change?   We were supposed to be debating the George Floyd bill tomorrow.  George Floyd deserves a better bill than he got, a bipartisan bill that  we would certainly be willing to work with the Democrats on, but they  didn't want our help. We rushed through and did it tonight.   We asked: What was the reason for the dramatic change? Is somebody  ashamed of what we are bringing and they want to do it late at night?   We were told: No. There is concern from somebody that the QAnon- announced inauguration will be tomorrow, so we need to get out of town.   Apparently, there is somebody that believes it. I don't know anybody  on our side, but perhaps the Speaker and the majority leader are the  believers in QAnon. Nobody else here that I know of.                            ____________________
