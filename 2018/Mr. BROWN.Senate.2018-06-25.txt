 Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murray, I ask  unanimous consent that a fellow on Senator Murray's Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee staff, Lori Achman, be granted floor  privileges through August 3, 2018.    Mr. President, last Friday was a dark day for American  workers and a dark day for the American auto industry. On the very same  day that General Motors laid off the entire  [[Page S4377]]  second shift at the historic Lordstown plant in the Mahoning Valley in  Northeast Ohio, we got word that GM plans to build its new Chevy Blazer  in Mexico. That is right--the company bypasses American workers, lays  off an entire shift, and sends more jobs to Mexico. All this comes on  the heels of the windfall GM got from the tax bill Congress passed last  year.   GM now can bring some $7 billion in overseas cash back to the United  States at a dramatically lower tax rate, they can immediately deduct  the cost of any new investments in plants and equipment, and their  overall corporate tax rate dropped by about one-third. They could use  that extra cash to invest in Lordstown, to build more cars in America,  but what do they do instead? They lay off 1,500 workers--1,500 Ohio  workers, 1,500 families affected--in Niles, Ravenna, Kent,  Reminderville, Youngstown, Girard, Lordstown, and all over the Mahoney  Valley and beyond. That is just a year after they laid off the third  shift--more than 1,000 workers--at the same plant. They have some  nerve.   The workers at this plant are among the best in the world. The car  they make, the Chevy Cruze, beat out the foreign competition in its  class last year. For the 2018 models, J.D. Power and Associates named  the Cruze among the top two cars in its class. They named the Lordstown  plant among the six top plants in the Americas. Anyone who has been to  Lordstown wouldn't be surprised.   Ten years ago, the Federal Government rescued the auto industry.   Eight years ago, I actually drove one of the first cars--with  Governor Strickland and others--off the line, one of the first Chevy  Cruzes coming out of the Lordstown plant.   Two years ago, I stood in Lordstown for the plant's 50th anniversary,  and I saw the pride the community takes in that plant. GM estimated  that more than 10,000 people--young and old, families with children,  workers who had been there almost the entire 50 years, vintage car  buffs, former workers--turned out to watch the parade and to celebrate  the plant. The line to get into the plant for a tour stretched down the  street and around the block. That is what this plant means to the  communities it serves. That is what the auto industry means to the  communities it serves. It appears General Motors has forgotten some of  that. That is why we worked so hard to save this industry, including  General Motors, after the economic crisis.   In addition to the Federal auto rescue, the State of Ohio gave GM  more than $80 million in tax incentives. But now, after Ohio gave  millions to this company, GM turns its back on Ohio--all while making  record profits, all while reaping the rewards of the tax bill paid for  by taxpayers.   As a country, as a State, we are invested in this industry. GM needs  to invest in America and in Ohio. It needs to invest in the workers and  in the communities that built this company and made it great. Instead  of making plans to invest in Mexico, GM should be working with workers,  with the union, with local officials--with all of us--to invest,  instead, in American workers. We have invested in GM; GM should invest  in Ohio workers.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
