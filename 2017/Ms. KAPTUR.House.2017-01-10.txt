 Mr. Speaker, in America, we expect no one to be above the  law. But, what happens if someone is super rich and breaks the law?   Today, I rise to place on the Record a demand that the President- elect's Cabinet nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos of  Michigan, immediately pay fines she owes to the State of Ohio.   These obligations total $5.3 million, just as Congresswoman Joyce  Beatty stated in her opening statement, and also Congresswoman Marcia  Fudge, who will speak subsequent to my own remarks. This is an enormous  amount of money owed to the State of Ohio in unpaid fines and levied  late penalties for Ms. DeVos' political organization for campaign  finance violations in Ohio. They broke Ohio law. These are the largest  fines ever levied in Ohio history, dating back to 2008. Essentially,  the political organization Ms. DeVos led violated Ohio's election laws.   Betsy DeVos of Michigan was in charge of the political action  committee known as All Children Matter, based in Virginia. During her  chairwomanship, she broke Ohio's election laws which impose spending  donation limits of $10,000 per candidate. She, in fact, violated those  limits by funneling national PAC money, over $870,000 of it, to Ohio's  State candidates--incidentally, all Republican candidates.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record these names and the amounts of  money they received.    Ohio Candidates Who Received Direct Contributions From Betsy DeVos'                      Federal PAC--All Children Matter         Blackwell, J. Kenneth & Raga, Thomas, $10,000; Husted, Jon       A, $10,000; Raussen, Jim, $7,500; Bacon, Kevin, $6,000;       Harris, Bill, $5,000; Montgomery, Betty, $5,000; Taylor,       Mary, $5,000; Bubp, Danny, $4,000; Coughlin, Kevin, $4,000;       Luther, Brant, $4,000.

Source: The Columbus Dispatch and FollowtheMoney.org     All these candidates pledged to advocate for privatizing  public school education through vouchers once elected into office.   The Ohio Election Commission, comprised of an equal number of  Republicans and Democrats, swiftly and unanimously levied a record fine  against her organization in 2008. Their decision was subsequently  vetted and upheld by a Republican judge in a State court.   Yet, now nearly a decade later, neither Betsy DeVos nor All Children  Matter has paid their penalty of $5.3 million to the citizens of Ohio.   Indeed, the State of Ohio prior to her violations had even informed  Ms. DeVos by issuing a legal opinion that such contributions from her  national PAC would be illegal to State candidates, and she willfully  ignored them and that opinion. No one, no matter how wealthy, should be  above the law.   And who exactly were the State candidates that received a direct  campaign contribution from Betsy DeVos' political action committee All  Children Matter? You will notice a few candidates still serving in Ohio  office, including Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor, Secretary of State  Jon Husted, State Treasurer Josh Mandel, and Ohio Senate President  Keith Faber. Former Ohio gubernatorial candidate J. Kenneth Blackwell  also received a direct contribution. Mr. Blackwell now leads the  President-elect's domestic policy transition team.   In addition, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, Betsy  DeVos gave direct contributions to at least 20 current Members of the  United States Senate. These are the same Senators who will now confirm  her for her Secretary of Education position.   Talk about pay to play and a real need to drain the swamp, the  President-elect ought to start in his own backyard.   The $5.3 million fine that Betsy DeVos' political organization owes  to Ohio could pay for better education for Ohio's children. It is  outrageous that a candidate for Secretary of Education holds herself  above the law and fails to make good on outstanding fines imposed  nearly 10 years ago. Public records indicate she personally has a net  worth of over $5.1 billion.   The New York Times today has a front page story by Noam Scheiber that  includes a quote from a writer and scholar who observes about the life  of Ms. DeVos.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this article as well.                  [From the New York Times, Jan. 9, 2017]    Betsy DeVos, Trump's Education Pick, Plays Hardball With Her Wealth                             (By Noam Scheiber)         After Tom Casperson, a Republican state senator from       Michigan's Upper Peninsula, began running for Congress in       2016, he assumed the family of Betsy DeVos, President-elect       Donald J. Trump's nominee to be education secretary, would       not oppose him.        The DeVoses, a dominant force in Michigan politics for       decades with a fortune in the billions, had contributed to       one of Mr. Casperson's earlier campaigns. But a week before       his primary, family members sent $24,000 to one of his       opponents, then poured $125,000 into a ``super PAC,''       Concerned Taxpayers of America, that ran ads attacking him.        The reason, an intermediary told Mr. Casperson: his support       from organized labor.        ``Deceitful, dishonest and cowardly,'' was how Mr.       Casperson's campaign described the ads, complaining that the       groups running them ``won't say who they are or where their       money is coming from.'' On Primary Day, Mr. Casperson went       down to defeat.         In announcing his intention to nominate Ms. DeVos, Mr.       Trump described her as ``a brilliant and passionate education       advocate.'' Even critics characterized her as a dedicated, if       misguided, activist for school reform. But that description       understates both the breadth of Ms. DeVos's political       interests and the influence she wields as part of her       powerful family. More than anyone else who has joined the       incoming Trump administration, she represents the combination       of wealth, free-market ideology and political hardball       associated with a better-known family of billionaires:       Charles and David Koch.        ``They have this moralized sense of the free market that       leads to this total program to turn back the ideas of the New       Deal, the welfare state,'' Kim Phillips-Fein, a historian who       has written extensively about the conservative movement,       said, describing the DeVoses.        Ms. DeVos declined to be interviewed for this article.        Like the Kochs, the DeVoses are generous supporters of       think tanks that evangelize for unrestrained capitalism, like       Michigan's Acton Institute, and that rail against unions and       back privatizing public services, like the Mackinac Center.        They have also funded national groups dedicated to cutting       back the role of government, including the National Center       for Policy Analysis (which has pushed for Social Security       privatization and against environmental regulation) and the       Institute for Justice (which challenges regulations in court       and defends school vouchers). Both organizations have also       received money from the Koch family.  [[Page H244]]         Indeed, the DeVoses' education activism, which favors       alternatives to traditional public schools, appears to derive       from the same free-market views that inform their suspicion       of government. And perhaps more than other right-wing       billionaires, the DeVoses couple their seeding of ideological       causes with an aggressive brand of political spending. Half a       dozen or more extended family members frequently coordinate       contributions to maximize their impact.        In the 2016 cycle alone, according to the Michigan Campaign       Finance Network, the family spent roughly $14 million on       political contributions to state and national candidates,       parties, PACs and super PACs.        All of this would make Ms. DeVos--whose confirmation       hearing has been delayed until next week amid mounting       pressure that her government ethics review be completed       beforehand--very different from past education secretaries.        ``She is the most emblematic kind of oligarchic figure you       can put in a cabinet position,'' said Jeffrey Winters, a       political scientist at Northwestern University who studies       economic elites. ``What she and the Kochs have in common is       the unbridled use of wealth power to achieve whatever       political goals they have.''                           Birth of a Power Couple         Ms. DeVos, 59, grew up in Holland, Mich., the daughter of a       conservative auto parts magnate who was an early founder of       the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group.       When she married Dick DeVos in 1979, it was akin to a merger       between two royal houses of western Michigan.        Her husband's father, Richard Sr., co-founder of the       multilevel marketing company Amway, was an active member of       the Christian Reformed Church that preached a mix of social       conservatism and self-reliance. He once told the church's       official magazine that Chicago's poor dwelled in slums       because that was ``the way they choose to live,'' according       to a Washington Post story from the 1980s.        A fan of Rolls-Royces and pinkie rings, Richard Sr. wrote       books with titles like ``Ten Powerful Phrases for Positive       People.''        A similar air hung over his business. Amway sales       representatives, which the company calls ``independent       business owners,'' make money both by selling the company's       products--everything from perfume to toilet bowl cleaner--and       by recruiting other sales representatives.        The Federal Trade Commission once investigated the company       for running a pyramid scheme before concluding that it had       misled potential recruits about how much they could expect to       earn.        The flip side of the family's proselytizing for capitalism,       according to Professor Phillips-Fein, has been an effort to       dismantle much ``that would counterbalance the power of       economic elites.''        Amway funded a nationwide ad campaign in the early 1980s,       protesting high taxes and regulations. Not long after, the       company pleaded guilty to cheating the Canadian government       out of more than $20 million in revenue.        The family had a more winning public face in Dick DeVos,       who combined the practiced empathy of a pitchman with the       entitlement of an heir, spending over $30 million on an       unsuccessful run for governor of Michigan in 2006. The       Detroit Free Press described him that year as the wealthiest       man to seek office in the state's modern history.        Betsy DeVos, who served as chairwoman of the Michigan       Republican Party for most of the decade between 1996 and       2005, has often played the role of strategist in the       relationship. She was a key adviser in her husband's run for       governor and publicly brooded that he had been too       gentlemanly in his first debate against the incumbent.        ``He's very good with people, a retail politician who looks       you in the eye, shakes your hand, listens to what you say,''       said Randy Richardville, a former Republican leader of the       Michigan Senate, describing the couple's strengths. ``I would       never underestimate Betsy DeVos in a knife fight.''        Ms. DeVos has sometimes lacked her husband's finesse, once       famously blaming many of the state's economic woes on ``high       wages.'' She has won detractors, by their account, by       browbeating legislators into voting her way.        ``Betsy DeVos was like my 4-year-old granddaughter at the       time,'' said Mike Pumford, a former Republican state       representative who once clashed with her. ``They were both       sweet ladies as long as they kept hearing the word `yes.'       They turned into spoiled little brats when they were told       `no.' ''        But Ms. DeVos has often made up for what she lacks in tact       through sheer force of will.        Mr. Richardville said he and Ms. DeVos disagreed over term       limits, which she supported as party chairwoman and he       opposed: ``I said, `I don't think you should be setting       policy. You should be supporting those of us who do make       policy.' But she never backed down.''        While Dick and Betsy DeVos appear to practice a more       tolerant form of Christianity than their parents--Ms. DeVos       has spoken out against anti-gay bigotry--as recently as the       early 2000s they funded some groups like Focus on the Family,       a large ministry that helps set the political agenda for       conservative evangelicals. They have also backed groups that       promote conservative values to students and Christian       education, including one with ties to the Christian Reformed       Church.        Their economic views are strikingly similar to the elder       Mr. DeVos's.        According to federal disclosures, Amway, which Dick DeVos       ran between 1993 and 2002, has lobbied frequently over the       last 20 years to reduce or repeal the estate tax. Only the       top 0.2 percent wealthiest estates paid the tax in 2015.        The company has also opposed crackdowns on tax shelters.        Ms. DeVos has been an outspoken defender of unlimited       contributions known as soft money, which she described in a       1997 editorial as ``hard-earned American dollars that Big       Brother has yet to find a way to control.''        After Congress later passed a major campaign finance reform       bill, a nonprofit that Ms. DeVos helped to create and fund       masterminded the strategy that produced Citizens United, the       2010 Supreme Court decision laying the groundwork for super       PACs funded by corporations, unions and individuals to raise       and spend unlimited amounts in elections.        And then there are the family's efforts to rein in the       labor movement.        Through their contributions to think tanks like the       Mackinac Center, as well as Mr. DeVos's direct prodding of       Republican legislators, the family played a key role in       helping pass Michigan's so-called right-to-work legislation       in 2012. The legislation largely ended the requirement that       workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment.        Unions in the state bled members in 2014, the first full       year the measure was in effect.        Allies say the DeVoses fight for their beliefs. ``Betsy and       Dick see themselves as principled conservatives,'' said       Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute. ``It       kind of seems healthy and admirable to give resources to       folks who are going to fight for causes you believe in.''        But the fights can appear to be as much about consolidating       power as ideology. Unions were arguably the family's most       formidable political opponent in Michigan, one of labor's       traditional strongholds.                             Changes in Michigan         The DeVos family's roots as education activists date back       at least to when Richard DeVos Sr. was running Amway and an       institute based at the company's headquarters trained       teachers to inject free-market principles into their       curriculum.        According to an interview Ms. DeVos gave to Philanthropy       magazine, she and her husband became interested in education       causes when they began visiting a Christian school that       served low-income children in Grand Rapids in the 1980s.         ``If we could choose the right school for our kids''--by       which she appeared to mean primarily private schools--``it       only seemed fair that they could do the same for theirs,''       she told the magazine.        The family spent millions of dollars on a ballot proposal       in 2000 asking if Michigan should legalize vouchers, in which       students can use taxpayer money to attend private schools.        Many critics, like the education historian Diane Ravitch,       argue that the point of vouchers is to destroy public       education and teachers' unions. The group Americans United       for Separation of Church and State has documented how       conservative Christians have long supported vouchers, which       could fund religious schools.        After voters objected by more than a two-to-one ratio, Dick       DeVos gave a speech at the Heritage Foundation saying such       efforts would have to shift to state legislatures, where       groups backed by deep-pocketed donors could offer ``a       political consequence for opposition, and political reward       for support of education reform issues.''        It is not unusual for the wealthy--who devote nearly 50       percent of their philanthropic dollars to education,       according to the group Wealth-X--to spend aggressively in the       political realm to impose their preferred reforms.        Even by these standards, however, the DeVoses stand out for       the amount of money they spend trying to advance their goals       through politics rather than philanthropy, such as research       into reforms or subsidizing schools.        As Sarah Reckhow, an expert on education philanthropy at       Michigan State University, put it: ``The DeVoses are like:       `No, we know what we want. We don't need to have all this       window dressing.' ''        Ms. DeVos has led two nonprofits that have spent millions       of dollars electing governors and legislators sympathetic to       school vouchers around the country.        Matt Frendewey, a spokesman for one of the groups, said the       efforts had frequently been bipartisan, and that the amount       of money they had spent has been dwarfed by contributions       from teachers' unions opposed to reform. Yet in Michigan, at       least, the family's political strategy has not been subtle.        After he defied Ms. DeVos on a key charter school vote, Mr.       Pumford, the former Republican legislator, survived an effort       by the Great Lakes Education Project, a nonprofit the DeVoses       bankrolled, to defeat him in his 2002 primary.        But shortly after, the House speaker told him the Education       Committee chairmanship he coveted would not be forthcoming.       ``I said, `Why?' '' Mr. Pumford recalled. ``He said: `You       know why. The DeVoses will walk away from us.' '' Mr. Pumford       added: ``She told me that was going to happen.''  [[Page H245]]         (Rick Johnson, the House speaker, said he did not recall       the conversation but also that he had not promised Mr.       Pumford the chairmanship and would not have explained his       reasons for withholding it.)        Over time, the Great Lakes Education Project helped elect       Republican majorities sympathetic to the DeVoses' agenda. But       the DeVoses' lobbyists and operatives also discovered less       messy ways to advance legislation.        Late one night of their last workweek in 2015, the Michigan       House and Senate were about to approve some uncontroversial       changes to campaign finance law, when the bill abruptly grew       by more than 40 pages.        After the legislators discovered what they had voted for,       many said they were horrified.        Tucked away in the new pages was a provision that would       have made it much harder for local bodies like school boards       to raise money through property tax increases.         ``Michigan schools will likely suffer the brunt of the       impact because the vast majority rely on periodic voter       approval of local operating levy renewals for property       taxes,'' the ratings agency Moody's wrote of the measure the       following month.         ``I was fooled into voting for something I opposed,'' said       Dave Pagel, a Republican representative. ``I consider it the       worst vote I've made.''        The chief culprits, according to Mr. Pagel and others at       the state Capitol when the bill passed, were lobbyists       closely tied to the DeVoses.        Tony Daunt, a spokesman for the Michigan Freedom Fund, a       nonprofit headed by the DeVoses' longtime political aide, and       whose political spending arm they have funded generously,       said the group was ``part of the discussion process with       people in the legislature'' about the proposal and ``had       consistently expressed support for the policy.''        The law was later blocked by a federal judge, but the group       has vowed to try again.                              Radical Suspicions         Ms. DeVos's advocates see in these fights the toughness to       take on entrenched opponents of expanding reforms like       charter schools and vouchers.        In promoting Ms. DeVos in The Washington Post, Mitt Romney,       the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee, emphasized       that her wealth gave her the independence to be ``someone who       isn't financially biased shaping education.'' He added,       ``DeVos doesn't need the job now, nor will she be looking for       an education job later.''        But critics see someone with an unmistakable agenda. ``The       signs are there that she will do something radical,'' said       Jack Jennings, a former general counsel for the House       education committee. ``Trump wouldn't have appointed this       woman for this position if he didn't intend something       radical.''     The article states: ``She is the most emblematic kind of  oligarchic figure you can put in a cabinet position. . . . What she and  the Kochs have in common is the unbridled use of wealth power to  achieve whatever political goals they have.''   If confirmed, Betsy DeVos would be responsible for administering our  Nation's student loan portfolio and would have to ensure borrowers  repay their loans in a timely manner. Yet, how can we believe she will  demonstrate sound judgment in her responsibilities or be a role model  when her own political organization has blatantly avoided paying  legally obligated fines for her violations of Ohio's election laws?   Mr. Speaker, Betsy DeVos' attempt to subvert the law and buy  influence are diametrically opposed to everything the President-elect  advised was wrong with America. He wants to drain the swamp. No one in  America should be above the law, and neither should Betsy DeVos be  above the law. She ought to pay the $5.3 million she owes the people of  Ohio.                            ____________________     Thank you, Congressman Garamendi. You are such a rare and  talented Member. I thank the people of California for sending you here.  You serve them every day of the week, 7 days a week--24/7. It is a  privilege to appear with you tonight and also with Congressman Paul  Tonko, one of our most talented Members from upstate New York--a region  like my own that has just been battered by the global economy and the  outsourcing of jobs. We all are just honored to serve in this Congress,  and we respect it and its history and its potential.   Mr. Speaker, as I travel my own district and State, I am finding I  have to reassure people. Anytime there is a change, I guess, in public  life, people need to be bolstered that everything is going to be okay.  We are here to be that squad and to say to the American people that  they have power, too, and that it isn't just the super rich of this  country or the billionaire class.   We can label them ``wealth power.'' And that has power; yes, it does.  Sometimes extraordinary power. But there is also ``people power.'' I  consider myself having been lifted here by people power over many  years, and I appreciate the people of my region for allowing me to  serve our country and to learn every day, to learn from them, to learn  how to make the instruments of the Nation work better for them.   There is also ``spiritual power.'' I am amazed at how people's  spiritual groundings help them through difficult situations and  transitions.   Then there is ``intellectual power.'' We hope to use some of that  here once in a while. That is a power in and of itself. We think about  the power of liberty of a free people to improve their Nation, to heal  their Nation, to expand opportunity in their Nation.   We are aided and abetted by a very curious media--sometimes more  ridiculous than it needs to be--but also of people digging, trying to  find that elusive truth that should lead us all forward. So we find  ourselves helping to heal our Nation by being Members here, and we all  hope for the best for our people and for our country. I think the  Members here are very well motivated.   I rise to defend, really, and to support two foundational programs of  our society: Social Security and Medicare. I will try to be brief so  others can comment.   I am very proud to say that our family is one of those families who  would have been completely destroyed had it not been for Social  Security and Medicare. Those didn't exist when my parents were born and  grandparents were  [[Page H292]]  living in our country. But in 1935, after our country crashed  economically and there were major bank failures and the stock market  crashed and wiped out the savings of millions of Americans, the Nation  turned to the Federal Government, to the President, to guarantee for a  large segment of our society--senior citizens--decent incomes.    The Social Security Insurance Act was enacted at the urging of  Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was regarded as a  saint in our household because what happened around our country was  that seniors before that time--many of them--were living in what we  called poorhouses. They were dying in terrible circumstances, and there  was no security as a person aged.   Can you imagine how revolutionary it was at that time to create a  social insurance program--probably the largest insurance program  America has ever had--to ensure that as people aged or if workers  became disabled in the workplace or if they died that their children  would have sources of income?   The program did all of that. In thinking back, gosh, over 70 years,  how transformational was that?   As for our grandpa, who died in a county hospital in Ohio before the  enactment of Medicare, I know the conditions that he died under. And I  know that, when our mother died, it was a different situation. She had  Social Security and Medicare, and we were able to take care of her. The  same was true with our father.   Intergenerationally, I see our country getting better. I am proud of  that. I am also proud to be a Democrat and a member of a party that has  created Social Security, which has become an indispensable part of our  way of life. As I have said to seniors and to workers, it is an earned  benefit. People pay for it every time their paychecks are nicked, and  their employers match it.   Obviously, to survivors--and, obviously, I have neighbors who have  lost spouses, whose children then benefit from the survivor benefit-- what an incredible gift this idea is to the American people. There are  35 million people today in our country who depend on Social Security-- one out of every six Americans. Every day, Social Security lifts 20  million people out of poverty--people who used to live in poverty.   Can you imagine what that was like?   We don't ever, ever want to go back to that world.   In 2014, the latest data show us that more than 6 million children  under the age of 18 live in families who receive income from Social  Security, lifting more than a million children out of poverty. Social  Security has never been a welfare program. It is an earned benefit, and  all Americans who contribute to it during their working lifetimes  receive benefits. Social Security is a compact of trust between  generations. It is the ever-present sentry at the economic security  gate for retirees, for those hurt on the job, or for their survivors,  and it is America's greatest insurance program ever.   I happened to be living when Lyndon Johnson helped to create the  Medicare program, which provides health insurance coverage now to over  55 million people in our country--essential health security for  seniors. Today, only 2 percent of the elderly in our country lack  health insurance compared to 48 percent--half the people of this  country--in 1962, after World War II, before Medicare even existed.  That seems sort of modern times, the 1960s; yet it really was not. I  would say that that is a ``wow'' by any measure.   Yes, people are living longer. Thank God the program is working.  People are getting free preventative healthcare screenings and are  lowering the long-term costs of care because of early diagnosis.  Seniors don't have to pay for mammograms or diabetes or cancer  screenings, thanks to the Affordable Care Act; so we keep trying to  make the system better.   Since House Republicans won the majority in 2011, every House  Republican budget has tried to end the Medicare guarantee and turn  Medicare into a privatized voucher program.   Do you know what that is going to do?   It is going to shut out millions of Americans who are elderly--or who  are about to be elderly--from insurance. The reason we have Medicare is  that insurers weren't insuring seniors--that is the reason it exists in  the first place--or they will make the price so high that people won't  be able to pay for it; or they will cherry-pick only the healthy  people. Then those who have diabetes, those who have had prior cancers,  those who have multiple sclerosis, those who have Parkinson's will be  cast aside.   What kind of a country would this be, for heaven's sake?   The American Association of Retired Persons and the National  Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare completely opposed  the Republicans' plan to voucherize and let every senior go out there  in the market and try to find a plan of his own, because they know what  that means. These two programs are the most pro-life programs this  Nation has ever created. We should be so proud of what we have been  able to do as a country over the last century.   The Republican attacks on Social Security and Medicare need to stop.  They are America's bulwark for millions and millions of people, and  they have proven themselves to be America's most important, lifetime  security programs.   I thank Congressman Garamendi and Congressman Tonko for being down  here tonight. I know how passionately you care about the people of our  country way beyond just your districts and why we are here. We are here  to stand with them.    If the gentleman would yield, I can remember the stench.    I can remember that.    My grandpa.    Our father had to fight to get him in there because there  wasn't enough space for people who were ill and dying. That was before  hospice and that was before Medicare. I remember, as a young girl, that  that was a hard thing to experience, but our mother and father never  protected us from the inevitable.    Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join Mr. Garamendi and Mr.  Tonko, and I want to place in the Record, since both of you have talked  so eloquently about the Affordable Care Act, you know how you will be  walking through your district, maybe at a parade or some public event,  and someone will break from the crowd and run toward you. I am thinking  about one particular woman who came up to me in one of my smaller  communities. She was in tears. This was during the summertime. She has  cerebral palsy, and she never was able to get care. I don't know why  she didn't qualify for insurance, I don't know all of that, but she  hugged me and thanked me.   And then around the corner from where we live, there is a little  produce market that I go into all the time. I am friends with one of  the women who works there. This little business couldn't afford  insurance, so their employees, when the Affordable Care Act passed,  went to the private marketplace to get a plan. This particular woman  who works long hours and lost her husband to cancer told me: Marcy, why  are people complaining about the Affordable Care Act? Guess what, now I  have cancer.   She said: I was able to go and get all of the tests, and now they  have me on chemotherapy.   So, with cancer, this woman is working. She was only able to get  insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Multiply that times 10,000,  20,000, 1 million, 20 million, whatever the number is. Think about the  number of people in our country who were without insurance. Sometimes I  am speechless when I meet these citizens because I think: Where were  you hiding before? Where were you?   Another place I was, a woman was mixing up. She said: Well, I have  health insurance, right? I pay car insurance.   I said: No. Car insurance doesn't cover health insurance.   People sometimes don't act in their own self-interest. She didn't  even know that because she had auto insurance, that didn't cover health  insurance. Can you believe that? So she was in a job where, with the  Affordable Care Act, she could go out to the exchange and buy a plan.   It is amazing to me some of the things that have happened and how I  see the Affordable Care Act off to a very good start.   As Mr. Tonko said, don't just repeal it until you have something to  replace it with. You cannot pull the rug out from under these people's  lives. It would be unconscionable to do that.   We have several Christians, several other denominations in this  House. It would be very unChristian to do that, for those who are  Christian. And for those of other denominations--pick your  denomination--I just think it would be very cruel.   I thank the gentleman for allowing us to speak out this evening on  behalf of citizens who can't speak for themselves and to try to help  perfect what we as a Republic can do for our citizenry.                                time  2015     On that point, another woman came up to me, I was over at  the medical hospital with my brother, and she has epilepsy, and she has  another condition. She told me, she said: You know, Marcy, I have to  cut my pills in half. Can you help me try to find pills so that I can  afford to pay for all the medicines that I need to take care of myself?   Rather than repealing, can't we find a majority of Republicans to  help us, to help our citizens be able to get medicine at prices they  can afford?   Why can't we have competitive bidding for pharmaceuticals? Why can't  we have that? We have it for the VA. We have it for the Department of  Defense. Why can't we have it for the rest of our citizenry so that we  can get the best price?   But I thought: Cutting your pills in half? And so what happens to her  is, if she doesn't take enough of the medicine, then she has a seizure.  But she has got other things wrong with her, so she is trying to cut  this pill and cut that pill. And I thought, this is crazy. This is  crazy.   Can't we do better as a country than this for our people?   I have never understood why the price of pharmaceuticals has shot up  so much. I can't tell you how many cases we get in our office where we  have to call these companies and beg, you know, do you have some  foundation where we can get a few more pills from Lilly or a few more  pills from this company or that company in order to help people in our  district.   It shouldn't be our job to turn into a medical dispensary because the  system isn't working. There ought to be a way to take care of this.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 20 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, January 11, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
