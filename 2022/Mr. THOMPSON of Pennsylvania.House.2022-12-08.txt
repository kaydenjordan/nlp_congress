 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Coach Shari Campbell of Clarion, who was inducted into the Pennsylvania  Volleyball Coaches Association Hall of Fame for 2022.   Coach Campbell has a distinguished career of leading women's  volleyball teams to victory as coach of both the Clarion Area Bobcats  and the Clarion Limestone Lions volleyball teams.   Coach Campbell has also had a uniquely impressive coaching record,  earning 437 wins for her team out of 507 games. Additionally, Shari  Campbell's teams have won three PIAA state championships in 2012, 2020,  and 2021.   Shari Campbell got her start in 1990 as a junior coach at Juniata  College in Huntington, Pennsylvania. She later became an assistant  coach at St. Bonaventure University in Allegheny, New York.   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Coach Shari Campbell on her  outstanding achievement. Most importantly, I thank her for being a  coach and mentor for the young women of Clarion. Her commitment to her  students is not just demonstrated by her record of wins, but also by  her dedication and commitment to seeing her players succeed on and off  the court.                            ____________________
