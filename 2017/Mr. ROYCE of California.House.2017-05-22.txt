 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1625) to amend the State Department Basic  Authorities Act of 1956 to include severe forms of trafficking in  persons within the definition of transnational organized crime for  purposes of the rewards program of the Department of State, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1625         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Targeted Rewards for the       Global Eradication of Human Trafficking'' or the ``TARGET       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Trafficking in persons is a major transnational crime       that threatens United States national security and       humanitarian interests.  [[Page H4412]]         (2) Trafficking in persons is increasingly perpetrated by       organized, sophisticated criminal enterprises.        (3) Combating trafficking in persons requires a global       approach to identifying and apprehending the world's worst       human trafficking rings.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Department of State's rewards program is a powerful tool       in combating sophisticated international crime and that the       Department of State and Federal law enforcement should work       in concert to offer rewards that target human traffickers who       threaten United States national security and humanitarian       interests by preying on the most vulnerable people around the       world.       SEC. 3. REWARDS FOR JUSTICE.         Paragraph (5) of section 36(k) of the State Department       Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2708(k)) is       amended--        (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking       ``means'';        (2) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses       (i) and (ii), respectively, and moving such clauses, as so       redesignated, two ems to the right;        (3) by inserting before clause (i), as so redesignated, the       following:        ``(A) means--'';        (4) in clause (ii), as so redesignated, by striking the       period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and        (5) by adding at the end following new subparagraph:        ``(B) includes severe forms of trafficking in persons, as       such term is defined in section 103 of the Trafficking       Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1625 is the human trafficking TARGET Act. It  authorizes the State Department and Federal law enforcement to target  international human traffickers, and they can do that by offering  rewards for their arrest or conviction anywhere around the globe.   Mr. Speaker, I think for all of us, with some of the cases we have  had in our districts, some of our constituents, some of the victims,  this is pretty close to all of us. It has touched many of our  communities, because trafficking in persons here in the U.S. and  worldwide is a major global crime that destroys countless lives at home  and abroad, and the most vulnerable are destroyed by this.   Many of these persons--and they are primarily women and children--are  trafficked into international sex trade by force or by fraud or by  coercion. And I will remind everyone, out in southern California, in  L.A., the average age of a girl being trafficked is 14. In Orange  County, the average age is 14.   So when I say ``by force,'' we are talking about abduction. When I  say ``by fraud,'' that is a situation where they get one of these  gigolos, one of those Romeos--they call them--to go out, convince some  girl to run off with him, get her out of State, and then he sells her  to a criminal gang. The gang sells her to the crime syndicate. Now her  fate is sealed. Or through coercion, and we have heard these cases. At  14, young people are pretty gullible, what this criminal organization  is going to do to her sister or to her parents if she does not go  along.   So this transnational crime also includes forced labor. It involves  significant violations of public health, human rights standards  worldwide, and every other kind of moral standard you could think of.  And that is why, as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and  as Representative for the 39th District in California, I have, over the  last few years, made working on this issue and moving legislation on  this horrific crime a top priority for the committee, and we have had  bipartisan support throughout for this legislation. We have enacted  many bills in recent years, including the International Megan's Law  last February. We have held committee hearings in Washington, in L.A.,  and in Orange County to hear firsthand from victims.   For example, at a field hearing in Fullerton, we heard from Angela  Guanzon, who was trafficked from the Philippines into coerced servitude  in Los Angeles where she worked for 18 hours a day every day without a  weekend off, without a holiday off, was forced to sleep on the hallway  floor until a sharp-eyed neighbor finally alerted law enforcement.   I helped establish a Human Trafficking Congressional Advisory  Committee. I established that in the 39th District for L.A., Orange  County, and San Bernardino. We have local law enforcement involved in  that as well as the Federal authorities, victims rights groups, and  community advocates in California to address these concerns, to try to  come up with solutions.   Mr. Speaker, we have made progress, but there is still so much work  to be done. If we are going to end human trafficking, it will take all  of us working together, so I want to thank Ranking Member Engel, of  course, Congressman Connolly, and the coauthor of my legislation here,  Lois Frankel, for their outstanding work on this measure.   As has been discussed today, trafficking in persons is increasingly  perpetuated and perpetrated by sophisticated transnational criminal  enterprises. The traffickers themselves operate outside sometimes of  our borders. Other times they are inside our borders, but the profits  from the trafficking industry contribute to the expansion of organized  crime and terrorism here and worldwide.   That is why combating human trafficking requires a global approach to  identify and apprehend the world's worst offenders. This TARGET Act for  traffickers does that. It targets human trafficking globally through  the Department of State's very successful Rewards Programs.   Rewards issued under these programs have led to the capture of major  terrorists and international criminals, including--I will remind  Members--Ramzi Yousef, who was convicted in the 1993 bombing of the  World Trade Center, several members of the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group  who kidnapped and killed American citizens, and over 60 major  international drug traffickers. All of them were convicted with the  help of this particular program that we want to expand now, that we  want to apply here.   A reward on one's head creates real fear for terrorists and  criminals. At one committee hearing, a State Department official  testified that one captured narcotics trafficker told DEA agents he  would no longer trust anyone in his organization after the U.S. put a  $5 million reward for his capture.   I remember the quote. He said he felt like a hunted man.   Well, Mr. Speaker, we want human traffickers to know the fear of  being hunted.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1815     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel) especially for the trips that she has made  overseas--not just here in the United States--to do this investigative  work to expose trafficking and for being the original lead Democratic  coauthor with me on this bill. I also want to again thank Gerry  Connolly for his work.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), the chairman  of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and  Trade. He has done a great deal of work over the years on this issue as  well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Let me say that, for republics in Europe and our United States, we  credit our civilizations with having eradicated slavery some 150 years  or more ago, but clearly Judge Poe uses the right word here: Slavery  is, in fact, what is committed in these acts.   I can tell you, my chief of staff, having worked in relief efforts in  south Asia and in Cambodia with underaged girls as young as the ones  described by Judge Poe--7, 8, 9 years old--the most vulnerable people  on this planet are being sold into slavery. As long as force and fraud,  coercion is used to prey upon the most vulnerable, as long as profits  from these victims suffering from the ill-gotten gains are used to  build out criminal networks to snare more and more of these children,  as long as trafficking in persons is a global crime that extends beyond  the capacity of certain governments, then it requires a global response  and, again, as my colleagues have said, requires that the United  States, therefore, lead.                                time  1830    So this bill targets human traffickers around the world through the  Department of State's successful reward programs by offering rewards  for their capture anywhere on Earth, it lets the victims of human  trafficking know we will not stop until they are free, and it tells the  predators that we will not stop until they are behind bars.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
