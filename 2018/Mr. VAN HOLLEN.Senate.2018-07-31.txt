 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida, Mr.  Nelson, for introducing this legislation and also my other colleagues  who have been on the Senate floor today.   This is emergency legislation, which is why there was a request for  unanimous consent to move forward today. It is very disturbing that  consent was not provided because we know that as a result of the Trump  administration's actions, starting tomorrow, people all over the  country--in fact, all over the world--are going to be able to download  on their computers instructions and a whole manual on how to  manufacture plastic guns with 3D printing.   This is something that has been before previous administrations. The  Obama administration fought hard against this ability for people to be  able to send those instructions to make 3D guns at the speed of light  around the world. In fact, this administration early on opposed  allowing this to happen.   Somehow, when this whole lawsuit was resolved the other day, the  folks who want to send these instructions around the world were allowed  to do so. In fact, Alan Gottlieb, who is with the Second Amendment  Foundation that was part of this case, said:         We asked for the Moon and we figured the government would       reject it, but they didn't want to go to trial. The       government fought us all the way and then all of the sudden       folded their tent.    Secretary Pompeo and the Trump administration folded their tent. As a  consequence, Americans will be placed at much higher risk starting  tomorrow. We have already seen over 1,000 people sign up to begin to  receive the instructions to make AR-15s using 3D printing.   Why is this going to pose a big danger? No. 1, it is a total end-run  around criminal background checks for the purchase of a handgun or any  kind of weapon. We should be closing the loopholes in the existing  background check system, closing things like the gun show loophole.  Instead, this allows for a total runaround. If you can just download  instructions and use a 3D printer to make a gun at home, you obviously  aren't going to go through any kind of criminal background check.   No. 2, we have spent a lot of time and effort giving the ATF the  authority to track guns used in crimes. I would have  [[Page S5472]]  thought all of us want to make sure we can track people down who are  using guns to commit crimes and catch them. If you print a gun at home  using a 3D printer, there is no traceable number, there is no serial  number. We are not going to be able to easily track down the people who  are using these guns to commit crimes.   No. 3, with plastic 3D printing, the technology we have at airports  to detect metal will become ineffective.   Folks around the world, if you are a terrorist wanting to do harm,  now you are going to get instructions over the internet. You are going  to be able to download it as easy as you can download an iTune. With a  3D printer in your basement or around the corner in some space, you are  going to be able to manufacture guns; No. 1, evading metal detectors at  airports, putting the entire flying public at risk; No. 2, it is a  public end-run around the criminal background check system, which is  already flawed; and, No. 3, it will not allow us to trace guns used in  crimes.   I thought there was a consensus in this body that we should get after  people who use guns to commit crimes, whether crimes in the United  States or crimes around the world. Yet what this body is doing by not  allowing a vote today on the Nelson bill is saying it is OK for people  to be using this technology in their basements to make guns that can  evade all these systems and commit crimes and make it impossible to  trace who did it.   This is a really bad day for the U.S. Senate. This is a moment where  people should be acting in emergency fashion to stop this danger and  risk to the American public. Instead, people are folding up their tent  and allowing this to happen, starting tomorrow. It is a shameful  moment.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the plan had been for me to join with  the Senator from Florida, now the Presiding Officer, to address our  concerns in two areas. One has to do with the Chinese  telecommunications company ZTE and the threat that it poses to the  national security of the United States. The second is to discuss the  urgent need for this Senate to take action to protect the integrity of  our democracy by passing the bipartisan DETER Act, which Senator Rubio  and I have introduced.   Since the Senator from Florida is now presiding in the Chair, I will  do my best to cover this for both of us, and I know that he will have  an opportunity at some other point to cover these important issues as  well.   First, as for ZTE, it is a Chinese telecommunications company. It is  a telecommunications company that has been exhibit A in the mix of  Chinese companies that have stolen U.S. technology.   In fact, when Secretary Pompeo was before the Senate a while ago,  talking about the relationships between the Chinese Government and  Chinese companies and talking about how they were stealing U.S.  intellectual property secrets for their own purposes, ZTE would be on  the top of that list. It is one of the most notorious thieves of  intellectual property anywhere in the world.   In the United States alone, they have been sued for patent  infringement 126 times in the last 5 years. That is an astonishing  figure, particularly as only a small subset of firms have the resources  to even bring litigation before a Federal court. ZTE has reportedly  been sued for patent infringement at least 100 times in other countries  around the world. This is a company that has developed by stealing high  technology from U.S. companies and other institutions around the world.   Second, ZTE poses an espionage threat to the United States-- translated: spying on Americans. This past February, FBI Director Wray  testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee saying:         We are deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any       company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments       that don't share our values to gain positions of power inside       our telecommunications networks. That provides the capacity       to exert pressure or control over our telecommunications       infrastructure. It provides the capacity to maliciously       modify or steal information, and it provides the capacity to       conduct undetected espionage.    That answer was in response to questions from the Senator from  Florida, who is now presiding.   ZTE has stolen American technology. According to our national  security officials--not just the Director of the FBI but also the head  of NSA, or the National Security Agency; and the DNI, or the Director  of National Intelligence; and the head of the CIA--ZTA poses an  espionage threat.   Now, on top of that--on top of that--ZTE was caught violating the  U.S. sanctions against North Korea and Iran, and it is not just that  they got caught, but when they got caught, they tried to cover it up.   They were warned not just once but twice, and, again, despite that,  they engaged in what Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross called a  ``multiyear conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions against North Korea  and Iran in an elaborate scheme of coverup.'' That is why, just a few  months back--I think it was in June--Secretary Ross imposed very stiff  sanctions on ZTE, including what is called the denial order, to stop  them from getting advanced technology components from U.S. companies  that ZTE could then use in their phones and their telecommunications  systems and then use that to conduct espionage against the United  States.   Secretary Ross did the exact right thing. Unfortunately, his decision  to impose that denial order was reversed by the President of the United  States.   When the President reversed that order, Senators here, on a  bipartisan basis--the Senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio; the Senator from  Arkansas, Mr. Cotton; and others, including Senator Warner--thought it  was important to protect the national security of the United States by  reimposing those important sanctions that the Secretary of Commerce had  put in.  [[Page S5484]]    How did we do that? We added a provision to the National Defense  Authorization Act that passed overwhelmingly in this body. That  provision was first inserted in the Senate Banking Committee. It was  then included in what is called the CFIUS bill, and then it was passed  by this body.   We urged the conferees in the Senate and the House on the Defense  bill to keep that provision in there and not let ZTE off the hook.  During that short period of time while it was in conference, a couple  months, ZTE spent over $1.3 million to hire Washington lobbyists to  help them pull that provision out of the Defense authorization bill.  The sad and really shameful story here is that ZTE and their lobbyists  succeeded. They succeeded in lifting that penalty on ZTE.   We have just sent the worst of all signals to China--whether it is  ZTE or Huawei or others--that we are not really serious when we say  that if we catch you violating our sanctions, we will punish you, or  that we are not serious in defending our country from espionage, or  that we are not serious about defending our country from the theft of  our intellectual property. That is a terrible and very weak message to  send.   I am going to keep fighting along with our colleagues, on a  bipartisan basis, to keep the pressure on these issues, on ZTE and  Huawei, because if we do not get serious about confronting these  threats, they will continue to come back to bite us.   I am very disappointed that the conferees did not include that  provision, and it does raise serious questions about a bill that  provides for our national defense: Why would it have a big loophole in  it that creates an opportunity for China to harm our national security?   Now, there is another way that our adversaries can harm our national  security, and that is to interfere in our elections to try to undermine  our democracy. We know from the heads of all the intelligence agencies  that this is exactly what happened in 2016. Our focus in this body  should be on making sure that no country interferes in our elections  again.   We all know that suspect No. 1 has been Russia. Russia was the  country that interfered in 2016, and we know that Russia is planning to  interfere in the 2018 midterm elections and beyond.   How do we know that? Well, first of all, the Director of National  Intelligence, Dan Coats, a former Member of this body, has said that  all of the lights are flashing red--a big warning that Russia plans to  interfere in our midterm elections, which are 98 days away.   We also learned just today that Facebook uncovered an ongoing effort  by foreign social media entities to disrupt our 2018 elections. This is  an ongoing process right now. This was the headline today in the  Washington Post: ``Facebook says it has uncovered a coordinated  disinformation operation ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.'' They  document what they are doing to try to prevent that disinformation  campaign.   We have the testimony of Dan Coats, the Director of National  Intelligence, and other intelligence agency heads. We have Facebook. We  also know that the Russians--and, specifically, the same operation,  GRU, that interfered in the 2016 elections--have already attempted to  interfere in three elections for 2018.   We know one that has been made public, the Senator from Missouri,  Mrs. McCaskill, where the Russians attempted to get into their system  ahead of the 2018 elections. We know all of this is happening, and it  would be surrendering our obligation as Members of the Senate, both  Republicans and Democrats, for us not to take action to defend the  integrity of our elections. The clock is ticking--98 days to go to the  elections.   We know from our intelligence agencies, we know from the evidence  that surfaced today from Facebook, and we know from the fact that they  have already interfered or attempted to interfere in three elections  for 2018 that this Russian effort is coming. So for goodness' sake,  don't we have an obligation to do everything we can to stop it?   That is exactly why Senator Rubio, who is presiding now, and I joined  together to introduce the DETER Act. It is a very straight forward,  simple idea. You need to send a signal in advance to Vladimir Putin  that if Russia gets caught again, if it gets caught this time  interfering in the 2018 elections, there will be automatic and harsh  penalties imposed on Russia and it will hurt Russia's economy. It will  hit them where it hurts. That is what the DETER Act does.   Everything we have heard about Russian conduct and behavior is that  it is important to try to send these signals early if you want to  influence their behavior. So what we need to do is to establish a very  credible threat that if they interfere and they get caught again, they  will face the penalty.   So what the DETER Act does is it says that the Director of National  Intelligence, on behalf of the intelligence community, will make an  assessment about whether or not Russia interfered in the 2018 election.  This assessment would take place shortly after the 2018 elections, and  if their finding is yes, then very harsh penalties take place.   Now, we can talk about the details in the coming days and make sure  that we get this exactly right, but where there should be no debate-- there should be no debate--is about the need to do something along the  lines of the DETER Act and to do it urgently.   As I said, the clock is ticking. We know how the Senate operates.  There is not really that much time between now and the elections, given  all the other things that we have to do, but I hope the Senate would  prioritize defending our democracy. I hope the Senate would prioritize  making sure that we have an election that the people of this country  can have confidence in and that we would prioritize making sure that we  protect the integrity of our democratic system. What Putin wants to do  is to undermine the confidence in the democratic system. He wants to do  that in the United States of America. He wants to do that to our allies  around the world, and we can't let that happen.   So this is not a moment where the Senate should just have hearings or  just talk about it. This is a moment for action, and I join the  Presiding Officer--and I am sorry he wasn't able to join me here  because of his duty in the Chair--but I want to join him not as  Republicans or Democrats but as Americans who want to defend our  democracy. Let's get this job done now. Let's protect the integrity of  our democratic process.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with  Senators Crapo and Brown.   The integrity of our elections is a vital national security interest.  It is imperative that our elections infrastructure--the technology and  services needed to conduct our elections--remains free from foreign  influence.   We know that our elections are under foreign threat from cyber  attacks and disinformation efforts through social media. Our democratic  process can also be manipulated through foreign investments in  elections infrastructure. In fact, just this month, the Federal Bureau  of Investigation notified Maryland officials that Russian oligarch  Vladimir Potanin maintained a substantial investment in a firm used by  the Maryland State Board of Elections to register voters and deliver  online ballots.   This June, the Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Foreign  Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, legislation to enhance our  national security by strengthening the review process of the Committee  on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS. Specifically, the  new law would allow CFIUS to review transactions beyond just those that  could result in foreign control of a U.S. business, to include ``other  investments'' by a foreign person in a U.S. business involved in U.S.  critical infrastructure. Critical infrastructure, as defined by the  Department of Homeland Security, DHS, includes election infrastructure,  such as voter registration databases and associated systems, systems  used to manage elections, voting systems, storage facilities for  election and voting systems, and polling places, to include early  voting locations.   I ask Senator Crapo, do you agree that critical infrastructure, as  defined by DHS, includes certain elections infrastructure?    I ask Senator Brown, do you agree that, once this  bill is enacted into law, existing CFIUS authority is broadened to  review certain ``other investments'' involving elections infrastructure  by a foreign person?
