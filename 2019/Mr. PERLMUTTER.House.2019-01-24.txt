 Madam Speaker, here we are in the fifth week of this  shutdown.   I want to talk about two stories.   One is Tyler. He is a resident of Golden, Colorado. I have known his  family a long time. He has two small children. He says: Two weeks ago,  I received a certificate from the United States of America thanking me  for working for the air traffic controllers for 10 years. The same day,  I got a check for zero dollars.   Then I want to talk about a young woman who works for the EPA. She  has two children with disabilities. She is a patriot. She has a  chemistry degree. She could work in a million different places. She  wanted to work for us, for the United States of America, to serve the  public, to give back to the United States. But now she has to question,  with two young kids with disabilities, whether she can do this anymore.  She expected us to be reliable as employers, and we are not.   We are better than this, Mr. President. Open up the government.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Maine. This  subject is so serious and so infuriating because it is absurd.   We have shut down our government--we are the only country in the  world that does something like this--inflictin harm on our employees,  on Americans, and on America.    I see we have the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger) in the  Chamber. She talked about national security being placed at risk. The  fact that we have done this to ourselves is really difficult, and I  would say to the President, Madam Speaker, that it is time to reopen  this government.   We have offered 11 versions of how to reopen the government. But I  want to talk about some stories, because the psychological effect that  the gentlewoman from Maine talked about really has an impact on these  employees.   I want to talk about a young man who works for the National Park  Service. He is in the natural resource technical division, so what he  does is he goes to the national parks and deals with faults and  different kinds of geological problems that may exist. They work  throughout the year, but particularly at the time when their parks are  not very crowded. This is something that is very important.   He has worked for the Park Service for 19 years, and then, all of a  sudden, he believes that nobody saw this coming, and he is furloughed,  with young children.   And he described it as this:         I don't know when we are going to get back to normal.       Everything is on hold. It just sucks. The mental side is       crushing. I am sad; I am angry; I am demoralized. And this       sitting around, just twiddling your thumbs, hoping that the       greatest Nation on Earth opens back up for business, eats       away at my soul.    He has a brother-in-law who works for the Border Patrol. He is an EMT  and a field agent with four children. He is a first responder not  getting paid.                                time  1730    And this gentleman, we ask him to provide border security, and he is  not getting paid, and he is under the pressure of having a young family  that needs these paychecks and needs stability and reliability.   We had folks from Fish and Wildlife that came in and talked to us,  they deal with aquatic and invasive species, like the zebra mussel,  which really can gum up water systems throughout the country.   There was a big conference between Canada and the western United  States that got canceled when, in fact, we should be making sure these  rivers and our waterways are in good shape. They are getting affected.   There are so many things. We talk about the front-facing individuals  that talk to the public, the TSA, the FBI, those individuals, but we  have so many other employees who provide service to each and every one  of us that are either working without pay or have been furloughed  without any end in sight.   This is no way to run a nation. We know that. The absurdity of all of  this is really taking hold, and it is time for us to open this  government. This can be resolved quickly, Mr. President. Let's just get  this government open, and then let's sit down and negotiate all of  this.    Madam Speaker, I want to talk about Tom, who is a 32- year Federal employee and works as an agricultural statistician. He  calculates how many cattle are in the western United States and how  many acres of hay and crop that we have.   This is his fourth government shutdown. He loves his job and his  work. He loves serving our country. But he feels like these political  games have become an insult, and he is tired of being used as a pawn.   I have many more stories, but I see that the gentleman from Maryland  is ready to go and I yield back to the gentlewoman from Maine so that  she can yield to the gentleman from Maryland.
