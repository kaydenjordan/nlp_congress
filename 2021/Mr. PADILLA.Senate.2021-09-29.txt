 Mr. President, I want to join Chairman Cardin in calling  attention to the unacceptable obstruction by our Republican colleagues  who are doing nothing other than playing political games with the  confirmation process.   Dilawar Syed is an outstanding and highly qualified nominee to serve  as Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration. Mr. Syed  brings decades of experience as a business leader and entrepreneur in a  number of fields. He is a dedicated public servant who helped guide  President Obama's support of Asian-American small business owners in  the wake of the great recession, and he has served as the founding  chair of the California Entrepreneurship Task Force.   He has earned support from business groups and on both sides of the  aisle. Notably, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce enthusiastically announced  their support for his nomination, citing his very impressive  background.   In June of this year, two of our Republican colleagues joined the  Democratic members of the Small Business Committee and voted to send  Mr. Syed's nomination to the full Senate for confirmation. But, today,  Republicans are refusing to allow the Senate to vote on his nomination.  In so doing, they are also obstructing the work of the SBA itself--work  that has never been more critical.   As the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote back in April, ``It is  essential for SBA's senior leadership team to be in place to deliver on  the agency's COVID-19 small business emergency relief  responsibilities.'' Again, critical.   Mr. Syed is ready to serve with dedication and skill as the SBA  pursues its mission of supporting economic growth for entrepreneurs and  working families. He is also ready to make history as the highest  ranking Muslim official in any Presidential administration, and our  Nation's hard-working small business owners urgently need his  leadership.  [[Page S6753]]    My Republican colleagues who are playing these political games to  obstruct this nomination are also blocking resources needed by their  own constituents.   Let's end this, and I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm Mr. Syed.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce the bipartisan  Outdoors for All Act.   This legislation would ensure that access to local parks and outdoor  recreation is equitable and available to all.   The Outdoors for All Act would codify and guarantee annual funding  for the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership program, which provides  grants to build new outdoor recreation spaces, improve existing parks,  and form connections between underserved, urban communities and the  outdoors.   It specifically invests in parks and open spaces in areas where 80  percent of Americans live. Any urban area with a population of at least  30,000 can qualify for grants, which can benefit residents in all 50  States.   These grants would fund projects in park-poor, urban communities, and  the bill would require the National Park Service to prioritize projects  that support underserved communities, provide job-training to youth,  and leverage resources through public-private partnerships.   As our cities grow and the effects of climate change intensify, this  bill will increase equitable access to the many benefits of local  parks, from job creation, to shade and tree cover, to clean air.   Nationwide, 100 million people, including 28 million children, do not  have a park within a half-mile of home. That is almost one third of  America.   Additionally, in the 100 most populated cities, neighborhoods where  most residents identify as Black, Latino, American Indian/Alaska  Native, or Asian American and Pacific Islander have access to an  average of 44 percent less park acreage than predominantly White  neighborhoods.   For example, in Los Angeles, low-income communities and communities  of color lack equal access to parks; a Los Angeles County survey found  that Compton reported only 0.6 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents,  in contrast to Malibu, which has 55.5 acres of parkland per 1,000  residents.  [[Page S6782]]    This bill would address this staggering inequity in Los Angeles and  across the country and make equity and justice a key focus of park  investment and planning.   I thank my colead Senator Collins and all of the bill's cosponsors  for championing this effort with me in the Senate. I also thank  Congresswoman Barragan for her steadfast dedication to park equity.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Outdoors for  All Act as soon as possible.   Thank you.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 2888. A bill to reduce passenger, crewmember, and airport  personnel risk of exposure to COVID-19, decrease the risk of  transmission of COVID-19 on board aircraft and to United States  destination communities through air travel, and protect children and  other vulnerable individuals by preventing further spread of COVID-19  in the United States; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation.
