 Madam Speaker, as the mother of a Pomona  police officer and former 911 dispatcher, I rise today to commemorate  National Police Week. This week, we celebrate the heroes who don't make  the headlines.   I know, from my son and other officers, how much our society expects  from the law enforcement community. We expect these brave men and women  to put themselves in harm's way and even endanger their own lives to  keep us safe.   Our police officers are protectors, peacekeepers, and public  servants, and I am proud to recognize them for what they do.   Law enforcement is a demanding and often thankless calling, and that  is why I will always fight to give our public safety professionals the  resources they need to carry out their duties.   As a 911 dispatcher for over 17 years, I answered calls from people  in danger and helped make sure that Los Angeles police officers were in  the right place at the right time with the right support they needed to  keep the city safe.   Anyone calling for budget cuts to law enforcement, including our  heroic Capitol Police, has clearly never heard the calls that I have.   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have repeatedly called  for and secured crucial funding for law enforcement and public safety  in California's 35th Congressional District and across our country.   I have also introduced the 911 SAVES Act, which gives our 911  dispatchers the recognition they deserve by officially classifying them  as emergency responders.   Law enforcement personnel must have the resources and support that  they need to appropriately carry out their duties. I will always fight  to ensure that they can uphold their sacred promise to protect and  serve our communities.
