 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we will vote today and tomorrow on the  Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, in the midst of a looming  constitutional crisis. Only in the past few weeks, the Director of the  FBI has confirmed that his agency is investigating ties between  President Trump's associates and Russian meddling in our recent  election.   The urgent need for an impartial investigation and the possibility of  the Supreme Court's having to rule on a subpoena directed to the  President of the United States is very real. The repeat of United  States v. Nixon is far from idle speculation. The independence of our  judicial branch has never been more important. It has never been more  threatened.   When the story of this constitutional crisis is written, I believe  that the heroes will be an independent judiciary and a free press. An  independent judiciary is the bulwark against overreaching and  autocratic tyranny, and the free press has uncovered much of the facts  that have prompted the FBI investigation and, I hope, eventually-- sooner rather than later--an independent prosecutor because only a  special prosecutor can bring criminal charges that will hold  accountable wrongdoers who have broken our criminal laws.   In this constitutional crisis, respect for an independent judiciary  is more important than ever before, but it is threatened by forces that  are powerful and undeniable. It was threatened first by the denial to  Merrick Garland of a hearing and a vote, relying on an invented  principle found nowhere in the Constitution that the President of the  United States--then Barack Obama--somehow lost his power to appoint  Justices during the fourth year of his term. That act of political  expediency demeaned this institution, the U.S. Senate, and it also  disrespected our judiciary. It dragged the Supreme Court into the  partisan mire that has caused such drastic dysfunction in this branch  of government.   President Trump demonstrated his own disrespect for the judiciary  through his constant, repeated, relentless attacks, calling one member  of the bench a ``so-called judge'' simply because he ruled against him  and struck down on constitutional grounds President Trump's illegal  travel ban--really a Muslim ban. His demeaning and disparaging comments  have attempted to shake the foundation of respect for judicial rulings  that have held him accountable and potentially every President  accountable to the American people, along with the Senate and the House  of Representatives. He has attempted to convince his audience that  judges who rule against him are not only wrong but illegitimate--in one  case, because of a judge's ethnic heritage.   I would have thought that there would have been bipartisan shock and  outrage at such suggestions, but the silence across the aisle has been  deafening. Such a campaign by the Executive against the judicial branch  would be extraordinarily disturbing regardless of the circumstances but  particularly so now in the midst of this constitutional challenge.   President Trump's disrespect for the judiciary was emphasized, as  well, by how he selected his nominee for the Court and how he  established a litmus test for that nominee. He proudly proclaimed that  litmus test, declaring on multiple occasions that his nominee would  automatically overturn Roe v. Wade and strike down gun violence  prevention measures. He outsourced that selection process to extreme  rightwing groups, like the Heritage Foundation, choosing from their  list, from their preapproved selectees. Against this backdrop,  President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.   I want to make clear that despite my outrage about what happened to  Merrick Garland, which was far worse than a filibuster--one of my  colleagues has termed it the ``filibuster of all filibusters''--and  despite my deep concern over a nomination from a President who so  disrespects the judicial branch, I was prepared to give Judge Gorsuch a  fair hearing. I believe my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and I  provided that hearing, and we will provide a vote.   I strongly believe that during this process, Judge Gorsuch had a  special obligation to be forthcoming. I want to be clear that that is  not opining on cases or controversies that may come before him or  issues that may be before his Court if he is confirmed. Unlike prior  nominees, he absolutely refused to say whether he agreed with core  principles and precedents, well-established and long-accepted decisions  of the Supreme Court that embody and enshrine principles that the  American people have accepted and that they expect the Supreme Court to  implement.   There is no tradition of a Supreme Court nominee's refusing to answer  every question posed to him as Neil Gorsuch did, even questions about  iconic cases. Justice Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts answered  unambiguously that they believed that Brown v. Board of Education was  rightly decided. Justice Roberts also said of the decision in Griswold  v. Connecticut: ``I agree with the Griswold Court's conclusion.'' On  the related case of Eisenstadt v. Baird, Justice Alito said: ``I do  agree with the result in Eisenstadt.'' Such statements do not prejudice  any litigants or prejudge any cases; instead, they provided Senators  and, more importantly, the American people with the confidence that  these Justices adhere to long-settled legal principles that have formed  the basis of critically important cases that came afterward. How far  these principles may extend is a live issue, but their underlying  legitimacy is not and should not be.    Unfortunately, at his hearing, Judge Gorsuch would tell us only that  Griswold and Eisenstadt were precedents--or decisions--of the Court,  and he doubled down on his evasiveness in response to written questions  that were submitted just last week. There was no reason for him to  diverge from the kinds of answers that were provided by Justice Roberts  and Justice Alito unless he, unlike them, disagreed with the reasoning  that was used in these cases.   These cases go to the core of the right to privacy and equal  treatment under the rule of law. The constitutional right to privacy  underlies not  [[Page S2343]]  just the rights of couples to use contraception, which was the issue in  Griswold and Eisenstadt, but the right of women to control their own  bodies, as established in Roe v. Wade, and couples of different races  to marry, as established in Loving v. Virginia, or the right of same- sex couples to equal treatment, as established in Lawrence v. Texas and  Obergefell v. Hodges. Justice Brandeis, in one of the original privacy  decisions, called this right to privacy ``the right to be left alone,''  and it is a core constitutional principle that Chief Justice Roberts  endorsed as well.   If Judge Gorsuch does not believe in this fundamental right or equal  protection under the rule of law, the American people deserve to know  it. Unfortunately, his continued evasion of my questions and those of  others tells a different story. I am left with the inescapable  conclusion that Judge Gorsuch passed the Trump litmus test--an  automatically anti-choice, pro-gun conservative and an acolyte of hard- right special interests who screened and selected his name. Yet I am  equally and maybe more concerned by Judge Gorsuch's approach to cases  dealing with worker safety and consumer rights, issues relating to  clean air and water and the fundamental role of the public sector in  protecting individuals and putting their rights above corporate  interests.   The important concerns my colleagues and I have raised have been  caricatured by some Senate Republicans to a belief that judges should  always rule for sympathetic plaintiffs, and that is simply not so. The  TransAm Trucking case, which has been discussed at length on the floor  and in committee, is of concern not because of the individual but  because of the reasoning he used. He relied on a handpicked dictionary  definition to rule against a worker who left his truck as he was under  threat of grave physical peril and perhaps death, and he distorted the  meaning of the statute, leaving aside basic common sense and feeling.  He called Congress's declared statutory purpose--protecting health and  safety--too ``ephemeral and generic'' to provide an interpretive guide.  That is how he characterized our purpose here in protecting the safety  of workers. This approach shows that Judge Gorsuch looks for guidance  not in the words that Congress has chosen but in his own dictionary.  And it may not even be Webster's; it may be the dictionary that is in  his head or is in the heads of the rightwing groups who screened and  proposed his name.   Then there is Judge Gorsuch's open hostility to the Chevron doctrine,  which is a term that was likely meaningless and incomprehensible to  most Americans before these proceedings and may be again after we are  done. Yet it is a profoundly important principle of law that  essentially stands against judicial activism--the very defect that many  of our Republican colleagues believe is too characteristic of the  courts today.   The structure of our government depends on the flexibility of these  agencies that protect the purity of our drinking water, the safety of  workers on construction sites, the integrity of our financial markets,  and much, much more, so that it may do its job and enforce rules and  laws that provide not only protection for ordinary people, everyday  Americans, but also a level playing field for the good guys who want to  do the right thing, and they are the majority of businesses in this  country.   The proposed abandoning of the Chevron doctrine that Judge Gorsuch  supports would eviscerate the enforcement of these basic rules that  protect workers and consumers--people who drink water in their homes  and breathe the air and go to work every day and expect to come home  safely, as well as people who invest their money in a way that is  protected against fraud.   As Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner wrote this Sunday in the New York  Times:         Judge Gorsuch is skeptical that Congress can use broadly       written laws to delegate authority to agencies in the first       place. That can only mean that at least portions of such       statutes--the source of so many regulations that safeguard       Americans' welfare--must be sent back to Congress, to redo or       not.    I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Apr. 1, 2017]                    The Government Gorsuch Wants To Undo                     (By Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner)         At recent Senate hearings to fill the Supreme Court's open       seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch came across as a thoroughly bland       and nonthreatening nominee. The idea was to give as little       ammunition as possible to opponents when his nomination comes       up this week for a vote, one that Senate Democrats may try to       upend with a filibuster.        But the reality is that Judge Gorsuch embraces a judicial       philosophy that would do nothing less than undermine the       structure of modern government--including the rules that keep       our water clean, regulate the financial markets and protect       workers and consumers. In strongly opposing the       administrative state, Judge Gorsuch is in the company of       incendiary figures like the White House adviser Steve Bannon,       who has called for its ``deconstruction.'' The Republican-      dominated House, too, has passed a bill designed to severely       curtail the power of federal agencies.        Businesses have always complained that government       regulations increase their costs, and no doubt some       regulations are ill-conceived. But a small group of       conservative intellectuals have gone much further to argue       that the rules that safeguard our welfare and the orderly       functioning of the market have been fashioned in a way that's       not constitutionally legitimate. This once-fringe cause of       the right asserts, as Judge Gorsuch put it in a speech last       year, that the administrative state ``poses a grave threat to       our values of personal liberty.''        The 80 years of law that are at stake began with the New       Deal. President Franklin D. Roosevelt believed that the Great       Depression was caused in part by ruinous competition among       companies. In 1933, Congress passed the National Industrial       Recovery Act, which allowed the president to approve ``fair       competition'' standards for different trades and industries.       The next year, Roosevelt approved a code for the poultry       industry, which, among other things, set a minimum wage and       maximum hours for workers, and hygiene requirements for       slaughterhouses. Such basic workplace protections and       constraints on the free market are now taken for granted.        But in 1935, after a New York City slaughterhouse operator       was convicted of violating the poultry code, the Supreme       Court called into question the whole approach of the New       Deal, by holding that the N.I.R.A. was an ``unconstitutional       delegation by Congress of a legislative power.'' Only       Congress can create rules like the poultry code, the justices       said. Because Congress did not define ``fair competition,''       leaving the rule-making to the president, the N.I.R.A.       violated the Constitution's separation of powers.        The court's ruling in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. the United       States, along with another case decided the same year, are       the only instances in which the Supreme Court has ever struck       down a federal statute based on this rationale, known as the       ``nondelegation doctrine.'' Schechter Poultry's stand against       executive-branch rule-making proved to be a legal dead end,       and for good reason. As the court has recognized over and       over, before and since 1935, Congress is a cumbersome body       that moves slowly in the best of times, while the economy is       an incredibly dynamic system. For the sake of business as       well as labor, the updating of regulations can't wait for       Congress to give highly specific and detailed directions.        The New Deal filled the gap by giving policy-making       authority to agencies, including the Securities and Exchange       Commission, which protects investors, and the National Labor       Relations Board, which oversees collective bargaining between       unions and employers. Later came other agencies, including       the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety       and Health Administration (which regulates workplace safety)       and the Department of Homeland Security. Still other agencies       regulate the broadcast spectrum, keep the national parks       open, help farmers and assist Americans who are overseas.       Administrative agencies coordinated the response to Sept. 11,       kept the Ebola outbreak in check and were instrumental to       ending the last financial crisis. They regulate the safety of       food, drugs, airplanes and nuclear power plants. The       administrative state isn't optional in our complex society.       It's indispensable.        But if the regulatory power of this arm of government is       necessary, it also poses a risk that federal agencies, with       their large bureaucracies and potential ties to lobbyists,       could abuse their power. Congress sought to address that       concern in 1946, by passing the Administrative Procedure Act,       which ensured a role for the judiciary in overseeing rule-      making by agencies.        The system worked well enough for decades, but questions       arose when Ronald Reagan came to power promising to       deregulate. His E.P.A. sought to weaken a rule, issued by the       Carter administration, which called for regulating       ``stationary sources'' of air pollution--a broad wording that       is open to interpretation. When President Reagan's E.P.A.       narrowed the definition of what counted as a ``stationary       source'' to allow plants to emit more pollutants, an       environmental group challenged the agency. The Supreme Court       held in 1984 in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council       that the E.P.A. (and any agency) could determine the  [[Page S2344]]       meaning of an ambiguous term in the law. The rule came to be       known as Chevron deference: When Congress uses ambiguous       language in a statute, courts must defer to an agency's       reasonable interpretation of what the words mean.        Chevron was not viewed as a left-leaning decision. The       Supreme Court decided in favor of the Reagan administration,       after all, voting 6 to 0 (three justices did not take part),       and spanning the ideological spectrum. After the conservative       icon Justice Antonin Scalia reached the Supreme Court, he       declared himself a Chevron fan. ``In the long run Chevron       will endure,'' Justice Scalia wrote in a 1989 article,       ``because it more accurately reflects the reality of       government, and thus more adequately serves its needs.''        That was then. But the Reagan administration's effort to       cut back on regulation ran out of steam. It turned out that       the public often likes regulation--because it keeps the air       and water clean, the workplace safe and the financial system       in working order. Deregulation of the financial system led to       the savings-and-loans crisis of the 1980s and the financial       crisis a decade ago, costing taxpayers billions.        Businesses, however, have continued to complain that the       federal government regulates too much. In the past 20 years,       conservative legal scholars have bolstered the red-tape       critique with a constitutional one. They argued that only       Congress--not agencies--can create rules. This is Schechter       Poultry all over again.        And Judge Gorsuch has forcefully joined in. Last year, in a       concurring opinion in an immigration case called Gutierrez-      Brizuela v. Lynch, he attacked Chevron deference, writing       that the rule ``certainly seems to have added prodigious new       powers to an already titanic administrative state.''       Remarkably, Judge Gorsuch argued that Chevron--one of the       most frequently cited cases in the legal canon--is       illegitimate in part because it is out of step with (you       guessed it) Schechter Poultry. Never mind that the Supreme       Court hasn't since relied on its 1935 attempt to scuttle the       New Deal. Nonetheless, Judge Gorsuch wrote that in light of       Schechter Poultry, ``you might ask how is it that Chevron--a       rule that invests agencies with pretty unfettered power to       regulate a lot more than chicken--can evade the chopping       block.''        At his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch hinted that he       might vote to overturn Chevron without saying so directly,       noting that the administrative state existed long before       Chevron was decided in 1984. The implication is that little       would change if courts stopped deferring to the E.P.A.'s or       the Department of Labor's reading of a statute. Judges would       interpret the law. Who could object to that?        But here's the thing: Judge Gorsuch is skeptical that       Congress can use broadly written laws to delegate authority       to agencies in the first place. That can mean only that at       least portions of such statutes--the source of so many       regulations that safeguard Americans' welfare--must be sent       back to Congress, to redo or not.        On the current Supreme Court, only Justice Clarence Thomas       seeks to strip power from the administrative state by       undercutting Chevron and even reviving the obsolete and       discredited nondelegation doctrine, as he explains in       opinions approvingly cited by Judge Gorsuch. But President       Trump may well appoint additional justices, and the other       conservatives on the court have expressed some uneasiness       with Chevron, though as yet they are not on board for       overturning it. What would happen if agencies could not make       rules for the financial industry and for consumer,       environmental and workplace protection? Decades of experience       in the United States and around the world teach that the       administrative state is a necessary part of the modern market       economy. With Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, we will be       one step closer to testing that premise.     His philosophy represents the height of activism,  because it would allow courts to substitute their policy judgments for  agency expertise. Abandoning the Chevron doctrine and the principles it  represents invokes a desire to destroy a broad array of rules that  protect critical rights. One such rule was issued by the Occupational  Safety and Health Administration in the aftermath of a Connecticut  tragedy at L'Ambiance Plaza decades ago when a collapse killed 28  workers in Bridgeport, CT. The rule prohibiting the use of the lift  slab construction technique that led to L'Ambiance's collapse has now  saved the lives of others. But would it have survived a review by Judge  Gorsuch? My fear is that he would have struck it down and substituted  the activist instinct of a judge instead--protecting the corporations  that might use it.   Today we still know very little about Judge Gorsuch's core beliefs  because he evaded so many questions. But here is what we do know. We  know that the man who hired him has said he passes his rightwing litmus  test. We know that conservative organizations have spent millions of  dollars on the prospect that he will move American law dramatically to  the right. And we know that he will not answer questions that his  Republican-appointed predecessors answered about core tenets of  American jurisprudence. In short, he has left us with substantial  doubt.   Let me conclude on this note--that doubt. Important and critical  doubt that should preclude us from confirming him today leaves women  wondering how long they will have autonomy over their healthcare  decisions, same-sex couples questioning whether they might be denied  the right to marry the person they love, workers and consumers doubting  their rights, and Americans fearing the Court will abandon protections  of privacy, equality, and the rule of law.   That is why I cannot support this nomination and why I urge my  colleagues to support a filibuster to block it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as we finished the vote just hours  ago, I could not help but notice a number of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle high-fiving each other. That image stays with me as I  stand here now. It saddens me. There is no cause for celebration in  what happened in the Senate just hours ago. No one should sleep well  tonight. No one should underestimate the magnitude of what happened  here. Damage was done to our democracy, in fact, to the institutions  that are the pillars of our democracy--the United States Supreme Court  and the Senate itself.   Today is, indeed, one of my saddest days in the Senate. Sadder than  anything is the damage that has been caused to the Supreme Court by  eroding and undermining trust and respect for an institution that has  power only because of its credibility with the American people. It has  no armies or police force; all it really has is the confidence and  respect of the American people.   Today, raw political power has been exercised to break the rules and  norms of this body so that a nominee could be confirmed. The only way  that he could be confirmed was, in fact, to wreck the rules, a nuclear  option that will have enduring fallout and rippling repercussions,  perhaps for years come.   For myself, I would state unequivocally that I hope we will work  together on issues where we have common ground, where we can reach  common solutions on infrastructure, on tax reform, on immigration  issues.   No one should make light of the potential fallout, as there is in any  nuclear explosion, from this action today.   The Senate has broken with decades of bipartisan practice when it  comes to the U.S. Supreme Court. The practice and the tradition was  that Presidents of either party would consult with Members of both  parties in this body before making a nomination so as to ensure a  mainstream nominee, and that nominee would be in the mainstream even  before his or her selection so that there was some modicum of comity  and so that respect for this body, as well as the courts, would be  preserved.   My concern is that the contagion of partisanship will infect the  court system as a whole. All of the nominations to lower courts, as  well as the appellate courts, will be affected.   My hope is that we can avoid that truly cataclysmic outcome, a  nuclear explosion, in some ways even more deafening and damaging than  the one used today would be because our courts are the bulwark of our  democracy. An attack on our courts is an attack on the only check we  have against tyranny and autocratic erosion of those rights. That is  why the nonpartisanship of our courts is so important.   The Supreme Court, of all our courts, should be above politics. In  fact, that is why the 60-vote rule for the Supreme Court was so  important. The Supreme Court is different: nine Justices appointed for  life to the highest Court in  [[Page S2400]]  the land. In some ways, it is an anachronism in our democracy-- unaccountable, unelected, sitting for life with the power to strike  down actions of elected representatives and an elected Executive by  issuing words on paper without the direct means to enforce them,  depending only on respect and credibility from the American people. To  approve nominees by a razor-thin majority is a disservice to the Court  and to our democracy.   Supreme Court Justices do more than just follow the law; they have to  resolve conflicts in the law and differences among the lower courts  where they disagreed and, in fact, ambiguities in the statute, where  there is lack of clarity, where this body is unable to reach consensus  and, in effect, decides to agree, to the extent it can, and leave some  question to administrative agencies, which rightly are entitled to  respect, as they implement the law.   Confidence and trust are essential, and we have undermined it today.  Our Republican colleagues have gravely damaged it by the actions taken  today.   I have urged my colleagues to reject Neil Gorsuch because I believe  he is out of the mainstream, because he failed to answer questions  about whether he agreed with established core precedents essential to  rights of privacy and equality under the law, because he has a judicial  philosophy that would involve substituting judgments of courts for  administrative agencies and banning the Chevron doctrine, and because  he favored in many of his actions, opinions, writings the interests of  corporations over individual rights.   We have debated the merits of this nominee. I believe that his  repeated evasion of the questions that were put to him leaves us with  the inescapable conclusion that he passed the Trump test; that he is  not a neutral caller of balls and strikes; that he is, in fact, an  acolyte of the of the rightwing groups that screened and suggested his  name; and that he would carry out not only the Trump litmus test to  overrule Roe v. Wade, strike down gun violence provisions, but also  other unknown decisions that would implement that far-right  conservative agenda. We can debate whether that view is right or wrong.   Today is one of my saddest days in the Senate. It goes more to the  institutions that have been demeaned and degraded: the U.S. Senate and  the Supreme Court. My hope is that maybe it will be a turning point.  Maybe we can reconstruct the sense of bipartisanship and comity that  existed for so many years. Many of my colleagues on the other side have  expressed to me their misgivings about what was done today.   The obstruction of Merrick Garland's nomination was, as one of my  colleagues put it, ``the filibuster of all filibusters.'' It was  another step in a continuing progression, culminating in today's  outcome that very much betrays the spirit and values of a bipartisan  selection of Supreme Court nominees because the highest Court in the  land is different.   I had the extraordinary honor to clerk for a Justice on the U.S.  Supreme Court, Harry Blackmun, who was appointed by a Republican,  President Richard Nixon. He grew as a Justice and surprised a lot of  people. He, no doubt, surprised the President who appointed him. And  that is what happens to really extraordinary men and women who serve on  our courts as well as in the U.S. Senate; they grow in the job.    Choosing a U.S. Supreme Court Justice is one of the most solemn and  important duties that a President has, and confirming her or him is one  of the most important tasks we have in this body.   Even at the most difficult and contentious times, as I served then as  a law clerk and as I have litigated since then for several decades, I  have never doubted that judges were working in good faith to uphold the  rule of law. Whether they ruled my way or not, I believed that we were  working to try to be above partisan politics and uphold the rule of law  and do the right thing to follow the law.   The Supreme Court does more than follow; it leads. Today's vote is a  significant challenge to that principle and perhaps the most difficult  that we have seen in recent history. It threatens to exact profound  damage on the confidence and trust the American people have in the  Supreme Court and perhaps in the courts overall, and that is a danger  for all of us.   In my view, when the history of this time is written, there will be  two heroes: the free press that has uncovered abuses and wrongdoing  despite opposition from many powerful forces, and our independent  judiciary that has upheld their right to do it and, also, the rights of  countless Americans in many areas of law.   Today's action threatens those two institutions in our society. It  undermines our rules. It would not have happened without a choice made  by the Republican leadership that they were willing to break the rules  to achieve this result.   I am determined to try to move forward in a positive way, in  legislation as well as in protecting and enhancing our courts, giving  them the resources they need to do their job--and law enforcement, the  resources needed to uphold the rule of law.   We cannot hold the Supreme Court hostage to any ideology, and that is  a lesson from today and from the past year that we should all heed.   Mr. President, I will continue to talk about this topic because I  believe it is so profoundly important to our Nation, but for now, I  yield the floor.
