 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the Republicans have  skipped town. They are leaving behind a ransom note on the full faith  and credit of the United States. One Republican Congressman said: ``My  conservative colleagues don't feel like we should negotiate with our  hostage,'' but the real hostages are American seniors, veterans, and  working families.   Donald Trump said: ``If they don't give you massive cuts, you are  going to have to do a default,'' but that is not what he said back in  2019. Back then, he said the debt ceiling was, ``a very sacred thing in  our country that we can never play with.''   He was right then.   Instead of cutting costs on the backs of working people, we should  require billionaires and corporations to pay their fair share, but  Republicans in Congress would rather put veterans' healthcare on the  chopping block. Most Americans, most Republicans, don't support that.  Let's get serious and get back to work.                            ____________________
