 Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago, more than half of U.S.  electricity came from coal. Today, it is less than 20 percent.   We now generate more energy from renewables than from coal. This  isn't anti-energy. It is about cheap energy.   In 2022, last year, 10 percent of all vehicle sales in the United  States were EVs. That was up from 6 percent the year before, 2 percent  the year before that.   ExxonMobil and Chevron today are trading at about 8 to 9 times their  earnings. I would compare that to companies like First Solar and Tesla  that are trading to 40 to 60 times earnings.   Let me dumb this down for you all. Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago, if you  shifted your investment portfolio away from fossil energy toward  climate-friendly investments, you would be richer today.   Now, my Republican colleagues, you all talk a good game about how you  are into personal freedom, and yet you are taking individual investors'  freedom away from them with this bill.   You all talk a good game about how government should not be picking  winners and losers. Why do you all keep picking losers?   In 2011, a guy named Hugo Chavez redirected Venezuelan oil worker  pensions into a Ponzi scheme run by a political ally.   My Republican colleagues a couple weeks ago voted to oppose socialism  in all its form. I am thinking that Hugo Chavez guy seems pretty smart.  Let's do the same thing.   You know what you call capitalism when you are losing? Woke  capitalism.   So if you all are afraid of free markets, if you want to destroy  workers' pensions, if you oppose individual freedom, if you want to  force your constituents to invest in proven losers, then please vote  for this resolution. Be honest about your values.   For everyone else, vote ``no.'' I plan to do so proudly and honestly.
