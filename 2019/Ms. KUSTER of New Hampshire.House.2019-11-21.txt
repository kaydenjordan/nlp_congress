 Madam Speaker, I rise today on National  Rural Health Day to bring attention to the importance of healthcare in  rural communities across this country and in New Hampshire.   Far too often, there are substantial health disparities for those  living in rural America. Our rural communities face growing and unique  healthcare challenges exacerbated by distance and the time it takes to  see a provider.  [[Page H9127]]    That is why I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 4995, the Maternal Health  Quality Improvement Act. This legislation would create rural maternal  network grant programs and ensure maternal health providers are  eligible for telehealth.   This is especially impactful for Granite State families that face  long distances and deal with extreme workforce shortages that make it  difficult to access much-needed care. For them, having access to  telehealth for maternal care is a real life-changer.   We must all continue to support and lift up the innovation, quality,  and service of rural healthcare providers and facilities.                            ____________________
