 Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of the en bloc  amendment which contains an amendment I have offered.   In order to ensure the Environmental Protection Agency is able to  effectively carry out its responsibility to protect human health and  the environment for future generations, we need to ensure emergency  responders and investigators are there when we need them.   Closing EPA's facilities or relocating personnel tasked with the  ultimate responsibility to answer the call during an environmental  emergency or investigate the cost and whom to hold accountable in the  aftermath is the wrong approach. Future generations will be less safe,  and the health of our environment will be at increased risk.    This amendment would simply prevent the EPA from closing or  relocating any office or facility that houses either emergency  responders or a criminal investigation unit responsible for carrying  out the agency's mission.   EPA emergency response personnel serve in offices--some large and  some small--across this Nation. These brave and dedicated public  servants respond to oil spills; chemical, biological, and radiological  releases; and large-scale national emergencies. They also provide  additional response assistance when State and local first responder  capabilities have been exhausted or need additional support.   Located in my district is the Large Lakes Research Station on Grosse  Ile, an island in the Detroit River. This facility serves the Great  Lakes region.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
