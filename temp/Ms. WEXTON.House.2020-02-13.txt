 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank Congresswoman Speier for introducing this important resolution.   In 1923 Alice Paul introduced the equal rights amendment to include  women in our Nation's founding documents. Nearly 100 years later,  during my time in the Virginia State Senate, I sponsored the resolution  for Virginia to ratify the ERA. But it wouldn't be until January 27,  2020, with the historic number of women lawmakers serving in the State  legislature that the great Commonwealth of Virginia became the 38th and  final State to ratify the equal rights amendment.   This was not simply a symbolic vote. Specifically affirming equality  on the basis of sex in the Constitution will strengthen State and  Federal laws that protect women. We need the equal rights amendment to  ensure that equal justice under law is a constitutional right for women  and not just an inscription over the entrance to the Supreme Court.   Finally, these words will ring true: ``Equality of rights under the  law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State  on account of sex.''   Today, I am proud to cast my vote in support of the ERA and in  recognition of the tireless work of so many trailblazers and activists  over the years, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
