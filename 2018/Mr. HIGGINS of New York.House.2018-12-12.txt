 Mr. Speaker, this good and generous Nation  has a long tradition of welcoming those seeking refuge and a better  life in America.   America is, in fact, a nation of immigrants. For generations,  immigrants and refugees--my ancestors included--have contributed to a  diverse and strong Nation built on the foundation that, through hard  work, anything is possible.   The State Department recently announced plans to cut the very  programs to provide refugees with the tools toward economic  independence, self-sufficiency, and success. It is a counterproductive  move by the administration that cites the economy as a priority.   Refugees are helping to revitalize older communities like the  Buffalo-Niagara region, increasing our population, contributing to a  dedicated workforce, and bringing new quality of life and economic life  back to neighborhoods like Buffalo's west side.   We are calling on Secretary Pompeo to immediately reverse any plans  to cut resettlement agencies and reaffirm this Nation's commitment to  the American Dream.                            ____________________
