 Mr. Speaker, May is Jewish American Heritage Month, a  time to acknowledge the inspiring history of American Jews and to  celebrate their contributions to every facet of American life.   From science and medicine to education and technology to music,  theater, philanthropy, civil rights, and the pursuit of justice,  American Jews have worked hard to build our great country.   Yet, we are facing a frightening rise in anti-Semitism. The 2021 FBI  hate crimes report showed a 20 percent increase in anti-Semitic hate  crimes.   Jews are the most targeted minority group in America, despite being  only 2 percent of the population. History has taught us that what  starts with anti-Semitism never stops there. Hatred spreads to other  minorities and threatens the foundations of democracy.   As the co-chair of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating  Anti-Semitism, I am working with Members on both sides of the aisle and  the Biden administration to confront anti-Semitism.   I will continue this fight to honor the Jewish Americans who have  contributed so much to American life.                            ____________________
