 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Yesterday the Rules Committee reported an impeachment resolution that  was hastily drafted without Republican input with just 24 hours' notice  for review. Last night we offered, on the Republican side, 17  amendments. Unsurprisingly, none were adopted.   Despite assurances that all Members will have access to materials  supporting the Articles of Impeachment, to date, Chairman Schiff has  ignored 72 bipartisan requests to view Ambassador Volker's transcript,  but pursuant to rule XI, clause 2(e)(2), committee records are the  property of the House, and thus, Members of the House should have  access.   Last night at the Rules Committee, it was stated that perhaps  Republicans were not requesting the information at the right time, so  we have to ask: When is the right time to ask to view our own House  records? Republicans requested an authorizing vote, and now we will  have one. However, this process has not been open and transparent, and  it diverts from precedent set in the two most recent Presidential  impeachment investigations. As a result, this investigation will be  conducted with no minority input.   A Presidential impeachment investigation is a national trauma. All  Members must take this constitutionally vested power seriously, and  Americans deserve to be represented in this process. Unfortunately,  neither serious nor equal consideration, nor full access to records  appear to be a criteria under which the Democrats are willing to  conduct this investigation. That is a shame, and it renders this  process a sham.
