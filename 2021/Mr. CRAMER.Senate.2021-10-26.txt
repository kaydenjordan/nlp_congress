 Madam President, every October, the Congressional  Coalition on Adoption Institute--CCAI--  [[Page S7367]]  sponsors its annual Angels in Adoption recognition gala. This event  honors individuals across the Nation who are making a difference in the  lives of young people in need of foster and forever homes.   As adoptive parents ourselves, the dedication and commitment to  adoption and foster care by CCAI and every Angels in Adoption honoree  this year are extremely near and dear to the hearts of my wife Kris and  me.   I want to recognize the Angels in Adoption couple I nominated and who  are being honored this year. I have known Jon and Carol Mielke of  Bismarck, ND, for many years. Yet I am not sure our home community has  any idea of all they have done to foster such vulnerable young children  for nearly 20 years.   Jon and Carol became foster parents in early 2003, when their  daughter was in college and their son a senior in high school. They  made the decision to foster infants, they said, because they had ``room  in their home and room in their hearts.''   To date, they have taken into their home some 45 infants. Some were  with them for only a couple of days. Others stayed nearly 3 years.   Always keeping in mind the main goal of foster care is family  reunification, they have made an effort to remain in contact with the  biological families of these children. Their first foster child was a  newborn who had been abandoned at the bus station. They cared for her  for 2-and-a-half months. This girl, who recently graduated from high  school, is one of the children with whom Jon and Carol have stayed in  touch. Another set of twins, now teenagers, visited them for a week  earlier this year.   Jon was a longtime administrative manager for a State agency, and  Carol's profession was accounting. He has since retired, and she later  became a licensed practical nurse, keeping flexible work hours to be  available for the children when they come into their home.   Because of Jon's background in legislation and lobbying, he has  provided testimony on foster care issues before the legislature. This  has helped bring positive statutory changes to some State laws.   Jon and Carol have been active in the regional foster care  association, with Jon serving as president one year. They also mentor  new foster parents and have appeared in media campaigns promoting  foster care. In 2006, they were named North Dakota's Foster Parents of  the Year.   The lifelong impact of the love and care they have given to each and  every baby coming into their home will never be accurately measured.  And, after nearly two decades, they continue to remain dedicated to  foster care because of their unwavering belief they can make a  difference in the life of a child.   I join all North Dakotans and the entire Congressional Coalition on  Adoption Institute in congratulating and honoring Jon and Carol Mielke.  We thank you for your years of dedication and the work you continue to  do fostering infants in your home. You are exceptionally deserving of  recognition as Angels in Adoption.                            ____________________
