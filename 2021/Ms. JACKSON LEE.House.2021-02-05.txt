 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise with great promise to support H.R. 447, the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2021, and thank the manager. I thank the chairman  for investing $3.5 billion over 5 years in expanding opportunities and  access to registered apprenticeships, youth apprenticeships, and pre- apprenticeships.   Let me tell you that in this time of record unemployment, 10 million  jobs lost in the United States, we need the opportunity to redirect and  retrain the American public. I am a strong supporter of apprenticeship  programs.   Colleges in my district, like HCC, have programs: independent  electrical contractors, plumbers, masonry, that make a difference and  have individuals making dollars that they have not made before.   I include in the Record two articles. The first one is from the  ``Houston Chronicle,'' and the second article is entitled: ``Houston  City Leaders Honor Students in Pre-Apprenticeship Program at TRIO  Electric,'' both referencing Houston Community College.                        [From the Houston Chronicle]  Interested in a New Career? Consider an Apprenticeship Union-sponsored                       Programs Build Skills, Careers         Houston Community College is restoring an old high school       and converting it into college classrooms. And it's using       some of its own apprentices to do it.        San Jacinto Senior High was built in 1960, and the       community college is gutting it for new academic classrooms.       The project started about a year ago, and is scheduled to be       completed in October.        The eight apprentices--six plumbers and two pipe fitters--      are among the thousands of student workers in Houston who       spend their days doing construction and their nights hitting       the books. Houston's 11 union sponsored programs, including       the plumbers and the pipe fitters, last for five years; other       programs, such as ironworkers and glaziers, last three years.        But once the newly minted journeymen and women graduate,       they should have great skills and--if the economy       cooperates--a great career path.        Chuck Fell, president of CFI Mechanical, which is       installing the plumbing, heating  [[Page H418]]       and air conditioning in the new community college building,       gave the group of apprentices a pep talk last week at the job       site.        ``You are learning skills,'' Fell said to the plumbers and       pipe fitters who are spending their days assembling and       installing the massive piping systems and four hours a night,       two nights a week in school learning their craft.        Those skills can take you a long way, whether you opt to       stay working in the craft or move up to foreman,       superintendent or project manager, said Fell, who attributed       his own success and that of nearly all of his project       managers to their own apprenticeship training.                              In-depth learning         ``You could be an owner of a company,'' said Fell, who       became a plumber/pipe fitter apprentice in Orlando, Fla.,       after graduating from college with a degree in architecture.        He went to work for a mechanical contractor who suggested       that to really learn the business, Fell needed to become an       apprentice.        As part of that training, Fell spent two years at Walt       Disney World's Epcot Center installing the mechanical and       plumbing systems.        ``Set your sights high,'' Doug Posey, director of       apprenticeship programs for Houston Community College, told       the apprentices. ``The opportunities are just incredible to       excel and to do great things.''        Posey recalled how he put himself through college as a pipe       fitter apprentice. He started his apprenticeship immediately       after high school and eventually ended up with a degree in       mechanical engineering from the University of Houston.                             Pleased with program         While the concept of apprenticing yourself to a master       craftsman and learning a trade is centuries old, it's not       exactly a well-known career path today. But two apprentices       who are working on the CFI Mechanical project are glad they       discovered the old-fashioned way to learn a skill.        Jaime Moncivais, a third-year apprentice, said he would       never have heard about the program if it hadn't been for his       cousin and his uncle, who are foremen at the job site. He was       working for a small company for two years before he left to       join the program.        Moncivais is 23 and earns about $43,000 a year, plus health       insurance and retirement benefits, by working full time       during the day. After work two nights a week, he attends       class for four hours. That costs him $88 a semester.        ``I'm enjoying it,'' said Moncivais, who says he's going to       get his state plumbing license before he decides what's next.        So does his fellow apprentice Rudy Flores, who said he was       drawn by the money. He estimates he earns about $50,000 a       year.        Flores, a fifth-year apprentice who has already received       his state plumbing license, found out about the       apprenticeship training program while working for a plumber       in Houston who was also a former apprentice.        He said he appreciates the intensive training of the       program that sets him and the other apprentices apart.                              it sends a message         ``We like to see institutions put their money where their       mouth is,'' said Richard Shaw, secretary-treasurer of the       Harris County AFL-CIO. ``It sends a message that you ought to       be training our students.''        Shaw has been critical of school districts and other       community colleges for not hiring their own graduates when       the schools need construction work.        Funding for the apprenticeship programs comes in part from       the state of Texas. But the bulk of the money comes from       contractors and union members.        For example, members of the plumbers union as well as       plumbing contractors each contribute 55 cents per work hour       for the training program.        HCC is the fiscal administrator of the union programs as       well as the two nonunion programs that train building       engineers and electrical workers.                            Seeing if they like it         Calvin Speight, business manager of Plumbers Local Union       No. 68, said he has 60 apprentices starting in the fall and       another 30 the following semester.        In the meantime, they're working as ``provisionals'' to see       if they like the job. Apprentices must be 18 years of age and       either have graduated from high school or have a general-      equivalency degree.    Houston City Leaders Honor Students in Pre-Apprenticeship Program at                               TRIO Electric         City leaders in Houston recently honored students in TRIO       Electric's Pre-Apprenticeship Program, with Mayor Sylvester       Turner telling them ``we believe in people like you.''        In proclaiming it ``TRIO Pre-Apprenticeship Partnership       Day,'' Mayor Turner recognized the company and their       education partners, specifically the leadership of the Spring       Branch Independent School District.        Turner also encouraged the 40 students in the program to do       the best for themselves and their families. Mayor Turner told       students that he had once served as an electrician's       apprentice where he learned skills that he uses to this day       as the chief executive of the nation's fourth largest city.        ``Today is a great day in the City of Houston,'' Mayor       Turner said. ``Beau Pollock of TRIO Electric has the vision,       dedication and commitment to provide students with job       skills,'' he said. ``You are trailblazers,'' Turner told the       students, ``willing to work hard and learn work skills. In       Houston, we invest in human infrastructure because we believe       in people like you.''        Pollock, TRIO's President, thanked the students for       performing well on the job and proving the program could be a       success.        ``I had a good idea to train students, yet you had to       perform,'' Pollock said. ``You performed and proved this was       a good idea.''        TRIO started their apprenticeship program in 2013, ``to       help meet a critical demand for electricians with technical       and leadership skills. Nearly 200 workers have taken       advantage of TAP. In 2017, TRIO started working with Spring       Branch ISD and Houston Community College (HCC) to establish       the TRIO Pre-Apprenticeship Program (TPAP) for high school       students. By the fall 2018 semester, more than 150 high       school students will be taking advantage of TPAP through       Spring Branch ISD, Austin ISD and Grand Prairie ISD. TRIO       Electric plans to expand TPAP to other areas of Texas and the       U.S.''        Spring Branch superintendent Scott Muri told the students       that it was the vision that created the apprenticeship       program to solve a need for skilled workers. Houston       Community College Associate Vice Chancellor Michael Webster       said the skills learned in the apprenticeship program will       last a lifetime.        The teachers in the program are former electricians and       educators with electrical experience who have been       collectively recruited and screened. The program teaches       students how to be safe, productive and skilled electricians       as well as teaches other employable and soft skills.        In addition to HCC and Spring Branch ISD, TRIO Pre-      Apprenticeship Program partners include Spring Branch ISD SKY       partners--KIPP and YES Prep, as well as the Greater Houston       Partnership's UpSkill Houston, United Way, Texas Gulf Coast       Workforce Solutions, and the Department of Labor (DOL). The       TRIO TAP and TPAP programs are DOL-approved.    We need to be able to provide opportunities for  young people, giving them the direction of where they can be a success.   I show these pictures of diversity in my district of individuals who  are having the opportunity to be apprentices. Increasing participation  in programs under the national apprenticeship program through technical  assistance brings together industry sector leaders and experts,  including employers. This is a new day.   As my colleague said, Congressman Lynch: I started as an iron worker  and now I am in the United States Congress.   This opens the door of opportunity. Let's support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, on the Budget, and as a cosponsor, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 447, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021,  which invests more than $3.5 billion over 5 years in expanding  opportunities and access to Registered Apprenticeships, youth  apprenticeships, and pre-apprenticeships.   I thank Congressman Scott, the Chairman of the Education and Labor  Committee, for reintroducing this legislation which passed by a  substantial margin in the 116th Congress as H.R. 8294.   This important legislation has the potential to yield $10.6 billion  in net benefits to U.S. taxpayers in the form of increased workers  productivity and decreased spending on public-assistance programs and  unemployment insurance and which bring America's investments in  apprenticeship more in line with countries around the world.   Mr. Speaker, the Registered Apprenticeship (RAs) system is America's  most successful federally authorized workforce development program.   According to the Department of Labor, 94 percent of people who  complete RAs are employed upon completion, earning an average starting  wage of above $70,000 annually.   Yet, according to the most recent data, only 0.3 percent of the  overall workforce in America have completed an apprenticeship.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation could not be more timely because during  a time of record unemployment, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021  invests more than $3.5 billion over 5 years in expanding opportunities  and access to Registered Apprenticeships, youth apprenticeships, and  pre-apprenticeships.   The legislation also creates an additional 1 million new  apprenticeship opportunities on top of the current expected growth of  the apprenticeship system, an investment that not only will pay off for  workers and employers, but also benefit the taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is critical to expanding the nation's  workforce development system during our country's deepest economic  downturn since the Great Depression.   Specifically, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021 authorizes $400  million for fiscal year (FY) 2022, increasing by $100 million annually  to $800 million for FY 2026, to support the creation or expansion of  registered apprenticeships, youth apprenticeships and pre- apprenticeship programs, including in nontraditional  [[Page H419]]  apprenticeship occupations and for nontraditional populations.   This funding will also attract and encourage employer participation  and recruitment for individuals with barriers to employment, including  individuals impacted by the criminal justice system.   Additionally, to ensure that apprenticeship agreements and program  registration to ensure consistency in quality standards and worker  protections, H.R. 447 codifies and streamlines standards for registered  apprenticeships, youth apprenticeship and preapprenticeship programs.   Also codified are the existing regulations and practices to ensure  that all individuals have an equal opportunity to participate in  programs under the national apprenticeship system, and to increase  diversity in the occupations offered and the individuals participating  in programs, especially in high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand  industry sectors and occupations.   The legislation institutionalizes, and establishes by statute, the  Department of Labor's (DOL) Office of Apprenticeship, and vests it with  the following roles and responsibilities:   1. Increasing participation in programs under the national  apprenticeship system through technical assistance and program  recognition activities;   2. Bringing together industry sector leaders and experts, including  employers, industry associations, joint labor-management organizations,  labor organizations, education and training providers, credential  providers, and apprentices to establish national frameworks to expand  apprenticeships to new occupations and sectors; and   3. Improving data infrastructure to improve reporting and publicly  disseminating information about apprenticeship programs.   Another strong feature of this legislation is that it codifies the  roles and responsibilities of the State Apprenticeship Agencies (SAAs)  by:   1. Authorizing annual funding for State Apprenticeship Offices and  SAAs at $75 million for fiscal year (FY) 2022, increasing by $10  million annually to reach $115 million for FY 2026, with one-third of  funds equally distributed to all States and outlying areas, and two- thirds of funds distributed via formula to SAAs; and   2. Requiring SAAs to submit plans for registered apprenticeship  activities, which generally mirror existing state requirements under  the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and the Carl D. Perkins  Career and Technical Education Act.   My concluding reason for supporting this important legislation is  that it strengthens the connections between the Department of Education  and Department of Labor through an interagency agreement to support the  creation and expansion of youth apprenticeships, college consortiums,  and data sharing agreements.   I strongly support this legislation and urge all Members to join me  in voting for its passage.    Mr. Speaker, this is a daunting and overwhelming  responsibility that this country has, and that is to defeat COVID-19  and to win this war against the pandemic.   If you take a survey of different States, you will find that there is  an uneven approach to distribution. There are mega centers; there are  small centers; and there are no centers. I am reintroducing my COVID-19  Delivery Act of 2021 that sets out a protocol dealing with the  nationalization or federalization of distribution so that distribution  is organized to the extent that every part of America knows when their  vaccines will come.   We will put out a national app so that public health entities can  know when their doses will come. We will find a logistical scheme so  that FEMA can manage the distribution across the Nation. We will  purposely design it so that hard-to-reach neighborhoods, communities of  minorities, will be found and so that we begin to vaccinate people  massively across the Nation.   We have to save lives. 594,000 may die by May. Please cosponsor the  2021 COVID-19 Delivery Act. It is going to make a difference.                            ____________________
