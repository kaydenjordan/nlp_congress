 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week, the National Guard is  departing what has been a months-long presence here at the Capitol.  Aspects of the Guards' presence here were not fleshed out as clearly or  coherently as either Congress or the servicemembers deserved, and  Members of Congress will continue to discuss and debate whether it is  appropriate for uniformed military personnel to play an ongoing role in  policing the U.S. Capitol going forward.   But where Senators are absolutely, 100 percent united is in our great  admiration and appreciation of the individual men and women who  volunteered to serve in the National Guard, who have put on the  uniform, and whose orders brought them here to the Capitol Complex.   It was my particular honor to get to meet and talk with several  groups of the remarkable men and women of the Kentucky National Guard  during this period.   Thank you, all, from all 50 States, for your patriotism and for your  service.                            ____________________     On a completely different matter, when President  Biden's nominees have been qualified and mainstream, they received  bipartisan cooperation. But the President's choice to head a key  Division at the Department of Justice as an Assistant Attorney General  failed to even advance out of the committee.   The Democratic leader had to reach into the Judiciary Committee and  rescue the nomination of Kristen Clarke. Our colleagues on the  committee did not give her a favorable recommendation. That is because  of a long history of statements that placed the nominee on, frankly,  the far-left fringe of the political spectrum.   If our Democratic colleagues have their way, a couple of days from  now, the American people will have an Assistant Attorney General who  argued publicly just last year that ``we must invest less in police.''  She used that exact phrase three times in one essay.   Violent crimes shot up dramatically in 2020. One survey of 30-plus  major American cities found that the murder rate jumped 30 percent last  year alone. Other estimates have found even larger increases. Experts  say 2020 saw the largest 1-year rise in homicides that America has ever  seen as far back as we have recorded these kinds of statistics.   Early data from this year suggests that 2021 may even be worse, but,  apparently, the President's response to this violent crimewave is to  have a proponent of defunding the police help run the Department of  Justice.  [[Page S3318]]    Adequate policing is not an enemy of civil rights. Among other  things, a recent study by multiple university professors confirmed that  more cops lead to fewer murders:         Larger police forces save lives, and the lives saved are       disproportionately Black lives.    Police funding isn't the only important issue where the nominee's  judgment has missed the mark.   Three years ago, when the then-Attorney General was standing up a  task force on religious liberty, Ms. Clarke said this was designed ``to  make it easier for people to use religion to mask their discriminatory  goals''--an incredibly out-of-touch, far-left statement.   Finally, we are currently watching an alarming spike in anti-Semitic  attacks and violence across our country. I introduced new legislation  on Friday, with Senator Cotton, to confront anti-Semitism head-on, but  as a Harvard undergraduate, Ms. Clarke invited, welcomed, introduced,  and then defended a famously anti-Semitic guest speaker who had  authored a book literally entitled--now listen to this--``The Jewish  Onslaught.''   The nominee has stated recently that she regrets that decision.  Goodness, I would certainly hope so.   Yet she also claims that her op-ed from just last year, which  asserted three times--three times--that we must invest less in police,  was not actually suggesting that we invest less in police.   This is not the right nominee for a crucial post at a crucial time so  I would urge colleagues to vote no this week.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on another matter, last week, a  bipartisan majority of Senators voted to proceed to floor debate about  our Nation's long-term competition with China.   There is no disagreement that the People's Republic's strategic  capabilities and its growing influence beyond the Indo-Pacific pose a  singular challenge to American strength and security. There is robust  debate about the right ways to address this challenge.   The legislation before us arrived on the floor incomplete, and it  spans a number of huge issues that occupy multiple committees'  jurisdictions. It is a prime example of a bill that needs a thorough,  bipartisan amendment process here in the Senate. So far, we have had a  few votes on important amendments. There are a lot more that need  consideration, and we should not close debate on this bill until those  amendments are addressed.   Unfortunately, during one important vote last week, our Democratic  colleagues sent a telling signal. They voted down Ranking Member Inhofe  and Vice Chairman Shelby's amendment to make sure that the real  backbone of our competition with China--the resources we allocate to  our Armed Forces and national defense--was not neglected.   Make no mistake, supply chains, espionage, intellectual property-- those are all important topics, but all the policy tweaks in the world  would not amount to much help if we lose our military edge with respect  to China. Soft power isn't much good without the hard power to back it  up.   The Chinese Communist Party appears to understand this quite clearly.  According to one watchdog, it has increased military investment by 76  percent over the last decade. China has increased its military spending  by 76 percent over the last decade. The same data show that our own  U.S. defense spending fell 10 percent over that period, thanks to the  approach of the last Democratic administration, and now President Biden  has signaled that he wants to cut defense spending after inflation-- exactly the wrong approach.   No serious strategy for our competition with massive foreign powers  could leave the U.S. Armed Forces, their tools, and their resources out  of the conversation in a meaningful way. I hope and expect we will have  a number of further votes on important amendments before there would be  any attempt to shut off debate on this wide-ranging measure.                            ____________________
