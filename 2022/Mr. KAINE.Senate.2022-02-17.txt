 Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to Senator  Cruz's amendment, No. 4927.   Everyone in this body who attended school in the United States had to  get vaccines to attend school--measles, mumps, rubella, polio,  chickenpox. Everyone in this body who sent a child to school in the  United States had to make sure that they got their children vaccinated.   Is that because of a big Federal mandate? No.   All 50 States--Utah, Texas, New York, Maine, Washington, Rhode  Island, Wisconsin, Virginia--embraced their own vaccine mandates--all  50. There are some variations. Iowa doesn't mandate a mumps vaccine,  and Virginia mandates a human papillomavirus vaccine, but we leave it  up to local school boards and State superintendents of instruction to  decide if a vaccine is warranted.   This is unprecedented in this body, an effort by the Federal  Government to force local school boards and State superintendents of  instruction to not have a vaccine mandate at the cost of taking money  away from the students and the teachers and the parents.   In Virginia, parents very strongly support vaccination of children.  Why would we not listen to parents? Why would we not listen to the  local school boards that are hearing from parents about this?   I urge my colleagues to reject a massive Federal overreach that would  disempower school boards and States and take funding away from their  children's education.   Please vote no on the Cruz amendment.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining  time be yielded back before the Lee and Cruz amendment votes and that  the Senate now vote in relation to the Lee amendment.
