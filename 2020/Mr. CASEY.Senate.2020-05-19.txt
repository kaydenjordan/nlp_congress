 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the  distinguished life and career of Aliquippa Chief of Police Robert  William Sealock, who passed away on April 11, 2020.   Chief Sealock dedicated his life in service to his community, his  Commonwealth, and his country. A veteran of the U.S. Navy, he later  served as a police officer in the Borough of Bridgewater and Crescent  and Center Townships, located in Allegheny and Beaver counties in  western Pennsylvania. At the time of his passing, he was the chief of  police for the city of Aliquippa. Beginning as a patrolman and working  his way up through the ranks of the Aliquippa Police Force over a  period of 23 years, he assumed the role of chief of police in 2018.  Chief Sealock was a graduate of Moon Area High School and became a  member of the Fraternal Order of Police James Naim Memorial Lodge No.  26 as well as a member of the Masonic Lodge No. 672.   Chief Sealock's leadership has been widely praised by both the public  and his peers in the law enforcement community. At a time when his  community faced a surge in crime and an understaffed police force,  Chief Sealock stepped up to meet the challenge. In just a few short  years, Chief Sealock enhanced the reputation of the police department  by working tirelessly to rebuild trust and bridge the gap between local  law enforcement and the community it served. He also instituted several  programs across multiple city offices that were designed to reach  Aliquippa's youth and increase participation in group activities.   Chief Sealock led by example. He recognized and understood how  important it was to police officers to have the support of their chief  and his hands-on approach inspired confidence. As a result, his fellow  officers had tremendous respect for his leadership and endearingly  referred to him as a ``cop's cop.''   Tragically, Chief Sealock suffered a medical emergency while on duty  which led to his passing. His dedication to the Aliquippa Police  Department, his beloved community, his family, and country were guided  by a sincere commitment to public service and improving the lives of  people he encountered. He will be remembered for his compassion, loving  spirit, and warm personality, and his legacy will be felt for many  years to come.   I extend my thoughts and prayers to his devoted wife, Donna; his  daughter and son-in-law Taylor Sealock-Smith and husband Taner; two  stepchildren Jonathan Peterson and Stephanie Snyder, Leslie Patterson  and husband Derek Trohaugh; his parents Patricia and James Blaha; his  sister Colleen Sealock; his father and mother-in-law William and  Dorothy Fontana; and all of Chief Sealock's family and friends as they  mourn his loss.                            ____________________
