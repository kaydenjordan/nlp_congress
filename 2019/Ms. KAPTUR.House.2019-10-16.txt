 Mr. Speaker, the people of Russia have never known real  freedom.   During the 20th century, over the course of 70 years, Joseph Stalin,  the Soviet Union's henchman and regime leader, and that of his  successors were responsible for the brutal murder of millions upon  millions of innocent people inside Ukraine, Russia, Poland, and many  other Central and Eastern European countries that became familiarly  known as the Captive Nations.   During World War II, American soldiers never really made it east of  Germany when they liberated camps in Germany, and so much of the truth  about what happened behind what was called the Iron Curtain, the edge  of Soviet rule, was largely unknown to the West.   Russia's wretched rule included:   Forced famine, starving millions of her own people to gain the  acquiescence of others;   Gulags, where individuals were sent to work in work camps and died.  They died of starvation. They died of overwork. They died of disease;   Genocide, the wiping out of ethnic groups that didn't fit the perfect  image of the ruler of Russia;   Ethnic cleansing and a horrific world war launched in collaboration  with Nazi Germany, where Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union divided up  Europe as they saw fit.   Not all Europeans have experienced the same history. I am interested  to read some press reports now about Eurocentric people. Well, let me  tell you, the history of Nazi Germany and the history of occupied  Ukraine or occupied Poland are completely different.   There was little value for human life by the Soviet regime and,  certainly, no value for liberty.   Americans remember, some do, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991  after the free world had labored since 1946 to allow that moment to  happen and the hope that it brought to millions of subjugated people  beyond that  [[Page H8185]]  Iron Curtain who dreamed of a better way of life--not only across  Europe, but, in fact, the entire world.   The fall of the Berlin Wall was symbolic, and its anniversary is  celebrated this year, 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall that  ushered in a new order, a world that said liberty could still prevail  over tyranny, even in the face of impossible odds in some of the most  forgotten places in the world.                                time  1700    Images of East and West Germans ascending the old Berlin Wall that  divided freedom from tyranny stood as that symbol. And those  individuals who had lived in West Germany and East Germany who climbed  that wall and met for the first time in decades serves as one of the  most powerful symbols of freedom in human history.   As families were reunited, new democratic institutions rose from the  ashes, where tyranny once dominated.   The United States became a beacon of light to those people in an  ever-growing free world following the rebuilding of Europe in the post- World War II climate and then, over four decades later, the Soviet  Union's demise.   The World War II Memorial that stands here in Washington, D.C., in  fact, is testimony to the 20th century's greatest achievement, the  victory of liberty over tyranny.   Yet, in the ashes of the Soviet regime, the seeds of tyranny survived  in the memories of its most ardent lieutenants and supporters. And one  of them, the current Russian President, Vladimir Putin, who for years  served as a Soviet spy in the KGB, is orchestrating Russia's vengeful  march to restore its former empire.   Today, Ukraine represents the scrimmage line in the fight for liberty  on the European continent. And why does it matter to America? Because  those allies in Europe have democratic republics like ours. They are  our closest political allies on the face of the Earth.   We do not live alone on this Earth. America does not live alone on  this Earth, but, rather, we have a security system that was established  following World War II that has held together the leaders of the free  world.   Vladimir Putin's greatest fear is an economically successful and  democratic Ukraine at Russia's borders. A free Ukraine would undermine  Putin's fragile, corrupt rule based on stealing--stealing land,  stealing money from the people of Ukraine, and lining his pockets and  those of his cronies.   A free Ukraine sends a message, too, to the Russian people, a people  who have never known liberty in their own right, that freedom is also  attainable for them.   For this reason, Putin would go to any length, and is-- assassinations, poisonings, war, torture--to steal from the Ukrainian  people their right to choose their own destiny--40 million people--40  million people at the stepstone to all of Europe, the largest landmass  nation in all of Europe. They have a right to choose their own destiny.   In the aftermath of World War II, the United States, alongside our  allied partners in the then newly formed North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, more familiarly called NATO, created precious  institutions to build solidarity and security among the war's  transatlantic allied victors--institutions that had never existed  before.   America invested trillions of dollars in programs, beginning with the  Marshall Plan, to build vigilant networks to stymie and, ultimately,  reverse the spread of state-imposed communism.   The American people, in a very war-worn country after World War II,  rebuilt Europe through the Marshall Plan. Wow.   Western-funded programs worked to rebuild Europe, and, though the  Nazis were defeated, millions still found themselves trapped under  dictatorial rule behind that Iron Curtain east of the Berlin Wall.   Ukraine was one of those nations forced to exist under Soviet  occupation until Ukrainian citizens declared their own independence  after the fall of the Berlin Wall in a democratic, nationwide  referendum in 1991, the only such referendum by any former Soviet  republic.   An astounding 84 percent of their voting-age population participated  in that referendum, and more than 90 percent of them voted to separate  from the Soviet Union and chart their own national course.   That was a new page that turned in world history. Even in the eastern  portions of Ukraine, in Crimea, a majority voted to be part of  independent Ukraine. In one voice, the Ukrainian people decisively  voted for and favored liberty over tyranny. What a dramatic moment in  world history as liberty attempted to move eastward.   But, even then, the struggle for liberty in Ukraine was far from  over. It was only beginning. And we can see it in real time even until  today.   In 2014, the Ukrainian people rose up in the Ukrainian revolution of  dignity against leaders in Ukraine that had become utterly corrupt, the  pro-Russian leader then, President Viktor Yanukovych, after he  rejected--why did they rise up? Because he rejected an association  agreement with the European Union.   And at whose behest did he do that? Vladimir Putin's.   Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian protesters immediately moved to  occupy the central plaza of their capital city, Kiev, Ukraine. Clashes  between those protesters and the riot police became violent and  resulted in the deaths of nearly 130 civilians. Most of them died from  government-ordered sniper fire.   As tensions rose, Yanukovych fled--guess where?--to Russia to take  cover. And, on that same day, by a vote of 328-0, their congress, their  parliament, voted that Yanukovych be removed from office.   The fight for liberty is being lived in real time. The world can see  it--not just the Ukrainian people; the American people, the leader of  the free world, for heavens' sake.   In that very same year, Vladimir Putin mobilized Russia's vast  military machine, one of the largest on Earth, to illegally and without  provocation invade Ukraine at its Crimean edge and launch a not-so- covert war on Ukraine's eastern flank, a clear effort to rewind history  and reimpose his dreamed neo-Soviet empire.   Over 5 years later, Ukraine remains in an heroic struggle to preserve  its hard-fought freedom and sovereignty. Its people have bravely faced  down artillery barrages and live sniper and machine gun fire carried  out by pro-Russian forces coming across the border, including Putin's  little green men.   While the country, Ukraine, is not yet a member of the European Union  or NATO, which it so wishes to be, its men and women, including  civilians, have bravely fought and died defending Europe and their own  fragile democracy.    Put yourselves in their position. What would you do if that happened  in the United States of America?   In the 5 years since the war started, 14,000 Ukrainians have been  killed, 30,000 have been wounded, and nearly 2 million internally  displaced in the conflict with Russia.   It is a war that groans on with little notice but enormous  consequences for liberty in this modern era.   As Ukraine's defense forces crumbled due to years of corruption and  mismanagement, the Ukrainian people took up the cause to defend their  own nation. They have been seriously underequipped. And their heroism  and, I might add, sheroism shines. Courageous women from the invisible  battalion left their college studies and took taxis to the frontlines  to thwart Moscow's war.   It was like a David and Goliath struggle. Indeed, it has been the  strength of the Ukrainian people that has fought Russia to a standstill  for a moment.   Just as we and our allies fought Soviet aggression in the 20th  century, the Ukrainian people are in the trenches fighting Russian  aggression in the 21st.   They have more than earned the respect and continuing support of the  United States and the free world.   When the Soviet Union collapsed, one-third of the Soviet nuclear  arsenal remained in Ukraine. There are two countries in the world that  have nuclear weapons aimed: Russia, at us; and the United States,  prepared to take them down if they would ever dare send them in this  direction.   But one-third of what the Soviet Union held in terms of nuclear  strength remained in Ukraine, de facto providing Ukraine the world's  third largest nuclear weapons arsenal.  [[Page H8186]]    But, in 1994, by signing the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine agreed to  give up the nuclear weapons in its territory in return for security  assistance by the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Think  about that.   A promise was made. Ukraine's independence, national sovereignty, and  borders would be respected. By annexing Crimea and waging a devastating  war on the eastern side of Ukraine called the Donbas, Russia has  severely violated the terms of this foundational security agreement.   Lest we forget, Russia retained its nuclear arsenal, and their  weapons remain aimed at us, the United States of America, and our NATO  allies in Europe.   The list of violations goes on. The basket one provisions of the  Helsinki Accords, which the Soviet Union signed in 1975, along with the  United States, Canada, and more than 30 European countries, as well as  bilateral agreements that the Russian Federation signed with Ukraine in  1997, have effectively been thrown to the wayside.   In addition, Russia's forcible annexation of Crimea and sponsorship  of a hot war in Ukraine's east since 2014 violates numerous United  Nations agreements that Russia, the Ukraine, the United States, and  other countries have signed going back to the organization's founding  in 1945.   While it would be convenient to only blame Russia for the  destabilization of this region, I must say, President Trump's recent  illegal block of more than $391 million in military aid to Ukraine was  not only a blow to Ukrainian security and to its new president, but to  our own.   Russia on the march does not serve the security interests of the  United States. The United States and NATO have a vital interest in  stopping the Kremlin's aggression in Ukraine. That Trump did so, in  denying military assistance, in delaying military assistance to  Ukraine, in pursuit of a personal political agenda for 2020, makes it  not only a betrayal of U.S. security interests but, also, a legal  issue.   It looks like just the sort of perversion of the justice system that  Ukraine has suffered for decades.   To date, there are no records detailing President Trump's or his  administration's official secret meetings and phone calls with Russian  President Putin and his top lieutenants. There is no documentation to  date on why President Trump lifted sanctions on key Putin oligarchs and  supporters.   If records exist, they, I hope, have not been unlawfully squirreled  away somewhere by senior White House staff, similar to actions alleged  in the September 2019 whistleblower complaint.   It is clear that Putin has been at war with Ukraine to restore its  domination in that neighborhood. The United States should do nothing to  make it easier. Tragically, it appears President Trump is accommodating  and, perhaps, abetting him.   It is no wonder that our current the President was Putin's preferred  candidate in 2016 and remains so for 2020.   Now, Paul Manafort, President Trump's 2016 campaign manager, sits in  Federal prison right now for tax evasion, but his crimes are much  worse.                                time  1715    He took millions of dollars, millions of dollars to lobby for the  pro-Russian, anti-American, Ukrainian President, Viktor Yanukovych, who  he mentioned earlier, whose own people drove him out the country.   Yanukovych personally took his orders from Putin, who personally  directed Russia's interference in U.S. elections and ordered the war in  Ukraine.   Take Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer. He has been  carrying out a shadow foreign policy campaign, at the Trump  administration's behest, to undermine their political rivals and boost  the President's reelection.   Recently, it was confirmed that Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy  Giuliani, turned to Manafort, who is sitting in jail, for advice in his  efforts to fabricate falsehoods on Vice President Joe Biden. The  President and Giuliani even enlisted the support of U.S. Government  officials in this scheme, co-opting U.S. taxpayer dollars for personal  political gain.   When the United States Ambassador to Ukraine refused to aid and abet  their plot, President Trump purged the highly respected U.S.  Ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who dutifully served our country with  distinction throughout her adult life. During her service, Ukraine  successfully carried out two democratic elections during a time of war  and significant duress and made enormous progress on its anticorruption  efforts.   Ambassador Yovanovitch's steady and principled vision, steeped in a  long tradition of U.S. diplomatic excellence, was exactly what was  needed to shepherd the Ukrainian people along the jagged path toward  democratic reform.   Ambassador Yovanovitch represented the United States at the highest  levels of her career in other countries facing similar challenges-- Armenia, for one, and Kyrgyzstan--under Republican and Democratic  administrations. She served Presidents in both parties. It is, indeed,  rare for a member of the Foreign Service to serve as an ambassador, let  alone three times in very dangerous places. This is a true testament to  her diplomatic seasoning, from which I believe our President could  learn something.   Tragically, the purging of Ambassador Yovanovitch is but the surface  of the contempt that this White House and some of my Republican  Congressional colleagues have treated public servants who place their  lives at risk serving the American people's love of liberty, day in and  day out.   President Trump, let the record show, who dodged service in the U.S.  military, seems to have no understanding of the value of our  transatlantic alliances and at what cost they have been won and built.  They are the single most important guarantor of our security and  freedom. America needs friendly allies who share our democratic values  and believe in the rule of law.   Recently, we have learned that while the Trump-appointed U.S.  Ambassador to the European Union should have been focused on repairing  relations with Europe, as our own President has embarrassed European  Presidents and leaders publicly, the Ambassador to the European Union  found himself in Ukraine, arranging meetings to conduct opposition  research on President Trump's political opponents.   It cannot be overstated just how much the actions of our President  and Rudy Giuliani have undermined U.S. strategic interests and the  progress Ukraine has made to strengthen its democracy and deter Russian  aggression.   Imagine how the young new President of Ukraine felt when the  President of the United States said to him that the military aid that  was due to have been dispensed in the middle of this summer from the  United States would actually be held until that President would do our  President a favor related to his own reelection. Wow.   For the Trump-led minions, our government does not serve the people.  Rather, unfortunately, it is serving him.   While we continue to seek cooperation with the Trump administration  to help our own people here at home in so many ways--the cost of  prescription drugs, trying to get an infrastructure bill passed in the  House and the Senate, trying to deal with corruption in our own  political system--Congress must investigate these deeply troubling  episodes abroad. The Constitution demands that we conduct our affairs  in a constitutionally mandated role of oversight and the impeachment  inquiry, which is ongoing. We must ascertain to what extent the  President and his advisers abused their power and held up critical  military aid to Ukraine for their own political gain.   Thus far, the President's defense has been complete resistance, not  providing the materials necessary for a full congressional  investigation in what seems to be an ongoing campaign to intimidate  State Department officials from testifying before Congress, which  really means before the American people.   The American people have a right to know the truth. This is an open  society. We don't need stonewalling from this administration.   We should ask the President what he has to hide. The American people  know the difference between truth and fiction.   Mr. Speaker, what a historic defeat for liberty it would be if the  West were to squander the sacrifices of the United  [[Page H8187]]  States, Ukraine, and our allies by allowing Putin to succeed in his  sinister mission.   Despite President Trump's negligence, the United States Congress  remains laser-focused on the threat from Russia. It is serious, and it  is real.   While Ukraine fights for its very existence, the United States  Congress and freedom-lovers everywhere must continue to support Ukraine  through military aid, programs to fight corruption, and the development  of civil society, which the American people do so well.   Congress must get to the bottom of President Trump's effort to  withhold vital defense aid to Ukraine. She is facing a mortal enemy.  This is liberty at stake in our lifetimes. Will we meet the challenge?   The abuses of power outlined in the whistleblower complaint  underscore the danger that President Trump's decisions pose to American  national security and democracy itself. The American people must learn  to what extent the President solicited interference from a foreign  country in the upcoming 2020 U.S. Presidential election.    From our own FBI, we have learned how many times Russia interfered in  the last election and how many times then-candidate Trump contacted  Russia during the campaign.   I was thinking about that one night. If I were running for President  of the United States, would I be in touch with Russia nearly 200 times?  Think about that. How unusual is that?   The American Presidency cannot be a tool for Russia to gain its  insidiously destructive power. Above all, the American people deserve  liberty first, last, and always in a political system free of malign  foreign influence.   Long live a free America, and may the people of Ukraine ultimately  gain the freedom they so justly deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
