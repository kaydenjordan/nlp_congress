 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my  colleague's resolution, H. Con. Res. 119, which expresses the sense of  Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States.   A carbon tax is a tax on the American consumer and our economy. A  carbon tax would significantly--I want to repeat that--significantly  drive up the cost of the fuels that drive our way of life, and result  in millions and millions of jobs lost.   This burden would be unfairly shouldered by the lower and middle  class incomes. The nonpartisan--I want to say that--the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office, CBO, in 2013 stated: ``A carbon tax would  increase the price of fossil fuels in direct proportion to their carbon  content. Higher fuel prices, in turn, would raise production costs and  ultimately drive up prices for goods and services throughout the  economy.''   A study from the National Association of Manufacturers found that a  carbon tax could drive up gasoline costs between $6 and $14 per gallon,  and lead to as many as 21 million jobs lost, a continually shrinking  economy, and lowering our Federal revenue, all without doing anything  to improve global greenhouse gas emissions.                                time  0945    Just yesterday, the House passed my amendment to prohibit funds from  implementing the Obama administration's social costs of carbon rule.   The facts are clear. A carbon tax is not the way to protect our  environment and economy. The social costs of a carbon tax far outweigh  the potential benefits.
