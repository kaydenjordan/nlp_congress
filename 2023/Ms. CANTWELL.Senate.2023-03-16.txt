 Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  talk about a court decision that is likely to come down anytime now  that could be an attack on abortion rights and access to healthcare  across the country. This is an important issue affecting the removal of  access to mifepristone, a drug that can lead to a termination of a  pregnancy but in the comfort of someone's home. The latest is an  example of a radical court in Texas trying to further restrict access  to safe and legal medication for abortion, which has been safely used  by millions of women over the past 22 years. Since Roe v. Wade was  overturned last summer, abortion patients and providers across the  country have faced a growing challenge, misinformation, threats, and  inability to get reproductive care--even in States like mine where  abortion is still legal.   Last week, I and Senator Murray met with abortion providers in  Seattle who told me about the growing fear and confusion among patients  since Roe has been overturned. The medical director at a clinic told  me, in the past 9 months, it has become routine for patients to ask  whether it is OK to even talk about abortions in the exam room.  Patients have been more hesitant to say where they live in fear of  legal retaliation. Mind you, this is in a State where the people in the  State voted to have abortion rights protected in a vote in 1991. This  assault on women's reproductive health is already having an impact on  women, even keeping them from talking about their options with their  healthcare providers.    Anti-abortion extremists are now turning their attention to Medicaid  abortion. Nearly a quarter of a century ago, the FDA approved  mifepristone, a drug that is safer, in some people's minds, it says,  than Tylenol. Today, more than half of all abortions and procedures in  the United States, including 55 percent of those in the State of  Washington, are performed through this medication.   This drug is not only safe and legal to use, but it also makes  abortion more accessible, but we know that this access could be  threatened through areas like telehealth, where a patient doesn't have  to travel long distances to see a provider. The access is important for  Planned Parenthood clinics. The medical director of Planned Parenthood  told me a story of a patient who traveled thousands of miles from her  home State to Washington to get abortion care. She couldn't afford a  hotel room, so she stayed with a friend, and the patient had to take  off time from work to make this trip. After all this effort, the woman  had a miscarriage while waiting in the waiting room.   People shouldn't have to travel all the way across the country just  for the kind of healthcare they deserve. This is why the court case on  Medicaid abortion is so dangerous. Should one judge in Texas decide to  overturn the FDA's approval of this safe drug from more than two  decades ago, it would effectively ban the drug on a nationwide basis.   The kinds of things that are already happening to intimidate or not  provide this in the pharmacies in our State are alarming. This ruling  would mean that every State, including those like mine that have  already expressed their opinion with the codification of Roe v. Wade,  could have some of its healthcare denied. The ruling would mean that in  Washington State, where abortion has expressly been under our State law  for more than 30 years, a person who needs or elects to terminate their  pregnancy could no longer safely do it at their home if they can't get  access to this drug.   Indeed, we will continue to fight for these issues. We want women in  America to have access.   This judge's decision in Texas could cost people in our State. It  could cost them time to travel, cost them time of healthcare, and  certainly we are seeing an uptick in the number of people coming to  Washington to get access to care.   We are also seeing people upping the ante in places like Spokane,  where they are trying to publicly humiliate people coming to clinics by  protesting. This is not a way to run healthcare. And we can't have a  judge in Texas deciding what FDA and scientists nearly a quarter of a  century ago said was a safe procedure.   We know that this is depriving women even in States where their  rights are guaranteed. It is impacting their access to safe and legal  abortions. There is a reason why we have an FDA and the science, and we  need to continue to listen to them.   Let's be clear. We are not going to let a decision like this go  unchallenged. People will not stop getting pregnant. And if this one  judge decides to substitute his opinion for the FDA's, women will  continue to look for this drug, and they will look for safe options.   I hope we can continue to educate people on how this is affecting  people in States that have already voted by law to protect a woman's  right to choose. This is eroding our rights, it is impacting our  providers, and it is basically telling young women that we are not sure  if you are going to be able to get access to this drug.   I hope the courts will not go down this errant path, and I hope that  we here will get our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to vote  with us to clarify and protect a woman's right to choose at the Federal  level.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
