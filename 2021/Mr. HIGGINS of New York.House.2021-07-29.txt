 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 4502, a funding package that prioritizes workers, families, and  communities.   This bill delivers in a major way for Buffalo and western New York.  It will fight cancer in underserved neighborhoods by helping Roswell  Park Comprehensive Cancer Center establish a lung cancer screening  registry.   It preserves local history at the Buffalo Naval Park and the  Albright-Knox  [[Page H4259]]  Art Gallery. It trains our future workforce by investing in training  programs at the West Side Bazaar, the Buffalo Sewer Authority, and  Buffalo State's Small Business Development Center.   It will better connect our community to nature, something the  pandemic has shown to be a critical life-quality asset, at the  Shoreline Trail and The Riverline projects.   Budgetary documents are a statement of our values. This package says  our children, veterans, families, and communities are our most  important investments.                            ____________________
