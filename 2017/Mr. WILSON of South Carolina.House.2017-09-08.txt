 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, an extraordinary highlight  of August was visiting Guatemala to observe the success for the Food  for the Hungry organization.   With Ambassador Tony Hall, a former Ohio Member of Congress, who is  appreciated as a world champion in reducing poverty, and the Food for  the Hungry director, Lucas Koach, I visited nutrition programs in very  remote villages of this beautiful country.   The people have suffered deficiencies due to malnutrition, including  stunted height and brain development. The communities we visited were  so isolated that travel was accomplished by helicopter. The Food for  the Hungry ambassadors worked tirelessly to provide healthcare  providers with counseling and nutritional supplements.   We were welcomed by Guatemala's Ambassador to the U.S., Manuel  Espina, and Mario Bucaro, president of Guatemala Prospera. In Guatemala  City, we met with the dynamic, young President Jimmy Morales and his  talented Cabinet, who expressed their appreciation for Food for the  Hungry giving Guatemalans the opportunity to have fulfilling and  meaningful lives.   We were grateful to attend a dinner with Guatemalan Caucus Chair Ken  Buck and World Food Programme Director David Beasley, former Governor  of South Carolina, who addressed the next morning's congressional  prayer breakfast in Guatemala City.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our prayers for all affected by Hurricane Irma.                            ____________________
