 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2021.   I started my career leading the Culinary Academy of Las Vegas, the  largest job training program in the State. This experience instilled in  me the importance of workforce programs that create pathways for  hardworking people to get good-paying jobs.   Passing this legislation is a vital step to begin our economic  recovery by training Nevadans for new careers in high-demand fields,  including at the Westside Education and Training Center in historic  west Las Vegas, which my office was just able to secure nearly $7  million to help build.   By providing nearly 1 million additional apprenticeship opportunities  over 5 years, and adding $10.6 billion in net benefits to our economy,  the National Apprenticeship Act will help working families and small  businesses restore the financial security that was lost during the  pandemic.   As a co-chair and founder of the Labor Caucus, I am proud to support  this legislation, which is endorsed by some of our Nation's largest  labor unions, including the AFL-CIO, UNITE HERE, the Laborers, and the  Teamsters.   I am glad that my amendment to support the recruitment and retention  of nontraditional apprenticeship populations, including women and  people of color, is included in this bill. My constituents and all of  our constituents deserve the opportunities this bill affords.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2021.                            ____________________
