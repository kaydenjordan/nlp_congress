 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment would prohibit funds from  enforcing the Obama administration's EPA methane rule.   This rule is currently facing litigation and uncertainty, and  Congress must act to block this job-killing regulation estimated to  cost the U.S. economy $530 million annually.   Methane emissions from oil and natural gas have significantly  declined in recent decades without multiple, overlapping Federal  regulations, and this is no exception.   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar), my colleague.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Madam Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), my chairman.    Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would prohibit the  implementation of the Obama administration's social cost of carbon,  SCC, rule.   Congress and the American people have repeatedly rejected cap-and- trade proposals. The Obama administration continuously used social cost  of carbon models, which can easily be manipulated, in order to attempt  to justify new job-killing regulations.   The House has made a clear, strong record of opposition to the social  cost of carbon, voting at least 11 times to block, defund, or oppose  the proposal.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Calvert), my chairman.    Madam Chair, I would urge a ``yes'' vote on this  amendment.
