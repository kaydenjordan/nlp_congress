 Mr. President, as we wrap up our work in the National  Defense Authorization Act, we need to address an issue, an issue that  has been the focus of a lot of controversy. It has been the focus of a  lot of heated words. Now, I understand heated words happen around here.  It occurs; people feel passionate about things. But when heated words  become untrue words, defamatory words, fighting words, sometimes the  record needs to be corrected. This is one of those times.   Moments ago, the President of the United States--who, to put it  mildly, has not had a good week--made some comments that I regard as  not only insensitive, inflammatory, but also downright misleading and  unfair. He has made them about and directed them toward a Member of  this body, our friend and colleague, the Senator from Alabama, Senator  Tuberville.   These attacks against Senator Tuberville have been relentless.  Relentless all because he has chosen to take a stand, a stand against  what he properly, legitimately, understandably perceives as a violation  of the spirit--if not also the letter--of the law. The law in question  is codified in 10 U.S.C. section 1093.   And 10 U.S.C. 1093, in a nutshell, says that the U.S. Department of  Defense may not spend Department of Defense funds to perform an  abortion, and it may not use a Department of Defense property,  facility, to perform an abortion.  [[Page S3734]]    This has been in place for a long time. It has been in place for  decades. This, you see, represents something of an island oasis in the  debate of abortion, this idea about government funding. It is one of  the last bastions of our overwhelming bipartisan agreement when it  comes to abortion in America, which is to say, regardless of how people  feel about abortion in general--whether they support it, whether they  are against it, in what circumstances they might recognize it as  something that can appropriately be legal or not--what unites them and  unites them overwhelmingly along bipartisan lines is this: That, in  part, because of the widespread disagreement among the American people  about abortion, Federal funds shouldn't be performing abortions. They  shouldn't be used to promote or conduct or perform abortions.   It is a very simple matter. This can and does unite Americans across  party lines--and overwhelmingly so. And so it was with good reason in  another National Defense Authorization Act--we just finished up the  National Defense Authorization Act for 2024, at least the initial  Senate version of it. But it was in another National Defense  Authorization Act a few decades ago that, I understand, 10 U.S.C. 1093  came to be law, because the American people agreed then, as they agree  now, that regardless of how people feel about abortion, we ought not to  be using Federal funds, particularly in the military but also  otherwise, to perform abortions.   Well, late last year, the U.S. Department of Defense started  considering a measure to get around 10 U.S.C. 1093 for a method that  was at once really creative and too cute by half.   When I say ``too cute by half'' not as a compliment, I, indeed, mean  it as a criticism, because it cleverly attempts to step around the  stated purpose, intent, spirit of 10 U.S.C. 1093. And one could not  argue that you avoid the technical grip of its talents if you do what  the Department of Defense started considering doing last year.   They started thinking about saying, OK, well, let's say that we will  give 3 weeks of paid leave time and reimburse travel expenses to any  military woman who wants to get an abortion and needs to travel  interstate to do it. We will pay for their interstate travel, for their  lodgings, their meals, and 3 weeks of paid leave.   It is understandable why this would cause some consternation, because  the only purpose of this could be to flout, to circumvent the stated  purpose and effect of 10 U.S.C. section 1093. Technically speaking, one  could argue, yeah, this is not performing abortions, so you can get  away with it. Sometimes in the military, it is not just about getting  away with it; sometimes in the military there ought to be some concern  for whether the American people have a voice in this, and the fact that  their elected representatives have tried to take things like this off  the table, and not let them do that.   So Senator Tuberville saw this coming. He also understood--as I think  anyone rationally looking at it has the ability to understand--that the  distinction between this and providing funding for the performance of  an abortion is really difficult to differentiate. If you add up the  value, the economic value, of the 3 weeks of paid leave and add to that  interstate travel--in many cases, it is going to be interstate air  travel--and lodgings, meals, per diem for that period of time, at the  end of the day, performance of the abortion is going to be dwarfed by  that policy. It is almost the afterthought. It is the least expensive  part of all of that. And so, yeah, can you say that you have evaded the  letter of the law? Yeah, I think you can make that argument, but it is  too cute by half, and they are trying deliberately to flout this law  while claiming that they are respecting it.   So what did Senator Tuberville do? Well, Senator Tuberville serves on  the Senate Armed Services Committee. And in that capacity, he has  oversight authority, oversight responsibilities over the Department of  Defense. So he did what he felt was appropriate and what I think was  appropriate, and he decided to sit down with the Secretary of Defense  and just talk it out with him, rather than relying on the rumor mill to  either confirm or dispel what might be happening. He articulated his  concerns.   He said: Look, if you were to do this, it is just a poke in the eye.  You are doing it because you can get away with it for the time being.  So don't do it. And if you still do it, there will be consequences. And  then he spelled out what those consequences would be.   You see, in the Senate, when we confirm people, particularly when we  confirm people who are up for consideration for a military promotion,  there is a custom and practice that we don't require the full  procedures to be followed--the full procedures, which takes some time.   And so Senators, typically, agree to expedite that process so that  these military promotions can be considered as a group, en bloc, and on  a really fast-tracked basis. It is, nonetheless, a senatorial courtesy;  it is something that we choose to do. It is our choice, and it is the  choice of each Senator individually. Any one Senator can decide for him  or herself when, whether, to what extent to allow that person and where  to withhold it.   And so what Senator Tuberville told Secretary Lloyd Austin, the  Secretary of Defense, was simple: If you do this, I will not any longer  be able to justify giving expedited treatment to military promotions  for flag officers--you know, admirals and generals. I won't do that, so  don't do it, because you will be flouting the law. You will be flouting  the law in a way that may take a significant amount of time, whether  through litigation--if it follows that course--or through legislation.  Probably be able to run out the clock through the end of this  administration.   Senator Tuberville felt that would be an unfortunate result and  wanted to give Secretary Austin the chance to avoid it. So he said:  Don't do it; but if you do do it, it is going to take you a whole lot  longer to confirm your admirals and your generals.   Well, what happened? A month or two later, lo and behold, the  Department of Defense releases that policy: 3 weeks of paid leave and  compensated, reimbursed travel expenses, and per diem, for the purpose  of getting an abortion. Sure, they try to dress it up in other  language. This is about abortion. This is about Dobbs because the  administration doesn't like the Dobbs decision. It is mad that the  Supreme Court of the United States stood up for the plain text of the  Constitution.   The plain text of the Constitution does not make abortion itself  categorically a Federal issue and certainly doesn't prohibit to the  States the authority to protect unborn human life. It doesn't take that  away, and because it doesn't take that away, it is not an issue that  nine lawyers wearing robes can just decide, just graft it on to the  Constitution.   So the Dobbs Court reached that conclusion. Whether you agree with  the Dobbs Court or not--I do. It was right. But whether you agree with  me on that or not, it is the Supreme Court's ruling.   This is a temper tantrum. It is a temper tantrum by the Department of  Defense and by the Biden administration. They are still mad that they  lost the Dobbs ruling. That is what this is.   So they proceeded with it, and Coach Tuberville said: I told you what  I would do, and I am going to stand up for what I told you I would do.  This isn't right. You are encouraging, you are facilitating abortions,  and it sends the wrong message altogether. This is not something that  we are comfortable with the Department of Defense doing. We made that  clear in law decades ago. And you are doing this for the sole purpose  of flouting--of circumventing. So don't do it.   Now, it is clear as a bell: This doesn't stop anyone from getting  confirmed. There is not one person whom we stop from getting confirmed  simply because any one Senator decides that he or she isn't going to  continue to expedite the process. Every one of these people could be  confirmed. Essentially, every one of them could be confirmed in not a  whole lot of time. It would be some time-consuming processes they would  have to go through, but it is not overwhelming.   In the meantime, all this pressure is mounting. The message from the  White House and from the Pentagon has been to put the blame entirely at  Senator Tuberville's feet and to say that all kinds of horrible things  are going to happen--dogs and cats living together in the streets; Book  of Revelations  [[Page S3735]]  stuff, apocalyptic stuff is going to happen--and it is all Senator  Tommy Tuberville's fault. This is nonsense.   For those who have made that argument within this body, it is  uncollegial. For the President of the United States to jump on this  bandwagon and do the same thing--the President of the United States, a  longtime Member of this body who never served with Senator Tuberville,  but if he had, he would have known him and he would have liked him.  They would have been friends. Senator Biden, I have no doubt, would  have respected as a matter of senatorial courtesy what Senator  Tuberville is doing because we respect each other's procedural rights,  especially when standing on a sincerely held conviction. But that is  not what President Biden is doing.   He gave a speech just a little while ago. He begins with the words  ``Something dangerous is happening.''   A few sentences later, he says:         The Republican Party used to . . . support the military,       but today they're undermining the military. The senior       senator from Alabama, who claims to support our troops, is       now blocking more than 300 military operations with his       extreme political agenda.    Let's talk for a moment about what is extreme. It is extreme to take  U.S. taxpayer dollars and use them to facilitate, promote, and  encourage abortion. That is extreme. It is also extreme for this  administration to refuse even to consider the possibility that maybe  they overstepped.   Now, there is dispute among people in the military as to whether or  to what extent any delay in the promotion of these members is a matter  of national security. I understand there are disagreements on that.  There are also no fewer than 5,000 veterans who have signed on to  support Senator Tuberville's Pentagon hold--5,000--who say that Senator  Tuberville's decision to place these holds is absolutely right and that  he is not to blame and that there are no circumstances in which Senator  Tuberville should be blamed for any impact on military readiness.   Now, let's step back for a minute, and let's just assume. Let's  assume for purposes of argument here that we are living in a world in  which there are legitimate national security ramifications flowing from  the nonconfirmation of any or all of the roughly 300 promotions we are  talking about. Let's assume that into existence.   If that is the case, to whatever extent that is true, what is true  for the goose is also true for the gander. It is not something that you  could put solely on Senator Tuberville, especially given the fact that  we could promote and confirm the promotions of every single one of  these people right now within the next 5 minutes. We could do it if  only this administration would stop trying to advance its radical, pro- abortion agenda through every jurisdiction, every Department, every  Agency. This is an all-of-government thing. They don't care; they are  going to promote abortion in whatever way possible. All they would have  to do is say: You know, let's set that aside. In the interest of  national security, let's do that.   It is not as if members of the military choosing to get an abortion  are prohibited from doing so. It is not as though members of the  military choosing to seek an abortion are denied leave or denied the  ability to do this.   So what exactly are we fighting for, and to whatever degree this is  impairing and impacting national security, who exactly is doing this?  The President of the United States and Secretary Austin  both independently have at their disposal the ability to end this now.    So a national security threat? Not a national security threat? To the  extent it is, it is on you, President Biden, and you certainly can't  put this entirely at Senator Tuberville's feet. This is your doing. You  have chosen this route. He warned you that Federal law itself cautioned  against it, and you did it anyway.   It goes on a few sentences later:         This partisan freeze is already harming military readiness,       security and leadership, and troop morale.    He goes on:         Freezing pay, freezing people in place. Military families       who have already sacrificed so much unsure of where or when       they change stations, unable to get housing or start their       kids in the new school [because they are not there yet].    Here again, I get it. It would be great to get those people  confirmed. It really would. I would like to see them confirmed. So even  though this wasn't my decision--I wasn't in his shoes. I wasn't the one  who chose this particular option. But he is my friend, he is my  colleague, and he is a U.S. Senator who holds an election certificate  just like the rest of us and just like President Biden did for the many  decades he served in this body. He has every right to decide when and  when not to extend the courtesy of expediting these confirmations. He  went about it in a gentlemanly, courteous way, giving advance notice.  He rested his theory on a law that has been in place for decades that  is being flouted.   The President of the United States has the audacity to lay at his  feet any suffering, any misfortune, any unhappiness among these  families, any military readiness that may flow from it, when he himself  knows darn well that in order to score cheap political points with the  abortion lobby, he is willing to bring these things on. And then he has  the audacity to blame this on one Senator from Alabama.   Shame on you, President Biden. Shame on you.   He goes on:         Military spouses are forced to take critical career       decisions, not knowing where or if they can apply for a new       job. . . . a growing cascade of damage and disruption all       because one senator from Alabama and 48 Republicans refused       to stand up to him to lift the blockade over a Pentagon       policy offering servicemen and women and their families       access to reproductive health care rights they deserve if       they're stationed in states that deny it.    He can dress that up all he wants. It is still on him. He can call  this healthcare all he wants, but he is talking about a procedure that  has one purpose, and that is to culminate in the cessation of unborn  human life.   I find that difficult to take--difficult to take especially in the  face of 10 U.S.C. 1093, which on its face makes clear that the American  people don't want and have outlawed the use of military funds and  facilities to perform abortions. Why should we be willing to tolerate  something that indirectly, in a way that is way too cute by at least  half, openly flouts the intended purpose and spirit of that law?   He continues:         I think it's outrageous. But don't just take it from me.       Hundreds of military spouses petitioned to end the extreme       blockade.    One spouse, referring to the Senator from Alabama, said:         This isn't a football game. This nonsense must stop right       now. Enough.    You know, the military spouse quoted is right. This isn't a football  game. It is much more serious than that--in fact, far more serious.  This is about the law. This is about maintaining military readiness.  This is about making sure that our laws aren't openly flouted by those  charged with managing and directing the affairs of what is our largest  Department and one of the central, key parts of the Federal Government,  one of its main reasons for existing. It is not a football game, and  this business of openly flouting the law and the business of law in  which we work is also not a game.   You see, the fact is, Secretary Austin made a grave miscalculation  when he decided he was going to make policy and make policy utterly at  odds with the policy embodied in enacted law. You see, you can't  legislate from the E-ring of the Pentagon. It can't be done.   My copy of the Constitution, the very first operative provision of  that document, article I, section 1, says:         All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a       Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a       Senate and a House of Representatives.    Article I, section 7, puts additional meat on the bones and makes  abundantly clear what is teed up in article I, section 1, clause 1. It  says that in order to make a law within the Federal Government, it has  to be through Congress. In order to make a law, you have to pass it  through the House and pass it through the Senate. Once you pass the  same text through both Houses of Congress, it has to be presented to  the President for signature, veto, or acquiescence.   Maybe he didn't get the memo on article I. Maybe he needs to be  reminded of the fact that he doesn't get to make law. It is not within  his prerogative.  [[Page S3736]]    He openly, brazenly and I believe very, very deliberately sought to  undermine the stated purpose, intent, effect, and spirit of 10 U.S.C.  1093. He chose to do that.   What is sad in this day and age, when the government is as big as  ours, a government that unwisely gives as much deference as it does to  the executive branch--not just to the President himself but those who  serve him in various capacities in executive branch Agencies and  Departments. In this day and age, it is almost analogous to the  expression that ``possession is nine-tenths of the law.'' As long as he  remains in charge of the Department of Defense, he can say up is down  and is surrounded by people who literally salute him every day and  people who follow those orders. Unless or until Congress does something  about it, he may get away with openly flouting the law.   (Ms. Cantwell assumed the Chair.) That doesn't mean that nobody in  the Senate can have anything to say about it, and it certainly does not  entitle the Secretary of Defense or the President of the United States  to have every Member of the U.S. Senate agree to continue to reward  them with continued deference and a grant of expedited consideration of  all military promotions, whether flag officers or otherwise. This is  not something they are entitled to. It is something that Senators  freely choose to give or to withhold. Here, he has chosen to withhold  it.    The beginning of the end of his speech says:         I urge Senate Republicans to do what they know is right.    On that point, I agree, and we will.
