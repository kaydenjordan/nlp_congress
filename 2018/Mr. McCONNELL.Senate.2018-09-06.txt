 Madam President, day 2 of Brett Kavanaugh's  confirmation hearings proved to be a marathon session. For 13 hours,  Judge Kavanaugh was grilled by our colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee. Through that testing, the Senate got to see exactly why the  American Bar Association deemed this nominee to be unanimously ``well  qualified,'' which is the highest possible rating, a distinction that  many of our Democratic colleagues in the past called the gold standard.   We saw precisely why he has earned such praise from accomplished  legal figures, like Lisa Blatt, a self-described liberal and a leading  Supreme Court litigator who proudly introduced Judge Kavanaugh before  the committee; and Neal Katyal, the Obama administration's Solicitor  General who said: ``It's very hard for anyone who's worked with Judge  Kavanaugh, appeared before him, to frankly say a bad word about him.''   Judge Kavanaugh was patient and professional. His answers showed  total command of everything, from the fine details of case law to the  principles upon which our Founders built the Constitution.   In July, one of Judge Kavanaugh's former Yale Law School professors  explained that he is ``an avid consumer of legal scholarship. He reads  and learns.''   It certainly shows. Judge Kavanaugh's widely acclaimed temperament  was on full display. He gave thoughtful, expansive answers, while also  respecting the independence of the judiciary. Even as some of our  Democratic colleagues seemed to forget--seemed to forget--that we are  examining a potential Supreme Court Justice and not interviewing a  superlegislator who will be writing his own policy preferences into  law, Judge Kavanaugh remained very gracious and spoke at length about  his past jurisprudence and his understanding of the role judges play in  our Republic.   It was striking to contrast Judge Kavanaugh's poise, on the one hand,  and professionalism with the continued unhinged--literally, unhinged-- antics of the far left, which once again resorted to yelling and  screaming and interrupting the hearing with nonsensical protests. The  Capitol Police deserves all of our gratitude for keeping order, as does  Chairman Grassley for keeping the proceedings moving smoothly.   Perhaps it is finally dawning on the far left that Judge Kavanaugh is  an impressive, mainstream, and brilliant nominee who almost any  objective observer would agree is more than qualified to serve on the  Supreme Court. Maybe that is why they are resorting to futile attempts  to disrupt the proceedings. Maybe that is why no fewer than 66  individuals were removed from the hearing room for interruptions.   I will be perfectly clear about this. Hysterical stunts are not going  to stop the U.S. Senate from completing its business. There is no  heckler's veto here. I look forward to more excellent testimony from  Judge Kavanaugh today.  [[Page S6042]]                                ____________________     Madam President, I want to say a few words about a  loyal and valuable public servant as he reaches a remarkable milestone.  Over the past 50 years, Members of Congress have come and gone, but all  the while, Dr. Walter Oleszek has been on hand at the Library of  Congress to answer Members' and staff's toughest questions about the  inner workings of American government.   Walter arrived in Washington in the summer of 1968 from Upstate New  York. He signed on with the Legislative Reference Service, now the  Congressional Research Service, and has been serving ever since.   Over five decades, Walter has grown into an institution unto himself.  He is not only the longest serving CRS team member but also a dedicated  and integral part of its operations, while also finding time to teach  and lecture on the side.   Alan Frumin, the former Senate Parliamentarian, was actually one of  Walter's students at Colgate University years ago. According to Alan,  ``If there's anything about Congress that Walter does not know, then  that thing doesn't exist.'' In my experience around here, the  Parliamentarian is usually the smartest one in the room. So that is  especially high praise, and Walter has earned it.   Today, on behalf of the Senate, I want to thank this scholar, author,  internationally sought adviser, and dedicated steward of the U.S.  Congress. We congratulate him on his career thus far and look forward  to continuing to work alongside him.                            ____________________     Madam President, pursuant to the order of August 28,  at 1:45 p.m. today, the Senate will proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar Nos. 693, 731, 778, 779, 782, 838, 839, and 893, as  under the previous order.
