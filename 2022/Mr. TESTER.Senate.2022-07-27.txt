 Mr. President, it seems a bit like deja vu all over  again. We have been here before. We were here before the Fourth of July  talking about the PACT Act, the toxic exposure bill, the bill that has  been in the works for 15 years and that the ranking member and I have  worked on very hard over the last 18 months, year and a half.   We are going to vote on it again here in a moment. This is a bill  that has been talked about a lot on this floor, and just about  everything has been said about this bill. It is a bill that allows us,  the American people, to live up to the promises we make our Active-Duty  military when they come home with an injury--in this case, toxic  exposure.   We have had toxic exposures--well, in World War I, it was mustard  gas; radiation in World War II; and, of course, Agent Orange in the  Vietnam war. We have had toxic exposures over and over and over again.  In the Middle East, it is burn pits.   Over the last year and a half, we have had many hearings on this  bill. In fact, we had a gentleman testify that he had a lung disorder.  He was in tough shape. And, in fact, he passed away a few months ago.   The truth is, this is a bill that we need to pass. And we passed it  already with 84 votes, and I think we had a couple of Senators gone or  we would have had 86. It is a bill that is bipartisan in nature, and it  is a bill that I think every Senator who votes for this bill can be  proud that we are supporting the men and women who have felt the wounds  of battle and are now trying to get their life back to normal.   But it is more than just the folks who served in our military; it is  also their families. I would encourage all the Members of the body to  support this bill.   It costs $27 billion a year, but it is a cost of war. If we are not  willing to take care of our men and women when they come back from  battles that we send them off to, then maybe we ought to rethink  whether we are going to send them in the first place. This bill is a  bill that was pushed by every veterans service organization out there.  It was their No. 1 priority. We listened to the veterans, and we ended  up with a piece of legislation that is very, very good.   If we are able to pass this out of the Senate again, this time it  won't be going to the House. It will be going right to the President's  desk, and we will have done right by our veterans in this country; we  will have done right by the next generation of fighting men and women  who will become veterans; and we will have had our veterans' backs  along the way.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion     Mr. President, the good Senator from Pennsylvania is  correct. I want to see this bill passed. I want to see this bill passed  for all the reasons I have talked about many times in committee and on  this floor.   This is about living up to the promises for our veterans. This is  about making sure that when the veterans come back from exposures to  burn pits or oil well fires or Agent Orange, that they don't have to go  to the VA and fight for their healthcare and their benefits.   It impacts 3\1/2\ million veterans in this country. By the way, there  will be a few more who die before we get this bill passed.   And I would also say that, as the Senator from Pennsylvania says, I  am all for the $278.4 billion over 10 years on this bill; I have got no  problem with that--well, the fact is, he does have a problem with that.  The fact is, by doing what happened today on this floor, the real issue  here--and make no mistake about it--is the money that is being spent to  take care of our veterans.   And I have said it before, and I will say it again. If you have the  guts to send somebody to war, then you better have the guts to take  care of them when they get back home--or don't send them in the first  place.   Now, let's talk about the $400 billion, OK, because, quite frankly,  what this is about--this is about not even trusting the people in this  body. We have an Appropriations Committee, and we vote on  appropriations bills, and we set the levels in the accounts based off  of appropriations. Let the process work. Let's not tie the hands of  appropriators. Let's make sure we let the process work. That is what we  have always done.   But the good Senator from Pennsylvania's amendment ties the hands of  the appropriators. Make no mistake about this, the American people are  sick and tired of the games that go on in this body. They are sick and  tired of us working for Democrats or working for Republicans and not  working for the American people. But this is bigger than that.   We have an All-Volunteer military in this country. If you don't think  young people are watching what we are doing today who are thinking  about signing up for the military, you are sadly mistaken. And when we  don't take care of our veterans when they come home, they are going to  say: Why should I ever sign on the dotted line because, of the promises  that I made and the promises the country made, only half that deal is  being respected--my half.   This is a sad day in the U.S. Senate. This is the biggest issue  facing our veterans today. Make no mistake about it, if it wasn't,  every veterans service organization wouldn't be out there talking to us  and have been talking to me for the last 15 years.   So we can make up all sorts of excuses about how this is going to  move money around, but--let me tell you something--we are the ones who  decide that. If we want to move money around, we will; if we don't, we  won't.  [[Page S3734]]    In the meantime, let's pass this bill. Let's give veterans the  healthcare they have earned. If it isn't, it is political malpractice.  What we are doing today with this policy, by putting this policy off,  does nobody any good whatsoever.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am going to reiterate what I said  before. The concern that the Senator from Pennsylvania has is a concern  that there is not a lot of trust in this body, and I agree--fair reason  to be.   As far as having rules, I believe in having rules, but I don't  believe we should have rules that tie the hands of our standing  committees, that say: You can't do this. Appropriations, I don't care  what you see, what you see, what issue comes down the road for  veterans--in this case, Martin Heinrich, the chair, and John Boozman,  the ranking member--you guys can't address it.   That is what the Senator from Pennsylvania wants to do. That is not  how this process should work. We should be dealing with issues as they  arise. That is a fact.   And by the way, I have said for some time, programs that have  outlived their lifespan, we should be cutting those programs, but we  don't do that very well.   But we have been at war for 20 years. With that war--by the way, that  was all put on a credit card--there was a fair amount that was funded  by an OCO account. And now we are going to say: Oh, no, no, no, no, no,  no; we are not going to spend the money to take care of our veterans. I  am going to use this as an excuse. I am going to use as an excuse the  fact that the Appropriations Committee might spend too much money.   Well, that is on us. And while that is on us, we have veterans dying  of cancers and lung conditions because a bill that should have been  passed before the Fourth of July is still on the floor today.   You can frame it any way you want. But in the end, this budgetary  gimmick is called: How the Congress Works. Appropriators appropriate.  If you don't believe me, ask Senator Shelby. That is what we do. And if  we appropriate too much, this body votes it down. Or if we don't  appropriate enough, this body votes it down and amends it up. That is  what appropriators do. That is how this process is supposed to work.   We should not be using that excuse to deny benefits to the men and  women who have served this country in a God-awful place in the Middle  East.   I yield the floor.
