 Mr. Speaker, for too long, there has been a culture of  disregard for our community financial institutions out of Washington,  D.C.   Regulations that were intended to bring discipline to the Nation's  largest institutions have instead suffocated Main Street and prevented  communities across the country from finding their footing on the path  to prosperity.   The passage of this historic, bipartisan, progrowth package today  will mark a change in the regulatory rhetoric out of Washington.  Communities will be heard instead of ignored. Families will find open  doors where previously they were shut out. And small businesses will be  empowered to grow rather than languish in regulatory uncertainty.   One provision of this legislation that I authored, the MOBILE Act,  embodies exactly the kind of commonsense help for families that today's  vote will provide.   The MOBILE Act will allow consumers across the country to open bank  accounts on their mobile devices using a driver's license or personal  ID, meaning access to financial services will start in your pocket and  be more convenient than ever.   Approximately three-quarters of the 20 percent of the U.S. population  that  [[Page H4347]]  is underbanked has access to a smartphone. This provision will help  these Americans get access to the critical banking services that will  set them on the path to financial success.   Mr. Speaker, this historic package is about unraveling red tape that  stifles the financial success of all Americans, and I urge its passage  here today.
