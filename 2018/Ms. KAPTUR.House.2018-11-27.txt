 Madam Speaker, how troubling it is that General Motors  has announced it is idling five major auto plants across the United  States and Canada. At the Chevy Cruze plant in Lordstown, Ohio,  facility alone, 1,600 jobs are on the chopping block. The dire impact  in Ohio surges to 5,000 more potential lost jobs when auto part  suppliers are considered.   President Trump promised to defend manufacturing. He promised to cure  the red ink of manufacturing job loss and wage-crushing trade deficits.  Under him, both are getting worse. Instead, his party enacted deficit- busting corporate tax giveaways with the Republican tax scam. Where do  the automakers intend to invest their bonanza? Not here.   Time and time again, American taxpayers and workers have been asked  to help the U.S. automakers. This latest move from General Motors is an  affront to their investment.   President Obama and congressional Democrats refinanced the ailing  American auto industry in 2009. Democrats saved American manufacturing  while the vast majority of Republicans voted no.   Madam Speaker, we need fair trade to open markets and create jobs  here at home.                            ____________________
