 Madam Speaker, Utah families are suffering and worrying  about how they are going to survive this crisis financially. This  legislation provides additional funds for the Paycheck Protection  Program to cover payroll and other essential expenses for small  businesses, and it keeps paychecks coming for employees. We must make  sure that this money makes it to the small businesses and hardworking  families that deserve it.   This bill also provides critical support to our hospitals that are  saving lives and money for testing so we can move safely and  responsibly to reopen the economy.   This is critical economic support. I support this bipartisan  legislation.
