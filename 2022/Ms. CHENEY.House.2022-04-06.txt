 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the select committee has now conducted over 800  interviews and depositions of witnesses who have knowledge of the  events of January 6. This includes more than a dozen former Trump White  House staff members.   Mr. Speaker, when you hear my colleagues make political, partisan  attacks on the select committee, I hope that all of us can remember  some basic facts: Through these interviews, we have learned that  President Trump and his team were warned in advance, and repeatedly,  that the efforts they undertook to overturn the 2020 election  [[Page H4372]]  would violate the law and our Constitution; they were warned that  January 6 could, and likely would, turn violent; and they were told  repeatedly by our State and Federal courts, by our Justice Department,  and by agencies of our intelligence community, that the allegations of  widespread fraud, sufficient to overturn an election, were false and  were unsupported by the evidence.    Yet, despite all of these specific warnings, President Trump and his  team moved willfully through multiple means to attempt to halt the  peaceful transfer of power, to halt the constitutional process for  counting votes, and to shatter the constitutional bedrock of our great  Nation.   As a Federal judge has recently concluded, the illegality of  President Trump's plan for January 6 was ``obvious.''   We are here today to address two specific witnesses who have refused  to appear for testimony before the committee.   The committee has many questions for Mr. Scavino about his political  social media work for President Trump, including his interactions with  an online forum called ``theDonald.win'' and with QAnon, a bizarre and  dangerous cult.   Mr. Scavino worked directly with President Trump to spread President  Trump's false message that the election was stolen and to recruit  Americans to come to Washington on January 6 to ``take back their  country.'' This effort to deceive was widely effective and widely  destructive, and Donald Trump's stolen election campaign succeeded in  provoking the violence on January 6.   On this point, there is no doubt. The committee has videos,  interviews, and sworn statements from violent rioters demonstrating  these facts.   Mr. Navarro will also be a key witness. He has written a book  boasting about his role in planning and coordinating the activity of  January 6. We have many questions for Mr. Navarro, including about his  communications with Roger Stone and Steve Bannon regarding the planning  for January 6.   As Judge Carter recently concluded: ``Based on the evidence, the  Court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly  attempted to obstruct the joint session of Congress on January 6,  2021.''   In the case of both of these witnesses, Mr. Speaker, the committee  would rather have their testimony than have to move this contempt  citation. When you hear my colleagues attack the select committee,  remember Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro have chosen not to appear. They  did not have to make this choice, but they did.   In America, no one is above the law. Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr.  Scavino nor Mr. Navarro is some form of royalty. There is no such thing  in America as the privileges of the crown. Every citizen has a duty to  comply with a subpoena.   Mr. Speaker, when you hear my colleagues challenge the committee's  legislative purpose, remember the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court of  the United States have affirmed our legislative purpose. Too many  Republicans are, once again, ignoring the rulings of the courts, as  many of them did in the run-up to January 6.   Mr. Speaker, the tale of what happened following the 2020 election,  resulting in the violence of January 6, is a tale of stunning deceit.  It is a tale of lies about our election and contempt for the rulings of  our courts.   The election claims made by Donald Trump were so frivolous and so  unfounded that the President's lead lawyer did not just lose these  cases; he lost his license to practice law. The New York Supreme Court  found: ``There is uncontroverted evidence that Mr. Giuliani  communicated demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts,  lawmakers, and the public at large in his capacity as lawyer for former  President Donald J. Trump and the Trump campaign in connection with  Trump's failed effort at reelection in 2020.''                                time  1700    Mr. Speaker, those in this Chamber who continue to embrace the former  President and his dangerous and destructive lies ought to take a good,  hard look at themselves. At a moment of real danger to our Republic,  when the need for fidelity to our Constitution is paramount, they have  abandoned their oaths in order to perform for Donald Trump. That will  be their legacy.   Mr. Speaker, this is not a close call. Mr. Navarro and Mr. Scavino  have chosen not to comply with a congressional subpoena. They are in  contempt. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I think it is very important, as our  colleagues consider their vote on this resolution, to keep in mind the  facts.   Number one, neither Mr. Scavino nor Mr. Navarro has appeared in front  of this committee. As I mentioned earlier, we have interviewed over 800  witnesses. The vast majority of them have cooperated fully and answered  our questions. Some of the witnesses have taken the Fifth. Some of the  witnesses have answered some questions and asserted a privilege on  other questions.   But the notion that somehow the former President can instruct someone  not to appear, that is not sustainable, that is not found anywhere in  the law. If Mr. Scavino or Mr. Navarro wants to assert some kind of a  privilege--and again, our questions for them have to do with their  activities that are political activities that are not covered by  executive privilege, but if they wish to assert that privilege, they  can appear and do so.    Madam Speaker, I would also note that in Trump v.  Thompson, the D.C. Circuit held, and then we were upheld in the Supreme  Court, that the committee's need for this information outweighs the  former President's rights to any kind of confidentiality.   I think it is important for those facts to be clear and to be on the  Record.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Aguilar).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I know my colleague and friend, Mr. Armstrong, knows very well that,  first of all, executive privilege is a qualified privilege.   Secondly, former President Trump has not asserted executive  privilege.   Third, I have tremendous respect, obviously, for Justice Kavanaugh,  but my colleagues continue to quote Justice Kavanaugh without noting  that the opinion in the D.C. circuit, which was upheld by the Supreme  Court, in that opinion the judge found a number of things, including  ``to allow the privilege of a no-longer sitting President to prevail  over Congress' need to investigate a violent attack on its home and its  constitutional operations would gravely impair the basic function of  the legislature.''   The Court also held that under any of the tests advocated by former  President Trump, the profound interests in disclosure advanced by  President Biden and the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th  Attack on the United States Capitol far exceed his generalized concerns  for executive branch confidentiality.   And I would just repeat again, Madam Speaker, that Mr. Scavino and  Mr. Navarro both have chosen not to appear in front of the committee to  answer questions that are clearly outside of any potential claim of  privilege they may have, and even if they believe there is a claim of  privilege, they are obligated to appear and make that assertion. They  cannot simply refuse to respond to the committee's subpoena.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Murphy).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I think it is again very important as our colleagues are  contemplating their vote on this resolution that they keep in mind the  facts. And we are hearing a number of things that are not consistent  with the facts.   First of all, with respect to the establishment of the committee, Mr.  Davis knows, and my colleagues know that we initially attempted to have  a bipartisan commission, which, in fact, Leader McCarthy instructed Mr.  Katko to negotiate with Chairman Thompson. Mr. Katko did that, secured  everything the Republicans asked for, at which point, Mr. McCarthy  walked away from the bipartisan commission, and then went over to the  Senate side and lobbied against the establishment of a bipartisan  commission.   The establishment of the select committee, again, is not what we  would have hoped. The 35 Republicans who voted for the bipartisan  commission wanted a bipartisan outside commission, but we cannot let  this attack go uninvestigated.   Mr. Davis also knows that with respect to the membership of the  committee, Speaker Pelosi said that she would not name two Members who  had been identified by Mr. McCarthy; that is completely consistent with  the resolution. And Mr. McCarthy then himself withdrew the other three  and determined that he would not participate.   Finally, Madam Speaker, I continue to hear this allegation that the  committee is not investigating what happened at the Capitol, not  investigating what happened with respect to the Capitol Police, not  investigating what happened with respect to security that day. That is  just not true. The committee has an entire team that is very focused on  and investigating what happened with respect to security at the  Capitol.   And it is also the case, though, Madam Speaker, we must all remember  that the former President provoked a violent assault on this body, and  the extent to which there were security lapses, the extent to which  people did not anticipate that there would be a violent assault on the  Capitol, provoked by the former President, is not the fault of the  Capitol Police. That is the responsibility of the former President.    And I would also note, Madam Speaker, that Mr. Davis voted ``yes'' on  the bipartisan commission when it came up.  [[Page H4377]]    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin), my good friend and colleague.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it does not feel really good today. It feels sad, and it  feels tragic that so many in my own party are refusing to address the  constitutional crisis and the challenge that we face.   The ranking member of the Judiciary Committee went to law school. I  am not sure if he passed the bar. But he knows that we all have an  obligation to abide by the rulings of the courts.   So, yes, it was a false story. Yes, it was a big lie. In fact, former  Vice President Pence has said that what President Trump wanted him to  do was ``un-American.'' It was also unconstitutional, and it was  illegal.   Mr. Speaker, what gives me tremendous hope though is although so many  in my party in this body have put loyalty to Donald Trump ahead of  their oath to the Constitution, the committee has interviewed scores of  Republicans from around the country who, in fact, have shown the kind  of tremendous bravery and dedication to public service that every  American can be proud of: Republicans who were appointed by President  Trump to posts in the Department of Justice; Republicans who stood  firm; Republicans who threatened to resign and who refused to  participate in President Trump's efforts to corrupt the Department of  Justice with the stolen election lies--yes, lies--that led to January  6.   We have heard from Republicans serving in State legislatures, in  State and local governments who also stood firm.   Mr. Speaker, it is crucially important that this body hold these  gentlemen in contempt. It is crucially important that they have to  abide by their subpoena.   I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on rollcall No. 121, I intended to vote  ``yea.''                             personal explanation
