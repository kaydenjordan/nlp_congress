 Mr. President, I come to the floor to oppose this  effort by my good colleague from Alaska and by congressional  Republicans to, in my view, turn back the clock 100 years on the  management of our native wildlife on our national wildlife refuges in  Alaska.   Since 2002, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has embraced what  some have called a politically driven and even unscientific regime of  intensive predator control. I think it is helpful to look at the views  of a former Governor of Alaska, Tony Knowles, who recently commented in  High Country News:         The most disappointing thing is that the balance of the       views on the Board of Game has disappeared. I tried to work       with a balanced board that reflected subsistence hunters,       sport hunters, guides and conservationists, but now the board       is made up of people who want to make hunting ungulates the       priority for wildlife management.        There's been a focused effort to dramatically reduce       populations of wolves, coyotes, and bears, and the methods       and means they've used are both unscientific and unethical.    That is not my quote, but that of former Governor Tony Knowles of  Alaska.   In addition, in the past decade, the Alaska Board of Game and the  department have turned their back, I think, on a long history of not  only working together between Federal and State agencies but embracing  ethics as central to wildlife management--not just to maintain the  viability of that management but to maintain the support of the public  for that management.   This relatively new approach that actively seeks to eschew the long  history of embracing sporting ethics can best be summed up by a quote  from Doug Vincent-Land, the former director of the Alaska Department of  Fish and Game Division of Wildlife Conservation. He said: ``The  professionals at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game did not feel it  was our role to judge the ethics of these practices.''   The result of this ethics-free approach is now glaringly obvious,  when considering some of the methods of take that have been approved  over time for native predators in Alaska. Shooting mother grizzlies  with cubs, aerial gunning of wolves, killing wolf pups in their dens,  using spotlights at bear dens, baiting of bears, and allowing the  wanton waste of black bear meat are a few of the practices that  Alaska's Board of Game has approved.   Aldo Leopold, the father of modern wildlife conservation, once said:  ``Ethical behavior is doing the right thing  [[Page S1867]]  when no one else is watching--even when doing the wrong thing is  legal.''   Now, I know it has become fashionable in some hunting circles  recently to ignore the importance of ethics to our way of life. Yet, if  our greatest leaders are any indication, that is, at best, a slippery  slope to irrelevance.   This cartoon is a good reminder. It is from the early 20th century,  at a time when President Teddy Roosevelt was invited down to  Mississippi for a black bear hunt. When he wasn't successful, they tied  a black bear to a tree. I think that cartoon from that period is a good  reminder of how T.R. viewed the importance of sportsmanship and ethics  in hunting as central to what maintains our credibility. Today,  politicians jump at the chance to embrace his reputation, but too often  they have not followed his example. So while shooting down grizzlies  with cubs may be legal, I suspect the public will never view it as  ethical. I have to wonder what good old T.R. would have to say about  recent decisions to allow things like unlimited bag limits on black  bear cubs or baiting of bears and shooting female grizzlies with cubs.   So why does all of this ethics stuff matter so much to hunters? Why  does it matter to me? It matters because hunters like me are a small  minority of the population in this country. We are less than 5 percent,  by most counts, and we are able to carry on this great tradition  because the vast majority--the nonhunting public, which is 95 percent  of the population--sees us as effective and ethical stewards of our  country's native wildlife. We have embraced the North American model of  wildlife conservation that has literally brought elk, deer, wild  turkey, and species we think of as common today--Canada geese, for  example--back from the brink of extinction, and that public shares in  that success when they enjoy wildlife. That is true, even if they never  hunt, never pick up a fishing poll. We as hunters also have the trust  and the respect of the public because we are willing to literally spend  billions of dollars of our own money to protect, conserve, and manage  those resources with the best available science.   The Alaska Game Board's decision to ignore the latest science on the  importance of predators to healthy prey populations is indicative of a  desire to effectively turn caribou and moose populations into livestock  and to manage for maximum numbers and maximum tag revenue.   Now, ironically, that approach has certainly been ineffective at  boosting and maintaining historically high caribou and moose numbers.   This is an example of a graph of moose population over time. We can  see back in 2002, when these sorts of intensive take measures went into  place: intensive predator control, preintensive management, and  postintensive management. If you can discern a consistent correlation  of an outcome of higher moose numbers there, you are doing better than  I.   This would all be fine if this was just happening on State lands in  Alaska, perchance. But, unfortunately, the Alaska Game Board now seeks  to suppress healthy predator populations on our national wildlife  refuges--the very places set aside to protect and preserve our native  wildlife--even predators, even black bears and grizzlies and wolves.  Let that sink in for a moment.   This is about embracing unscientific wildlife management on the very  refuges that belong to each and every American citizen--not Alaska  State land but our national wildlife refuges.   People save up for years--sometimes decades--to travel thousands of  miles to go to places like the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge so they  can see a grizzly bear fish for salmon. Does it make sense to allow  these kinds of extreme measures of take to allow for grizzlies with  cubs to be killed in those refuges? Will these policies actually  benefit the hunting public? I would argue that they do not.   Not one of my colleagues can deny how much I love to hunt and fish.  Many of my life's best memories have been forged around the campfire  with my friends and family at elk camp. Just this past Christmas break,  both of my boys joined me for what would be my son Carter's very first  elk hunt. This is the picture of us in the Continental Divide  Wilderness Study Area.   After days of hard hunting, hiking miles through the rough and tumble  backcountry of the Continental Divide WSA, my son Carter harvested his  first elk.   He soon learned that the real work starts after you pull the trigger.  He labored long and hard to make sure that every scrap of meat from  that animal made its way from the wilderness to our freezer. Anything  less would be unethical and disrespectful to that magnificent animal.  My son takes great pride in the meals that elk provides for our family  and our friends. He also knows that hunting is conservation and that we  have a responsibility to hand these wildlife resources off to the next  generation unimpaired. I am proud that even at 13 he takes that  responsibility very seriously.   Some of my son's classmates in school are vegetarians. Too many of  those who do eat meat think that it is created, as my colleague from  Alaska said, on a Styrofoam platter wrapped in cellophane. Carter knows  better. As someone who hunts and fully embraces the ideas of  sustainability and ethics, the next generation of sports men and women  couldn't have a better ambassador to this new generation of millennials  for why hunting is actually critical to the future of wildlife.   That, my friends, is what this CRA before us, in my view, puts at  risk.   When you vote to put the Federal stamp of approval on methods of take  that the public views as objectionable--even unethical--when you allow  that ideologically driven style of game management to even permeate the  sanctity of our national wildlife refuges, I don't think that is  standing up for hunters. I fear that it is endangering the future of  something that is critical to culture and way of life.   As I said before, the number of active hunters in the United States  today sits, I think, at around 5 percent, or maybe a little lower--I  hope not. By voting for this CRA, we are risking the confidence of the  general public in our ability as hunters to be the best stewards of our  wildlife resources. That is a risk that I am not willing to take.   So I would urge all of my colleagues to stand up for our Nation's  wildlife, to stand up for our national wildlife refuges, and to vote no  on this proposal.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I will close on the issue of the CRA  before us today.   This CRA will turn back the clock on the management of native  wildlife on our Nation's wildlife refuges. Methods of take, like  shooting mother grizzlies with cubs, aerial gunning of wolves, killing  wolf pups in their dens--these are not 21st-century tools for wildlife  management. They are relics of the 19th century, before we truly  understood the importance of predators to healthy ecosystems and  populations. These practices have no place on our Nation's Federal  wildlife refuges.   This rule, frankly, doesn't stand up for subsistence hunters or  hunters at all; it simply reinforces the politically driven and  unscientific turn that the Alaska Board of Game has taken under  Governors like Sarah Palin. This isn't about hunting; it is about dogma  and dogma driving policy.   I urge all of my colleagues tonight to vote for fair chase hunting,  to vote for native wildlife, and to vote for our national wildlife  refuges. To do that, I ask you to vote against this measure.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.
