 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  some great Americans. I am here to congratulate and thank a dozen brave  men and women who have committed their lives to serving our country.   Earlier this summer, 12 of my constituents and former constituents  whom I am proud to have nominated for an appointment to our Nation's  military academies have graduated.   It has been an incredible honor to meet these dedicated young people  over the years and to support them in their pursuit of an education.  Those who choose to spend their lives protecting and defending the  United States are the bravest this great Nation has to offer.   Today, I would like to recognize each of the graduates whom I have  previously nominated who completed their education at our Nation's  military academies:   Robert Bendik of State College, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy;   Isaac Bengel of Erie, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy;   Darren Keglovits of Coudersport, a graduate of the U.S. Naval  Academy;   Hannah Milliron of Duke Center, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy;   Alexandra Treglia of State College, a graduate of the U.S. Naval  Academy;   Grayson Hill of North East, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy  West Point;   Sarah Henderson of Indiana, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy  West Point;   Sterling Pickett of Loganton, a graduate of the U.S. Air Force  Academy;   Bailey Ishler of State College, a graduate of the U.S. Air Force  Academy;   Emily Walbridge of Mill Hall, a graduate of the U.S. Air Force  Academy;   Karlee Xander of Corry, a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy; and   Thomas King of Port Matilda, a graduate of the U.S. Air Force  Academy.   These brave men and women have bright futures ahead of them, Mr.  Speaker; and as they begin their careers in our Nation's Armed Forces,  I know their hard work, their dedication, and their commitment will  serve them well.   I am incredibly grateful for their service, and I commend them for  their bravery.   This next chapter in life will present many challenges, but also many  opportunities, and I am confident that these young people will rise to  the occasion.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank these individuals for their  service, and I wish them the very best of luck.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my  colleagues to support the HEALTH Act. I am pleased to have introduced  this bipartisan bill with the support of my cosponsor, Representative  Butterfield from North Carolina.   The HEALTH Act is a bipartisan effort to help increase access to  local telehealth. The bill will codify Medicare reimbursement for  community health centers and rural health clinics for telehealth  services, cutting red tape and ensuring that these vital services are  available to patients on a more permanent basis.   As a lifetime resident of rural Pennsylvania, and having spent nearly  three decades as a therapist and licensed nursing home administrator, I  have been amazed at how telehealth services make life easier for rural  and underserved communities, particularly for older Americans.   Now more than ever, access to telehealth services has become a  necessity in America. Medicare recipients are in need of these services  without barriers and restrictions, and the HEALTH Act will improve  access for the underserved.                            ____________________
