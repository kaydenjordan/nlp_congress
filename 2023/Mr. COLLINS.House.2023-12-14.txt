 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of  the House taking up the remaining appropriations legislation as soon as  we get back in the new year.   The past 12 months have certainly been trying, but our Conference has  shown that we can pass strong conservative policy that puts America  first.   To my colleagues, enjoy your time with your family. Come January,  let's be prepared to finish what the American people expect us to do,  and that is to get these remaining appropriations bills across the  finish line.                            ____________________
