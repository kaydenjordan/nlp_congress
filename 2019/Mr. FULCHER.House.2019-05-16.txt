 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 987, as well,  for a number of reasons; but one in particular that has been raised  already is the provision that it terminates the short-term limited  duration insurance provision.   Now, these are a good thing, and they have been good for Idaho. Idaho  has been one of the States that has been leading on this front.   Mr. Chairman, before the Affordable Care Act, the average premium in  our State was $1,915. After the Affordable Care Act, that premium  average went to $5,267. And that is, from what I understand, not unlike  what has happened in other States, because the young and the healthy  left the plans. That left the older, less healthy who were remaining in  those plans, and it has driven those costs up.   The younger and the more healthy have gone out of the plan altogether  or they have joined a Medi-Share. But the point is that it has driven  those numbers up significantly.   In my State, the legislature passed a 3-year provision for short-term  plans, and it is good for everyone. If you are in between those jobs or  if you are in between coverage for some reason or you need to maintain  continuity among the plans, it allows for that.   Mr. Chairman, I have heard a couple of times these referred to as  junk. If they were junk, there wouldn't be such demand for it. I would  reframe that argument to say that junk would be better described to the  system that has driven those prices up from $1,915 to $5,267. We want  to draw that younger constituency into those plans. Everyone wins. We  all win when that is the case.   Mr. Chairman, again, H.R. 987 strikes that provision, and for that  reason, I will oppose it, and I ask my colleagues to do the same.                                time  1430
