 Madam President, I rise to talk about the Marijuana  Justice Act--a bill I introduced today that would end the Federal  prohibition on marijuana and start to end the War on Drugs. For far too  long we have approached drug use and addiction as something we can jail  ourselves out of. It is beyond clear that approach has failed. It is  time we start to address the persistent and systemic racial bias that  has plagued our criminal justice system and adopt policies that will  move us forward, not backward. It is time to de-schedule marijuana.   Since 2001, arrests for marijuana have increased across the Country  and now account for over 50 percent of all drug arrests in the United  States. The ACLU conducted a thorough study of over 8 million marijuana  arrests between 2001 and 2010. It found that 88 percent of those were  for marijuana possession. Alarmingly, the study also found that African  Americans are 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana  possession than their white peers, even though they use marijuana at  similar rates.   Over the last five years, States have begun to legalize marijuana in  an effort to push back on the failed War on Drugs and combat the  illicit drug market. Currently, eight States and the District of  Columbia have legalized marijuana and more States are taking up  measures to follow suit. We know from the experiences of States that  have already legalized marijuana that we will gain far more than we  lose--these States have seen increased revenues and decreased rates of  serious crime, and a reallocation of resources toward more productive  uses. In Colorado, arrest rates have decreased and State revenues have  increased. Washington saw a 10 percent decrease in violent crime over  the three-year period following legalization.   However, the Federal government still treats marijuana as an illegal  substance. It is time for the Federal government to end the Federal  prohibition of marijuana.   Today, I introduced the Marijuana Justice Act, a bill that would  remove marijuana from the list of controlled substances, thereby ending  the Federal prohibition. The bill would also automatically expunge  records for people who were convicted of Federal marijuana use and  possession offenses. We must help people with criminal records get back  up on their feet and obtain jobs, and expunging their records is an  important step in that process.   The legislation would allow individuals currently serving time in  Federal prison for marijuana offenses to petition a court for a  resentencing. One of the greatest tragedies from the Fair Sentencing  Act was that it did not provide retroactive relief to individuals  serving time under the old crack and powder cocaine sentencing laws.  The Marijuana Justice Act would allow people currently serving time for  a marijuana offense to seek immediate relief.   The bill would also use Federal funds to encourage States where  marijuana is illegal to legalize the drug if they disproportionately  arrest or incarcerate low income individuals or people  [[Page S4670]]  of color. Too often drug laws are enforced disproportionately against  minorities and the poor. This is unacceptable and belies our values.   Finally, the Marijuana Justice Act would establish a community  reinvestment fund, which would invest money in communities most  affected by the War on Drugs. Building new libraries, supporting job  training, and investing in community centers will improve public safety  and is the right thing to do after decades of failed drug policies.   The Marijuana Justice Act is a serious step in acknowledging, that  after 40 years, it is time to end the War on Drugs. It is time to stop  our backward thinking, which has only led to backward results. It is  time to lead with our hearts, our heads, and with policy that actually  works.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PORTMAN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. McCain, Mrs.          McCaskill, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Blunt, Mrs. Capito,          Mr. Casey, Ms. Collins, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Flake, Mr.          Graham, Mr. Isakson, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Lee, Mr.          Nelson, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Brown, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr.          Hoeven, and Mr. Cochran):   S. 1693. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to clarify  that section 230 of that Act does not prohibit the enforcement against  providers and users of interactive computer services of Federal and  State criminal and civil law relating to sex trafficking; to the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
