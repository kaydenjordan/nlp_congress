 Mr. President, I spoke on the Neil Gorsuch nomination  [[Page S2349]]  last week, and I intend to speak on it again tomorrow. Let me just say  that I support Neil Gorsuch as the nominee to the Supreme Court. He is  a good man. He is a mainstream jurist, incredibly qualified. I am happy  to strongly support him for the Court.                               Opioid Epidemic    Tonight, Mr. President, I want to talk about another issue, one that  I hope can continue to bring us together here in this body and also  bring our country together. I rise today to talk about what a lot of  experts say is the worst drug crisis in the history of our great  country--the worst. It is the opioid epidemic. This is the addiction to  heroin, prescription drugs, synthetic heroins like fentanyl. The newest  threat, this synthetic fentanyl, is coming into our communities from  other countries, particularly China.   There are laboratories in China where evil scientists are putting  together these concoctions and sending them through the U.S. mail  system into our communities.   China is doing it on a scale that is devastating to our communities.  As a result, I have urged President Trump to prioritize this issue in  his meeting with President Xi in Florida later this week. China has  banned one synthetic form of heroin, carfentanil, recently, but there  is a lot more to do. I am urging President Trump to make it clear to  President Xi that we will do everything we need to do to keep this  poison out of our communities.   This epidemic is affecting every single one of the States represented  here in this body. I know the Presiding Officer knows that because I  know he has been involved in his own State. It is affecting your home  town, whoever you are and wherever you are in the United States.  Unfortunately, it is affecting people you probably know.   Every day we are now losing 144 Americans to drug overdoses, most of  which are from overdoses of opioids. That is one American life lost  every 12 minutes. That will be about the length of this speech. Look at  your watch. In the next hour, five Americans will die of a drug  overdose.   I have been working on this issue for a long time. I first got  involved over 20 years ago when I was in the House of Representatives  and a constituent came to me because her son had died of a combination  of smoking dope and huffing gasoline. She came to me and said: What are  you doing about it?   I was ready. I talked to her about the fact that we had $15 billion  devoted to interdicting drugs and incarcerating people and so on.   She said: What are you doing to help me and my community? I have gone  to my church. They are in denial. I have gone to the school, and they  say it is not a problem here. I have gone to my neighbors, and they  won't come together and talk about it.   So we got involved in this issue, and I set up our own community  coalition back in my home town of Cincinnati and chaired that for 9  years. I am still very involved with that group, but I also got  involved with legislation to try to do things to actually reduce the  demand for drugs, because that is so important.   Here we are again. The crisis we had then was mostly crack cocaine,  marijuana. Then it was methamphetamines, bath salts. But I have never  seen anything like this. This is the worst. If you don't think it is  the worst drug crisis we have ever faced, then think about this. Look  at this chart of drug overdose deaths in America.   Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death--the  leading cause--in my home State of Ohio, and probably in your State and  in our country. This is from 2015, the most recent year for which we  have complete data. Nearly two-thirds of the deaths were because of the  prescription painkiller heroin-fentanyl issue, or synthetic forms of  heroin.   Drug overdoses are not now just the leading cause of death. Overdoses  kill more Americans than guns do. This next chart will show that,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more  Americans died from drug overdoses in 2015 than died from HIV/AIDS at  the height of that epidemic. The peak of the AIDS epidemic was 1995.  This is 2015 with regard to drug overdoses.   According to an article in the New York Times, more than four times  as many people are dying every day from this epidemic than were dying  at the peak of the crack epidemic. In the last 3 years, more Americans  have died of drug overdoses than died in the Vietnam war.   Unfortunately, we have reasons to believe that this crisis is getting  worse, not better. According to recent figures, fatal overdoses due to  prescription painkillers, heroin, or synthetic heroin in 2016 alone  went up 26 percent in Connecticut, 35 percent in Delaware, and 39  percent in Maine. During the first three quarters of 2016, deaths from  overdoses in Maryland increased 62 percent. In Ohio they increased 20  percent the last 2 years in a row.   So we have seen this huge spike here in deaths from overdoses,  starting in about 2010 and going up. This is with regard to heroin.  This is with regard to non-methadone synthetic opioids--in other words,  fentanyl, carfentanil, U4, and other synthetic heroins.   This is a crisis. It is one that, unfortunately, is affecting every  single community--whether you are in an urban, suburban, or rural  community, whether you are young or old, regardless of your walk in  life.    The issue, of course, is much bigger than just the tragedy of  overdose deaths. It is also about people whose lives have gotten off  track because of these drugs and because of the addiction. There are  200,000 people in Ohio alone who are living with an addiction to these  drugs. By the way, if you are addicted, you are much more likely to be  committing crimes, fraud, and theft to pay for that habit.   In my State of Ohio--and I will bet in your State--the No. 1 cause of  crime is opioids. A lot of these people have lost a job or can't get a  job. I talked to some business folks over the weekend in Ohio who  talked about regulations and taxes. They said: You know, this drug  issue is affecting every single one of us. We can't get people to pass  a drug test. We have employees who are now addicted to prescription  drugs or heroin and their absenteeism and inability to come to work is  affecting our economy.   So this is something that is affecting all of us. Of course, many  have broken relationships with their families and their loved ones. I  cannot tell you the number of people who have told me, and I have  probably met with 1,000 addicts or recovering addicts over the last few  years. I can't tell you how many people have told me: Drugs became  everything, and I pushed my family out, and pushed my friends out, and  pushed my job away, and it left me in a situation where I was broken.   But living without hope is something that we can deal with, because  there are ways for us to get people into treatment and to get people  into recovery to help them. We are in a crisis. Some have asked me:  Well, how did we get here? That is usually a good start to this: How do  we get out of it? How did we get here is complicated. But according to  the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions, those who are addicted  to prescription painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to  heroin.   Let me look at this a different way. Four out of five heroin addicts  started with prescription drugs. So this issue of prescription drugs,  overprescribing, is a huge part of how this happened in the first  place. Increasingly, what we have seen in all of our States is  addiction starting with these drugs and then switching to cheaper and  more accessible heroin, and then switching again to sometimes more  powerful forms of heroin like carfentanil, maybe 30 to 50 times more  powerful than heroin. That is what is taking so many lives at such an  alarming pace. The epidemic started with overprescribing. The United  States uses more prescription pain killers than any other country in  the world. It is not even close. Look at these numbers here. This is  the daily opioid dose for over a million people. Look at the United  States as compared to every other country in the world.   This is using 2014 data, and the numbers may have gotten better  because of the work being done to cut back on painkillers. But  according to the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, we  consume nearly 70 percent in this country--5 percent of the world's  population and nearly 70 percent of the world's painkillers.   In 2012, that number was 75 percent. It is still not even close on a  per-person basis. For every American, there are 50  [[Page S2350]]  pain pills in this country, and second place is Canada with 30 pain  pills.   According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, painkiller  prescription sales nearly quadrupled from just 1999 to 2014. That  number finally peaked in 2012, by the way, and since then has come down  slightly. In 2012, there were more prescriptions for painkillers in  Ohio than there were people in Ohio. There were more prescriptions for  painkillers--not pills, prescriptions--than there were people in Ohio.  By the way, that was also true in 11 other States.   Fortunately in Ohio, we have made some progress under the leadership  of Governor Kasich, Lieutenant Governor Taylor, Attorney General  DeWine, and the State legislature. They have taken some important steps  to cut back on painkiller prescriptions. We have cut them back by about  one-fifth, about 20 percent since they peaked in 2012, but that number  is still way too high. According to the Ohio Board of Pharmacy, 631  million pain pills were prescribed to Ohioans last year. We are also  still dealing with the consequences of a lot of the addictions that got  started in 2011, 2010, or before.   The number of prescriptions has risen, just as the addiction to  opioids has risen. Drug cartels have followed this prescription drug  epidemic, bringing in heroin. Those drug cartels flooded my State and  probably a lot flooded a lot of your States with this cheaper, more  accessible heroin, now synthetic heroin.   According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Mexican heroin  production alone increased sixfold in just 4 years--from eight metric  tons in 2005 to 50 metric tons in 2009. That number is now 70 metric  tons, and it just keeps rising.   According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, here in this  country, Mexican opium poppy planting increased by 64 percent just from  2014 to 2015. So it is getting worse, not better.   According to the Congressional Research Service, virtually all of the  heroin produced in Mexico is consumed here in the United States of  America.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heroin  use among young people has doubled in the last decade, among young  people 18 to 25 years old.   This affects all of us. It knows no ZIP Code. It certainly knows no  walk of life.   Since 2010, heroin overdose deaths have doubled among Hispanic  Americans, African Americans, Native Americans, and Whites.   A lot of the people who are addicted to prescription drugs have  switched to heroin instead. Now we are seeing that heroin addicts are  switching also, even if they don't know they are doing it. They are  switching to fentanyl and carfentanil. Again, it could be up to 50  times more powerful than heroin. Sometimes they don't know it because  the traffickers are sprinkling the fentanyl in other drugs--heroin, of  course, but also, we know now, cocaine. They are mixing it with  marijuana, mixing it with other drugs, and not letting people know.   We had a 14-year-old girl recently die in Dayton, OH. She was with  her friends, snorting what she was told was heroin. She had done it  before. But this was fentanyl, and it killed her instantly.   More than 1,000 Ohioans were killed by fentanyl in 2015--more than  double the previous year and more than 10 times the number in 2013. In  Cleveland, for example, there have been more overdoses from fentanyl in  the past 10 months than there had been in the past 10 years. In  Columbus, there have already been half as many fentanyl overdoses in  the first 3 months of this year as there were all of last year. This is  why I say fentanyl is the new risk, the new danger.   As one father who lost his son to an overdose told me: Every time you  engage in taking drugs, you are playing Russian roulette because you  don't know what is in it.   In my hometown of Cincinnati, fentanyl deaths now surpass heroin  deaths. Drug overdose deaths in Cincinnati increased by 40 percent from  2014 to 2015. Over that same timeframe, in just 1 year, heroin  overdoses increased 12 percent, while fentanyl overdose deaths  increased 153 percent. These numbers are very disturbing. They are  discouraging, too, because it seems like we just can't turn the tide.  It is easy to feel as though we just can't do anything, that we are  paralyzed, but there is actually a lot we can do to help, and we can  and should.   Here in the Senate, we have already taken some very important steps  in the last year. About 9 months ago, we passed legislation called the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA. Last year, we passed  the 21st Century Cures Act. Those two together provide much more  funding for this issue. The Cures Act alone is $500 million more this  year going back to the States to provide funding primarily for  treatment for this increase in overdose deaths. There will be $500  million authorized again next year. We have to be sure that gets into  the appropriations bill.   We also have seen, I think much more importantly in a way, through  the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--separate legislation-- that we are beginning to fund directly programs that work. We spent 3  years looking around the country and had five conferences here in  Washington, DC. We brought experts in from all over the country who  told us what the best practices were. What is the best prevention  technique that is working? How do we get kids not to make these  decisions? What is the best thing that is happening in terms of  treatment, and then longer term recovery, what works and what doesn't  work. Is medication-assisted treatment better? Is it better? Does it  rely more on longer term recovery? Have they had more success there?   All of this has led us to put together this legislation, the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, that actually funds programs  like drug courts that are working around the country. They take people,  diverting them from prison, and say: As long as you stay clean, you can  stay out of jail, because you are a user, you are not a pusher. But you  have to stay clean.   Then they provide them alternatives, including using drugs that  reduce the cravings. If you reduce the craving for opioids, that is  proving to be very, very successful in some cases. Dimitrol is the drug  they use mostly in Ohio to do that. There are some great examples of  people who have gone through the drug court process who have now been  clean for a few years. They are back to work. They are back with their  families. They are back as contributing members of society. So there is  hope. We have seen how it can work.   CARA is the first legislation Congress ever passed to promote long- term recovery. Why? Because we have looked around the country and had  experts here. We figured out that the treatment programs are important,  and before that, the detox program is important. But what is leading to  more success is longer term recovery programs.   As an example, think about being in detox for a week and then maybe a  couple weeks in a treatment program and then going into a sober housing  arrangement where you have regular meetings, where you are getting  support from fellow recovering addicts. That seems to work longer. You  are there. It seems to work better for most Americans.   Unfortunately, we do not have all of CARA's legislation fully  implemented yet. Only three of its eight programs have been  implemented. It has been a while. It has been about 9 months. It is  time to push all of those programs.   I pushed the Obama administration on this. I am now pushing the Trump  administration. Last week, I was delighted that the Trump  administration announced the creation of a commission on the opioid  epidemic, led by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has a real  passion for this issue. I commend the President and Governor Christie  for their commitment to making progress on the issue. Their leadership  and their partnership with Congress will make a difference.   Today I talked to General Kelly, the new Secretary of Homeland  Security. He is going to be on the commission. He said they are going  to report about the problem within 90 days. We know a lot about the  problem. We also have to be sure we are seeing some action.   What I would suggest today is that the administration work hard to  implement the remaining five CARA grant programs that are not yet up  and running. For example, it has been 8 months, almost 9 months, since  CARA  [[Page S2351]]  was signed into law. Yet we still don't have the grant for naloxone up  and running. Our States and local communities need this Narcan on the  street to save people's lives, because this is a miracle drug that  reverses the effects of an overdose, but we also need to get more  training for some of our first responders so they can administer it  more effectively, which is particularly more important right now with  this new drug, the fentanyl, the synthetic drug coming in, because  synthetic heroin requires sometimes not one, not two but four or five  uses of Narcan--maybe more--to save someone's life. So our first  responders are asking for this help.   We still don't have the grant for medication-assisted treatment up  and running. We still don't have the grant for pregnant and postpartum  women's treatment providers up and running. This will help to ensure we  have fewer babies who are born with this addiction. Let's get going on  these.   For all of us here in Congress, let's be sure that we fully fund  CARA. It is $182 million a year, every year, in addition to what we  were spending on opioids. We need to be sure that funding is there,  that these programs are working, and that our communities begin to get  more of the help they need. These evidence-based programs that work are  what we ought to be supporting, and that is exactly what the  legislation does.   I thank Vice President Pence, who was in Ohio on Saturday. It was a  meeting about the economic issues we faced as a country. He talked  about tax reform and regulations and skills training, but he also  talked about this issue. I think it is important that we are all  talking about this issue back home and raising awareness hopefully to  save lives, to keep people from going down this path but also to ensure  that our fellow citizens know the importance of Congress and State  legislatures and local communities getting engaged with it all.  Everyone must get involved.    I was in Youngstown, OH, on Friday, and I held a roundtable at the  Neil Kennedy Recovery Center. This is one of the first programs of its  kind in the country. It started in the late 1940s. It focused more at  that time on alcoholism. Executive Director Carolyn Givens was there  with her staff. They are incredibly compassionate people. She told me a  lot of stories.   I was able to meet with some of the recovering addicts at the center.  One told me his name was Michael. He told me that center saved his  life. It saved his life. This is a guy who worked for years at utility  companies. He is a skilled worker. He got involved with prescription  drugs because of an accident or an injury, and then he ended up moving  to heroin, which was cheaper and more accessible. Then he found his  life spinning out of control. Now he is there, and he is getting back  on track.   Everybody, by the way, at the roundtable who was there--the staff and  community leaders who were involved--they all said: Get this  legislation implemented. We need it.   On Friday afternoon, I went to Cleveland and toured the St. Vincent  Charity Medical Center with addiction specialist Dr. Ted Parren. What  an amazing guy he is. This is in a hospital setting where they have a  detox unit and a treatment center, which is very unusual. I think it is  the only one of its kind in Cleveland, and it is one of a few in the  country where, within a hospital setting, these people are getting  everything they need. It is a very comprehensive approach. They deal  with mental health issues, of course, but also other physical issues  people have, and it is helpful to have it all together there at that  center. I thank the sisters for what they are doing because they are  supporting this, and sometimes it is quite expensive to have a  treatment program. At St. Vincent's, they are doing an awesome job.   Everyone there told me the same thing that I hear across Ohio--that  their services have, unfortunately, never been in greater demand. They  have a waiting list. They say the situation is getting worse, not  better. I think that is true in your State, too, because according to  the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, SAMHSA, 9 out of  10 of the 22 million Americans who are suffering from addiction are not  getting the treatment they need--9 out of 10. CARA and the Cures Act  will help change that.   People need to change that in their own hearts. They need to step  forward and seek the treatment they need. We need to take away the  stigma of addiction because it is an illness. We need to treat it as an  illness because that would help people come forward, admit they have a  problem, and get the treatment they need. Their families and their  communities are desperate for that to happen. CARA and Cures will help  change all that.   I applaud my colleagues here, Republican and Democrat alike, for  moving forward on this legislation over the last year, but there is a  lot more work to do. We should continue to address the underlying issue  of overprescribing. It started this epidemic in the first place. We  talked about the number of prescriptions that are still out there.   Last week, I joined with my colleague Senator Amy Klobuchar to  introduce bipartisan legislation called the Prescription Drug  Monitoring Act to keep better track of prescription painkillers, keep  them out of the wrong hands, and identify an addiction as early as  possible so that it can be treated.   This goes to the pharmacist. You will have to report when someone  gets a pain pill prescription. They have to put it on the Prescription  Drug Monitoring Program.   It goes to doctors. They have to be sure that when they are  prescribing medication, that that is part of the drug monitoring  program. They have to access the drug monitoring program before they  give a prescription to be sure the person isn't filling the  prescription with them that they have already filled somewhere else.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of that abuse still out there. Sometimes  it is across State lines, which is why Federal legislation is required.  Our legislation requires that States work better together to ensure  that the Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs are talking to each  other.   By the way, if people don't do this under our legislation--the  pharmacists, the doctors, and the States--then they have their Federal  funding pulled back that we talked about earlier on the CARA  legislation.   If you see a sign of addiction starting, our legislation requires  that you let the patient's doctor know that so we can begin to identify  the people who have an addiction and get them the treatment they need.   I think this is going to be a good bill because it will lead to a  smarter and more effective use of taxpayer dollars, and more  importantly, of course, it is going to prevent a lot of new addictions  from starting in the first place. That, of course, would save lives.   Congress can also do something else that is really important, and  that is to give law enforcement better tools to be able to keep some of  this poison out of our communities. So the prevention and the treatment  and the recovery and Narcan for our first responders--they are all very  important, but let's also keep some of this out. Let's do a better job  of stopping the heroin at the southern border. Let's do a better job of  stopping the fentanyl, which is this new synthetic heroin we are  talking about that is causing so many overdoses and deaths. Let's do a  better job of keeping that out.   This should be a no-brainer, in my view, because it is coming in  through the U.S. mail system. We know this. All the studies show this.  Most of these synthetic drugs are being made in labs in China, and they  are shipped by mail to traffickers in the United States, sometimes to  Mexico as well. Typically that is done through the Postal Service. Why?  Because the private carriers like UPS or FedEx or DHL and others  require, when you ship something, that you have advance information  provided to the Customs and Border Protection and to others as to where  the package is from, what is in it, where it is going. The post office  doesn't require that. Is it any wonder that traffickers are using the  Postal Service rather than one of these private carriers?    Law enforcement came to us and told us that they could use this  data--it is electronic data provided up front--because that would  enable them to determine the suspect packages. Of the millions of  packages that come into our country, they have to know how to find that  needle in the haystack. That is why they want the ability to find these  [[Page S2352]]  packages, to scan these packages, and to be able to stop some of this  poison that is coming into our communities.   The legislation we have with regard to this issue is called the STOP  Act. I recently introduced it again this year with Senator Klobuchar,  Senator Rubio, Senator Hassan, and many others here in the Chamber. It  is a bipartisan bill, called the Synthetic Trafficking and Overdose  Prevention Act, or the STOP Act. It closes this loophole we talked  about within the Postal Service and requires the post office to obtain  advanced electronic data on packages before they cross our borders,  just like the private carriers have to do.   It is not a new idea, by the way. In 2002, Congress placed this  requirement on private carriers. That is when it started. It also  required that the post office review this and look into this. So, in  2002, this Congress was smart enough to say: This seems to make sense.  Let's require the post office to look into it. We have seen the  results. The results are that traffickers stay away from the private  carriers because they know they can use the Postal Service and get away  with it.   Traffickers are lacing the heroin on the streets of America with  these synthetic drugs to make them stronger and more addictive. They  are getting more people addicted. Fentanyl is also so powerful that it  only takes a couple of milligrams--the equivalent of a pinch of salt-- to kill you. They say that three flakes can kill you. The fact that  heroin is now being laced with fentanyl, of course, makes it much more  likely for you not only to have an overdose, because of the strength of  this synthetic heroin, but also that you will die from that overdose.  Again, it is much harder to use Narcan and to begin to save lives by  using that and to reverse the effects of the overdose.   So the STOP Act, to me, again, is something that we definitely ought  to do in this Chamber. It would restrict the supply of these dangerous  drugs, raise the prices of these drugs, and would make them harder to  get. That is going to save lives.   Support for the STOP Act is growing. Our bill has now been endorsed  by the Fraternal Order of Police and by the Major County Sheriffs of  America. They are convinced that this tool will work. Last Friday, I  was in Columbus, OH. I met with Franklin County deputy sheriff Rick  Minerd, also the deputy chief of the Columbus Police, Mike Woods. We  had the Cincinnati and Columbus directors of the Customs and Border  Patrol--the chiefs--there to talk about it, and we had the Drug  Enforcement Agency's special agents in charge there with us. We also  had people who were on the investigative side of the Customs and Border  Patrol. The deputy attorney general of Ohio was there, Steve Schumaker,  and others. All of these law enforcement people said: Give us this  legislation. It is a tool that we need.   We had a hearing today on the Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Committee, and General Kelly was there. He is the new Secretary  of Homeland Security. He agreed with me that the STOP Act would ``help  [Customs] officers target illegal shipments . . . reduce the ability  for the post office to be used for the illicit shopping of all kinds of  contraband . . . [and] be helpful to be able to identify packages'' of  synthetic drugs. He is right. We need the administration's help and  push for this legislation as well. Let's get this done.   President Trump, by the way, endorsed this idea last year when he  said during the campaign:         We will close the shipping loopholes to China that others       are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders and       into the hands of our own Postal Service. These traffickers       use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and       other drugs to users and dealers in the United States. [The]       Trump administration will crack down on this abuse and give       law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this       mission.    Let's get it done.   Again, I have asked President Trump to raise this issue with  President Xi Jinping because China can do a lot more to try to shut  down these laboratories in China, to try to stop some of the materials  that are coming into the laboratories that make up this fentanyl. By  the way, it is in China's interest to do so.   I have received information recently that there is leakage. What does  that mean? That means that some of this fentanyl is going out to the  countryside, to the suburbs of China, and to the cities of China, and  it is affecting their population.   This legislation already has a companion bill in the House. So this  is not an issue in which the Senate can act and then we cannot get it  through the process because we cannot get it through the House and the  Senate. Pat Tiberi and Richard Neal have introduced companion  legislation--Tiberi, a Republican from Ohio, and Neal, a Democrat from  Massachusetts. It is bipartisan. It is the kind of legislation that  should draw bipartisan support, and we should get it done.   Is it a silver bullet? No, we do not have a silver bullet. There is  not one silver bullet. There is a comprehensive approach here, and  these two bills that I have talked about are new steps that we should  take.   I urge my colleagues to continue to support the CARA legislation.  Let's provide full funding. Let's support the Cures legislation in the  upcoming appropriations process. Let's continue to engage the good  folks back home who are trying, at the tip of the spear, to do all that  they can in terms of providing better treatment opportunities and  longer term recoveries and who are going into our schools and talking  about prevention so as to do all we can to keep people from going into  that funnel of addiction.   Let's pass this legislation. Join us in keeping better track of  painkiller prescriptions so that potentially addictive drugs do not end  up in the wrong hands and so that addictions get treated early. That  legislation is important.   Join me and join the 10 other Senators in pushing back against  poisonous synthetic heroin, which is coming into our communities, by  supporting the STOP Act as a cosponsor so that we can get this bill to  the floor and get it to the President for his signature.   I believe these two pieces of legislation, if allowed on the floor,  will pass overwhelmingly. I believe the President would sign them. Most  importantly, I believe they would begin to save lives in the  communities we all represent.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support  again for Judge Neil Gorsuch. I spoke on the floor the other day about  Judge Gorsuch. I just heard my colleague from Georgia talk about him,  and he did a terrific job.   This guy, Neil Gorsuch, is the right person for the job. He is  qualified. He is smart and he is fair, and a bipartisan majority of the  Senate will vote for this worthy candidate tomorrow. Let me underscore  that. A bipartisan majority of the Senate will vote for this worthy  candidate tomorrow. He will end up getting on the Court.   I must tell you that I regret that some of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle refused to provide him that up-or-down vote without  going through the process we had to go through today. As someone who  has gone through two Senate confirmations myself, I know they are not  always easy. But I will tell you, it is a whole lot better for this  institution and our country when we figure out ways to work together-- in this case, to continue a Senate tradition of allowing up-or-down  votes.   I like to work across the aisle. I have done that through my career.  I can point to 50 bills I authored or co-authored that have become law  in the last 6 years. They were bipartisan, by definition, because they  got through this body and were signed into law by President Obama. I  have voted for President Obama's nominees before President Trump. When  President Obama had a well-qualified judge here on the floor, I voted  for that judge. I voted for Loretta Lynch. That was not an easy vote. I  took heat for it back home because I thought she was well-qualified. I  think that is what we ought to do in this body.   I am disappointed in the situation we are in. I think we could have  followed more than 200 years of Senate tradition and not allowed for a  partisan filibuster to try to block this nomination. We chose not to do  that in this body. Never in the history of this body has there been a  successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court judge--never. Some of  my colleagues said: How about Abe Fortas? That was several decades ago,  and that was bipartisan. Abe Fortas was a Supreme Court Justice who had  some ethics issues, and he actually dropped out of trying to get the  nomination because of it. But never have we stood up as Republicans--or  stood up as Democrats--and blocked a nominee by using the filibuster.  It has just not been the tradition.   Instead, it has been to allow an up-or-down vote--a majority vote.  There are two Justices on the Supreme Court right now who got confirmed  with less than 60 votes. One is Clarence Thomas--probably the most  controversial nominee in the last couple of decades, I would say. I  wasn't in the Senate then, but I was watching it, as many of you were.  It was certainly controversial, yet he got to the Court with 52 votes.  Justice Alito was confirmed by 58 votes only 10 years ago. So these  nominees were not filibustered.   By the way, President Obama's nominees, Elena Kagan and Justice  Sotomayor, were not filibustered by Republicans. They were given an up- or-down vote. In the history of the Senate, 12 nominations have been  defeated on the floor, but, again, never a successful partisan  filibuster. Even Judge Robert Bork--some of you remember that  nomination. It was very controversial. His nomination was defeated in  1987. He was a Reagan appointee. But he wasn't filibustered. They had  an up-or-down vote, and he was voted down.   So what are these objections to Judge Gorsuch that would rise to that  level where we want to say that over 200 years of Senate tradition  ought to  [[Page S2416]]  be shunted aside and we ought to stop this man? What are those  objections? I must say that I have listened to the floor debate and  talked to some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I made  my case. They made their case. I just don't see why this man is not  qualified. He was a law clerk for two Supreme Court Justices. He served  in the Justice Department and had a distinguished career there. He was  also a successful lawyer in the private sector. And of course, he has  been a Federal judge for a decade. So we can look at his record.   My colleague from Georgia just talked about that record. It is why  the American Bar Association--a group not known to be a conservative  body--decided that he was ``well qualified.'' They unanimously declared  him to get their highest rating of ``well qualified.'' This is what  they said about him. They said:         Based on the writings, interviews, and analyses we       scrutinized to reach our rating, we discerned that Judge       Gorsuch believes strongly in the independence of the judicial       branch of government, and we predict that he will be a strong       but respectful voice in protecting it.    That is why the American Bar Association gave him their highest  rating. Not qualified? By the way, nobody objected--nobody--for any  reason, to his nomination to serve as a Federal judge, to be a circuit  court judge, a level right below the Supreme Court, back in 2006. Not a  single Senator objected. By the way, those Senators included Senator  Hillary Clinton, Senator Barack Obama, Senator Joe Biden, and a number  of Senators, of course, who are still here today with us, who chose to  filibuster this nomination. So I don't know.    I heard some of my colleagues talk about some of his decisions. They  have picked one or two of his decisions as judge over the past 10 years  and said they didn't like the outcome, and that is why he is not  qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. I have a couple of concerns with  that argument. One, Judge Gorsuch has decided over 2,700 cases. I am  sure we can all find one or two of these we didn't like. That is true  for any judge. As I said, I voted for a number of President Obama's  nominees, and I voted against others based on the merits and based on  their qualifications. It didn't mean I agreed with them--trust me--or  disagreed with them on everything. The odds are very good that you  agree with Judge Gorsuch's decisions a lot more than you disagree with  them. You know why I say that? Because the odds are really good that  you agreed with them. Let's try 97 percent, because 97 percent is the  number of his decisions that were unanimous with the other judges on a  three-judge panel. So 97 percent of the time, his decisions were  unanimous.   Who is on these three-judge panels? Well, it is usually bipartisan in  the sense that it is nominees who have been nominated by different  Presidents of different parties. In the case of his circuit court,  there is Judge Paul Kelly, who was appointed by President George H.W.  Bush. There have also been several of his colleagues who were appointed  by President Bill Clinton. Judge Gorsuch even mentioned in his  testimony that he was on judge panels. He presided with Judge William  Holloway, who was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. So these  three-judge panels tend to have judges that were appointed by  Republicans and Democrats alike--97 percent of the time unanimous. And  98 percent of the time, his decisions were in the majority.   So again, I think the odds are pretty good that we are going to agree  with Judge Gorsuch a lot more than we disagree when we look at his  cases. He is a consensus builder. He is a guy who figures out how to  come to a decision people agree with on different sides of the aisle,  and from different points of view. That is what his record his.  Actually, that doesn't surprise me at all, because he clerked in the  Supreme Court for two Justices. One was Byron White and the other was  Justice Anthony Kennedy. Those are two Justices who get a lot of heat.  Byron White did, and Anthony Kennedy does--from both sides. Why?  Because they tend to be in the middle. They write a lot of decisions  that are consensus decisions. They tend to be that fifth vote on a 5- to-4 decision. That is whom he clerked for.   To note that somehow this guy shouldn't be confirmed for the Supreme  Court because of one or two decisions just doesn't seem to be  legitimate to me. This is a guy who had thousands of decisions, and the  vast majority were 98 percent or 97 percent unanimous. He had one  decision that was appealed to the Supreme Court because the litigants  must have thought he was wrong. They took it to the Supreme Court to  correct him. What happened? The Supreme Court affirmed it. They agreed  with Judge Gorsuch.   I don't know whom you could find out there among judges who has a  stronger record. In every case, somebody wins and somebody loses. I get  that. Think about this: Out of Judge Gorsuch's 180 written opinions,  only one has ever been appealed to the Supreme Court--wow. And they  agreed with his ruling.   He made it clear he makes decisions not based on the outcome he  likes, but based on what the law says. He thinks his job on the court  for the last decade--and going forward--is to actually look at the law  and decide what the law says and what the Constitution provides, not  what he wants.   I think that is the kind of judge we would want--particularly those  of us who are lawmakers, right? We are the ones writing the laws. We  would hope that would be respected and that judges wouldn't try to  legislate. This is what he said in his testimony:         A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a       bad judge . . . I have watched my colleagues spend long days       worrying over cases. Sometimes the answers we reach aren't       ones we would personally prefer. Sometimes the answers follow       us home and keep us up at night. But the answers we reach are       always the ones we believe the law requires.    Interesting perspective. He is saying: Hey, if you like all your  decisions, you are probably not a very good judge because your personal  beliefs aren't always going to be consistent with what the law says or  the Constitution says.   He goes on to say:         I've ruled for disabled students, for prisoners, for the       accused, for workers alleging civil rights violations, and       for undocumented immigrants. Sometimes, too, I've ruled       against such persons. My decisions have never reflected a       judgment about the people before me, only a judgment of the       law and the facts at issue in each particular case.    Again, it seems to me that is the kind of person you want on the  court. Making a decision as a judge is not about ruling in favor or  against somebody because you like them or don't like them. It is about  applying what the law says. As he said in his testimony recently, his  philosophy is ``to strive to understand what the words on the page mean  . . . [to] apply what the people's representatives, the lawmakers, have  done.'' That is us. That is the House. That is people who are elected  back home by the people who expect us to be the elected representatives  and to listen to their concerns and then vote. Those laws should not be  rewritten by the judiciary. That is the approach he takes. I would  think any legislator would want to ensure the laws we pass are applied  as written. Much more importantly, that is what people want too. That  is what people should insist on. We want our votes to count. We want  our voices to be heard.    President Lincoln warned in his first inaugural address that if  judges legislate from the bench, ``the people will have ceased to be  their own rulers.''   ``The people will have ceased to be their own rulers'' if judges  legislate from the bench.   I think President Lincoln was right. When judges become legislators,  the people do have less of a voice. Judge Gorsuch himself summed it up.  He said: ``If judges were just secret legislators, declaring not what  the law is but what they would like it to be, the very idea of  government by the people and for the people would be at risk.'' I think  that is the deeper issue here.   Again, I think he is the kind of judge we should want. Judge Gorsuch  and I had the chance to sit down and talk about this philosophy. We  talked about his background and his qualifications. I asked him some  very tough questions, as he got asked during the Judiciary Committee  nomination process. His hearings were something that all Americans had  the opportunity to watch. He did a great job, in my view, because he  did focus on how he believes that his job is not to allow his personal  beliefs to guide him but, rather, upholding the law as written and the  Constitution.  [[Page S2417]]    I think that approach is a big reason he has earned the respect of  lawyers and judges from across the spectrum, by the way. If you look at  the people who say this guy is a great judge, it goes all the way  across the political spectrum.   Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, an advisor to former  President Obama, said Judge Gorsuch is ``a brilliant, terrific guy who  would do the Court's work with distinction.'' Those of you who know  Laurence Tribe, he is well-regarded, considered to be a liberal thinker  on many issues. But he has looked at the guy, and he has looked at his  record. He knows him. He says he is brilliant, terrific, and will do  the Court's work with distinction.   Neal Katyal--you have heard about him. He was the Acting Solicitor  General for President Obama, a guy who knows a thing or two about  arguing before the Supreme Court. He said Judge Gorsuch's record  ``should give the American people confidence that he will not  compromise principle to favor the President who appointed him. . . .  He's a fair and decent man.''   This goes to what the ABA said about him: Independent. He will  protect the independence of the judiciary.   Look, he is smart, no question about it. You saw him answer those  questions. You have seen his record. He is qualified, as we talked  about. He is certainly a mainstream judge, when you look at his  opinions--98 percent of the time in the majority, 97 percent of the  time unanimous. Three-judge panels. He has the support--the bipartisan  support--of a majority of the Senate.   By the way, the American people, as they have plugged into this, also  think he ought to be confirmed. There is a recent poll by the  Huffington Post, which is not considered a conservative newspaper or  entity. They said the people want us to confirm Neil Gorsuch by a 17- point margin. Why? Because they watched this. They looked at the guy.  They saw the hearings. They looked at his record. People believe he is  the right person to represent them on the Supreme Court.   So, again, while I am disappointed this process has become so  polarized and divisive here in this body, I am glad to see this good  man take a seat in our Nation's highest Court. I believe he deserves  our support.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.                            ____________________
