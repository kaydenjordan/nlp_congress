 Mr. President, I send a question to the desk for both  parties.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin sends a  question for both counsel for the former President and the House  managers.   The clerk will read the question, and the counsel for the former  President will have the first 2\1/2\ minutes.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The House managers assert that the January 6 attack was       predictable, and it was foreseeable. If so, why did it appear       that law enforcement at the Capitol were caught off guard and       unable to prevent the breach? Why did the House Sergeant at       Arms reportedly turn down a request to activate the National       Guard, stating that he was not comfortable with the optics?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Counsel for the former President is  recognized.   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Would you read the question again, please?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the question again.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The House managers assert that the January 6 attack was       predictable, and it was foreseeable. If so, why did it appear       that law enforcement at the Capitol were caught off guard and       unable to prevent the breach? Why did the House Sergeant at       Arms reportedly turn down a request to activate the National       Guard, stating that he was not comfortable with the optics?    Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Holy cow. That is a really good question.   Had the House managers done their investigation, maybe somebody would  have an answer to that, but they didn't. They did zero investigation.  They did nothing. They looked into nothing. They read newspaper  articles. They talked to their friends--you know, a TV reporter or  something or something or another.   But, Jiminy Cricket, there is no due process in this proceeding at  all, and that question highlights the problem. When you have no due  process, you have no clear-cut answers, but we do know that there was,  I think, a certain level of foreseeability. It looks like, from the  information they were presenting, some law enforcement knew that  something could be happening.   In my presentation, we knew that the mayor, 2 days before--before-- had been offered to have Federal troops or National Guard deployed,  beef up security here, and Capitol Police. It was offered. So somebody  had to have an inkling of something. My question is, Who ignored it and  why? If an investigation were done, we would know the answer to that  too.   Thank you.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House managers have 2\1/2\ minutes.   Ms. Manager PLASKETT. First, if defense counsel has exculpatory  evidence, you are welcome to give it to us. We would love to see it.  You have had an opportunity to give us evidence that would exculpate  the President. Haven't seen it yet.   Everyone--the defense counsel wants to blame everyone else except the  person who was most responsible for what happened on January 6, and  that is President Trump, Donald Trump. He is the person who foresaw  this the most because he had the reports; he had access to the  information. He, as well, had--we all know how he is an avid cable news  watcher. He knew what was going to happen. He cultivated these  individuals. These are the undisputed facts.   The National Guard was not deployed until over 2 hours after the  attack. I heard reference to Mayor Bowser in the defense's  presentation. Mayor Bowser does not have authority over the Capitol or  Federal buildings. She could not deploy the National Guard to the  Capitol. That is outside of the jurisdiction of the Mayor of the  District of Columbia.   At no point in that entire day did the President of the United  States, our Commander in Chief, tell anyone--law enforcement struggling  for their lives, insurgents who felt empowered by the sheer quantity of  them, any of us in this building, or the American people--that he was  sending help.   He did not defend the Capitol. The President of the United States did  not defend the Capitol of this country. It is indefensible.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.
