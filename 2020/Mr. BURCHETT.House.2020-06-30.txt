 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on H.R. 2, the INVEST in America Act.   There is no doubt America's roads need repair. The proposal before  us, unfortunately, consists of empty promises and wasteful spending.  [[Page H2930]]    During my tenure as a local elected official, I saw firsthand that  large public works projects can happen without exploding deficits.  While mayor of Knox County in Tennessee, my office leveraged resources  to increase our paving capacity fivefold. It made significant progress  on the largest public works project in county history, all while  continuing to pay down our debt.   These improvements didn't just happen. They required difficult  discussions with a range of local stakeholders, while ensuring fiscal  responsibility.   At almost $1.5 trillion, Mr. Speaker, in spending, this bill doesn't  attempt to find long-term solutions to our highway transportation  needs. Instead, it increases bureaucratic red tape and explodes costs  in a thinly veiled attempt to implement the partisan Green New Deal.   Congress has spent $3 trillion on the COVID-19 virus in recent  months. Simply put, this is unsustainable and is fiscally reckless at a  time like this.   I serve on the House Budget Committee, in which we haven't passed a  budget in quite some time up here, and I am willing to work across the  aisle to find some solutions that put people to work meeting our  Nation's infrastructure needs without crippling future generations with  mounds of debt. That is why this Congress needs to pass a real budget,  Mr. Speaker, instead of piecemeal spending plans and election year  messaging bills like this one.   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 2 and to get back to  work doing real legislating in committees and on this hallowed House  floor.
