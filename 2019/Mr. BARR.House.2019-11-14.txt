 Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to this bill, not  because I believe the Export-Import Bank should not exist under any  circumstances, but because I believe we can produce a better bill, a  bill that would actually help America compete while holding other  nations like China accountable in the global market.    I am concerned that the bill in its current form would actually  enable China's malign activities to the detriment of U.S. national  security.   Now, let me be clear. I supported the compromise bill that Chairwoman  Waters and Ranking Member McHenry negotiated in June, and I compliment  my friend, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry) for his  leadership on this. I recognize the value a reformed Ex-Im Bank can  provide to U.S. businesses.   The new Ex-Im president and chairman, Kimberly Reed, has impressed  me. She visited my district and made clear her commitment to helping  U.S. exporters, including small businesses in Kentucky, compete in the  global market. She also, importantly, committed to reforming the Bank  to abandon Obama-era policies that discriminated against Ex-Im support  of traditional fossil energy and related exports.   But the bill we are debating today cannot be fixed by a strong leader  like Kimberly Reed. It is flawed, it is not the right answer, and we  can and should do better.   Specifically, this bill does not go far enough to combat malign  Chinese influence and China's aspirations to replace the United States  as the preeminent global economic power.                                time  1445    The Communists in Beijing continue to steal our intellectual property  and place their thumb on the scale of global economic competitiveness  by propping up its economy through state-owned enterprises.   Additionally, we see rampant human rights abuses and violent quashing  of freedom seekers in Hong Kong. Over the last 5 months, we have  observed protestors in Hong Kong being shot, beaten, gassed, and  arrested.   My amendment to this bill, which the Rules Committee did not make in  order, would have made Ex-Im assistance to Chinese state-owned  enterprises contingent on their commitment to upholding the Sino- British declaration, which established the ``one country, two systems''  principle that would allow Hong Kong to retain its capitalist system.   In his book ``The Hundred-Year Marathon,'' former senior Defense  Department official Michael Pillsbury details China's strategy to  supplant the United States as the world's dominant power by 2049, the  100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. He said,  ``Only recently have there been disturbing signs that a more  militaristic China may be ascendant, which has caused some to question  the wishful thinking that has prevailed for more than 40 years.''   Unless we take a hard stand and a hard line against China, including  through more powerful restrictions on the Ex-Im Bank's interactions  with Chinese SOEs, we risk ceding our preeminence in a fair and free  global market.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, which will allow  U.S. taxpayer funds to subsidize Chinese ascendency and its Communist  state-owned enterprises and enable China's theft of our intellectual  property, its forced transfer of technology, and its blatant violation  of human rights.   This bill could be better. The Export-Import Bank could help us  combat Chinese growing imports. This bill doesn't do it.
