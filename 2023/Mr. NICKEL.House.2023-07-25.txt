 Mr. Speaker, I recently had the chance to travel with a  bipartisan group of Members of the House of Representatives to Brazil,  Colombia, and Panama.   During our trip, we discussed important issues like immigration,  counterterrorism, trade, and national security.   In Brazil, I learned about the increasing presence of the Chinese  Communist Party from local law enforcement officials.   In Colombia, we discussed efforts to combat illegal drug trafficking.  We met with leading officials on the longstanding, bilateral  relationship between the United States and Colombia.   In Panama, I saw firsthand the challenging conditions faced by  migrants attempting to travel to the United States and live their  American Dream here. I have empathy for the people I met, and this  experience reinforced the importance of addressing immigration with  compassion and respect.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is a shining beacon of democracy, and  I am not surprised that people from all over the world want to come  here. We need to ensure that our borders are secure, that the American  people are safe, and migrants are treated with dignity and fairness.   This was an eye-opening experience that affirmed the need for strong,  smart, and strategic policies that advance our national interests, our  values abroad, and protect our homeland and democracy.   We also must diligently combat the Chinese Communist Party's  increasing presence in the region.   I will continue to closely monitor developments in this area and work  toward a pragmatic approach to foreign policy that puts America's  security first.   Finally, we must take up and pass comprehensive immigration reform. I  am eternally optimistic that we can get something done in this  Congress.   At the end of the day, addressing the situation at the border and  taking up comprehensive immigration reform should not be a Democrat or  Republican issue. The American people deserve more than politics as  usual, and the time for action is now.   Let's work together, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as  Americans to secure our border and advance comprehensive immigration  reform.                            ____________________
