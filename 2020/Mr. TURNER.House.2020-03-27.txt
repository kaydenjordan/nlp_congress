 Mr. Speaker, today, I cast my vote for the coronavirus  relief package. The coronavirus pandemic has affected Americans deeply  in every facet of their lives. Our government has asked, and in Ohio  our governor has ordered, that Americans stay home other than for  essential needs. Our President and Governor's goal has been to keep  Americans safe. This has put a dire strain on our economy. In addition,  our hospitals are having increased costs and decreased revenue. Small  businesses are struggling to make payroll or even stay open. Employees  are being furloughed or laid off. Families are struggling to keep food  on the table and make their mortgage or rent payments.   We must now provide necessary financial relief to families,  individuals, and businesses bearing the burden of the COVID-19 crisis.   I want to thank our health care workers, grocers, law enforcement,  and National Guard for showing up to work, fighting coronavirus on the  frontlines, and keeping our communities safe.
