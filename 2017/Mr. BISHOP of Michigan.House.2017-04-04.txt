 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory  of World War II veteran, noted author, and longtime Eighth  Congressional District resident Donald Burgett, who recently passed  away at the age of 81.   Don was an Army paratrooper, and he participated in the opening  operations of the Normandy invasion with A Company, 506th Parachute  Infantry of the 101st Airborne Division.   After his service, Mr. Burgett published four books, including  ``Currahee!'' published in 1967 and endorsed by President Dwight D.  Eisenhower. Mr. Burgett used his photographic memory to paint vivid  scenes during the chaos of war.   In addition to his writing, he also was an active member of several  veterans organizations, including the VFW, American Legion, Disabled  American Veterans, and the Military Order of the Cooties. He was a  local builder and loved spending time outdoors.   Don is survived by his wife, Twyla, his 5 children, 12 grandchildren,  and 28 great-grandchildren. A memorial is being held for him this week  in his honor in his hometown of Howell, Michigan.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence for this great American  patriot.   May God bless Don and his family.                            ____________________
