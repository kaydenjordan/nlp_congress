 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill,  Insuring Fairness for Family Farmers Act.   Crop insurance is one of the best tools farmers have against bad  weather, natural disasters, and volatile markets. Unfortunately,  specialty crops consistently lag behind commodity crops in coverage  levels, and small farms are less likely than large farms to have crop  insurance.   That is why I am introducing the Insuring Fairness for Family Farmers  Act, a bill that would incentivize crop insurance agents to cover small  and specialty crop farmers like ours in Oregon.   More than 33 percent of all Oregon farms are small farms, compared to  13 percent of farms in the U.S. And my growers have been clear about  the challenges the current system creates for them.   As we write the farm bill, Congress has a rare opportunity and a  responsibility to ensure small family farms have their interest  prioritized by giving them the tools they need to remain in production.   Let's save the family farm.                            ____________________
