 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay respect and  honor to my great teacher, Liane Dougherty. Mrs. Dougherty passed away  on December 5, 2019. She taught me in history class more than 20 years  ago at Poly Prep, where she was a mentor. She is survived by her  husband, Francis, and her children, Max and Sophie.   Her students recall--myself included--that, each and every day, she  would approach the classroom with grace, compassion, incredible wisdom  and intellect. I can say without a doubt, I would not be a Congressman  today without Mrs. Dougherty.   There is only one person in all of America being honored on the floor  of the United States House of Representatives today, and that is Liane  Dougherty. She is deserving of that, the best teacher I could ever ask  for.   Madam Speaker, may she rest in peace. We will always honor her  incredible legacy.                            ____________________
