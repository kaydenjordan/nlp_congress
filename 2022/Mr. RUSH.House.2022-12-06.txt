 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Louie Gohmert, for his  friendship over the past years that we have served together in this  Chamber.   I certainly thank him for his support of the Emmett Till Antilynching  Act that was signed into law by President Biden a few months ago. I  thank Representative Gohmert for his support and for his steadfastness  on that bill.   Mr. Speaker, it is for the final time that I stand in this well on  this floor to commemorate the memory and the legacy of Fred Hampton, my  friend and comrade in the Black Panther Party.   This last Sunday marked 53 years since Chairman Fred was assassinated  by a racist, corrupt Chicago Police Department, which, as a part of the  FBI's COINTELPRO program, the FBI's national counterintelligence  program, without legal authority and in stark violation of the U.S.  Constitution, surveilled, harassed, harmed, arrested, and assassinated  innocent, ordinary American citizens.   My friend, Fred Hampton, was a brilliant young man that I recruited  to join the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party, which I, along  with Mr. Bob Brown, organized in 1968.   Fred and I fought together side by side against police brutality and  police murder in Chicago specifically, but across our great Nation in  general.   We set up free community health clinics, free breakfast for children  programs, and a free busing to prison program to allow families to  visit their loved ones who were in prison.   Mr. Speaker, we initiated free sickle cell anemia testing programs to  educate this Nation and to tell Black people about this dreaded but  often and largely ignored disease.   Mr. Speaker, thanks to his charismatic leadership, Fred Hampton was  so powerful and so inspirational throughout the city of Chicago and the  Nation at large, his charisma, his influence extended even to other  countries.   Chairman Fred was a charismatic, courageous, exceptional, and highly  committed leader, who, at the age of 21, was assassinated while he  slept under the influence of the drug Seconal that was put in his  favorite drink at that time, which was Kool-Aid. His Kool-Aid was laced  with Seconal.   Why? Because Fred Hampton used every fiber of his talent, his immense  talent, without hesitancy, to fight for poor people: poor Whites, poor  Blacks, poor Asians, poor Hispanic people, poor people across the  board.   His oratory skills exceeded almost every significant leader of his  time. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, he was able to move the masses not simply  and only because of his oratory but also because of his example.   To see Fred, to hear Fred, was to know Fred, to be inspired by Fred.   Mr. Speaker, Chicago, my home city, the city I love, was and still is  one of the most segregated cities in America, but Chairman Fred  understood how to connect across racial and geographic boundaries. He  knew how to connect with aspirations and deep-seated desires of people  across racial and geographic lines. He knew how to create alliances and  coalitions based around common needs and common desires.   He created the original Rainbow Coalition in Chicago. This coalition  was a partnership with the Young Lords, a Hispanic organization, and  the Young Patriots, which was an organization of poor Appalachian  Whites from the Uptown community in Chicago.   Mr. Speaker, this amazing, creative, never-seen-before coalition of  poor people was comprised of working-class people in our city suffering  with the same issues that we all were suffering with. Those issues were  police brutality, substandard housing, mediocre education, low-quality  healthcare, and low-quality food that was being sold in stores in our  neighborhoods.   Mr. Speaker, these were the programs that Fred Hampton championed.  This was the kind of individual that Fred Hampton was.   I stand here today, Mr. Speaker, and say that rather than be saluted  for these and similar efforts, the Black Panther Party members, and  particularly Chairman Fred, were seen as a threat to those in power.   J. Edgar Hoover said that the Black Panther Party was this Nation's  number one threat. Why? We were feeding hungry children. We were  providing free healthcare to young children, to poor people who needed  it. We were taking loved ones to prison to see their loved ones who  were incarcerated. We were speaking truth to power.   Is this the reason why Fred Hampton was assassinated? Is this the  very reason why the Black Panther Party was being viewed by J. Edgar  Hoover and the FBI as the number one threat to this Nation? It just  doesn't make sense.   Mr. Speaker, J. Edgar Hoover's FBI started a file on Fred and put him  on their Agitator Index, listing him as a key militant leader.   They even went so far as to hire a fellow by the name of William  O'Neal, a streetwise Black criminal and operative, as an FBI informant  who was assigned to infiltrate the Black Panther Party and report back  to them about our every move, our every activity.                                time  1845    And then, Mr. Speaker, on December 4, 1969, at about 4 a.m. in the  morning, the Chicago Police Department, working in conjunction with the  FBI and the Cook County State's Attorney, Edward V. Hanrahan,  surreptitiously entered an apartment at 2337 West Monroe where Fred  Hampton lived, and where other Black Panther Party members were  staying. They came with the premeditated plan to murder Fred Hampton,  to murder me and any other party members that they found in that  apartment.   They came armed with machine guns, high-powered pistols, and every  other type of weapon, intent on killing everyone in that apartment.  They came under the guise of executing a search warrant for weapons,  but had every intention of murdering Fred Hampton, and others in that  apartment. They killed Fred.   Mr. Speaker, let me make it real clear. Throughout American history,  there has not been anyone other than  [[Page H8793]]  Fred Hampton that was assassinated under the authority of the U.S.  Government--not one. Fred Hampton was the only politically assassinated  American citizen that was assassinated on the shores of our Nation.  Fred Hampton.   They came for me, but they missed me, Mr. Speaker. Early the  following morning at about 5 a.m. on December 5, they came, the Chicago  Police Department tried to kill me again. They came to my apartment  with a search warrant for weapons and they shot my door down, but I was  not in that apartment. I moved my family out of that apartment, just  hours before they came, on the preceding day.   Mr. Speaker, they tried to justify the murders of Fred Hampton and  Mark Clark by saying that it was a shoot-out, placing the blame on Fred  and other members of the Black Panther Party. Later, it became crystal  clear that this was a clear politically motivated assassination.   The grand jury evidence showed that the police had fired 99 times--99  shots fired into that apartment. And they also said that there were  only two shots that were possibly fired by the Panthers in that  apartment.   Mr. Speaker, let me remind you that this was during the 1960s, a time  of deep and necessary awakening in our Nation, a time of political  protest, a time of cultural confrontation. A time of change in our  Nation. It was a time when poor, oppressed people took a necessary step  forward to end the systemic oppression that they were faced with.   African Americans, women, disabled individuals, Mexican-American  farmworkers, Native Americans, anti-war protestors, environmentalists,  and other activists organized to fight during this time against  injustice and for equality and for equity.   Most of us view this time, some half-century later, as a turning  point in American history. A time when the oppressed populations in our  Nation finally had an opportunity to speak up and create positive  change for themselves and by themselves.   However, Mr. Speaker, J. Edgar Hoover, didn't like what he saw. He  didn't like what was going on in our Nation.   J. Edgar Hoover determined that anyone who had the audacity to stand  up and challenge the oppressive status quo, that they were a threat.   To whom? We were American citizens. We loved our Nation. We were a  threat to him and his consorts--him and those who wanted to oppress,  for racial and other reasons, poor people.   Mr. Speaker, in 1956, J. Edgar Hoover created and designed a program  within the Federal Bureau of Investigation called COINTELPRO.  COINTELPRO was an acronym for the Counterintelligence Program of the  FBI.   This program was a calculated, strategic effort to discredit,  dismantle, neutralize all the efforts for societal reform, for our  right to constitutionally redress our grievances and lift the  oppression, subjugation, discrimination, and biases that we were forced  to live under.   This COINTEL Program illegally, outside of the law, spied on and  harassed American citizens. They went so far as to tap phone lines,  plant false and damaging stories in the national and local press,  falsely imprison people, charging people, and even assassinating  American citizens, activists.   J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI famously targeted Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr., and his family. Hoover sought to discredit Dr. King and to  undermine his civil rights work by painting him as a Communist.   After Dr. King made his iconic ``I Have a Dream'' speech, and the  inspiration that it created for people from all backgrounds across the  Nation, then J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI came to view Dr. King as a  dangerous person. They began a massive surveillance campaign against  Dr. King. They tried to prove that Dr. King was a Communist. They  failed to produce one scintilla of evidence on this, but they still  habitually harassed Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.   In 1964, the FBI sent what is known as the ``suicide letter,'' that  was their quote. The letter urged Dr. King to commit suicide by calling  him a fraud and citing alleged extramarital affairs. This dastardly,  low-life letter was sent to Dr. King's home where it was opened by his  wife, Coretta.   This was a calculated, sinister, and deeply personal attempt by the  FBI designed to bring shame and harm to Dr. King and his family. This  was outside of everything that this Nation stands for--outside of the  law.   Mr. Speaker, they were using taxpayer dollars in order to do these  and other dastardly things, using this COINTEL Program as their  vehicle.   They didn't stop with Dr. King. Some of the other well-known targets  for this COINTEL Program included Aretha Franklin, Malcolm X, Muhammad  Ali, Billie Holiday, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Fonda, Jean Seberg, John  Lennon, Yoko Ono, even the 1960s pop band, The Monkees. They were also  victims of COINTEL.                                time  1900    J. Edgar Hoover had already started spying on people like Charlie  Chaplin and Ernest Hemingway well before this COINTELPRO program was  finalized and set up and operationalized.   This COINTELPRO program targeted everyday people, not just  luminaries, but everyday, ordinary American citizens, anyone that had  the audacity to voice a disagreement against discrimination.   They even targeted housewives, the housewives who attended the  chapter meetings for the National Organization for Women.   Mr. Speaker, I have introduced the COINTELPRO Full Disclosure Act,  H.R. 2998, and I ask that the Members of this Congress sign on to this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
