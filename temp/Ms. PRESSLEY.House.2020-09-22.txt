 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with my fellow  Americans with alopecia in recognition of September as Alopecia Areata  Awareness Month.   Today, like nearly 7 million Americans, I live with alopecia, an  autoimmune disease that attacks the hair follicles. This common  condition is highly unpredictable and cyclical. Hair can grow back in  or fall out again at any time, and the course is different for each  person.   Alopecia areata disproportionately affects children and Black  Americans, and particularly Black women.   Some people may say that it is just hair, but for me and for many  people living with alopecia, hair is intrinsically linked to our  identity and our cultural expression.   We all have our own unique stories with our alopecia diagnosis. Mine  began nearly a year ago as my braider noticed a small patch of  baldness. Very soon after, I was waking up to sinks full of hair. What  started as a few small patches quickly spread.   I remember the moment vividly. I was alone in my D.C. apartment,  separated from my family, on the same day that would have been my  mother's 72nd birthday and on the eve of an impeachment vote. I was  standing in the bathroom, staring at my reflection in the mirror, and  for the first time I was completely bald.   For months, I had dreaded the moment when it would be all gone; but  looking at myself in the mirror that night, I felt relief, peace, and  acceptance. It was a moment of grace, and I thank God for that.   In a matter of weeks, I would lose my eyelashes, eyebrows, and the  rest of my hair and be diagnosed with alopecia universalis, one of  three forms of alopecia.   I am still coming to terms with my new alopecia reality and the  impact of my traumatic hair loss. Every day, thanks to the support of  my family, my staff, the broader alopecia community, and others who  have experienced hair loss, I am making progress.   I am making progress despite the hateful comments, the cruel and  constant online harassment about my baldness, the intrusive and  ignorant questions on the elevators, the unsolicited advice, and the  stares, lots of stares.   No doubt about it, a bald woman entering a room or entering the floor  of the U.S. House of Representatives makes people uncomfortable.  Visually, it challenges every antiquated cultural norm about what is  professional, what is pretty, what is feminine.   But in the loss, the hurt, and the ache of it all, I have never lost  sight of the following: I am Sandy and Martin's daughter; I am Conan's  wife; I am Cora's stepmom; and I am the Congresswoman for the  Massachusetts Seventh Congressional District.   Mr. Speaker, I am now bald, but I am in good health and in incredible  company. I have received an outpouring of love from people across the  globe who are living with alopecia.   Early on, I received a note from an elementary school-aged girl with  alopecia. She wanted to give me some tips in navigating this new  normal. She told me about the first time she walked into school after  her diagnosis, ``Just walk right up to your friends and tell them, `I'm  still me,' '' she wrote.   Who couldn't use a reminder like that as they navigate the world?  Those little acts of kindness and solidarity have defined this  experience, too.   I am proud to be in the good company of those fighting for people  living with alopecia. There is an entire community that has been  working tirelessly to share their stories and to educate the public on  the impact of alopecia areata.   For three decades, the National Alopecia Areata Foundation has been  working to garner congressional support for research and treatment  development. My longtime friend and partner in good, Congressman  McGovern, introduced legislation to allow medical wigs to be covered  under the Medicare program so that every senior living with alopecia  can afford wigs and other head coverings.   This year, the House passed my amendment to provide an additional $5  million in next year's funding for the National Institutes of Health,  which  [[Page H4645]]  will fund research to increase our understanding of the causes,  impacts, and possible treatments of alopecia areata.   I know that our work is far from over, and I will continue to fight.  I will take my seat at the table. I will take up space, and I will  create it, too; and with this space, we will make change.   Every single person deserves to show up in the world exactly as they  are without fear or discrimination. To my fellow alopecians wherever  you may be, today I bring our story to the floor of the people's House  to say that we belong, our stories deserve to be heard, and we are  absolutely beautiful and worthy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the CROWN  Act, which will move us one step closer to ending the centuries of  discrimination against Black hair, discrimination that has rejected the  dignity and beauty of my people.   From personnel handbooks to school dress code policies, Afros, locs,  and twists have been codified as proxies for our Black skin and  manifestations of anti-Black racism.   Many, especially Black women, grow up hearing that our natural coils  and kinks are distracting, ghetto, ugly, and unprofessional. From as  early as grade school, Black girls are pushed out of school for wearing  their hair naturally. As we grow up, we are taught to straighten our  hair if we want to get a job or simply live our lives in peace.   When I first joined Congress, I proudly chose to wear my hair in  Senegalese twists because I sought to intentionally create space for  all of us to show up in the world as our authentic selves.   Today, I navigate the world a little differently. My beautiful twists  were taken from me due to the autoimmune disease known as alopecia  universalis.   But today, I stand in honor of those who don crowns of all types. May  they continue to shine.                            ____________________
