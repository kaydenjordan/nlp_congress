 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  omnibus appropriations act. While this is not the bill I would have  written, nonetheless, it is a significant victory for Minnesotans and  Americans.   By investing in critical priorities like education, election  integrity, housing, infrastructure, public safety, opioid abuse  prevention and treatment, and veterans' healthcare, this legislation  keeps Minnesota and our entire country safe, strong, and moving  forward.   As ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee, my focus has been on protecting the environment,  upholding our commitments to Native Americans, and preserving our  natural resources and cultural treasures.   We added new resources to address the maintenance backlog at our  national parks, support the Smithsonian Institution, and increase  funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and the Humanities.  Importantly, we have removed many Republican riders that attacked  endangered species, undermined environmental safeguards, and  jeopardized public health.   In addition, this bill ensures that the Federal Government will treat  wildfires as the natural disasters they are and stop the ridiculous  practice of forcing the Forest Service and the Department of the  Interior to borrow from other priorities to pay for wildfire  suppression.   I appreciate the hard work of all my colleagues, but especially Mr.  Simpson in forging this bipartisan compromise.   Mr. Speaker, the omnibus represents a major accomplishment on behalf  of the American people. I thank Ranking Member Lowey. I thank Chairman  Frelinghuysen and Chairman Calvert and all of our staff, both  Democratic and Republican, for their hard work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this  bipartisan bill.
