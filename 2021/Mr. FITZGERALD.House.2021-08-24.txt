 Madam Speaker, I want to just remind everybody, no  matter what side of the bill you are on, there is a huge trust issue  going on in America right now. People do not trust the system, and that  is everyone's problem. If you think a centralized election bill to move  the power to Washington, D.C., and put it in the hands of Congress and  the courts is going to help, you are wrong. They don't trust us and  they don't trust the courts.   A decentralized system is what has worked in America. So make sure  that after you support this legislation, you go back and you meet with  the town clerk that runs the elections, the county clerks, the parish  clerks, the municipal clerks, and yes, the State legislatures. I notice  the State legislatures are taking a real beating here today.   Pre-clearance expansion. Is that a can of worms that this body really  wants to open up? Printed ballots. Photo ID. Now we are going to  mandate polling places, election timelines, primary mechanics, who can  be a poll worker. These are all things that are included in H.R. 4. I  just want to make sure the public is aware of that.   We are now taking the power away from the people and placing it right  here in Washington, D.C., in Congress and in the courts exclusively.
