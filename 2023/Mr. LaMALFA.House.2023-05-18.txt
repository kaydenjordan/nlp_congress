 Mr. Speaker, our ally in the Middle East, Israel, has  suffered from even more rocket attacks from Hamas terrorists.   Hamas, as usual, is launching rockets from civilian population  centers and using those civilians as human shields.   We hear a lot of talk these days about 15-minute cities. Israelis  live 15-seconds from a shelter. That is how they have to live their  life if they are  [[Page H2433]]  within the range of the rockets which are becoming more and more wide- ranging over the territory of Israel.   If a terror organization in Mexico, for example, were firing rockets  into cities in Texas and Arizona, the United States would certainly be  expected to retaliate with military force. This is the case with  Israel, it must protect its citizens from indiscriminate rocket  attacks. Israel is not to blame for the civilian casualties caused in  this conflict.   Indeed, the blame lies squarely at the feet of Hamas and other terror  organizations who believe in the use of violence to achieve their  goals.   Israel, in good faith, gave over the Gaza in a land-for-peace deal.  Yet, the ink wasn't even dry, and they started stacking rockets in Gaza  and launching them at Israel.   The United States must continue to support Israel's right to exist  and defend itself from aggression. As our most powerful partner in the  Middle East, we owe it to them.                            ____________________
