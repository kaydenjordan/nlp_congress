 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the Senate to take up  the bill we just passed, H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act.   With title 42 having expired, we are seeing a surge of migrants  approaching our border that will add to a crisis in New York State that  has seen New York City take in over 60,000 migrants so far. Now, Mayor  Eric Adams has resorted to busing migrants into the Hudson Valley,  despite previously decrying southern States from doing that to New York  City.   This is a completely untenable situation and demands immediate  Federal action, which is why the House Republican majority passed H.R.  2.   As the husband of an immigrant, I know why so many people immigrate  to our Nation. We are the greatest Nation in the world. But we simply  cannot continue to let our borders be wide open as they are now. We are  seeing tens of thousands of people cross our borders illegally every  single day.   I urge the Senate to pass this legislation. Having spoken with the  President yesterday in my district, I know he understands the need to  act on our border.   We have to work together to secure our border, end this broken  system, and ensure the safety of our residents.                            ____________________
