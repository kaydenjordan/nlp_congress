 Madam Speaker, while this institution  should rightfully ensure the law is faithfully executed by the  administrative branch, this exercise has shown itself to be the  ultimate manipulation of the legislative branch's oversight powers in  order to achieve political gains.   I caution my colleagues, who have placed political expediency ahead  of moderation, their votes later today will forever change this  institution. Imagine a future where this body utilizes the most severe  of its constitutional tools to continually put the opposition party on  trial.   Madam Speaker, the American people have elected their Representatives  to be their voice and vote on matters most important to this country.  We must collectively focus on these issues, not on the political  impulses of a few.   This cannot become the new normal. I will be voting a resounding  ``no'' on these Articles of Impeachment.
