 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, at this time last year, Washington  Democrats were beginning their quest to dump trillions of dollars in  leftwing spending on a recovering economy that already had the  preconditions for some inflation. Everybody warned Democrats to pump  the brakes. Just weeks earlier, Republicans had already supported a  smaller, targeted, bipartisan stimulus that had barely started to take  effect. Even top liberal economists warned the Democrats' agenda could  spark massive inflation.   The consequences for working families have been particularly harsh.  Essential goods have played an outsized role in driving up prices  overall. It is harder to put dinner on the table when eggs, meat, and  fish are 12 percent more expensive. It is harder to fill up cars with  gas that is 40 percent more expensive and to heat a home with natural  gas that has gone up 24 percent or fuel oil that has gone up 47  percent. This is reality for millions of Americans. They are living it  every single day.   Yet the Biden administration seems less interested in trying to solve  this problem than in trying to persuade families that the pain is  actually just in their heads. One recent story reported that members of  President Biden's team were ``seemingly mystified'' about why the  American people weren't celebrating this economy.   Well, if Washington Democrats spent 5 minutes talking to a middle- class family, I am confident they would cease to be mystified. The  middle 40 percent of American earners have seen their disposable  incomes fall more than an entire percentage point over the last year-- entirely due to inflation. Any American who hasn't managed to secure an  8-percent pay raise in the last year has actually received a real pay  cut, thanks to Democrats' inflation.    The American people are reporting their lowest consumer sentiment in  over a decade. Seventy-five percent say our economy is doing badly.  Almost 80 percent expect inflation to get worse. Six in ten say their  family's income isn't keeping pace with their costs of living.   These are not statistics the White House can wave away. We are  actually talking about human pain. A working mother in Michigan said:         I cannot buy the food that I would normally buy for my       family.    In Washington State, a single mom of four who also cares for her  elderly parents says she has had to take favorite family foods like  frozen pizza and wings and make them ``more of a treat than just a  regular meal.''   This is where Democrats' policies have left working families.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on a related matter, this  Democrat-caused inflation has forced the Federal Reserve and its Board  of Governors into a very tricky position. But while the country is  carefully watching the Fed Board of Governors, the Senate happens to be  considering several of President Biden's nominees to that very same  Board.   Later today, I will meet with Chairman Powell, whom President Biden  wisely renominated to serve another term atop the Fed. Chairman Powell  has proven to be a straight shooter within the mainstream of monetary  policy. His creative leadership helped stabilize our entire economy  through the uncertain early days of the COVID recession. I look forward  to discussing inflation and the state of our economy with Chairman  Powell this afternoon.   Unfortunately, several of President Biden's other Fed nominees appear  to have been significantly less wise selections. One nominee, Professor  Cook from Michigan State University, has previously promoted partisan  conspiracy theories. In 2020, she called for a fellow academic to be  fired because he opposed defunding the police.   The White House cites among Professor Cook's qualifications that she  sits on the Board of Directors of the regional Fed in Chicago. She was  appointed to that position just a few days before President Biden  nominated her for this one.   More troubling still is President Biden's nominee to the extremely  powerful position of Vice Chair for Supervision. This slot comes with  major unilateral power. But the President's nominee, Sarah Bloom  Raskin, has spent recent years pressuring the Fed to stop being a  neutral regulator and instead become an ideological, leftwing activist  body.   Ms. Raskin has argued openly that unelected Fed Governors should use  their powers to declare ideological war on fossil fuels and affordable  American energy.   Ms. Raskin wants our banking system to start picking winners and  losers in ways that would stick American families with higher gas  prices, higher electricity bills, and more dependence on China. And she  wants to implement this agenda from inside one of the least directly  accountable institutions in our government so that voters simply have  no recourse.   The far left is already boasting that this backdoor Green New Deal  would only be the first step. Democrats have already introduced  legislation that would get the Federal Reserve into the racial  redistribution business and inject racial preferences into our  financial system. These unpopular ideas would completely upend an  institution that Americans need to remain nonpolitical, nonpartisan,  and nonideological. Fed Governors are supposed to be neutral  regulators, not economic policy dictators whom voters can't get rid of.   If this weren't disqualifying enough, potentially significant ethical  questions have begun to swirl around Ms. Raskin's nomination. During  her time out of government, Ms. Raskin became affiliated with an  obscure financial technology firm in Colorado. Shortly thereafter,  somehow, mysteriously, this small company became what appears to be the  only nonbank financial tech company in the entire country to receive a  special master account that allowed them to directly access a core  Federal Reserve system.   This is an obviously worrisome topic, but I understand that Senators  have not even been able to get Ms. Raskin to satisfy their basic  requests for information. So I would urge President Biden to find a  better, more mainstream, more bipartisan candidate to serve this  crucial institution.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
