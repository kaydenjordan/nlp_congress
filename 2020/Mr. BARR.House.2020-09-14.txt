 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Coleman Crest Farm in  Lexington, Kentucky. This farm is one of Lexington's oldest African- American-owned family farms with a remarkable legacy.   James Coleman, the farm's first owner, was born into slavery in 1845  in Uttingertown, Kentucky. Incredibly, in March of 1888, James Coleman  purchased the land he and his parents had worked on for years as  slaves.   The farm has passed through four generations of Colemans since that  time, all while enduring and prevailing over racial discrimination, the  Great Depression, and two world wars.   In 2001, James Coleman's great-grandson, Jim, and his late wife,  Cathy, purchased the farm. Tomorrow on September 15, Cathy Coleman's  birthday, a groundbreaking of a new house at the farm will take place  dedicated to Cathy's memory. The farm will be used to help shape the  future for Black farmers as Lexington youth are exposed to the  agricultural opportunity as a means to realize the American Dream.   I am honored to pay tribute to the entire Coleman family today in the  people's House.                            ____________________
