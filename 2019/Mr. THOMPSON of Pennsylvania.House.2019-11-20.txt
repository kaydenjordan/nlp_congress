 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  American Education Week.   Every year, this week underscores the importance of access to quality  education. It honors the teachers, instructors, and educational mentors  who make a difference in the lives of our Nation's learners.   Working to ensure access to high-quality and affordable education for  all students is of utmost importance. The American education system  should be as diverse as our Nation's students, including learners of  all ages, of all socioeconomic backgrounds, and from rural America,  urban America, and everywhere in between. That includes students who  choose to pursue a traditional 4-year college degree as well as those  who choose to attend a trade school or an apprenticeship program.   As co-chair of the bipartisan Career and Technical Education Caucus,  I have been pleased to introduce a number of career and technical  education bills, alongside my fellow co-chair, Congressman  Jim  Langevin, which aim to restore rungs on the ladder of opportunity for  every American.   Most recently, that includes H.R. 5092, the Counseling for Career  Choice Act. H.R. 5092 ensures students have access to quality  counseling resources that can help them make more informed decisions  about their educational futures and professional career choices. By  better equipping these students with the skills to succeed, we are one  step closer to closing our Nation's skills gap.   The skills gap is the result of a lack of qualified students in STEM  disciplines like nursing, energy, information technology,  cybersecurity, and more. Career and technical education is working to  empower students by equipping them with employable skills.   To directly address the workforce shortage in cybersecurity, I was  proud to cosponsor H.R. 1592, the Cybersecurity Skills Integration Act.  This bill would create a pilot program through the Department of  Education to award grants to create or expand existing postsecondary  CTE programs in cybersecurity competencies.   Career and technical education has support outside of the Education  and Labor Committee as well. I also cosponsored H.R. 898, the Skills  Investment Act of 2019. H.R. 898 enhances Coverdell Education Savings  Accounts, which are tax-advantaged savings accounts for  educational expenses. American workers can use the accounts to pay for  skills-based learning, career training, and workforce development. In  addition, both workers and employers receive tax credits for  contributions to these accounts.    Mr. Speaker, in addition to addressing the shortage of our skilled  workforce, we need to continue increasing educational access for  students who are living with disabilities. The Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act ensures nearly 7 million infants, toddlers,  children, and youth with disabilities have access to quality education.   Unfortunately, Congress has fallen short on our commitment to these  individuals, and support for students with disabilities has remained  underfunded. That is why I was proud to support H.R. 1878, the IDEA  Full Funding Act, which would mandate gradual increases in IDEA funding  to reach the full funding as promised by Congress when IDEA was passed  and to do that by fiscal year 2029.   Lastly, there are many bipartisan bills that support quality  education for American learners. I have always believed that we produce  the best results for students when we work across the aisle. However,  the partisan College Affordability Act, which would reauthorize the  Higher Education Act, actually contributes to crippling college costs  and widens our Nation's skills gap.   It is my hope that we can offer real solutions like the High-Quality  Opportunities in Postsecondary Education Act, or the HOPE Act, which  provides institutions with the tools they need to help students prepare  for successful careers and successful lives.   This is American Education Week. Let's remember that students deserve  better than a one-size-fits-all educational plan.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize November as National Adoption Month.   This month we celebrate the life-changing act of adoption that has  touched the lives of so many in our country. American families  nationwide open their homes and their hearts to children in search of a  stable environment and a forever home.   Despite the many parents that adopt, there are still so many children  in the foster care system in search of a place to call home. In 2018,  almost half a million children and teenage youth were in U.S. foster  care. As a country we must always strive to help the most vulnerable  citizens among us. All children in America deserve a permanent family  that can provide them with the love, support, and encouragement needed  to reach their full potential in life.   During this important awareness month, we recognize the unconditional  love adoptive parents provide to their children, and we hope that all  children will soon be welcomed into a loving family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my brother in the  Lord from Colorado for hosting this Special Order tonight, during a  special week where we commemorate the Holy Word, the Bible.   Mr. Speaker, since 1941, every President since Franklin Delano  Roosevelt has declared the week of Thanksgiving as National Bible Week.   It is fitting that we celebrate this week along with the national day  of Thanksgiving. Both the Bible and this annual holiday provide us with  the time to reflect on what is most important in our lives: our faith,  our creator, our family, and our love for one another.   Mr. Speaker, part of my family lineage can be traced back to those  Pilgrims who set out for the New World in search of religious freedom.  They endured both hardship and sacrifice at a heavy cost to be able to  freely worship without persecution.   Forty-five of the 102 Mayflower passengers died in the winter of 1620  to 1621, and the Mayflower colonists suffered greatly during their  first winter in the New World from lack of shelter, scurvy, and general  conditions of hardship. They brought with them, though, their faith and  several Bibles.   The event that Americans commonly call the First Thanksgiving was  celebrated by the Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World  in October of 1621. This feast lasted 3 days, and, as accounted by  attendee Edward Winslow, it was attended by 90 Native Americans and 53  Pilgrims.   Thanks to William Bradford's journal, we have knowledge of how these  Pilgrims gave thanks. The question remains as to whom and why did they  do this.   As people of faith, I would like to believe they were acting out the  lessons of the Bible, such as that found in Psalm 107. This Scripture  states the theme of God's loyal love and redemption. It is written for  at the time of Israel in exile.   Wandering and overwhelmed by circumstances, I could see why these  early Pilgrims could find solace in this Scripture. They also found  themselves wandering and enduring hardship.   The Bible illustrated the power of giving thanks to the Lord, the  importance of assuming thankfulness as a human attitude.   These words indicate not just a knowledge of, but also a recognition  and a relationship through, the Word of God that the Bible offers.   I don't know if the Pilgrims referenced this Scripture in preparing  or dealing with the hardships that they endured. I do know that the  Bible and the Word within it was important to these travelers and early  settlers.   The Bible has had a tremendous influence in my life and the lives of  millions of Americans. The Scriptures inside serve as a guide for us in  both times of trouble and in times of triumph. And, for that reason, it  remains the best-selling book of all time.   During this week, I am thankful for the strong community of faith  that I have come to know through weekly Bible studies and prayer  service here in the United States Capitol and, certainly, back in my  district and my home community. It is a time where we put aside  differences and come together to share the love and the Gospel of Jesus  Christ.   The words of the Bible unite people, nations, and even politicians as  we  [[Page H9106]]  come together to celebrate faith, fellowship, and prayer.   As I prepare to close, let me share these thoughts.   God chose Israel; America chose God; and God's first love is Israel.  Let's make America God's lasting love.   Mr. Speaker, let us also celebrate the First Amendment, which affirms  our right to choose and exercise faith without government coercion or  retaliation.
