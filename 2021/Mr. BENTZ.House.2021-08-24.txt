 Madam Speaker, this bill would operate to freeze in place,  to substantially chill, changes to the election processes of some of  the 90,126 State and local government units found in this United  States.   Madam Speaker, I assure you, the election processes of many of these  State and local units are not perfect, but this bill would chill  necessary corrections and updating of such election processes. Why?  Because the bill creates a private enforcement cause of action, with  attorney fees to the prevailing party, and establishes a clear risk to  these 90,126 government units of incurring tens if not hundreds of  thousands of dollars of attorney fees if the government unit gets it  wrong and violates the subjective standards, such as the undefined term  ``diminishes'' found in section 4A(c)(2) in the bill.   Madam Speaker, after what we have been through in the last election,  we should be working to encourage certainty and clarity in our election  processes. This bill does not do that. It does the opposite.                                time  1645
