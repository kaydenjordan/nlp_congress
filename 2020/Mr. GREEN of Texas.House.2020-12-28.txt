 Mr. Speaker, at some point on the infinite  continuum that we call time, we will all have to account for our time.   We are all going to have to answer the question: Where were you when  a pandemic was gripping the land? What did you do when you had the  opportunity to put money in the pockets of people who needed it? Where  was your courage when you had the chance to cast a vote to make a  difference in the lives of people?   I say to you, my dear friends, this is the time for us to take a  stand for the American people. Let's vote ``yes'' to put money in their  pockets, because we caused them to stay home as a result of the  pandemic. The government is for this reason. This is why the government  exists: to take care of people.
