 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan  legislation.   I just want to remark briefly to my colleague from Florida (Ms.  Castor) that the ACE Kids bill was a very important bill that we worked  on actually for three Congresses. Joe Barton and the gentlewoman did a  marvelous job. We didn't quite get it done. We passed it in this House  with more than 400 votes in the last Congress. At the end, the Senate  just didn't take it up.   It is very important that it is included as part of this bipartisan  package, which we hope is early enough that we can get the Senate to  act and pass it, because it really does impact families that are in  much need.   I also am happy that we are moving this comprehensive bill today  because it does contain a variety of important extensions. All of them  had hearings and a lot of bipartisan support from the very first. This  includes protections against spousal impoverishment for those seniors  who have a spouse who is receiving home-based long-term care under  Medicaid.   Back in 2010, we temporarily mandated these protections for home  care, but that mandate was set to expire at the end of this very week,  so it has to be extended.   Last year, my good friend and colleague, Mrs. Dingell, and I  introduced a bill to make the spousal impoverishment protections  permanent, and we worked hard to get that done and passed here in this  House. But at the end, even though we worked tirelessly on this, we got  only a temporary extension. That is why it expires the end of this  week.   This bill doesn't permanently extend it like we had hoped last year,  but it does give a reprieve by extending the protection until the end  of this year, so, in essence, a 9-month extension. It is my hope that  we can use the time to actually pass a permanent extension.   I particularly commend the work of my colleague, Mrs. Dingell from  the great State of Michigan, for her passion on this, to make sure that  we can get it done. I applaud the Speaker for getting it scheduled on  the House floor early so that we can get it done, hopefully, this week,  and the Senate can concur. Then let's use the time to really make it  permanent, to help these families that otherwise will have funds taken  out, as this really does rely on Medicaid, to a large degree.                                time  1745
