 Madam Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle throughout this whole process, their allies in the media, they  like to say that Republicans only want to talk about process, not  substance, even though we continue to talk about substance as well.    They declare their facts are uncontested. They just did it again.   So just to, maybe, recap a few for everyone watching at home, as well  as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and hopefully they  will listen:   President Zelensky says there was no demand, no pressure, no quid pro  quo.   Andriy Yermak said on December 10 that their whole story with regard  to the December 1 meeting with Ambassador Sondland is completely  refuted.   We heard from Ambassador Sondland himself, who admitted that he heard  from President Trump that he didn't want any quid pro quo and that he  was guessing when he stated otherwise. Ambassador Sondland, that is,  said he was guessing and that no one on the planet had told him  otherwise.   Ambassador Volker tells us that President Zelensky didn't know that  there was a hold on aid on July 25. He didn't find out until after he  read it in Politico on July 29.   The aid got released shortly thereafter, and Ukraine didn't have to  do absolutely anything in order to get the hold released.   When our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that the July  25 call transcript says, ``do me a favor,'' we have to correct them  time and again that it says, ``do us a favor.'' And if you look at that  paragraph, it is only about Ukrainians interfering in the 2016  election.   Now, if you want to ignore the Chaly op-ed; Chalupa worked with the  Ukrainian Embassy to dig up dirt; the black ledger to bring down the  Trump campaign; whether it is Avakov's statement; or the origins of the  Steele dossier--these are all examples. Look at Ken Vogel's reporting  from January 2017. It is irrefutable.   These are all substance, so stop saying that the facts are  uncontested.    Madam Speaker, this impeachment is an embarrassment for  House Democrats.   On the substance, the Democrats claim that their case is uncontested,  [[Page H12182]]  relying on presumptions, hearsay, and 3 percent of the story trying to  connect dots that actually aren't connected.   Some inconvenient truths: President Zelensky didn't know that there  was a hold on aid until August 29. The aid gets released shortly  thereafter, and Ukraine didn't have to do anything in order to get that  aid released; President Zelensky says no demand, no quid pro quo, no  pressure.   But Democrats want the public to ignore the other 97 percent of this  story. It doesn't work like that.   Senate Democrats want new witnesses to show why there was a hold on  aid. That is an odd request if you think you have already proven your  case.   At the heart of this debate, two investigations are being discussed  between countries. Democrats and media allies want the public to  believe it is all just debunked that Ukrainians interfered in the 2016  election. They want you to ignore Avakov and Chaly's comments, that  Chalupa worked with the Ukrainian Embassy, origins of the Steele  dossier, the black ledger, and more.   The problem with all of this is that the American public are smarter  than Democrats are giving them credit for.   Next, the Democrats claim the Republicans are arguing that it was  Ukraine and not Russia that wanted to interfere and was interfering in  the 2016 election. No, that is not what Republicans are saying.   Of course, we have the Burisma-Biden issue of a corrupt Ukrainian  energy company run by a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch hiring Hunter Biden  for at least $50,000 per month, with no energy experience and no  Ukraine experience, solely because he is Vice President Biden's son.   Now, the company wanted to hire Hunter Biden because they wanted to  curry favor while there was this ongoing corruption investigation.  Enter Joe Biden. He gets that prosecutor fired, threatening the loss of  $1 billion if it didn't happen immediately, which it was.   Now, Democrats believe that Burisma and Biden should be immune from  scrutiny. I disagree. Never again should that conflict of interest ever  happen. And our governments should be working together to get to the  bottom of all of this.   This has also been a total disaster on the process, from getting a  Federal worker to file a whistleblower complaint to Schiff's made-up  version of the July 25 call.   In the closed-door interviews, Schiff was prosecutor, judge, jury,  and witness coach. Every day he loved getting America drunk on his  favorite cocktail, three ingredients: cherry-picking leaks, withholding  key facts, and misstating evidence.   In the depositions and in the public hearings, the President's  counsel was not invited to attend, present evidence, or cross-examine  witnesses; and Republicans weren't allowed to call witnesses like  Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, and others.   Then there was the House Judiciary debacle where Schiff couldn't even  show up to present his reports. He had to have one of his staffers  present it for him. This impeachment is ripping our country in half. It  is fatally flawed on the process, the substance, the intentions, and  the consequences. It is a total Schiff show. I encourage all my  colleagues to vote ``no.''                                time  1830
