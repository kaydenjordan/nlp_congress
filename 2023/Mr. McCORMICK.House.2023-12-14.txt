 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference  report for the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act.   I am proud to report that this conference report includes language  that I authored to both rein in government-sponsored censorship and  help resolve the military recruiting crisis.   The 2024 NDAA will require advertising agencies placing military  recruitment commercials to certify that they have not placed  advertisements in news sources based on personal or institutional  political preferences or biases or determinations of misinformation.   This language is intended to prevent the Department of Defense from  contracting with advertising agencies that utilize blacklists provided  by organizations like Global Disinformation Index and NewsGuard, which  have been found to be biased against conservative viewpoints.   Mr. Speaker, of the five Defense Department service branches, only  two, the Marine Corps and Space Force, met their Active-Duty enlisted  recruiting goals for fiscal year 2023. Last year, the Army missed its  recruiting goals by 25 percent.   In the midst of this recruiting crisis, it makes zero sense to  artificially limit the reach of our military recruitment  advertisements. It is especially foolish when those limitations target  the sites frequented by the people most likely to volunteer to serve.   I am grateful to Chairman Rogers, Speaker Johnson, and Ranking Member  Wicker for fighting to include this important revision.                            ____________________
