 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to table at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I share one thing in common with my friend  from Virginia. This is a very sad day and certainly a day I never  expected to have to live through.   I think, broadly speaking, as I look across this floor, you can  divide Members into three groups. I am very happy to be in the first  group, the overwhelming majority of my party who supports the Speaker  that we elected.   We are proud of the leadership he has shown. We are proud of the  manner in which he has been willing to work with everybody in our  Conference, and I believe in this Chamber.   There is a second group, a small group. Honestly, they are willing to  plunge this body into chaos and this country into uncertainty for  reasons that only they really understand. I certainly don't.   Then there are friends on the other side--I mean friends, honestly,  with great sincerity--I have a lot of friends over there, and I  recognize that my friends on the other side have a very complex set of  partisan, personal, and political calculations to make.   I certainly wouldn't presume to give them any advice about that, but  I would say think long and hard before you plunge us into chaos because  that is where we are headed if we vacate the speakership.   I personally think there are really three reasons why we have come to  this point, and that is because at each three of these critical  minutes, the Speaker did the right thing.   First, there was a Speaker vote. He got 85 percent of the vote in our  Conference; 90 percent of the vote from Republicans on this floor.   Yet, we had a small group that decided no, they would dictate what  they want. He didn't let that happen. He fought. Now, he fought for  himself, but he fought for 90 percent of us too that wanted him to be  the Speaker, and I appreciate that.   Then, of course, we had the debt ceiling deal. Nobody here thought he  could pass a bill. Nobody in America thought he could pass a bill.   He did what Speakers are supposed to do. He passed the bill. Then he  sat down and negotiated with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic  President and came back with a good deal, a deal that will limit  spending. He did the right thing.   Finally, last Saturday on this floor, we were on the verge of a  government shutdown, a government shutdown that the vast majority of  Members in this Chamber did not want, a substantial majority on my side  and an overwhelming majority on the Democrat side.                                time  1500    He put his political neck on the line, knowing this day was coming,  to do the right thing--the right thing for the country without a doubt.  My friends and I agree on that, whether or not we agree on the Speaker.  He did the right thing. He did the right thing for this institution. He  showed it could function in a time of crisis. Finally, he did the right  thing for our party. He made sure that we could continue to negotiate  and achieve some of the very objectives my friend from Virginia laid  out, and achieve them in divided government, which calls for some  degree of give-and-take.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of this Speaker. I am very proud to  stand behind him. Tomorrow morning, whether I win or lose, I am going  to be pretty proud of the people I fought with and I am going to be  extraordinarily proud of the person I fought for, the Speaker of the  House, Kevin McCarthy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Jordan), my very good friend.

Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Louisiana.  [[Page H4977]]         Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining for  each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong), my great friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
