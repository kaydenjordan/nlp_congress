 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  702, the Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act of 2017, as amended.   I thank all of the bill's co-sponsors, including Representatives  Norton, Sensenbrenner and Jackson Lee, for working with me on this  measure and for their commitment to strengthening federal Equal  Employment Opportunity (EEO) programs.   I also thank Tanya Ward Jordan, Paulette Taylor, and all the members  of the Coalition 4 Change (C4C) for their years of work on this measure  and their perseverance.   H.R. 702 is essentially identical to H.R. 1557, which was considered  in the last Congress. That legislation passed the House by a vote of  403-0. However, the bill did not pass the Senate before the end of the  114th Congress. I am hopeful that this year, we can finally get this  measure over the finish line and to the President's desk for signature.   I authored H.R. 702 to make long-overdue reforms of federal EEO  programs to ensure that they are better able to protect the rights of  federal employees and applicants for federal employment.   Federal EEO programs exist to uphold the guarantee of equal  opportunity that is the right of every citizen in this nation and to  ensure that any barriers impeding fairness in personnel decisions are  identified and eliminated.   While the vast majority of federal workplaces comply with current EEO  requirements, some federal agencies still have not met the standards of  a model EEO program set forth by the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission (EEOC).   For example, in 2014, the EEOC issued a report on the Social Security  Administration (SSA) that made 12 findings regarding SSA's failure to  maintain a model EEOC program, ensure efficient management of the  complaint process, provide uniform training to ensure equal  opportunities, and implement effective and efficient anti-harassment  policies and procedures.   The EEOC made more than 60 recommendations for reform of that one  program alone.   Last year, bi-partisan investigations conducted by the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform of the National Park Service and the  U.S. Forest Service found significant deficiencies in both agencies'  EEO programs.   At both agencies, employees suffered when their complaints of  discrimination were not handled in a fair and timely manner. Employees  were also harmed by agencies' failure to safeguard complainants'  personal information.   To help end these failings, my bill would require that EEO programs  operate independently of an agency's human resources or general counsel  offices--and that the head of the program reports directly to the head  of an agency. This would ensure that effective implementation of the  EEO program is prioritized at the highest level of an agency--and that  it operates with the sole purpose of ensuring equal opportunity for all  employees.   H.R. 702 would also strengthen the accountability mechanisms that are  central to the effectiveness of the EEO process.   Further, H.R. 702 would make clear that agencies cannot impose any  nondisclosure agreement on federal employees to prohibit employees from  disclosing fraud or illegal actions to Congress, the Office of Special  Counsel (OSC), or an Inspector General.   According to the 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, only 60  percent of federal employees agreed that they could, quote, ``disclose  a suspected violation of any law, rule or regulation without fear of  reprisal.''   The Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act would help ensure that  federal employees can report discrimination without suffering  retaliation--and that such reports will be thoroughly and fairly  investigated and adjudicated in a timely manner.   Finally, as I close, I want to address some of the issues that arose  during consideration of this measure in the Senate Homeland Security  Committee last year.   I want to be crystal clear that I believe that supervisors who engage  in discriminatory or retaliatory action must be held accountable.   However, this can be accomplished without curtailing any existing due  process rights for federal employees and I will continue to oppose all  efforts to roll back any due process right.   I urge all Members to support H.R. 702, and I hope that in this  Congress, we can finally enact this measure into law.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  702, the ``Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act of 2017.''   I support this legislation because it ensures agencies effectively  implement their Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) programs and that  federal employees are never prevented from disclosing discriminatory or  wasteful actions to Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, or  Inspectors General.   Let me express my thanks to Ranking Member Cummings for introducing  this critical legislation that is essential to ensuring that our  federal workplaces are free from discrimination, and that any barriers  impeding fairness in personnel decisions are identified and eliminated.   This is not the first time we have addressed and offered legislation  regarding workplace equality.   In 2002, the ``No Fear Act'' was first introduced in Congress and set  the precedent for imposing additional duties upon Federal agency  employers that are intended to reinvigorate their longstanding  obligation to provide a work environment free of discrimination and  retaliation.   On October 2, 2000, the House Science Committee held a hearing  entitled ``Intolerance at EPA--Harming People, Harming Science?''   Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, an EPA whistleblower, won a 600,000  dollar jury decision against EPA for race and sex discrimination under  title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   During that hearing, then-chairman of the Science Committee  Congressman Sensenbrenner illuminated the dangerous precedent set by  the EPA, stating, ``While EPA has a clear policy on dealing with  employees that discriminate, harass and retaliate against other EPA  employees, no one apparently involved in the Coleman-Adebayo or Nolan  cases have yet to be disciplined by EPA.''   Mr. Speaker, no employee should fear voicing their concerns in  reference to a safer more work conducive environment.   According to the 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, only 60  percent of federal employees agreed that they could quote, ``disclose a  suspected violation of any law, rule or regulation without fear of  reprisal.''   We must do better and ensure employees have confidence that they can  report an act of discrimination without suffering retaliation.   Employees need to know that EEO reports will be thoroughly, fairly,  and timely investigated and adjudicated.   H.R. 702 would require that EEO programs operate independently of an  agency's human resources or general counsel offices.   This bill requires the head of the program report directly to the  head of an agency and the act would prohibit the use of non-disclosure  agreements that restrict an employee from disclosing to Congress, the  Office of Special Counsel, or instance of waste, fraud or abuse.   We often look at individuals or groups who step forward as  whistleblowers.   This term has been used with a negative connotation to describe  insubordinate employees, but history has shown us that whistleblowers  are often heroes that have shed light on employers' illegal practices  and as a result made the workplace better for future employees.   Mark Felt, the FBI agent known as deep throat during the Watergate  Scandal of the 1970s.   Frank Serpico, New York police officer who confronted his department  for the rampant corruption the leadership let take place.   Jeffrey Wigand, a tobacco executive who admitted that tobacco  companies knew they were putting addictive chemicals into their  cigarettes.   And Sherron Watkins, an executive of the Enron corporation who was  vital in exposing the financial lies and frauds of the company.   All these individuals stood up against well-established corporations  and agencies even when others doubted their claims.   We must protect these types of acts in Federal offices and  successfully implement the Equal Employment Opportunity Programs (EEO).   Mr. Speaker, in a sense every Member of Congress is a whistleblower  for the people in that uncovering and correcting problems in the  agencies that administer the laws is an essential part of our oversight  responsibilities.   As a senior member of the Committees on Homeland Security and the  Judiciary, and as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on  Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I understand  the importance of safe and discrimination free workplaces.   By strengthening existing requirements to ensure federal EEO programs  meet high standards, we are implementing the best practices available  to combat workplace discrimination.   It is our duty as Members of Congress to be whistleblowers, bring  attention to this pressing matter, and put a stop to injustices  occurring in the workforce.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 702, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  [[Page H5402]]    A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
