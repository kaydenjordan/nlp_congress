 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I am proud to be a sponsor of H.R.  1309 for a multiplicity of reasons, and I thank Mr. Courtney for  introducing this legislation.   Madam Chair, I am proud to tell you also that within my congressional  district in Houston, Texas, we have the largest medical center in the  world.   Madam Chair, annually, the Houston Medical Center encounters 10  million patients. The Houston Medical Center also, Madam Chair, has  106,000 employees. The Houston Medical Center is 17 times larger than  the average city in the United States of America.   We understand the scope of this problem, and there is a problem. But,  sometimes, problems are not best explained with statistical  information. Sometimes, the words of people can make the difference in  understanding a problem.   I have within my hand a letter from the National Nurses United  organization. Hear now their words:         Violence on the job has become endemic for RNs and other       workers in healthcare and social assistance settings. Nurses       report being punched, kicked, bitten, beaten, and threatened       with violence as they provide care to others. Far too many       have experienced stabbing and shootings.    Madam Chair, the evidence is overwhelming. We do have a problem. To  understand the scope of the problem, you have to have some intelligence  accorded some repository so that it can be properly assessed. The  Secretary of Labor will be the repository. We will get the information  to the Secretary.   But this is not enough, to merely have the Secretary of Labor have  the sense of what the scope is. The buck stops with Congress. Congress  needs to know the scope of the problem. If changes are necessary and  not being made, the buck stops with us. We will have to encounter this,  and we will have to take up our duty, responsibility, and obligation to  provide the proper legislation.   With this understanding, we have filed amendment No. 6. This  amendment understands that the Secretary will receive the information,  and then this amendment would require the Secretary to annually report  to Congress so that Congress will have the transparency that the  Secretary has so that Congress may take appropriate action when  necessary. Understanding the scope of the problem helps you understand  the scope of a necessary solution, if there is one.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire what time is  remaining.    Madam Chair, the gentlewoman from North Carolina  and I are very dear friends, and I have great respect for her. In fact,  I have a deep, abiding affinity for her humanity.   But, today, I am reminded of the words of Ruth Smeltzer. Ruth  Smeltzer reminds us that:         Some measure their lives by days and years, Others by       heartthrobs, passions, and tears; But the surest measure       under the Sun, Is what in your lifetime for others you have       done.    Madam Chair, this day provides us an opportunity to do something for  others who are in harm's way, who are caregivers, and who are doing  what they can to provide the kind of healthcare services that we need.  They do it at great risk. We are the people who can minimize that risk.  It is our responsibility to do for others what we would have others do  for us. If I were a healthcare worker, I would want Congress to take  this kind of appropriate action to protect me.   I also would remind my colleagues that if we do nothing, at some  point, we will find people reluctant to go into this area of endeavor.  Who wants to go to work with the fear of being harmed?   I love my dear lady from North Carolina, but we respectfully  disagree. The buck stops here.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the For  the People Agenda generated by this House, and I am antithetical to the  Senate's provision, which is a for-the-President agenda.   We, the Members of the House, have passed legislation for gun safety.  The President has merely talked about it.   We have passed legislation to help with personal and financial  security for women. The President says ugly things about women.   We pass legislation that will help the Dreamers. The President is  about ending the dream.   We have passed legislation helping those who are being discriminated  against in the LGBTQ community. The President ignores this community.   We passed legislation to help with election and democracy security.  The President wants to do all that he can to help Putin and those in  Russia with their security, ignoring ours.   In our House we have, for the people, passed a bill to increase the  minimum wage. The President seems to be antithetical to it. If we have  our For the People Agenda and we pass these bills and send them to the  Senate, the least that the Senate can do is generate their own version  so that these bills may go to a conference committee.    They don't have to have a for-the-President agenda. I am for the  people. The Senate is for the President.
