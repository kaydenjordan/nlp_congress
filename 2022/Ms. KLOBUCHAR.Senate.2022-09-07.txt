 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to report back from a trip  that Senator Portman and I took to Ukraine last week. And the No. 1  thing I would like to report is that President Zelenskyy personally  asked us--and I know that Senator Portman addressed the Senate last  night and reported this--but he personally asked us to thank the U.S.  Senate, to thank the people of this country for the generous and  unending continuing help that the Senate has given to Ukraine in their  fight for democracy.   This is a country that has given it all. Sometimes we wonder, in our  own country, what are we going to put on the line for our democracy?  Are we going to go over and vote today? How much do we care? There, the  people of Ukraine are putting their lives on the line every single day.   The ballerina who puts on camo and goes to the front lines, the  exhausted workers at the nuclear plant trying to protect not just the  country of Ukraine, but surrounding countries because it is the biggest  nuclear plant in all of Europe, supplying 20 percent of the electricity  to the people of Ukraine.   They go to work every day, under incredible stress and pressure that  we can't imagine, trying to keep their country safe while surrounded by  500 Russian troops. We think of the cellist playing beautiful melodies  on the front steps of bombed-out remnants of a  [[Page S4457]]  town square to remind people that culture and love still exist in this  country.   I think of the mass grave that we visited in Bucha, in Irpin, the  apartment buildings after apartment buildings burned out, but Ukraine  goes on. We saw firsthand the strength of the Ukrainian people in the  face of Vladimir Putin's inhuman barbarism. But just as Putin has shown  his true colors, so have the people of Ukraine in brilliant blue and  yellow. Over the past 6 months since the invasion, their bravery and  humanity has consistently shone through.    When Senator Portman and I went to Ukraine last January as part of a  group of Senators--we were the last group which went in before the war  started, with Senators Shaheen and Murphy and Senator Blumenthal and  Senator Wicker and Senator Cramer--we witnessed the incredible resolve  of the Ukrainian people. Last week, we saw up close a nation defending  its homeland in a way that few expected would even be possible.   We had an excellent hour-long meeting with President Zelenskyy and  Defense Minister Reznikov and the President's chief of staff.   Our country has helped them so much. We heard the story of how our  employees at the Embassy--we now have people located in Kyiv--went to  get some takeout food from a Ukrainian restaurant, and when they got  the food back, got the bag back, someone, not even knowing who they  were or where they worked but thinking they were American, had written  on it: ``Thanks for the HIMARS.''   Along with at least 42 other nations, from Japan to South Korea, to  Poland, we have stood with democracy. We have stood with Ukraine.   We also discussed with President Zelenskyy the counteroffensive  Ukraine is making to reclaim its territory in the Kherson region. This  was one of the first cities Ukraine lost when the war began, but we  have seen some initial signs of success.   Ukrainians have also announced that they have recaptured some  villages and knocked out weapons and radar stations and a pontoon  bridge the Russians had built.   We are working closely with the Ukrainians to tailor our security  assistance to meet their immediate needs on the frontlines of the  conflict, something that was more difficult to do at the beginning. Now  we actually have people back in Kyiv, and we also have clear lines of  communication with the Ukrainian leadership.   Of course, as I mentioned earlier, the situation on the ground  remains incredibly dangerous, especially in the Zaporizhzhia region,  home to the largest nuclear plant in Europe, which was a central issue  that we raised in our discussions with Ukrainian leadership.   The plant, which, as I noted, previously provided Ukraine with 20  percent of its power, is at significant risk because of Russian  shelling.   Just today, Ukraine announced that they may have to shut the plant  down for fear of a nuclear disaster, as this skeleton crew constantly  has to reconnect the lines that have been shelled to not only get the  power out to Ukrainians, which Russians are trying to divert to their  territories--to Russian-held territories--to making sure they have the  power to keep the reactor going and safe.   We called on Russia to establish a demilitarized zone around the  plant and to allow the team from the IAEA to inspect the plant. We were  glad when the team of 14 inspectors visited the plant. Two inspectors  will remain there indefinitely. This is all happening as we speak.   The IAEA released its report yesterday and said:         While the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear       emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat of       nuclear safety and security.    The agency, which is full of nuclear safety experts from around the  world, noted extensive safety concerns. They urged an immediate stop to  fighting on site and in the vicinity.   I continue to call for that demilitarized zone around the plant. We  know that this nuclear incident wouldn't be just an incident; it would  be a catastrophe.   We all know this is a hard fight, but America must continue to stand  with Ukraine.   If Vladimir Putin had been allowed just to enter their country, take  over an entire democracy, he would never have stopped there.   We also held a meeting with U.S. military leaders at the 101st  Airborne Division in Poland, who are there to underscore our commitment  to our NATO allies and the defense of Europe. They affirmed that the  Ukrainians are making great use of the weapons we have supplied in  their fight against Russia.   In addition to the direct support we are providing to Ukraine, we are  also seeing that sanctions are working in Russia, as just yesterday,  the administration reported--our administration--that Moscow is in the  process of purchasing rockets and artillery shells from North Korea. It  shows how much trouble Russia is in when they are purchasing military  equipment from the country of North Korea. This type of desperate  purchase says a lot about the state of Russia's supply chain.   In fact, we have seen that as Russia has attacked Ukraine, its  actions have been met with almost universal condemnation. It was a key  factor in Finland and Sweden's decision to pursue NATO membership, a  measure we here in the Senate supported on the floor with a resounding  95-to-1 vote.   The United States has provided economic, military, and humanitarian  aid since the invasion. Our leadership has brought and continues to  bring other nations to the table and has allowed Ukraine to continue to  fight for its freedom.   We remember that moment after the invasion began when President  Zelenskyy stood in Kyiv and said the simple words: ``We are here.''  ``We are here.'' That video went viral. ``We are here.''   From that moment on, he and his people inspired the world--a living  symbol of courage. So now it is our time to assure the Ukrainians,  knowing that they are up against the evil of Vladimir Putin, with the  simple words: ``We are here.''   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have eight requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
