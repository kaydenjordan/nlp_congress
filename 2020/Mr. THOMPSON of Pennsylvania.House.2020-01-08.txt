 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss  the importance of rural health and what it means to the nearly 60  million Americans who call rural America home.   No matter where you live, access to quality healthcare should not be  considered a luxury. Recently, a local hospital in my district was  recognized as a healthcare leader in rural America. The University of  Pittsburgh Medical Center, Northwest campus in Venango County was one  of 18 rural hospitals in the Nation to receive an award for excellence  and patient safety and quality in 2019.   The accolade is given annually by The Leapfrog Group serving more  than 2,100 hospitals to find the Nation's best in healthcare safety and  quality.   Hospitals like UPMC Northwest are just one piece of the puzzle when  it comes to building a network of reliable care in rural America.   In many cases, rural residents can still live very far away from the  closest hospital, which makes getting quality care even more difficult.   Telehealth can help reduce barriers to health services for all  residents, particularly the elderly, and those with limited mobility.  The Northwest campus of UPMC has been a leader in telehealth and  telemedicine.   Telehealth options are becoming increasingly available in not only  rural communities, but across the country. Ninety percent of healthcare  executives say their organizations are developing or already offer  telehealth services, and in 2018, approximately 7 million individuals  took advantage of a telehealth consultation.                                time  1030    Telehealth services are a great tool for those who may live far away  from a hospital, but it also takes much of the hassle out of scheduling  an appointment and makes routine care much more efficient.   Mr. Speaker, I have been proud to assist in leading the advancement  of telehealth and telemedicine legislatively in this body, including  the STEP Act, which greatly expanded access to telemedicine to our  Active Duty military, Reserve, and Guard. That was signed by President  Obama in the VETS Act, which did the same thing for our American  veterans under the VA MISSION Act signed by President Trump.   As we continue to explore ways to increase access, affordability,  quality, and basic choice, telehealth or telemedicine must be a part of  that conversation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Centre County veteran James ``Big Jim'' Hibbert, a retired Marine Corps  staff sergeant.   Big Jim Hibbert honorably served in the United States Marine Corps  and the Army for more than 19 years during six overseas deployments,  including three combat deployments.   In 2019, during a meeting of the Spring Creek Chapter of Trout  Unlimited, Jim met a young Army veteran in mental distress after his  medications had been changed. The veteran had lost his job and was  experiencing a mental health crisis.   Jim had been trained by mental health professionals in listening  skills as a part of Trout Unlimited's Streamside Mentor program. He  immediately took action, establishing a rapport and assisting the  suicidal veteran.   Ultimately, Jim helped save his life that day. Because of this  selfless act and for his commitment to his fellow veterans, Jim is  being recognized by Trout Unlimited's Veteran Service Partnership  program.   Big Jim Hibbert continues to serve and support his fellow veterans  every day, and I thank Big Jim.                            ____________________
