 Madam Speaker, one of the greatest honors and  privileges of my life has been to serve with John Lewis whom I had the  privilege of calling a precious friend.   In August, 58 years ago, the young John Lewis led a march to  Washington with Martin Luther King and on August 16 of 1965, the  momentous Voting Rights Act was signed into law, thanks to John Lewis.   Today, on August 25, 2021, we are here to vote for the John R. Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act. A bill that he almost gave his life to  pass all of those years ago will now restore the power of the Voting  Rights Act, the right to vote, in the new legislation named for our  dear friend and the conscience of this Congress. Let's vote ``yes.''
