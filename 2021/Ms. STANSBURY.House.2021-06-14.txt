 Madam Speaker, I rise today as the newest  Representative for New Mexico's First Congressional District.   As Secretary Deb Haaland said in her farewell before this body: We  are called to service in different ways.   I stand here today because I believe that we are called to build a  world that is more just, more equitable, and more resilient.   I ran for Congress because I believe deeply in our communities and  our ability to bring meaningful change, and that the weight of history  and of all future generations is on us to do so.   As a New Mexican, I know that we are strong and we are proud and that  our work is to lift up our communities to fight for the dignity and  well-being of our people, to rebuild our economy, and to tackle the  biggest challenges of our day. We are called to do this work because  the moment is now, and our future depends upon it, which is why I,  Madam Speaker, am so proud to be able to serve alongside you as New  Mexico's next Congresswoman.                            ____________________
