 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate:  First of all, to my friend and colleague, Senator Brown, I thank you  for the opportunity to participate today, and I hope to do my best to  add a feeling of strength to the message that Dr. Martin Luther King  shared in his letter.   This is a reading from a ``Letter From Birmingham Jail,'' Dr. Martin  L. King Jr., April 16, 1963.         My Dear Fellow Clergymen:        While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came       across your recent statement calling my present activities       ``unwise and untimely.'' Seldom do I pause to answer       criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all the       criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would have       little time for anything other than such correspondence in       the course of the day, and I would have no time for       constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of       genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set       forth, I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope       will be patient and reasonable terms.        I think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham,       since you have been influenced by the view which argues       against ``outsiders coming in.'' I have the honor of serving       as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,       an organization operating in every southern state, with       headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty five       affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is       the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Frequently,       we share staff, educational and financial resources with our       affiliates. Several months ago the affiliate here in       Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent       direct action program if such were deemed necessary. We       readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our       promise. So I, along with several members of my staff, am       here because I was invited here. I am here because I have       organizational ties here.        But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is       here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left       their villages and carried their ``thus saith the Lord'' far       beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the       Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the       gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman       world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom       beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond       to the Macedonian call for aid.        Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all       communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and       not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice       anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in       an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment       of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all       indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the       narrow, provincial `outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives       inside the United States can never be considered an outsider       anywhere within its bounds.        You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham.       But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a       similar concern for the conditions that brought about the       demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest       content with the superficial kind of social analysis that       deals merely with effects and does not grapple with       underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are       taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate       that the city's white power structure left the Negro       community with no alternative.        In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps:       collection of the facts to determine whether injustices       exist; negotiation; self purification; and direct action. We       have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be       no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs this       community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly       segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of       brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced       grossly unjust treatment in the courts. There have been       more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in       Birmingham than in any other city in the nation. These are       the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the basis of these       conditions, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the       city fathers. But the latter consistently refused to       engage in good faith negotiation.        Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with       leaders of Birmingham's economic community. In the course of       the negotiations, certain promises were made by the       merchants--for example, to remove the stores' humiliating       racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend       Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian       Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all       demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized       that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs,       briefly removed, returned; the others remained. As in so many       past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow       of deep disappointment settled upon us. We had no alternative       except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would present       our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the       conscience of the local and the national community. Mindful       of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a       process of self purification. We began a series of workshops       on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves: ``Are you       able to accept blows without retaliating?'' ``Are you able to       endure the ordeal of jail?'' We decided to schedule our       direct action program for the Easter season, realizing that       except for Christmas, this is the main shopping period of the       year. Knowing that a strong economic-withdrawal program would       be the byproduct of direct action, we felt that this would be       the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants for       the needed change.        Then it occurred to us that Birmingham's mayoral election       was coming up in March, and we speedily decided to postpone       action until after election day. When we discovered that the       Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene ``Bull'' Connor, had       piled up enough votes to be in the run off, we decided again       to postpone action until the day after the run off so that       the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the issues.       Like many others, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, and       to this end, we endured postponement after postponement.       Having aided in this community need, we felt that our direct       action program could be delayed no longer.
