 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition  to H.R. 3004, Kate's Law. This is politically driven legislation  intended to create a fear of immigrants, even though repeated studies  have shown immigrants commit less crimes.   It enhances criminal penalties against immigrants, the vast majority  of whom have come here peacefully to rejoin loved ones. All that, and  it doesn't even do what it claims to, address the situation that led to  the tragic death of Kate Steinle.   There are those who might imply that this bill came from H.R. 15, the  comprehensive bipartisan immigration bill that could have passed the  House if allowed to vote on the floor, but this is not true. I know,  because I was one of the lead sponsors of this bill.   Our bill would have vastly improved the pathways to immigrate legally  to the U.S. This bill makes no distinction between those immigrants  trying to rejoin their families and those who may be prone to commit  crimes.   Instead, it treats all immigrants attempting to reenter the U.S. as  criminals and significantly expands sentences for persons with  misdemeanors such as driving without a license or loitering. Even  asylum seekers, who present themselves at the border to escape deadly  gang violence in their home country, could be subject to criminal  prosecution.   Turning our backs on asylum seekers and refugees doesn't make us  safer. It makes us weak, and it is just plain wrong.   We were horrified by Kate Steinle's murder, but the provisions in  this bill would not have prevented it. The man charged with killing her  was convicted for multiple illegal reentry offenses, serving more than  16 years in prison. He had been caught each time he attempted to cross  the border. His presence in San Francisco was not due to lax penalties  for reentry or weak border security.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided legislation ripped from  the pages of Donald Trump's mass deportation and anti-immigrant  playbook.   I include in the Record five documents from organizations that are  opposed to this bill as well as the sanctuary bill, and that is the  15,000 immigration lawyers and law professors who are members of the  American Immigration Lawyers Association; the 1.6 million members of  the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or  AFSCME; the 2 million members of the Service Employees International  Union, SEIU; the Asian Americans Advancing Justice; and the Fair  Immigration Reform Movement.                                                American Immigration                                             Lawyers Association,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.      Statement of the American Immigration Lawyers Association           Opposing the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R.           3003) and ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004)      Contact: Gregory Chen, Director of Government Relations.        As the national bar association of over 15,000 immigration       lawyers and law professors, the American Immigration Lawyers       Association (AILA) opposes ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act''       (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004). AILA recommends       that members of Congress reject these bills which are       scheduled to come before the House Rules Committee on June 27       and to the floor shortly thereafter. Though Judiciary       Chairman Goodlatte stated that the bills will ``enhance       public safety,'' they will do just the opposite: undermine       public safety and make it even harder for local law       enforcement to protect their residents and communities. In       addition, the bills which were made public less than a week       before the vote and completely bypassed the Judiciary       Committee, include provisions that will result in violations       of due process and the Fourth and Tenth Amendments to the       Constitution.        At a time when over 9 out of 10 Americans support       immigration reform and legalization of the undocumented,       Republican leadership is asking the House to vote on       enforcement-only bills that will lead to more apprehensions,       deportations, and prosecutions of thousands of immigrants and       their families who have strong ties to the United States.       Instead of criminalizing and scapegoating immigrants,       Congress should be offering workable reforms that will       strengthen our economy and our country.                The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003         H.R. 3003 would undermine public safety and interfere with       local policing.        H.R. 3003 would amend 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1373 to prevent states       or localities from establishing laws or policies that       prohibit or ``in any way'' restrict compliance with or       cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The bill       dramatically expands 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1373 which is more       narrowly written and prohibits local law enforcement from       restricting the sharing and exchange of information with       federal authorities, but only with respect to an individual's       citizenship or immigration status.        Rather than empowering localities, the extremely broad       wording of H.R. 3003 would strip localities of the ability to       enact common-sense crime prevention policies that ensure       victims of crime will seek protection and report crimes. The       bill would also undermine public safety by prohibiting DHS       from  [[Page H5345]]       honoring criminal warrants of communities deemed ``sanctuary       cities'' if the individual being sought by local law       enforcement has a final order of removal.        Under H.R. 3003, localities that fail to comply with       federal immigration efforts are penalized with the denial of       federal funding for critical law enforcement, national       security, drug treatment, and crime victim initiatives,       including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program       (SCAAP), Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and       Byrne JAG programs that provide hundreds of millions of       dollars to localities nationwide.        In an effort to force localities to engage in civil       immigration enforcement efforts, including those against       nonviolent undocumented immigrants, the bill would make it       far more difficult for many localities, including large       cities, to arrest and prosecute potentially dangerous       criminals. The bill could even offer criminals a form of       immunity, knowing that any crimes they commit in a designated       sanctuary city would result, at most, in their removal from       the country as opposed to criminal prosecution.        H.R. 3003 would run afoul of constitutional safeguards in       the Fourth Amendment.        By prohibiting localities from restricting or limiting       their own cooperation with federal immigration enforcement,       H.R. 3003 effectively compels localities to honor ICE       detainer requests--a controversial and constitutionally       suspect practice that is nonetheless widely-used by ICE.       Federal courts have found that ICE use of detainers violates       the Fourth Amendment, and that localities may be held liable       for honoring them.        The bill also expands detainer authority by establishing       that ICE may issue detainer requests for localities to hold       undocumented immigrants for up to 96 hours--twice what is       currently allowed--even if probable cause has not been shown.       Courts have concluded that localities cannot continue       detaining someone unless ICE obtains a warrant from a neutral       magistrate who has determined there is probable cause, or in       the case of a warrantless arrest, review by a neutral       magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. The expansive       provisions in H.R. 3003 would force localities to choose       between detaining people in violation of the Constitution or       being punished as a ``sanctuary city.''        Furthermore, this bill provides government actors and       private contractors with immunity if they are sued for       violating the Constitution. Provisions in this bill transfer       the financial burden of litigation by substituting the       federal government for the local officers as the defendant.       If H.R. 3003 becomes law, American taxpayers would be stuck       paying for lawsuits brought by those who are unjustly       detained.        The bill goes even further by creating a private right of       action allowing crime victims or their family members to sue       localities if the crime was committed by someone who was       released by the locality that did not honor an ICE detainer       request.        H.R. 3003 would violate the Tenth Amendment.        H.R. 3003 would compel states and localities to utilize       their local law enforcement resources to implement federal       civil immigration enforcement in violation of the Tenth       Amendment's ``commandeering'' principle. The Tenth Amendment       does not permit the federal government to force counties and       cities to allocate local resources, including police       officers, technology, and personnel, to enforce federal       immigration law. The federal government also cannot withhold       funds from localities refusing to participate in federal       efforts if the programs affected are unrelated to the purpose       of the federal program, or if the sanctions are punitive in       nature.        H.R. 3003 would expand detention without due process.        H.R. 3003 would increase the use of detention without       ensuring those detained have access to a bond determination.       Under the bill, nearly anyone who is undocumented, including       those who have overstayed their visa would be subject to       detention without a custody hearing. The bill also       establishes that DHS has the authority to detain individuals       ``without time limitation'' during the pendency of removal       proceedings. These provisions would dramatically expand the       federal government's power to indefinitely detain       individuals, and would likely result in ever growing numbers       of undocumented immigrants held in substandard detention       facilities.                            Kate's Law, H.R. 3004         H.R. 3004 would expand the already severe penalties in       federal law for illegal reentry (INA Sec. 276; 8 U.S.C.       Sec. 1326). The number of people prosecuted for illegal       reentry has grown steadily to about 20,000 prosecutions each       year, and such cases comprise more than one quarter of all       federal criminal prosecutions nationwide. H.R. 3004 adds       sentencing enhancements for people who are convicted of minor       misdemeanors and people who have reentered multiple times but       have no criminal convictions. This bill will not improve       public safety and will undermine due process and protections       for asylum seekers. H.R. 3004 would waste American taxpayer       funds by imposing severe prison sentences upon thousands of       people who pose no threat to the community and who have       strong ties to the country and are trying to unite with their       loved ones.        H.R. 3004 would impose severe sentencing enhancements upon       people with minor offenses.        H.R. 3004 would add sentencing enhancements for minor       misdemeanor convictions, including driving without a license       and other traffic-related offenses. Under the current version       of INA Sec. 276, if a person is charged with reentering the       U.S. after being removed, their punishment is enhanced by up       to ten years only if they have been convicted a felony or       three or more misdemeanors involving drugs or violence. Under       H.R. 3004 someone who has been convicted of any three       misdemeanors regardless of severity would be subject to a       term of up to ten years.        This expansion would unfairly target large numbers of       people who are not a threat to public safety but instead are       trying to reunite with family members and have other strong       ties to the United States. Currently half of all people       convicted of illegal reentry have one child living in the       country. Increasing sentences for illegal reentry would also       waste taxpayer dollars, costing huge amounts of money to lock       up non-violent people.        H.R. 3004 would punish people who attempt to seek asylum at       the border.        H.R. 3004 expands the provisions of INA Sec. 276 to punish       not only people who reenter the U.S. or attempt to reenter       the U.S., but also people who cross or attempt to cross the       border. The bill goes on to define ``crosses the border'' to       mean ``the physical act of crossing the border, regardless of       whether the alien is free from official restraint.'' That       means that people who present themselves at ports of entry to       request asylum and are taken into custody by CBP to await a       fear screening would be subject to criminal charges based on       a past removal, even though they are seeking refuge in the       U.S.        H.R. 3004 would impose severe sentencing enhancements for       people with multiple entries.        The bill would also create new sentencing enhancements for       people who have reentered the U.S. multiple times, even if       they have no other criminal convictions. If someone has been       removed three or more times, and is found in the United       States or attempts to cross the border again, H.R. 3004 law       would provide for sentencing enhancements of up to ten years.       The bill makes no exception for bona fide asylum seekers,       which means that people who are seeking refuge in the U.S.       from atrocities abroad could be subject to a lengthy prison       sentence under these provisions.        H.R. 3004 would undermine due process by blocking       challenges to unfair removal orders.        The bill will prevent an individual from challenging the       validity of a removal order, even it was fundamentally unfair       in the first place. The Supreme Court held in U.S. v.       Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828 (1987) that due process requires       that a challenge be allowed if a deportation proceeding is       used as an element of a criminal offense and where the       proceeding ``effectively eliminate[d] the right of the alien       to obtain judicial review.'' This provision in H.R. 3004 is       likely unconstitutional and will cause grave injustice to       defendants, such as asylum seekers who were deported without       the opportunity to seek asylum.                                   ____                                                           AFSCME,                                      Washington, DC, June 28, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to oppose the punitive and       unnecessary No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) and       its companion bill that increases penalties for certain       immigrants (H.R. 3004). These bills together weaken the       rights of immigrants, cut funding to vital state and local       programs, and further criminalize immigrants.        H.R. 3003 and 3004 are deeply flawed pieces of legislation       that would add chaos to an already broken immigration system       when comprehensive reform is what is needed. The bills       undermine state and local policing strategies that have       worked well for many communities. Implementing this ``one       size fits all'' approach, as proposed in these bills,       jeopardizes the trust that diverse communities have placed in       their police force and undermines federal grants that are       aimed at helping law enforcement and that support the very       programs needed to reduce crime.        H.R. 3003 forces communities to devote local resources to       enforcing federal immigration law and penalizes them if they       don't comply. H.R. 3004 mandates increased penalties on       immigrants for reentry, which could lead to a large increase       in the prison population without additional resources. This       would create new financial liability for federal, state, and       local governments, that are already cash strapped, at a time       when funding is urgently needed for investments in public       safety, infrastructure and other vital community needs.        We urge the House to reject both H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004.            Sincerely,                                                     Scott Frey,       Director of Federal Legislative Affairs.                                   ____                                                             SEIU,                                      Washington, DC, June 28, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the two million members       of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), I urge       you to vote no on H.R. 3004 and H.R. 3003, which are       currently scheduled to come to the House floor this week.       These mean-spirited and unwise bills would waste taxpayer       dollars, shackle local law enforcement efforts to  [[Page H5346]]       protect the public, and make our nation's immigration laws       even meaner and less reasonable than they already are.        H.R. 3004, ``Kate's Law,'' would increase the prison       population of nonviolent offenders who pose no public safety       risk, without evidence that its harsh provisions would have       any impact on unlawful immigration, and without any other       justification of its cost or impact on prison overcrowding.       Those affected would include immigrants who have only       committed minor misdemeanors such as driving without a       license or other traffic-related offenses, and others who       have never committed any crimes besides unauthorized entry.       H.R. 3004 would also penalize persons fleeing persecution who       voluntarily present themselves at the border to apply for       asylum, and it would short circuit the current minimal due       process protections that protect persons whose previous       deportation was unlawful.        H.R. 3003, the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' is       intended to commandeer state and local law enforcement       resources to perform federal deportation activities. It is       one part of the ongoing effort to villainize immigrants by       unfairly--and against all available evidence--painting them       all with a criminal brush for the misdeeds of a few. Rather       than protecting the public, the provisions of H.R. 3003 would       frustrate policies by states and localities that increase       public safety by encouraging cooperation between law       enforcement and the communities they serve. There is mounting       evidence that localities with such policies experience lower       crime because they build trust between the police and those       they serve, thereby inspiring the community collaboration and       assistance that is a key ingredient to maintaining safe       neighborhoods.        It should be pointed out that the provisions of H.R. 3003       are sufficiently radical that even those who do not support       sanctuary cities should vote no. The bill would deny       important law enforcement funding to localities that are       unwilling to honor any and all federal immigration detainer       requests, including requests that courts have said are       unconstitutional. It would empower private individuals to sue       a locality if they or their family are victimized by a crime       committed by an individual who was released despite a federal       detainer request. It would render local governments powerless       to prioritize local needs over immigration enforcement, even       for local agencies funded by local taxes. And, if that       weren't enough, a separate provision would significantly       increase the categories of individuals subject to mandatory       detention and prolonged detention without bond, thereby       filling local jails and private prisons with individuals who       pose no danger to themselves and no flight risk.        For the reasons listed above, both of these bills should be       defeated. SEIU therefore asks you to vote no, and may add       votes on any of them to our scorecard. If you have any       questions, please contact Josh Bernstein.

Five Civil Rights Organizations Oppose Latest Immigration Actions in                                 the House    house republicans introduce two anti-immigrant bills during immigrant                               heritage month         Washington, DC.--Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.)       introduced a set of anti-immigrant bills that are scheduled       for a vote later this week. These are the latest in a line of       bills that outline a clear anti-immigrant strategy by House       leadership and this administration.        H.R. 3003 seeks to authorize the Federal Government to       withhold millions of dollars in federal funding for       localities with limited detainer policies, sanctuary city       policies, and community trust policies aimed at complying       with the Constitution and making communities safer. H.R. 3004       would expand the Federal Government's ability to prosecute       people for illegal reentry into the U.S., excludes       humanitarian exemptions for people fleeing violence, and       heightens penalties in those cases.        Asian Americans Advancing Justice, an affiliation of five       civil rights organizations, issues the following statement in       response:        ``Asian Americans Advancing Justice strongly opposes H.R.       3003 (the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act), H.R. 3004 (known       as Kate's Law), and the passage of any immigration       enforcement legislation that would increase indiscriminate       enforcement, further the criminalization of immigrants, and       instill more fear in already terrified communities.       Approximately 40 percent of all immigrants come to the U.S.       from Asia, and 1.6 million of those immigrants are       undocumented. Anti-immigrant policies create a climate of       fear for all immigrants, regardless of status.        We are horrified and dismayed that House leadership has       chosen to line up behind the administration in its       scapegoating of immigrants. Both of these bills further the       administration's goals of criminalizing all immigrants and       expanding mass incarceration. Since the administration failed       in its attempt to strip funding from municipalities with       sanctuary and community trust policies in federal court, it       is looking for Congress to fulfill its anti-immigrant agenda.        There is abundant evidence that sanctuary and community       trust policies make communities safer. As Arizona and Texas       have shown us, forcing local law enforcement to enforce       immigration laws increases racial profiling and distrust of       law enforcement by communities of color.        Rapidly pushing these bills through the House as America       looks toward a holiday that celebrates the best of our       American ideals is clearly an effort to slide this       legislation under the radar of anyone who would oppose it,       including millions of Americans who support immigrants'       rights.        Vilifying and punishing immigrants who may be fleeing       violence or seeking a better life for their families does not       makes us safer, just inhumane. We call on Congress to reject       this latest anti-immigrant strategy. This vote will be a test       for Members of Congress to show which side of justice they       are on.''        Asian Americans Advancing Justice is a national affiliation       of five leading organizations advocating for the civil and       human rights of Asian Americans and other underserved       communities to promote a fair and equitable society for all.

House GOP Continues Cruel Crusade Against Immigrants         Washington.--Kica Matos, spokesperson for the Fair       Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), issued the statement       below after the House voted on the No Sanctuary for Criminals       Act and Kate's Law:        ``Republicans in the House are hell bent on criminalizing       the hard working immigrants who contribute so much to our       country. This week they voted on two heartless bills that do       nothing more than continue to fuel Trump's deportation       machine.        The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act punishes ``sanctuary       cities,'' local jurisdictions addressing immigration issues       without federal interference, and expands the government's       inhumane practice of indefinite detention of immigrants.        The second bill, ``Kate's Law'' is a thinly veiled attempt       to give prosecutors more power to continue the vicious mass       incarceration of black and brown people by expanding on legal       penalties for re-entry. The bill also limits the already       limited protections for people reentering the country for       humanitarian reasons.        The attacks on brown and black people by Republicans are       not going unnoticed. The people are on our side--they marched       with us on May 1st, they showed up after Trump issued the       first refugee ban and they called out elected officials at       town halls. Our message to Congress is clear: the only       solution to fix the broken immigration system is a pathway to       citizenship.        These two bills are the antithesis of our values and should       be condemned by everyone.        The Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM) is the nation's       largest immigrant-rights coalition, with grassroots       organizations fighting for immigrant rights at the local,       state and federal level.
