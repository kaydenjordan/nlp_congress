 Mr. President, once again, congratulations on your  election. I haven't gotten a chance to talk with the Presiding Officer  in detail about his path to the U.S. Senate, but I have had a chance to  talk to a lot of my colleagues about how they got here, and I think we  can all agree it is not often a real pleasant experience. You get your  name dragged through the mud. You get called all sorts of names. You  have to call lots of friends and strangers and ask them for money. It  is no walk in the park to run for political office or to put your name  out there and be the subject of both praise and a lot of ridicule.   It is not surprising the reason that people do this. The reason that  the 100 of us have decided to run for office and to put ourselves out  there in the public spotlight is because we deeply care about our  neighbors, about the people who live in our States. We are doing this  job, to a man and woman, because we want to make life better for  people; in particular, people who have been just thrown big curveballs  by life.   I grew up in a pretty economically secure house, but I understand a  lot of kids don't have that opportunity, and I feel like both  Republicans and Democrats are here because we want to lift those kids  up. I have had a pretty healthy life, a few bumps and bruises along the  way, but I feel like both Republicans and Democrats are here because we  get that other people aren't as fortunate. They got sick. They got  diagnosed with something terrible. Our role should be to try to help  get them some cures or some treatments.   We are here not because we think it is fun to run elections, we are  not here because we like the look of our name on the door, we are here  because we care desperately about people. I think this is what Senator  King was getting at in his remarks. All of the tabloids and the TV news  shows, they spend 80 percent of their time focusing on politics, and we  end up chasing our tail off in here because if the daily political rags  and the cable news shows are talking about politics, then maybe we  should be talking and thinking about politics as well, but that is not  why we decided to do this. We decided to run for the Senate because we  care about people.   Why we are here tonight is pretty simple. Ultimately, the repeal of  the Affordable Care Act, with no replacement, with no plan for what  comes next, will hurt millions of real people in very real ways. In the  end, I don't believe that my Republican colleagues want to cast a vote  that will do that.   This tall guy right here is Josh Scussell. He lives in Connecticut.  He is from Guilford. He is standing next to his bone marrow donor and  her boyfriend. This is Josh's wife. Josh was diagnosed with stage IV  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2012.   Here is what Josh says. He will tell you the unvarnished truth. Josh  says: ``The ACA is entirely responsible for me still being alive.''   He relapsed after an additional diagnosis before he turned 26, and  the only way he was able to get insurance was because of the Affordable  Care Act, which allowed him to stay on his mother's insurance up until  he turned 26. During the course of his treatments, he underwent stem  cell transplants, which could be up to $200,000 each. Because of those  transplants, he needed ongoing weekly treatments at a cost of $10,000  per treatment.   He recalled how he was getting his first stem cell transplant and he  was in the hospital during the Supreme Court deliberations on the  Affordable Care Act. He said, ``I was in a hospital bed watching the  TV, when the Supreme Court approved the ACA, and just the feeling I had  in my body was a feeling that I had never experienced before because I  knew that I was going to be taken care of.''   Josh is in remission. In a few more years of being cancer-free, the  doctors tell him he might be out of the woods. He says, ``I'm more  fearful for other people in my position. . . . Because there's no way I  would have been able to afford any of those treatments'' if it wasn't  for the Affordable Care Act.   This little guy, his name is Rylan. This is his mother Isabelle.  Rylan was born with a congenital heart defect. One day he had to be  rushed to Connecticut Children's Medical Center for emergency open- heart surgery to keep him alive. Isabelle says that she never really  thought about health insurance. She knew she had it, but she didn't  really think about it until Rylan went for that emergency surgery. She  thought: Oh, no, is our insurance going to cover it? Will they cover  all the treatments he needs going forward now that he will have had a  preexisting condition? She found out that the Affordable Care Act  protected her because it eliminated a common practice of insurance  companies to cap the amount of coverage you get in any one given year  or over the course of your lifetime.    Isabelle tells it plainly. She says:         Without the Affordable Care Act, we would have never been       able to afford the care for Rylan. We would have had to make       awful decisions--decisions about whether we kept our house,       kept our car, whether we could still afford to work.    It was the Affordable Care Act that protected her and her family.   Finally, this is John. John is a hero in my book. John was born with  cystic fibrosis. John tells the story about how health care is the most  important thing to him in the world. It is more important than salary.  It is more important than his job. It is more important than friends.  He struggles every day to live. The only way he lives is that he is  able to take medications that allow him to continue to breathe and that  allow his lungs to continue to function amidst this crippling disease  and diagnosis.   John is on the Affordable Care Act, and John will tell you, just as  plainly as Josh and Isabelle, that without the Affordable Care Act, he  would die--not 2 years from now, not 3 years from now. John would die  within a matter of weeks because without his medications, he cannot  live.   It is not hyperbole to suggest that the absence of the Affordable  Care Act is a matter of life and death. John will tell you that without  the Affordable Care Act, he doesn't have insurance. Without insurance,  he cannot afford the medications to keep him alive. Without the  medications to keep him alive, John disappears from this Earth.   These are real people. I care about them because I know them, and I  have had the chance to meet John and Isabelle and Josh. But you have  these people in your State as well. My Republican colleagues have just  as many of them. Some of the biggest numbers of enrollment in the  Affordable Care Act aren't in States represented by Democrats; they are  in States represented by Republicans. And this mythology that the  Affordable Care Act hasn't worked or that it is in some death spiral is  just political rhetoric. It is not true.   This is an AP fact check story from today, I believe. Here is the  beginning of it. It says:         President-elect Donald Trump says that President Barack       Obama's health care law ``will fall of its own weight.''        House speaker Paul Ryan says the law is ``in what the       actuaries call a death spiral.''        And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that ``by       nearly any measure, ObamaCare has failed.''    The AP says:         The problem with all these claims: They are exaggerated, if       not downright false.   The Affordable Care Act has not failed for the 20 million Americans  who have insurance now because of it. The Affordable Care Act has not  failed for the millions more who are paying less because insurance  companies can no longer discriminate against them if they have a  preexisting condition. The Affordable Care Act has not failed for  seniors all across this country who are on Medicare and are paying less  for prescription drugs.   There is no doubt that the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect.  Medicare wasn't perfect when it was passed. We amended it 18 different  times. The Affordable Care Act needs to be amended and perfected, as  well, but if you really care about people instead of political  headlines, then the prescription here is simple: Stop. Take a step  back. Don't  [[Page S177]]  lurch the entire health care economy into chaos when you don't have to.   I am pretty sure that Donald Trump is going to be President for the  next 2 years. I am pretty sure that Republicans are going to control  the Senate and the House of Representatives for the next 24 months. You  have time. You don't need to prove some point to the political talk  show hosts and the conservative radio commentators. You can step back  and rescue these real people from the fate that you are about to  subject them to by--instead of engaging in a partisan repeal with no  replacement for what comes next--reaching out across the aisle and  working with Democrats to try to fix this law.   I have been here the last 6 years. I was part of the passage of this  law when I was in the House of Representatives. I have listened to my  colleagues say, literally tens of thousands of times in Washington and  across the country, that their priority was to repeal and replace this  law. I watched on TV our President-elect say in response to a question  about the process for health care repeal going forward:         No, we are going to do it simultaneously [repeal and       replace the law]. It'll be just fine. We are not going to       have, like, a two-day period and we are not going to have a       two-year period where there is nothing. It will be repealed       and replaced.    There will not be a 2-day period in between repeal and replace. And  that is what I heard from my Republican colleagues: Put your vote where  your mouth has been because the alternative is a death spiral.   The Associated Press calls the mistruths out and says: No, the  Affordable Care Act is not in a death spiral. But those same health  care economists who are quoted in that story will tell you that if you  repeal this bill without any replacement for what happens next, that is  what creates the death spiral. Why? Because when you put a clock  ticking on the life of the Affordable Care Act, then a couple of things  happen. First, people who need some procedure done rush into those  exchanges and they drive up the actuarial cost, and insurers just look  at themselves and say: Why would you hang around for that? And they  bolt. So the Affordable Care Act falls apart if you telegraph to people  that you have only 1 year or 2 years left.   You don't have to do this. You don't have to visit that kind of harm  on real people. I know that is not why Republicans ran for office. I  know we have philosophical differences on how to get health care to  people, about how to insure more people, but let us sit down and figure  out a middle ground so we can save the lives of all these people who  are relying on us.   What we are doing right now is extraordinary. This is absolutely  extraordinary. We were sworn in less than a week ago. The new President  has not even been inaugurated. There isn't even a conceptual plan for  what will replace the Affordable Care Act, and we are rushing forward  with repeal. There is an enthusiasm to this cruelty that is hard to  understand.   I hope that some of the Republicans who just in the last 24 hours  have called for a delay in this debate are heard by Republican  leadership. I know that Democrats will continue to be on this floor to  make this case. I guess I am still optimistic enough about what is  still a pretty broken town that, in the end, my Republican friends  aren't so cold-hearted, aren't so barbaric as to take away insurance  from people like those we have been talking about here today when there  is an alternative, when there is another way, when there is no  political imperative to do this kind of damage to people right now.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.
