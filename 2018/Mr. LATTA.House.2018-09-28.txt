 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6. This legislation will  make a significant difference to tens of thousands of Americans who are  struggling with addiction.   I am pleased that my bill, the INFO Act, is part of the fight against  the opioid crisis. The INFO Act is essential to ensuring we are  providing behavioral health professionals, advocates, physicians, and  families with the tools, resources, and funding information they need  to prevent, identify, and treat addiction.   Furthermore, H.R. 6 is critically important to stop the flow of  illegal opioids, prevent the misuse of drugs, and help those who are  addicted. With 190 Americans dying every day from overdoses, it is time  to act now.
