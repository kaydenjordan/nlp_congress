 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to first begin with thanking Chairman Engel  for his bipartisan work to craft legislation in response to this week's  developments.   We often say in our committee that politics stops at the water's  edge. And, in this time of crisis, I am proud to work with him to lead  the most bipartisan committee in the Congress.    Today may be a dark day, but it would be much darker if we were  divided instead of standing united.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this joint resolution. Simply put,  the catastrophe that has unfolded in Syria over the past 10 days is  almost beyond words.   I am concerned about the extreme, long-term damage this has caused  the United States interests in the Middle East and to the Syrian  people, including the Kurds.   The United States has worked for years to prevent an armed conflict  between our NATO ally Turkey and our Syrian Kurdish partners. Our  presence in Syria was critical to countering and defeating ISIS, and,  until last week, it helped prevent unnecessary bloodshed.   Working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the U.S. and our coalition  partners eliminated ISIS' control of territory in Syria and were  continuing to fight ISIS insurgents.   I understand the administration's legitimate concerns about engaging  our U.S. forces in long-term military operations. I, too, want to wind  down our overseas conflicts and bring our troops home. But, leaving  northwest Syria now does not resolve the problem that brought us there  in the first place; it only creates more.   We need a residual force in place. The consequences of this decision  have already unfolded before our very eyes. We have betrayed the trust  of our Kurdish partners who fought bravely with us against ISIS to  defeat and destroy the caliphate, and they paid a heavy price in  thousands of lives lost.  [[Page H8159]]    We must remember that Turkey's offensive affects not only Kurds but  also the people of northeastern Syria. So far, dozens of civilians have  been killed and over 160,000 people have been displaced.   Islamic State prisoners, Jihadists and affiliates, are already  breaking free, reversing our hard-fought gains to defeat these  dangerous terrorists.   And, now, our Syrian Kurdish partners have struck a deal with the  Syrian regime. This gives Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers  more territory and opportunity to advance their destabilizing agendas,  including their war on the Syrian people.                                time  1315    My colleague Eliot Engel and I drafted this resolution to show that  we do not support this decision by the administration and to call on  Turkey to end this destructive campaign in Syria.   We urge the United States to support the affected communities of  northeast Syria, including the Kurds. We call upon the administration  to support our Kurdish partners and stand with them just like they have  stood with us for so long.   Given the grave implications that an ISIS resurgence would have for  our homeland security, we call on the administration to provide an  updated counter-ISIS strategy.   I do support the administration's decision to impose sanctions on key  Turkish officials and make clear that there are more consequences for  continuing this invasion. But more pressure is needed.   Congress is only just beginning its work to repair the damage this  decision has caused. Chairman Engel and I are working together on a  bipartisan bill to sanction Turkey for as long as it continues this  destructive offensive. I look forward to working with the chairman to  bring this bill to the floor as soon as possible.   I urge all Members to support this joint resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Hurd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Reed).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   This is one of those rare moments in Congress when we see both sides  coming together, exercising our Article I constitutional  responsibilities on foreign policy. I can't think of a better committee  than this, the Foreign Affairs Committee, to stand unified as a  Congress.   This is not just the House, Mr. Speaker. This is a joint resolution  with the Senate. This is going to pass the House and the Senate,  sending a strong message about our foreign policy.   I believe that we learn from history. The National Archives has an  inscription that says, ``What is past is prologue.'' You see, history  repeats itself, and we need to learn the lessons from history.   I remember after we withdrew out of Europe after World War I, it  allowed the forces of Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler to raise its ugly  head, and it took the Marshall Plan to finally put an end to it.   Then as recently as 2011, in the previous administration, President  Obama pulled 10,000 troops out of Iraq. My side of the aisle strongly  objected to that foreign policy decision, arguing that it would create  a wave of terrorism, and we were right. ISIS reared its ugly head, and  the caliphate was formed.   Mr. Speaker, you and I served on the Homeland Security Committee. In  the years 2015 to 2016, the terror threat was frightening. My threat  briefings were frightening in the SCIF.   External operations being plotted out of Iraq and Syria to kill  Americans in the United States, almost one per month, we stopped 95  percent of those threats. The 5 percent is what the American people  know about.   But I will tell you this--from that experience, have not we learned  anything?--that we need a residual force, if anything, to protect the  homeland from terror threats.   Now we have over 10,000 ISIS in-country and over 70,000 family  members that are there as part of the insurgency. We had over 30,000 at  the time of the peak of the ISIS caliphate. And we can't go back.    I am concerned, Mr. Speaker, that this move will embolden the  Russians. The Russians have already gone to our military's campsites  and mocked us. They are mocking the United States of America. Iran is  there, and ISIS is now emboldened.   We need a residual force to protect us, as we had in Iraq. We need  that in Syria, and, yes, we need that in Afghanistan. We can wind down  the number of troops, but we need that residual force.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close by saying that I will never forget  talking to Condoleezza Rice after she retired at Stanford, and she said  that one axiom is true in foreign policy: Your allies must trust you.   Our allies are questioning us right now. We told them, ``Trust us. We  have your back.''   What is happening now, the Kurds are being slaughtered as I speak in  northern Syria.   She also said another thing: Our allies must trust us, and our  enemies must fear us.   That is my foreign policy. It is Condoleezza Rice's foreign policy. I  think it is a good foreign policy.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for working with me to stand up on  this very important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
