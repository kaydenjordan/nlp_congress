 Madam Speaker, I rise today due to my strong concerns  with the Democrats' COVID-19 bill. With a very small percentage of this  massive package specifically directed at combating COVID-19, the $1.9  trillion COVID bill is more of a Democratic wish list.   I have tried to add relief for healthcare providers, with funds  specifically for rural and Medicaid providers, but Democrats voted this  down.   It is amazing how it is okay to have the Silicon Valley subway, the  Seaway bridge in New York, and a bailout of multiemployer pension plans  from problems prior to COVID-19, but my amendment to help healthcare  providers was not included.   I was proud to support the last five COVID-19 relief packages to help  Kentuckians. I think we can all agree that we need to boost vaccine  distribution, safely return all students back to in-person learning,  and help people return to work. Much of the funds in this partisan bill  will not be used until next year or later.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
