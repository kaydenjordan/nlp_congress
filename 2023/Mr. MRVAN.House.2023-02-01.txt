 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my appreciation for another  recent success for the First District of Indiana from the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   Just this week, the Department of Transportation shared that the  cities of East Chicago, Gary, and Hammond received funding under the  Safe Streets and Roads for All grant program to develop plans for  infrastructure projects designed to reduce transportation-related  fatalities and serious injuries.   I am grateful for all the leaders and public servants in these cities  putting in the work to successfully obtain and utilize this new Federal  resource.   As we proceed, I look forward to continuing to work with all local  stakeholders and my colleagues to support and promote the safety of our  transportation infrastructure so that all individuals and businesses  can continue to thrive and attract new economic activity to our  communities.                            ____________________
