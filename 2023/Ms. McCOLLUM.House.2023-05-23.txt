 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 11, the  latest Republican attack on clean air protections.   Heavy-duty vehicles make up approximately 6 percent of vehicles on  the road but generate 59 percent of dangerous nitrogen oxide  (NOX) pollution. This rule, issued in December 2022, is  targeted at reducing the air quality impacts of heavy-duty engines  beginning in Model Year 2027 and protecting clean air. Changing the  standard for heavy-duty engines and vehicles is expected to reduce  dangerous NOX pollution by nearly 50 percent by 2045. This  rule was created with trucking, engine manufacturing, and other  industry stakeholders and will be the first update to heavy-duty  vehicle emission standards in 20 years.   Every American deserves access to clean air, yet approximately 72  million Americans are exposed to higher levels of air pollution due to  their close proximity to high-traffic trucking routes. These Americans  are more likely to be low-income and communities of color. It is  estimated that the EPA's new rule will lower respiratory illness,  cardiovascular problems, and cases of childhood and adult asthma caused  by exposure to dangerous pollution. I am proud of the historic  investments Democrats made last Congress to develop cleaner, zero- emission technologies that will protect public health. Passing S.J.  Res. 11 would abandon the progress we have made to address public  health concerns and promote environmental justice in our Nation's  infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, not only will S.J. Res. 11 disproportionally harm  children, the elderly, and communities of color, but it would block the  Biden Administration, or any future administration, from taking  meaningful action to curb dangerous NOX pollution from  heavy-duty vehicles.   It should be rejected.
