 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 414, I call  up the bill (H.R. 3003) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to  modify provisions relating to assistance by States, and political  subdivision of States, in the enforcement of Federal immigration laws,  and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3003.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the No Sanctuary for  Criminals Act. This simple, straightforward bill combats dangerous  sanctuary policies that permit criminals to go free. We are all too  familiar with how sanctuary policies have devastated families across  the United States, and today we are taking action to prevent these  senseless tragedies and save American lives.   For years, the lack of immigration enforcement and spread of  sanctuary policies have cost too many lives. The Obama administration  encouraged or, at the very least, turned a blind eye to jurisdictions  nationwide that implemented sanctuary policies designed to prevent U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement from being able to effectively  enforce Federal law. Foolhardy jurisdictions continue to pass  legislation and implement policies aimed at stymieing and maligning  Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   Earlier this year, a Baltimore City Council member introduced a  resolution calling on ICE to arrest only those posing a ``serious  risk.'' In discussing this initiative, the council member likened ICE  officers to Nazis several times. Such rhetoric is reprehensible,  creating a moral equivalent between genocide and a nation exercising a  fundamental right and obligation of sovereignty.   In a deeply troubling move on the other coast, San Francisco  announced that it would no longer participate in the Joint Terrorism  Task Force because of concerns that the task force's duties may  coincide with immigration enforcement.   Sanctuary policies often focus on flouting ICE detainers, notices  issued by ICE to allow it to take custody of aliens in law enforcement  custody in order to initiate removal proceedings.   These irresponsible policies have led to a sharp drop in ICE's intake  of aliens from criminal detention facilities, which forces ICE agents  to engage in the far more time-consuming and dangerous task of picking  them up on the streets. This, among other factors, led to a drop in the  number of criminal aliens removed from the interior of the United  States from almost 87,000 in fiscal year 2014 to approximately 63,500  the following 2 fiscal years.   We must discourage, not encourage, sanctuary policies and practices.  H.R. 3003 addresses sanctuary policies and also takes great strides in  clarifying Federal immigration detainer policy.   Since the 1990s, Federal law has barred jurisdictions from  restricting communication with Federal immigration officials regarding  immigration status; however, this provision has never been enforced.  H.R. 3003 amends current law and expands this prohibition against  impeding Federal law enforcement. Instead of merely focussing on  communication, the bill ensures that no jurisdiction may restrict  assistance or compliance with immigration enforcement.   To be clear, this bill imposes no affirmative duty to act on the part  of any jurisdiction. Should a jurisdiction not comply with this  provision, the jurisdiction will not be eligible for certain grant  programs administered by the Department of Justice and Homeland  Security. Eligibility for many of these grant programs is already  predicated on compliance with this provision in the Immigration and  Nationality Act.   This section is also in line with a recent memo by Attorney General  Sessions outlining compliance with this provision as the single factor  that the Justice Department will use in identifying sanctuary  jurisdictions.   Regarding detainer policy, Congress has long heard that jurisdictions  will not comply with ICE requests to hold individuals due to a lack of  probable cause inherent in the detainer. I am pleased that H.R. 3003  provides the probable cause standards necessary to ensure that ICE only  places detainers on aliens for whom they have probable cause and are  deportable.   In addition, the bill mandates that ICE must take custody of the  subject of a detainer within 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays.  Jurisdictions who comply in good faith with detainer requests will be  immune from liability associated with that detainer, and if such an  action does arise, the U.S. Government will substitute itself in as the  defendant. This ensures that jurisdictions do not go bankrupt defending  against never-ending litigation. And in those jurisdictions that refuse  to honor a detainer resulting in an alien committing a crime, the  victim or victim's family will be provided with the opportunity to  bring a lawsuit against that jurisdiction.   The third section of H.R. 3003 is named for Sarah Root and Grant  Ronnebeck, two young people whose lives were suddenly taken by criminal  aliens who remain at large today. This section was originally  introduced as separate bills by Judiciary Committee  [[Page H5319]]  members Steve King and Andy Biggs, who worked tirelessly to bring these  tragic cases to the attention of the committee and the Congress.   This section provides that aliens who are arrested or charged with  serious crimes that result in death or serious bodily injury of another  must be held without bond during the pendency of their removal  proceedings.                                time  1415    In addition, aliens convicted of even one drunk driving offense will  also be ineligible for bond during their removal proceedings. The  latter would have prevented the August 2010 death of Sister Denise  Mosier, a Catholic nun in Virginia, at the hands of a drunk driving  illegal alien who was released from ICE custody on bond. These classes  of individuals present a clear and present danger to society and should  not be permitted to roam our communities during the pendency of their  removal hearings.   The commonsense provisions of H.R. 3003 will provide better  immigration enforcement and the peace of mind that no criminal will be  provided sanctuary from our immigration laws.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. King), who is a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say to the  gentlewoman from northern California that what is crazy is what the  city of San Francisco is doing with their taxpayer dollars, since it  was reported just yesterday that San Francisco taxpayers could soon pay  $190,000 in a lawsuit settlement with an illegal immigrant who claimed  he was reported to Federal immigration authorities in violation of the  city of San Francisco's sanctuary city ordinance.                                time  1430    The city attorney's office confirmed this, and the settlement is  expected to be confirmed by San Francisco's supervisors in future  hearings.    I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.   Now, people who are murdered, people who are injured by people who  are unlawfully present in the United States should have their day in  court with the city of San Francisco or anyone else just as well as  they are apparently willing to pay money to people who are illegally in  the country because they were properly turned over to Federal  authorities to be deported from this country.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a member  of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire at this time how much time  is remaining on each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Black), the chairman of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond and  point out that many, many of the victims of these crimes are Hispanic,  African American, and others, and they were seated around the Cabinet  table at the White House yesterday pleading for this legislation  because they had lost their loved ones. They would much rather have  been able to rewind the tape and be with those loved ones who were  killed by people who were illegally present in the United States. The  victims would never have suffered if our laws had simply been enforced.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Dunn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First, let me be clear: the only law enforcement agencies that risk  losing any Federal grants because of this legislation are those  agencies that, without any outside compulsion, deliberately choose to  violate Federal law by outright prohibiting their law enforcement  officers from voluntarily communicating with ICE and cooperating with  it in the enforcement of Federal law.  [[Page H5329]]    Second, let me also be clear that this bill does not require State  and local law enforcement agencies to comply with ICE detainers, and it  does not seek to cut off any Federal grants to jurisdictions that  choose not to comply.   Finally, it is a long-settled principle of constitutional law. And  let me remind you that all of these law enforcement officers vowed to  defend the Constitution, and the Constitution grants supremacy to  Federal immigration law.   When there is a conflict with Federal immigration law, State laws  that are in conflict are invalid, preempted by Federal law under the  10th Amendment. Under the 10th Amendment, State and local law  enforcement agencies have no obligation to comply with unconstitutional  provisions of State or local law that asks them to violate title 8,  United States Code, section 1373.   Then, again, getting back to the amazing news that we have, the city  of San Francisco has just agreed to pay $190,000 to an illegal alien  because the San Francisco sheriff complied with an ICE detainer and  turned the alien over to ICE, apparently in violation of San Francisco  policy. That individual, under Federal law, because he was the victim  of a crime, will be eligible to apply for a U visa.   Respect for the rule of law is the way to keep communities safe.  Respect for the rule of law is the way to make sure that people like  Kate Steinle are not murdered in the city of San Francisco, as we have  heard of other murders all during the debate today, by people who are  unlawfully present in the United States. Therefore, they are all  preventable crimes.   Law enforcement in this country needs to cooperate. Most law  enforcement officers want that to be done. Let's support them, let's  support this legislation, and make sure that the rule of law is upheld.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman is quite correct:  everyone deserves to feel safe.   Kate Steinle deserved to feel safe when she was walking down the pier  with her father in San Francisco, when she was killed.   Not enacting this legislation endangers public safety, not the  opposite, as those on the other side have argued.   How would you trust local government officials, who have instructed  their law enforcement officers to not cooperate with Federal law  enforcement officers to take dangerous criminals off of our streets,  when this motion to recommit would say: ``Oh, they will have to certify  that such compliance would endanger public safety and then the law  wouldn't apply?''  [[Page H5333]]    It is circular reasoning.   The nonenforcement of immigration laws has led to the bolstering of  sanctuary jurisdiction policies in communities throughout the United  States. These policies hamper the enforcement of Federal law and do  nothing to truly promote trust between law enforcement and U.S.  citizens.   This bill provides a commonsense approach to fixing the damage caused  by sanctuary policies without mandating any affirmative duty. In order  to be in compliance with section 1373 of the Immigration and  Nationality Act, as amended in this bill, States and localities have no  affirmative duties to act. They have no obligations to cooperate or  communicate, or even engage with U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement at any level.                                time  1530    Instead, they simply may not affirmatively restrict a government  entity, including law enforcement, from cooperating or communicating  with ICE.   So I am shocked that so many on the other side of the aisle view  compliance with this provision as a condition for eligibility for  certain grant programs as outlandish. This is not a novel concept. And  compliance with section 1373 is already a condition of eligibility for  these grant programs.   As for detainers, H.R. 3003 creates the probable cause standard that  so many have argued was lacking for so long. Once enacted, States and  localities can look to Federal law to receive clarification on what  probable cause standard is employed before a detainer request is  placed.   To further aid jurisdictions, the threat of expensive and time- consuming frivolous litigation is abated by providing immunity for  jurisdictions that exercise good faith in honoring a detainer.   Finally, this bill ensures that dangerous criminal aliens convicted  of drunk driving or not yet convicted of very serious crimes are  prevented from freely walking the streets of our communities during  their removal hearings. This bill is a strong first step in ensuring  that our immigration laws are enforced.   I urge my colleagues to vote down this motion to recommit, to vote  for the base bill, and to send a message that sanctuary policies will  not be tolerated so that the rule of law will prevail.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 415, I call  up the bill (H.R. 3004) to amend section 276 of the Immigration and  Nationality Act relating to reentry of removed aliens, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3004.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, for too long, illegal reentry of criminal aliens has  been viewed as a minor felony with only a fraction of those repeat  offenders ever seeing the inside of a Federal courtroom. Section 276 of  the Immigration and Nationality Act provides Federal prosecutors with  the tools necessary to truly deter criminal aliens from reentering the  United States.   Unfortunately, the section simply does not go far enough to act as a  deterrent. Criminal aliens view the risk as worth the reward, as most  charged under this section of law are given minuscule sentences that  belie the severity of the crime.   Aliens who reenter the United States after being removed, demonstrate  a flagrant disregard for our immigration laws and pose a tremendous  threat to public safety and national security in every community  nationwide.   This Congress has heard from countless victims and family members of  victims whose lives were forever changed or completely destroyed by  criminal aliens preying on our citizens.   This bill is named in memory and in honor of Kate Steinle. On July 1,  2015, Ms. Steinle was enjoying an evening at a popular attraction in  San Francisco with her father. As three shots were fired, Ms. Steinle  collapsed screaming. Her father, Jim, performed CPR until paramedics  arrived, but she ultimately succumbed to the severe damage caused by  the bullet and she died hours later.   Her murderer was arrested an hour later and identified as a middle- aged criminal alien who had been removed from the United States and had  returned at least five times. The gun used had been stolen from a  Federal officer with the Bureau of Land Management.   Mr. Speaker, these horrific events must be better deterred and  prevented. No legislation can prevent every tragic situation, but this  Congress has a duty to take every action possible to mitigate this harm  and danger.   It is in this vein that I am proud to bring Kate's Law to the House  floor today. This bill seeks to amend and greatly improve section 276  of the Immigration and Nationality Act by enhancing the maximum  sentences for criminal aliens who seek to reenter the United States.   While an alien reentering this country is subject to a sentence of up  to 2 years, current law only subjects certain criminals to enhance  penalties. Specifically, only criminal aliens previously convicted of  an aggravated felony, as defined in our immigration laws, controlled  substance violations, crimes against other persons, or certain felonies  would trigger an enhanced sentence of either 10 or 20 years.   Kate's Law closes the loophole into which so many criminal aliens  fall. The bill provides that a criminal alien, previously convicted of  any three misdemeanors or any felony, would, upon conviction for  illegal reentry, be subject to a maximum sentence of 10 years.   Aliens previously convicted of a crime for which they were sentenced  to at least 30 months, would, upon conviction for illegal reentry, be  subject to a maximum sentence of 15 years.   Aliens previously convicted of a crime for which they were sentenced  to at least 60 months, would, upon conviction for illegal reentry, be  subject to a maximum sentence of 20 years.   Aliens previously convicted for murder, rape, kidnapping, a peonage  offense, or any three felonies, would, under conviction for illegal  reentry, be subject to a maximum sentence of 25 years.   These are significant enhancements to our immigration laws and are  long overdue. I would be remiss, however, if I failed to mention a  caveat added to the bill. If enacted, Kate's Law adds affirmative  defenses for aliens charged under this section. If an alien can prove  that they had the express consent of the Secretary of Homeland Security  to reapply for admission, or that an alien previously denied admission  and removed was not required to obtain such consent, then the alien may  present that as an affirmative defense to the illegal reentry crime.   This safeguard will ensure that only aliens who illegally reenter the  United States may be convicted and sentenced to enhanced penalties  under this section.   This is missing from the current statute, and I am sure my colleagues  on both side of the aisle would agree that due process protections such  as these add to the efficacy of such a measure.   Nothing that this Congress can pass will ever bring Kate Steinle  back, nor take away the pain suffered by her family, and countless  other victims of crimes committed by criminal aliens. Kate's Law,  however, will offer a deterrent against future criminal aliens who seek  to illegally reenter the United States. Knowing they may face up to 2  years in Federal prison is one thing, but the possibility of a sentence  of 10, 15, 20, or 25 years will have the desired effect.   I agree with many of my colleagues on both side of the aisle that we  must take many other steps to address our immigration system. This  Congress must pass strong measures to ensure that immigration  enforcement in the interior of the United States remains a priority.  Kate's Law is an essential component of that larger effort to bring  about true enforcement of our immigration laws, and protect this Nation  from criminal aliens.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  [[Page H5335]]  Iowa (Mr. King), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a member of the Judiciary Committee and chairman of  the Small Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to quote from a  letter from the Sergeants Benevolent Association that we received 2  days ago in support of Kate's Law, and I want to read a sentence from  it.   ``In recent years, the need to protect our citizens from those aliens  who enter the United States illegally, commit crimes here, are  deported, and who illegally return to the U.S. and commit additional  crimes has become a top concern of the law enforcement community.''   This is from the Sergeants Benevolent Association, Police Department,  City of New York. I include it in the Record.           Sergeants Benevolent Association, Police Department, City             of New York,                                       New York, NY, June 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker: I am writing on behalf of the more than       13,000 members of the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the       New York City Police Department to advise you of our strong       support for H.R. 3004, ``Kate's Law,'' that will be       considered by the House of Representatives later this week.       We are grateful that the Congress is moving expeditiously to       take up this important legislation.        In recent years, the need to protect our citizens from       those aliens who enter the United States illegally, commit       crimes here, are deported, and who illegally return to the       U.S. and commit additional crimes has become a top concern of       the law enforcement community. It is a problem that was       exemplified in the horrific murder of the young woman in       whose honor H.R. 3004 is named, Kate Steinle. In 2015, Ms.       Steinle was shot and killed on a San Francisco pier while out       for a walk with her father. Her murderer was a career       criminal who had already been deported five previous times,       had a long criminal history, had served multiple prison       sentences, and was on probation in Texas at the time of the       shooting. Nearly two years has passed since Steinle's murder,       and little has been done to address the scourge of violence       perpetrated by those who break our laws and continue to       illegally reenter the United States. That is why prompt       congressional action on ``Kate's Law'' is so critically       important.        H.R. 3004 will ensure that those deported aliens with       criminal histories who decide to illegally reenter the U.S.       will face stiff prison sentences upon their return. First,       the bill provides for monetary fines and between 10 and 25       years in prison for those aliens deported or removed who       illegally return, depending on the severity of their prior       crimes. In addition, this legislation provides for up to 10       years in prison for any alien who has been refused entry,       deported, or removed from the U.S. three times or more, but       who returns or attempts to reenter the U.S.        Finally, for any criminal aliens who were removed from the       U.S. prior to the completion of a prison term and who then       attempt to reenter, H.R. 3004 requires that such individuals       be incarcerated for the remainder of their sentenced prison       term without any possibility for parole or supervised       release. The passage of ``Kate's Law'' is critical to       ensuring that deported aliens with criminal records are       deterred from illegally reentering the U.S., and will help       law enforcement protect our communities from violent       criminals and suspected terrorists who are illegally present       in the U.S.        On behalf of the membership of the Sergeants Benevolent       Association, thank you again for your efforts on this and       other issues important to law enforcement across the nation.            Sincerely,                                                        Ed Mullins,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta).                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Walker).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Yoder).    Mr. Speaker, I have only one speaker remaining, and I  am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.   Mr. Speaker, we are a nation of immigrants. There is not a person who  has participated in this debate today who cannot go back a few years, a  few generations or several generations and find someone in their family  who came here to the United States, but we are also a nation of laws.  The loss of respect for the rule of law is absolutely a serious problem  in this country, and the step-by-step approach to restoring respect for  the rule of law and reforming our immigration laws starts with these  bills, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate's Law.   We are all about today, in this legislation, enhancing public safety,  securing our borders, and restoring the rule of law.   We give discretion to Federal judges--discretion to Federal judges, I  would add--to make sure that people who have entered this country  previously illegally and who reenter the country can be given enhanced  sentences. It is not mandatory by any means, and, in fact, in many  instances, it would be better to send the person outside the country  and not have the taxpayers bear the expense.   But in the case of the individual who murdered Kate Steinle and had  reentered the country five times and had committed other crimes while  in the United States, having that additional time that the judge could  impose on that individual who was just being released for having been  convicted of illegally entering the country, Bureau of Prisons should  have turned him over to ICE to send him out again. But if the ICE  agents wanted to, when he entered illegally the previous time,  recommend that he be given more time than the sentence he just served,  he would have still been in prison when Kate Steinle walked down that  pier with her father and was murdered by him.   So when those on the other side say this was not preventable by this  law, they are entirely wrong. This law would have prevented that if a  judge had chosen to impose that additional time that we are today  providing in these cases.   We also clear up some uncertainty regarding this current law, and I  think it is entirely appropriate to do so. It will deal with some of  the situations that those on the other side have discussed, but most  importantly, it will discourage people from entering the United States  illegally, particularly when they have already entered illegally  earlier and have been convicted of a crime for doing so.   So, to me, this is absolutely the beginning point of restoring to law  enforcement at every level in our country the necessary tools to  enforce our immigration laws, to work together to keep American  citizens safe, like Kate Steinle and many, many others.   Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet with about a dozen  representatives of families who lost loved ones to the criminal acts of  people who were not lawfully present in the United States. And so it is  also entirely true to say that, had those individuals not been present  in the United States, those crimes would not have been committed,  those, in most instances, murders, in all instances, killings, would  not have taken place.   Therefore, when you enforce our immigration laws, unlike laws  applying to American citizens who also commit crimes, in the case of  people who are not lawfully present in the United States, these crimes  are entirely preventable if we enforce our immigration laws. Therefore,  I would urge my colleagues to support Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary  for Criminals Act to make sure that we go down this road of restoring  the trust of the American people in their system of government, in  their protection by their government, and in their own respect for the  rule of law and know that their government is upholding that with  regard to other individuals as well.   This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit not only changes  the bill before us, but it also changes current law. It has long been  Federal law that an alien who has been deported and who returns to the  U.S. is subject to possible criminal prosecution.                                time  1645    Under this bill, an alien who has received consent from the  Department of Homeland Security to return or is not required to seek  consent from DHS has an affirmative defense.   Obviously, such an alien will never be prosecuted. Never has, never  will. In fact, because this is current law--and the gentlewoman was the  chairman of the Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee for 4  years and never offered such an amendment to current law--I see no  reason to address it in this legislation.   I will say that we have all been committed in a very bipartisan  fashion to combating sex trafficking. We passed several bills through  this House, some with the gentlewoman's support, some without, that do  indeed combat sex trafficking.   But back to the issue before us today. Criminal aliens are reentering  the United States after being removed all the time. Without stronger  enforcement measures in place, this government cannot provide an  appropriate deterrence for these reentries.   Kate's Law takes a tough approach to dealing with criminal aliens who  reenter the United States. Instead of the majority being subjected to  no more than a 2-year maximum sentence, this bill takes an individual's  criminal history into consideration and provides enhanced penalties  accordingly. While the 2-year sentence may not deter illegal reentry, a  potential 25-year sentence certainly would.   Nothing can bring Kate Steinle back and nothing can absolutely  prevent such crimes from occurring in the future. This legislation is  meant to honor her memory and clearly demonstrate that this Congress  will act.   This legislation is another step in bringing stronger enforcement  measures to improve our immigration enforcement capabilities. Longer  sentences for those criminal aliens who reenter the United States  illegally is an important aspect of that mechanism.   I urge my colleagues to vote down this motion to recommit, vote for  the underlying bill, and to truly deter criminal aliens from reentering  the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
