 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week to  honor the 394 law enforcement officers whose names have been forever  engraved into the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in  Washington, D.C.   I am honored to join Congressman   Michael Guest and 90 of my  Republican colleagues in introducing a resolution to recognize these  brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice. The surviving  families of these officers are now left to walk through the  unimaginable path of pain and loss. My prayers are with them every day  as they grieve for their loved ones.   My district and State, like so many of my colleagues, did not escape  loss. Fifteen law enforcement officers from Louisiana were killed in  the line of duty in 2020, including four from the Fifth Congressional  District:   Kejuana Artez Bates with the Vidalia Police Department;   Kietrell Michael Pitts with the Tangipahoa Sheriff's Office;   Randy Michael Vallot with the Richland Parish Sheriff's Office; and   Marshal Lee Walter, Jr., with the Mangham Police Department.   These officers swore an oath to uphold the public trust. We remember  them not just today or this week, but for years to come. We thank all  law enforcement officers and their families for their sacrifice, and  ask God to bless each and every one of you.   The people of our country are forever grateful.                            ____________________
