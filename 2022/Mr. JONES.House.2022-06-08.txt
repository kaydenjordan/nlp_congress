 Madam Speaker, I rise because we find ourselves on a path  that we have traveled before, a path that the American people were  promised they would never have to meet again after Columbine, after  Sandy Hook, after Parkland, and now after Uvalde.   For two decades--two decades--Republicans bought by the NRA have  blocked every attempt to pass legislation that would stop children from  being massacred in their classrooms. Why? Because nothing is easier  than buying an AR-15 in this country except buying a Republican Member  of Congress.   Today, Democrats in the House will pass the Protecting Our Kids Act,  and we need the Senate to abolish the filibuster to do the same.                                time  1600
