 Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the Finance  Committee for his leadership not only on this bill but also healthcare  over the decades. He knows something about the right way of doing it  and the wrong way of doing it, which is partly what brings me to the  floor today.   I want to say something that I think will be uncontroversial to the  people at home but may be news to some people here, and that is whether  you support the Affordable Care Act or whether you don't support the  Affordable Care Act, whether you have been a supporter of ObamaCare or  whether you are not a supporter of what is called ObamaCare, in  general, people are pretty dissatisfied with our healthcare system at  home. In general, people are pretty dissatisfied with the rate their  insurance goes up. They are pretty dissatisfied with the fact that a  lot of people are still uncovered in this country. If they are a  senior, they are pretty dissatisfied not just with the idea but with  the practice that month after month, people have to cut their medicines  in half just to get through the month. They are pretty dissatisfied  with the fact that they call an insurance company to make a claim to  say ``My child was sick'' and point out that month after month they  have paid their premiums only to find that on the day they make that  claim, there is someone at that insurance company who has more time  than they do to stay on the phone, to keep them on that phone, to deny  them their claim. They are pretty dissatisfied about that.   As a whole, I think the American people are dissatisfied by the fact  that we spend 16 percent of our gross domestic product, our entire  economy, on healthcare when every other industrialized country in the  world spends half of that or less than half of that on healthcare and-- this is going to come as news to some people in this Chamber--get  better results. We are moving in the wrong direction on too many  dimensions when it comes to our healthcare.   I have said all of that as a proponent of the Affordable Care Act. I  spent a year and a half in Colorado, in certain places, being called a  Bolshevik or a socialist, being accused of advocating for a government  takeover of our healthcare system. This was at a time when the tea  party was very active, and people would come and say, quite rightly:  Read the bill. Read the bill. We need to take our government back.   We tried to do some things to help in that bill. For the first time  in the country's history, we tried to say that it wasn't OK to  discriminate against people who were sick or have what is called a  preexisting condition when they went to buy health insurance. As the  Senator from Oregon said, it wasn't OK that if you did get sick when  you had insurance and you got something like cancer that an insurance  company could just throw you off their rolls because you hit their cap.   We said that we thought it wasn't OK that there were millions of  people, many of them children, who didn't have access to primary care;  that is, a doctor to be able to give you a checkup and see how you are  doing so that you weren't getting treated in the emergency room--the  most expensive, least intentional way of running a healthcare system  that is imaginable. In fact, I would say that is the Bolshevik way of  running a healthcare system: When you are sick, you get to show up at  the emergency room, and somebody is going to take care of you. It gives  you the results of a Bolshevik system because you are paying more for  less of an outcome.   We tried to address some of those things, and that became the  Affordable Care Act. That became ObamaCare. That became something that  was politicized for 7 years, as the House of Representatives cynically,  month after month, voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Then the  majority of the House went home to their districts and said: We  repealed ObamaCare. We voted to repeal ObamaCare.   You didn't repeal it.   No, we voted to repeal it. If you send me back there next week, I  will do the  [[Page S3899]]  same thing. I will do it the week after that.   Then at some point, people started to say: Well, you keep having the  vote on repealing ObamaCare. Why haven't you actually done it?   They said: Well, we didn't have the Senate.   They have had the Senate now for two Congresses.   Well, we didn't have the Presidency.   Now we have the same party in Presidency, the Senate, and the House  of Representatives. This terrible bill we are considering is not a bill  that anybody--that is an exaggeration--virtually anybody in my State  supports or has asked for. That is what we have in front of us.   I know somebody else who knew that the American people were  dissatisfied with their healthcare system, and that was Donald J. Trump  when he was running for President of the United States.   I hope, in particular, the people who voted for the President, as a  way of keeping Washington accountable, will remember that he said he  was going to provide the American people ``a terrific plan,'' to  ``cover everyone at a fraction of the cost.'' The President, when he  was running--he still does it--was very fond of talking about--his  words--how stupid everybody in Washington was and he knew how to make  deals and he was going to come here and make great deals and he was  going to cover everybody at a fraction of the price with a terrific  plan. That is what he promised the American people. That is what he was  peddling when he was running for President. He said: ``Everybody is  going to be taken care of much better than you are taken care of now.''  That is what he said. This isn't fake news. This isn't CNN or the New  York Times or the Wall Street Journal or whoever is in the crosshairs.  This is what the President said on the campaign trail when he was  running because he detected, quite rightly, that the American people  are unhappy with the way our healthcare system works--unhappy in the  richest country of the world to have a healthcare system where people  have to make decisions about their lives and about their children's  lives that no one in the industrialized world has to make about their  lives or their children's lives--and they wonder why.   I think the diagnosis has a lot to do with what some people have  said, which is special interests having a grasp on Washington, DC. That  is what the President said he was going to give to the American people.  This is what his promise was to the American people. What did we get  instead? We have a bill passed by the House that was a massive tax cut  for the richest people in America, which, literally, nobody in my  townhalls in red or blue parts of my State has ever said is something  that would help with their healthcare. Not a single person has said  what they want for healthcare is a massive tax cut for people making  more than $250,000 a year--not one, not one person.   There is a 25-percent cut to Medicaid in this bill. That was done in  the name of, I guess, reforming entitlements. The argument has been  made that there are a lot of lazy people who are on Medicaid, and if  you cut Medicaid by 25 percent, they will go to work, and they should  go to work. Well, there are two issues with that. The first is, it is  important to understand who is on Medicaid.   In my State, 50 percent of the people are children. Are they supposed  to be at work or can they go to school? Then there are a whole bunch of  people on Medicaid--in fact, it is a very large share of the population  of Medicaid who have spent their entire life savings down for the  privilege of being in a nursing home paid for by Medicaid. Are they  supposed to work? Then there are a lot of people--I am ashamed to say  this--there are a lot of people in this country who are working one  job, two jobs and can't make enough money to buy private insurance in  the United States of America. That is a shame. Do they need to get a  third or fourth job before we are saying they are not lazy or should we  fix this healthcare system so it is more affordable, more predictable,  more transparent for American families? Those were the promises the  President made. That is the content of the bill with one addition. They  slipped in--between that tax cut and that 25-percent cut to Medicaid,  which is paying for that tax cut for the wealthiest Americans--what my  colleague Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, has described  accurately as ObamaCare lite. He is absolutely right about that. If you  hate ObamaCare, you will hate ObamaCare lite. If you are looking in a  rural part of my State or the country, and you already can't afford  insurance because there is no market there and you can't get a subsidy  that will help you because you are making too much money, you are going  to hate that even more. Wait until they pass the Cruz amendment, which  he is calling the freedom amendment--freedom to have to endure  something no one else in the industrialized world has to put up with,  which is buying lousy insurance that doesn't cover anything. You can  create the worst product in the world and make it affordable. That is  not hard to do.   We have come a long way from Franklin Roosevelt's four freedoms, if  we are talking about the freedom of insurance companies to be able to  throw you off if you hit the lifetime cap, freedom not to give you  insurance if you have a preexisting condition. We have come a long,  long way.   Finally, my colleagues are here so I am going to stop. I do want to  say one word about the process. The majority leader today announced  that he is going to keep the Senate in for 2 weeks in August because  they have to finish their work on healthcare or maybe it is 3 weeks in  August. I don't care if it is a month. I don't care if they cancel  every recess we have between now and the end of the year. I don't care  if we work on weekends if it will create a situation where we can  actually improve healthcare for the American people. I am glad to stay.  In fact, I think we should stay, but, unfortunately, that is not what  he is trying to do. What he is trying to do is jam through a bill that  is incredibly unpopular with the American people. That is why, until 2  weeks ago, it was a secret. Until two Thursdays ago, it was a secret.   I have to suspect that one reason they want to keep us in August is  because they don't want to go home because they were just beaten to  death over the July 4th recess because people came out in Republican  and Democratic parts of their States and said: Are you out of your  minds? This bill has nothing to do with our healthcare. They probably  don't want to repeat that in August.   I will close just by saying this, and I said this again to the people  who came to my townhalls and were highly critical of the Affordable  Care Act and the process: I want to remind you folks that back then-- the Senator from Oregon will remember this--back then, we spent over a  year debating that bill here in the Congress. We had countless-- somebody could count them up--but countless committee hearings in the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Finance  Committee. We had almost 200 amendments that were Republican amendments  that were adopted as part of that bill. Everybody remembers, no  Republican voted for it, but there were 200 Republican amendments  adopted as part of that bill. We have not had a single committee  hearing in the Senate about this healthcare bill--not one.   So you can keep us in for 2 weeks or 3 weeks longer in August, but a  better idea might be to follow the regular order around this place.  Talk about take our country back, take our government back, make it  work, have hearings, have witnesses. I can think of 100 Coloradans, off  the top of my head, who would like to come here and testify. I would  even say 50 of them can be Republicans and 50 of them can be Democrats.  Have them come testify what would make healthcare better for them. That  is what this should be about: families all across this country who are  struggling because of our healthcare system and who need relief from  this Congress and who so far aren't getting it.   I will close just by saying, if the President could submit a proposal  that actually would meet the criteria he set out when he was running  for President--instead of having a bill he couldn't pass with even 51  Republican votes--he would have a bill he could pass with 100 votes  here in the Senate, and that is what we should strive to do.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, I wish to recognize a dedicated community  leader, civil servant, and dear friend, Rosemary E. Rodriguez. She most  recently served as my State director and senior adviser. Throughout her  life, Rosemary has displayed a genuine and consistent commitment to  strengthening our State and our country.   Rosemary began her career as a legal assistant at two of Denver's  most prominent law firms. Also, during the early stages of her career,  Rosemary began her lifelong commitment to the Latino community as she  helped form the Hispanic League, an organization that strives to be a  liaison between the non-Hispanic and Hispanic communities. Rosemary  began her career in government in 1992, working for Mayor Wellington  Webb's administration. She served in several roles during her time with  the mayor, such as deputy director of the mayor's Office of Arts,  Culture & Film, Denver County clerk and recorder, and director of  boards and commissions.   In 2003, she was elected to the Denver City Council. Later, her peers  on the council elected her as president. In 2007, she began to work on  the Election Assistance Commission. In this capacity, she worked to  preserve the integrity of our national elections and increase access to  our most fundamental right to vote. She chaired the commission in 2008.   In 2009, Rosemary became an invaluable part of my staff as State  director and did a tremendous job representing our office and  connecting with communities across Colorado. When I wasn't able to  attend an event, I was always confident that Rosemary would convey our  team's values and perspectives on any number of issues. I also counted  on her advice whether it related to women's issues, immigration reform,  or other issues of importance to the Latino community. Most recently,  she was elected to the Denver School Board where she continues to serve  Colorado's kids.   Due to her dedication to the people of Colorado, Rosemary has  received several awards including the Mi Casa Resource Center's  Volunteerism Award, the Anti-Defamation League's Passing the Torch  Award, and the Denver Public Library's Cesar Chavez Hall of Fame Award.   I have been honored to work with my friend Rosemary for the past 8  years. Her intellect, creativity, and compassion should serve as an  example for all those who serve. I wish her the best in her future  endeavors, and I fully intend to count on her advice and perspectives  for years to come.                            ____________________
