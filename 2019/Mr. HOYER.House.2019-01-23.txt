 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad that Mr. Joyce is still on the floor. Mr.  Joyce, I think, put his finger on the problem, and the problem is: Gee,  I really like the Interior bill. It has been reached in a bipartisan  fashion, and it is wonderful, but, by the way, the package is not  perfect because it doesn't do what I want done or what the President of  the United States wants done on one specific bill, Homeland Security.   My goodness, I don't know why we didn't have an opportunity to  conference on that bill. You brought it to the floor on December 20, 10  days before the end of the year--10 days before the end of the year. If  it was so important, why did we wait 11\2/3\ months to bring it to the  floor? How could we conference a bill like that? There was no time.   The reason you didn't bring it to the floor is you didn't have the  votes. Mr. Joyce, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Cole all came to this floor when we  considered another bill that was what the United States Senate  Republicans wanted in their bills, and so we said we need to open up  this government.   Mr. Graves talked about and Mr. Joyce talked about consensus. Mr.  Graves used the word ``consensus.'' Hopefully, we will have a consensus  on this floor.   Shutting down the government of the United States is stupid,  irresponsible, and dangerous. That ought to be a consensus on this  floor. And if that is the consensus, as it certainly is mine and  certainly on my side of the aisle, then the cure is to open up  government.   We have offered 9, 10, 11 different alternatives to do that, most of  which  [[Page H1156]]  were their bills formed in the last Congress under the Republican  leadership in the House and the Senate. But, sadly, they won't take  ``yes'' for an answer, so they keep the government shut down.   Only six Republicans in the last vote voted to open up government.  Every Democrat, save one--and that had nothing to do with opening or  shutting down government--voted to open up this government of the  people and for the people.   I served on appropriations for 23 years. I never voted to shut down  the government, because the government is there to serve the people,  and we swear an oath to protect and preserve. Somebody is now going to  say: Well, we put something in a bill and you voted against it, Hoyer,  and that was an appropriation bill. By the way, when I voted against  it, it passed.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats have been trying to open this government since  the first day of our majority passing their bills. When I say ``their  bills,'' the Republican bills; they were out of the Senate.   On January 3, the Democratic-led House passed a package of six  appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019 based on the language  approved overwhelmingly in the Republican-controlled Senate, alongside  a continuing resolution for the seventh bill funding Homeland Security,  which, I will remind you, was not brought to this floor until December  20, 2018.   What a high priority they placed on that. They were in charge for 11  months and 20 days, and they never brought it to the floor. High  priority item, obviously.   Senate Leader McConnell passed a bill through the Senate on a voice  vote, I think, unanimously, and sent it to us, so government would be  opened. We would have voted for it, all of us, but they didn't bring it  to the floor.   They brought a bill to the floor that said they wanted to do  something on the wall. Why? Because the President wanted to do  something with the wall. Why is the government shut down? Because the  President will not allow the Congress of the United States to act to  open it up. And Senator McConnell, for unknown reasons, believes that  we have to have a by-your-leave, Mr. President, to open up this  government.   This is historic that we have shut down the government for this  length of time. It is unforgivable that we have put 800,000 of our  fellow citizens--people who work for this government, people who help  millions of people every day to get assistance they need or documents  that they have to have to settle on a home, or make sure that there is  training for firefighters, or any one of thousands of different,  critically important jobs that the Federal Government does--out of  work. They, on the Republican side of the aisle, my colleagues, have  done that. They have shut down the government. We have not.   Unless you think taking a hostage and demanding a ransom and having  us not agree to that ransom is shutting down the government, and,  therefore, you have to vote over and over and over and over and over  again to keep the government of the people shut down.   During the second week of January, we passed, on an individual basis  four appropriations bills that passed the Republican Senate last year  92-6. Is that a partisan act on our part offering four bills that  passed the United States Senate, which they controlled, 92-6? When I  say ``they,'' I mean, the Republican Party. These are not Democratic  bills we are trying to pass through with some majority we have. We took  their bills. Why? Because we have a consensus: shutting down the  government is the wrong thing to do.                                time  1500    And very frankly, I think privately, if you are asked that question,  presumably most of you respond with a consensus answer: ``You are  right, it is. We shouldn't do that.''   As the urgency of this shutdown grew last week, House Democrats  attempted to send a continuing resolution at last year's funding  levels.   Now, it is important to understand, last year's funding levels are  the levels that were set when the Republicans were in charge of the  House and the Senate, not Democratic numbers.   This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue about doing the right  thing: opening up the government. So we were prepared to send your  bills, and you voted against your own bills.   I can't understand it, and I can't understand why anybody in America  doesn't understand that we are for opening up government and the  Republicans are repeatedly and consistently voting not to open up the  government. House Republicans rejected those four bills that were  Republican bills.   Next, we voted to add an amendment to reopen the government through  February 8, a short term--give us time to talk and discuss and see if  we can come to agreement. It seems to me to make sense. That is usually  what short-term CRs are for. We may yet find out tomorrow whether  Senate Republicans can agree to reopen government under those terms. I  hope they do.   In the meantime, late last week, we also brought a continuing  resolution to the floor to reopen the government through February 28.  Okay. Maybe we need a longer time to negotiate.   Democrats have been trying to end this Trump-McConnell shutdown  nonstop since taking control of this House. That work continues this  week as we bring to the floor a new appropriations package.   As we debated the Senate-authored versions--let me say that again,  the Senate-authored versions, not our versions--of funding bills  earlier this month, some of my Republican colleagues came to this floor  and said that their objection to it was because it did not reflect the  House position.   Now, ladies and gentlemen, you just heard Mr. Joyce talk about the  Interior bill. Presumably, if the Interior bill were here alone, he  would vote against it because it didn't have national security interest  in it. On that theory, we ought to vote against 11 of the bills that we  don't like individually, but you brought them as packages last time. I  thought that was a good example.   We are going to do it again. But the fact of the matter is it is not  because you are disagreeing with your bill--you come as the ranking  member, I say to my friend, Mr. Speaker--but because of some other  issue. We can all find some other issue.   So I think there is a consensus that shutting down the government is  the wrong thing to do, and unless you believe that shutting down  government is okay, you will vote ``yes'' on these bills to open up our  government, the people's government. Serve your constituents and the  American people, generally.   I don't know why you keep voting ``no'' just because the President  tells you to do so. That is not what your constituents sent you here to  do. Our constituents sent us here, Mr. Speaker, to serve them. The  writers of the Constitution of the United States didn't say the  President tells Congress what to do. They said Congress tells the  President what to do, and he executes that policy.   That is what separation of powers is all about. Not for Senator  McConnell to say: Unless the President says it is okay, I am not going  to put a bill on the floor. What kind of misreading of the Constitution  of the United States is that?   We are the policymakers of America. We are the ones who send to the  President. Yes, he has a role, a critical role. He can veto, and we  need two-thirds to override his veto, but it is not to say: Mr.  President, we won't even put it on the floor for the Representatives of  the people of the United States to express their opinion on unless you  say okay.   Let's get a spine. Let's stand up. Let's act like the Article I  institution we represent. Let us be independent.   Let us have what democracy demands: differences of opinion argued  out, not by taking hostages, not by demanding ransom, but by  discussion, by debate, and by votes. That is what democracy is about.   And if it becomes common practice for President Trump or any other  President to say to us: ``If I don't like what you are doing, I am  going to shut down your government''--that is what is happening here.   It is not just about a wall. It is about whether tomorrow the  President is going to make some other demand and shut down the  government, or tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow when the President  makes another demand and shuts down the government.  [[Page H1157]]    When will it stop, my friends? Maybe never, but it will not continue  with my vote.   Vote for this bill. Open up the people's government. Stand up and be  what America believes you are, an independent, coequal branch of the  Government of the United States. Vote ``yes'' for your country and for  the people you represent.
