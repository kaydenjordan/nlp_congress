 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 725, I  call up the bill (H.R. 1153) to amend the Truth in Lending Act to  improve upon the definitions provided for points and fees in connection  with a mortgage transaction, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.  [[Page H907]]    The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1153         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Mortgage Choice Act of       2017''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF POINTS AND FEES.

SEC. 3. RULEMAKING.         Not later than the end of the 90-day period beginning on       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Bureau of Consumer       Financial Protection shall issue final regulations to carry       out the amendments made by this Act, and such regulations       shall be effective upon issuance.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and submit extraneous material on H.R. 1153, currently  under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1153, the Mortgage  Choice Act of 2017.   I would like to start out thanking my colleague, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) for his tireless leadership on this issue,  having ushered this very same legislation through our committee in  three different Congresses.   The purpose of H.R. 1153 is simple: to provide much-needed regulatory  red tape relief to our community financial institutions so they can  serve their customers; so they can provide them more mortgages. This is  a straightforward piece of legislation. It is practical, it is  necessary, and, Madam Speaker, it is bipartisan.   Now, you may hear today, Madam Speaker, from some of our Democratic  colleagues that ``we oppose the bill.'' We heard that claim in the  Rules Committee earlier this week. But I do find it interesting that no  amendments were offered during committee markup, nor were any  amendments offered at the Rules Committee. I remind all on the House  floor, Madam Speaker, that the Financial Services Committee favorably  reported this bill to the House with a strong bipartisan vote of 46-13,  which means almost half of the Democrats on our committee supported  this bill; and in the 113th Congress, Madam Speaker, this bill passed  by voice vote--not a single objection.   Madam Speaker, this bill would help make homeownership more  affordable for working Americans and would promote access to affordable  mortgage credit for low- and moderate-income families and first-time  home buyers. It does this while continuing to protect consumers.   The Mortgage Choice Act is needed because the CFPB wrote a flawed and  problematic definition that grossly miscalculates points and fees. The  result is that many mortgage loans, particularly those for low- and  moderate-income borrowers, would not meet the standards of a qualified  mortgage and thus not get made.   Currently, CFPB rules include affiliated title charges under a 3  percent cap when determining whether a mortgage is a qualified  mortgage, but it doesn't include unaffiliated. This does not make  sense. The CFPB rules are detrimental, again, to low- and moderate- income borrowers and first-time home buyers since they are more likely  to have smaller loan amounts and, therefore, more easily trigger the 3  percent cap.   That means under the current definition, many mortgage applicants  will be denied homeownership opportunities simply because they do not  fit into the government box; or the only mortgages in the alternative  available to them might be at far higher interest rates, making them  unaffordable for many. In other words, the CFPB's defective definition  has ended up protecting many consumers right out of their opportunity  to buy a home.   H.R. 1153, from the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), would  change the way points and fees are calculated by excluding fees paid  for affiliated title charges and escrow charges for insurance and  taxes. That would, therefore, Madam Speaker, increase homeownership  opportunities for borrowers by allowing more loans to meet the QM  standard.   Let's not just listen to me, Madam Speaker. Let's listen to our  community financial institutions that we expect to help our  constituents. A credit union from Washington explained how this was  affecting everyday Americans.   They wrote: ``A member at our credit union wanted to buy down his  rate on his mortgage with cash out of pocket at closing in order to  lower the payments for his retirement. However, doing so would have  made his total points and fees higher than allowed under ATR/QM, and  there was no allowable way around the problem.''   From my native Texas, a community banker wrote in and said: ``The  greatest frustration our customers have is our bank's inability to now  make home loans. For years we made loans to people for the purchase of  their homes. We would do about one every other week. So it was not a  large volume. It was a good service. We always made these loans to keep  in our loan portfolio. We never sold any home loans, but with the new  requirements for home loans, it has driven us out of this kind of  business. It has also taken us out of the construction lending on homes  because we cannot risk the risk of a takeout commitment failing. The  consumer is the loser.''   Indeed, that is true, Madam Speaker. As I mentioned earlier, Mr.  Huizenga has worked on this bill for the past two Congresses again. In  the 113th Congress, it passed by voice vote. It passed by an  overwhelming majority of 286-140 in the 114th Congress. I trust the  third time will be the charm.   I urge all of my colleagues to do what is right for our constituents  and to pass H.R. 1153 to provide open access for Americans to purchase  a home.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to say that,  if the ranking member would read section 8(a) of RESPA, she would  realize everything she said was false because it prevents any fee,  kickback, or thing of value.   Second of all, what she describes as a harmful and fraudulent policy  was supported by half of her Democrats, including her vice ranking  member, Mr. Kildee from Michigan.   Madam Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Huizenga), who is the sponsor of the legislation and the chairman of  the Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and  Investments.                                time  0930     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the chair of the Committee on Armed  Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Trott), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a hardworking member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased now to yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman), a cosponsor of the  legislation and a great friend of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we could not be more highly honored that the minority  leader would take such an interest in H.R. 1533, the Mortgage Choice  Act.   I am reminded that there are Members who come to this great Chamber  to make speeches, and there are those who come to make laws. When it  comes to speeches, I would note that the Gettysburg Address came in at  2 minutes, and Americans may think it had greater eloquence.   I would note that as the minority leader quoted the Bible frequently  throughout her speech, it reminds me of Isaiah 1:18, ``Come now, let us  reason together, says the Lord.''   Yet President Trump stood right there in the State of the Union  Address with his hand out with an olive branch extending an open hand  to work with Members of both parties on an immigration reform package.  He offered a fair compromise. He offered a fair compromise, and,  instead, the minority leader slapped his hand and called it insulting,  Mr. Speaker. She called it lame. She called it dangerous.   This is not someone who has come to this Chamber, the people's House,  in order to make law. The President didn't offer legalization. He  offered a pathway to citizenship. He didn't offer this for 700,000. He  offered it for 1.8 million. He said:         Let's secure our borders, and let's make sure that       immigrants who come to this country come legally and come       with their sleeves rolled up coming to work and build       America.    There are those who want to solve a problem, and there are those who  want to exacerbate a problem for the election.   Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans need the opportunity to  get mortgages to buy their part of the American Dream. Everything that  the ranking member said, she ought to share it with her own Democrats  because half of them on our committee support H.R. 1533 which is good  for America and good for prospective home buyers.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all House Members to adopt it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
