 Mr. Chair, I rise to offer support for Representative  Jackson's amendment.   In Texas, across America, and deep in the waters off of our coastline  rests an abundance of untapped energy. Through American ingenuity and  technical innovations, we now have the ability to explore these natural  resources and return the United States to its status as a net exporter  of oil and natural gas.   Frankly, Mr. Chair, there are so many excessive regulations, we may  need to limit the number of pages in this report we are asking for. I  urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of Representative Donalds'  amendment.   The most logical path forward for a clean, reliable electrical supply  is nuclear power.   The U.S. Navy operates 80 nuclear-powered vessels with more than  5,400 reactor-years of accident-free operation.   The face of nuclear power is changing to a generation of small  modular reactors that deliver power with lower initial capital costs  and more flexibility in placement.   Today, we import 95 percent of our high-assay low-enriched uranium  from Russia. A startling quote in a Reuters article says that, without  Moscow, the U.S. nuclear power industry could collapse in 1 to 1\1/2\  years.   Today, I speak for Mr. Donalds' amendment, which will help lead  America back to total energy abundance by finding and evaluating  American sources of uranium.   If you want a Green New Deal, this is it.
