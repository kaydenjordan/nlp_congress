 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Madam President, this Friday marks the 2-year  anniversary of the shooting at the school in Parkland, FL, where 17  innocent lives were lost at the hands of evil. We will never forget  that tragic moment and day.   I am dedicated to keeping weapons from dangerous people. That is why  I have introduced the EAGLES Act over the past 2 years. This  bipartisan, bicameral bill reauthorizes and expands the leading center  in threat assessment and prevention. This bill is a tribute to the  victims and the families.   Also, the Justice Department still hasn't provided to Congress its  report on the shooting. I hope the Department of Justice will get off  the stick. It owes it to the families to get this report done.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
