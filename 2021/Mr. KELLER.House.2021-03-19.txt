 Mr. Speaker, today, we take a moment to remember the life  and service of Sergeant Major Christopher Brownawell, a decorated  American soldier who died unexpectedly last week.   Chris' life was defined by his service, both in and out of uniform.  For 24 years, Chris served honorably in the United States Army,  deploying to Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait.   Outside of the military, Chris kept our community safe as a  corrections officer at SCI Coal Township.   Those who knew Chris remember him as the quintessential infantryman  and a purpose-driven leader who went out of his way to develop and  mentor other soldiers. Chris set the standard for other soldiers and,  undoubtedly, had a profound impact on so many during his years of  service.   Every freedom we have in this Nation was paid for by soldiers like  Chris. Chris is a hero, and his legacy of service to our community,  State, and country will live on with his family and friends and our  community.                            ____________________
