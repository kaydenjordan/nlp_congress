 Mr. Speaker, nearly every Member of this body proclaims to  be a champion of small business. But how many follow with action?   Time after time my colleagues are presented with opportunities to  vote in support of small businesses and then repeatedly fail to live up  to their hollow promises.   They say they support small businesses, but Democrats proudly support  increases on small businesses and job creators.   They are actively disrupting the labor market by keeping workers out  of the workforce with never-ending handouts to able-bodied Americans.   They are preventing first-generation entrepreneurs from passing a  successful business on to the next generation.   They are expanding credits for childcare without any work  requirements for the parents.   They are surveilling small businesses and farmers through the IRS.   The Democrat dream is an America dependent on Big Government. It  couldn't be farther from the American Dream where a guy like me, who  grew up on food stamps, could take a big idea and a big work ethic and  turn it into a successful business career and job creator.   Under Democrat policies, we may see the end of the American Dream. We  cannot let that happen.                            ____________________
