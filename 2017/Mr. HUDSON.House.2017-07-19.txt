 Mr. Chair, I was unavoidably detained from the House  floor. Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No.  396 (Tsongas Amendment to H.R. 2833).   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute, as amended.   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Rodney Davis of Illinois) having assumed the chair, Mr. Weber of Texas,  Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the  Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the  bill (H.R. 2883) to establish a more uniform, transparent, and modern  process to authorize the construction, connection, operation, and  maintenance of international border-crossing facilities for the import  and export of oil and natural gas and the transmission of electricity,  and, pursuant to House Resolution 454, he reported the bill back to the  House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is  ordered.   Is a separate vote demanded on the amendment to the amendment  reported from the Committee of the Whole?   If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute, as amended.   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit    Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?   Mr. O'HALLERAN. I am opposed.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. O'Halleran   moves to recommit the bill H.R. 2883 to       the Committee on Energy and Commerce with instructions to       report the same back to the House forthwith, with the       following amendment:        Page 3, after line 14, insert the following:        (D) American iron and steel.--As a condition of issuing a       certificate of crossing under subparagraph (A), the relevant       official or agency shall require that all of the iron and       steel products used in the construction, connection,       operation, and maintenance of the border-crossing facility       are produced in the United States, as determined by the       relevant official or agency in a manner consistent with       United States obligations under international agreements.    Mr. MULLIN (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  [[Page H6022]]  to dispense with the reading of the amendment.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Oklahoma?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for  5 minutes.   Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, hardworking families across Arizona and across our  country are sick and tired of Congress putting partisan politics ahead  of creating jobs at home.   As I travel across rural Arizona and speak to workers, miners,  farmers, and families, I am asked the same questions: ``When is  Congress going to get serious about helping rural America?   ``When are you guys going to work together and create good-paying  jobs?   ``When are we going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and  roads?   ``When are we finally going to get reliable broadband?''   In my 7 months in Congress, I have seen firsthand the failure to  address these problems in a truly bipartisan manner. American workers  are counting on all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to focus on  bringing back jobs to our country.   The underlying bill before us does not go far enough to ensure  pipelines, which involve major investments and can span hundreds of  miles across sensitive areas, are made with quality, reliable,  American-made materials.   My commonsense amendment simply requires Federal agencies to certify  that all of the iron and steel products used in any cross-border  pipelines are produced in the United States before they can be  approved.   Mr. Speaker, foreign steelmakers now supply half the oil and gas  drilling and extraction pipes used in the United States, and it is only  getting worse. The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates that  imports of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry are up 237 percent  in the first half of 2017 from a year earlier.   Earlier this year, President Trump signed an executive order  instructing the Secretary of Commerce to develop a plan that would  require any company building a pipeline within U.S. borders to use  American-made materials and equipment. My amendment mirrors the spirit  of that executive order by applying the same rules to any proposed  cross-border pipelines.   Mr. Speaker, we need to rebuild America. We need to rebuild America's  infrastructure. We need to rebuild America's energy infrastructure, but  we need to rebuild America by creating American jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I can think of no better message to send during  President Trump's ``Made in America Week'' than by standing up for  American workers and supporting this commonsense amendment. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
