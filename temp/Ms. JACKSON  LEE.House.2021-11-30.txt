 Mr. Speaker I rise in proud support of H.R. 951, the Maternal  Vaccination Act.      The online version has been corrected to read: This also gives  mothers piece of mind that they'll be safe as they advance in  their pregnancy. Mr. Speaker, I rise in proud support of H.R. 951,  the Maternal Vaccination Act.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      I would like to thank Congresswoman Sewell for introducing this  legislation.   This bill establishes a national campaign to raise awareness and  increase rates of maternal vaccinations and calls for the CDC to  consult with various stakeholders to carry out this campaign.  [[Page H6682]]    In addition, the CDC must focus on increasing vaccination rates among  communities with historically high rates of unvaccinated individuals.   The CDC must also make publicly available any materials and resources  I developed for the campaign.   In addition, H.R. 951 would instruct the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention to broaden a public awareness campaign on vaccinations  to include pregnant and postpartum individuals and require the campaign  to disseminate vaccine information to providers and facilities that  provide obstetric care.   The bill would also authorize an additional $2 million annually from  2021 through 2025 for the vaccination awareness campaign.   This bill would put pregnant woman at the focus of the fight to  combat COVID-19.   As the Chair of the Congressional Coronavirus Task Force, I have used  every mean possible to sound the alarm about the seriousness of the  COVID-19 virus.   On February 10th 2020, I held the first press conference on the issue  of COVID-19 at Houston Intercontinental Airport.   I then held a second press conference on February 24th to continue  efforts to raise public knowledge of the impending threat.   On February 26th, I wrote the Chair and Ranking Member of the  Committee on Homeland Security requesting to be briefed by Acting  Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf regarding the preparedness of  the Department of Homeland Security to address a possible pandemic.   On March 19th, I announced an innovative partnership with United  Methodist Medical Center (UMMC) to open the first drive-through  Coronavirus Test Screening facility in the Greater Houston area, which  proved beneficial to everyone in the Greater Houston area, as with  UMMC's help we have opened multiple that are located within high-risk  communities in the Greater Houston area, to reduce the need for travel  to get access to COVID-19 testing.   Since the start of this pandemic, I have sought to proactively  addressing the critical issues and concerns tied to the COVID-19 virus.   As I stated at the beginning of this pandemic, ``We must not panic,  but prepare.''   I am pleased to see that this bill is not a panic-induced response,  but a well-though-out proposal to further protect our citizens.   When pregnant women get vaccinated, they not only build their immune  system to the virus, they also create antibodies for their unborn  child.   Throughout history the vaccination of pregnant mothers has shown to  be beneficial when it comes to viruses like tetanus, influenza,  pertussis.   With this bill we can help newborn children who have not yet  developed their immune systems fight off a deadly virus such as COVID- 19.   This also gives mothers piece of mind that they'll be safe as they  advance in their pregnancy.
