 Mr. President, shortly, I will ask unanimous consent on  the nomination of Dimitri Kusnezov to be the Under Secretary for  Science and Technology at the Department of Homeland Security.   The Department needs qualified and steady leadership to support its  240,000 employees and their critical missions to protect our homeland  security and to keep Americans safe. The Directorate of Science and  Technology plays a vital role in carrying out these responsibilities as  the Department's research and development arm, conducting  groundbreaking research to help our Nation identify vulnerabilities in  our homeland security so that we can close existing gaps and increase  our capacity to address both current and emerging threats.   Dr. Kusnezov is more than qualified to lead these efforts. He most  recently served as the Deputy Under Secretary for Artificial  Intelligence and Technology at the Department of Energy, where he led  the efforts to drive artificial intelligence innovation by  incorporating it into their missions and operations, including through  the creation of a new Artificial Intelligence Office.   After more than a decade on the Yale faculty as a professor of  theoretical physics, Dr. Kusnezov left academia to pursue public  service at the Department of Energy and became a member of the Senior  Executive Service. He served as a senior adviser to the U.S. Secretary  of Energy and Chief Scientist for the National Nuclear Security  Administration.   Throughout the confirmation process, Dr. Kusnezov has demonstrated he  possesses the technical and specialized expertise to serve in this  role, and I urge my colleagues to confirm Dr. Kusnezov.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the  following nomination: Calendar No. 727, Dimitri Kusnezov to be Under  Secretary for Science and Technology, Department of Homeland Security;  that the nomination be confirmed without intervening action or debate;  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table; that any statements related to the nomination be printed in the  Record; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  actions.    Mr. President, I renew my above request except that I ask  unanimous consent that the vote occur at a time to be determined by the  majority leader, in consultation with the Republican leader; that there  be 10 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form on the  nomination; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote  without intervening action or debate on the nomination and the Senate  resume legislative session.    Mr. President, the Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs has reviewed the nomination of David P. Pekoske to  be the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration,  Department of Homeland Security. Seeing that this is Mr. Pekoske's  nomination for a second consecutive term to be the Administrator of the  Transportation Security Administration, the chairman and ranking member  have reached a unanimous consent agreement to forgo a mark up for this  nominee.   In the 115th Congress, the Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs sought referral in June of 2017 for Mr. Pekoske's  first nomination to be the Administrator of the Transportation Security  Administration. The committee held a hearing for this nominee on June  11, 2017, and reported the nominee out of committee favorably on June  19, 2017. In the future, this committee is likely to seek referral on  this nomination. This should be considered the standard procedure for  future nominations to this role.                            ____________________
