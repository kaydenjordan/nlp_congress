 Mr. Speaker, I was not present at votes on  Thursday, March 5, as I was travelling back to Washington state to meet  with coronavirus response leaders. Had I been present, I would have  voted ``yea'' on Roll Call No. 87 (Cisneros Amendment), ``yea'' on Roll  Call No. 88 (Mucarsel-Powell/Schrier Amendment), ``nay'' on Roll Call  No. 89 (Motion to Recommit), and ``yea'' on Roll Call No. 90 (Final  passage of H.R. 1140) because the bill strengthens workplace rights for  Transportation Security Officers, improving job conditions, and  enhancing the security of the traveling public.                             personal explanation
