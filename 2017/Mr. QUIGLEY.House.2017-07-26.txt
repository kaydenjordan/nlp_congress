 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 286, line 24, after the dollar amount insert       ``(increased $921,000,000)''.        Page 297, line 21, after the dollar amount insert       ``(reduced by $921,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Quigley) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chairman, some of us in this room are old enough to  remember duck and cover. As kids, the notion was that, if you hid under  a half-inch plywood piece of desk under a thermonuclear attack, you  would be safe. It is not a particularly rational idea, but not much  more rational than our current nuclear posture.   For decades, Presidents and Members of Congress from both parties  have worked together to prevent the use and spread of nuclear weapons  and materials. Starting with President Reagan's leadership, American  Presidents have reduced the size of America's nuclear arsenal from its  Cold War peak. In fact, Republican Presidents have cut the arsenal far  more aggressively than their Democratic counterparts, yet this year's  Energy and Water bill doubles down on an outdated Cold War strategy by  unnecessarily diverting precious resources to build new nukes.   It remains unclear how these weapons will solve 21st century national  security threats such as terrorism, cyber attacks, or global warming.   Rather than wasting dollars to keep up the status quo, we must find  ways to replace the U.S. nuclear arsenal while maintaining a force  capable of deterring nuclear attack against the U.S. and its allies.   In 2013, the Pentagon determined that the U.S. could reduce its  deployed strategic nuclear force by one-third below its current levels  and still meet security requirements. According to the former vice  chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military utility of U.S.  tactical nuclear weapons, such as the B61, is practically nil. Defense  Secretary Mattis has raised doubts about the need for the new ICBMs,  and they need to take a closer look at the new nuclear-armed cruise  missile.   Rather than wasting tax dollars to keep up the status quo, we must  find ways to replace the U.S. nuclear arsenal while maintaining a force  capable of nuclear deterrent.   It is worse than that. This bill proposes to add nearly $1 billion to  the nuclear weapons activities account by gutting the Department of  Energy office responsible for research and application of technology to  increase energy efficiency and renewable energy. DOE's EERE has  traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support and is crucial to research and  development in clean renewable energies, energy use reduction  technologies, vehicle engines, geothermal technology, and advanced  batteries.   This is a government success story. The $12 billion we invested in  EERE, through 2012, yielded a more than $230 billion benefit to the  U.S. economy, and EERE has an annual return on investment of more than  20 percent. Entire industries are built on the back of the work EERE  does, stimulating a robust domestic clean energy economy.   The role of EERE is also critical to furthering the transition to a  low-carbon economy and ensuring long-term, robust, sustainable economic  growth. That is why this amendment would take $922 million from nuclear  weapons activities and give it back to EERE.   Just to be clear, this would still be a cut to that office. The  current bill funds EERE at $986 million less than the current enacted  level, but it would go a long way towards fixing this mistake.   Mr. Chair, I urge committee members to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, respectfully, what the gentleman is  talking about has been done many times. Again, in 2013, the Pentagon  said we could do this with one-third of the weapons we have now.   The cost of restoring a weapon like the B61 is more than its weight  in gold. We have already been told we have too many. So the plan here  is, let's restore as many as possible, build as many as we possibly  can, and maybe in the future we will be told again that we don't need  this many. In the meantime, we are using those resources to cut  necessary programs.    Mr. Chair, I ask for Members' support, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
