 Madam Speaker, the bill that was entitled the Violence  Against Women Act was passed in the House today, and I deeply regret it  was not the kind of bipartisan bill that I feel like we should have  had.   I don't know anybody in this Chamber who supports violence against  women or who does not want to do what we can to stop it. We battled  this out verbally in the Judiciary Committee.   It is so clear to me, having prosecuted sexual assaults of women who  were battered and beat up badly by their husbands or partners, that it  is such an egregious thing. I heard over and over as a felony judge in  Texas about how traumatized the women were and potentially would be for  the rest of their lives. I heard that, with counseling, they could work  to avoid having the triggers that put them right back in the place  where they were so badly abused.   More recent literature indicates that women who have been sexually  assaulted seem to have a much higher percent--a number of times,  apparently--more post-traumatic stress disorder after having been  sexually abused than even soldiers have after combat. One suggestion in  a study indicates that because soldiers are trained for what they go  through, perhaps that reduces the amount of PTSD. There is no adequate  training to prepare a woman for the kind of abuse that so many have  suffered.   One of the triggers that I have heard about as a judge that could  trigger this trauma, reliving the experience all over again, is a woman  being in a confined space and having a biological man come in to that  confined space. We have heard of women assaulting men who have done  that, some who may have been through sexual assault before.   I understand the idea of my colleagues across the aisle who want to  help avoid hurting the feelings of biological men who think they are  women, or according to the latest rendition of DSM-5, they are  suffering from gender dysphoria, which is kind of the opposite of  euphoria, but it basically is a confusion or a discomfort with one's  biologically assigned gender.   So I get it. You don't want to make them feel bad. You don't want to  hurt their feelings. So to avoid hurting their feelings, we would put  so many women at risk.    A lot of folks I have heard say that one in four women will be  sexually assaulted. If that is true, then that means that those who  voted for this bill today would seek to punish again and again and  again women who have suffered the outrageous and egregious assault  sexually or being battered with no way out.   When my friend across the aisle, Debbie Dingell, speaks of those  fears and terrors as a child and abuse going on in the home, my heart  goes out to her and anybody who has suffered like that.   But this is the United States Congress. Can't we have a bill that  doesn't have a political aspect and that just tries to do the right  thing by women who have suffered from sexual assault or being battered,  and let them have a confined space without a biological man being  forced into their traumatized world? Couldn't we agree on that? The  answer is no.   Debbie Lesko, my friend and colleague also on the Judiciary  Committee, has been such a victim. She had amendments. She spoke  brilliantly about the suffering and what needed to be done to fix the  bill. And yet, it was a political matter. It is too important that we  not hurt the feelings of men who think they are women. Therefore, we  are just going to let those women have to suffer. They just need to get  over their trauma, their PTSD, their reliving the nightmare of a sexual  assault over and over again. There is more regard for somebody's hurt  feelings than someone else's. A woman's terror forces them over and  over through such terror time and time again.   I read a story about a woman seeing a man and freaking out and  started to assault him. If a woman has been through a sexual assault  before, my heart goes to her, not for the guy who walks in and  traumatized her so.   Yet if the majority here has their way, that bill would become law.  Those traumatized women would be condemned to be traumatized repeatedly  at the demand of the Democratic majority in Congress, in the House  here.                                time  1330    I really would have hoped we could have had a bill that we could all,  of one accord, say: This is right. This is the thing to do by women.   But we can't get a bill to the floor to try to protect unborn women,  unborn girls.   In China, the abortion rate of girls is dramatically higher than that  of boys, because they think--they haven't been like me and had three  girls. They don't know how wonderful it is. So they think: Gee, if I am  only going to be allowed to have one child, I prefer it be a boy.   And there is outrageous discrimination--a real, true war on women-- going on in China. And China has yet to feel the destructive results of  what they have required.   But that is a war, killing an unborn child because she happens to be  biologically female. But we haven't heard condemnation about such  practice in this Congress, and that is a legitimate war on women,  children who were never given the chance to live simply because--not to  live outside the womb simply because they are biologically women. It's  very tragic.   I hope the Senate will use some common sense and have a heart for the  women who have been victims of assault. And I know. I have seen it. I  have heard it. As a prosecutor, I was frustrated by it, when a woman  would come in, beat to a pulp, black and blue, all bruised up and  scarred. You want to put her husband in prison forever, doing that to  anybody, and especially a woman who could not defend herself.   And, time and again--too often, the experts will tell you, those who  prosecute a lot--the woman will come back and say: You know what, now  that everything has healed, it is really my fault.   And they have this idea that somehow they deserved that kind of  beating when they didn't at all. As a judge, there were so many times  that I told young children--you could tell they blamed themselves for a  sexual assault--without the jury around, you need to understand this  was not your fault. You didn't deserve this. You never did anything to  deserve it. This was a crime committed against you. You were the  victim, and don't ever think that you deserved it, or you are the  guilty party.   Because it is amazing. Some men have the ability to make their  victims think they are the ones at fault.   Yet, for those who suffer the trauma again, having a man confront  them in a very confined space, they are going to be condemned to relive  it over and over again. It is very unfortunate.   Hopefully, wisdom will win out and the Senate will help us have a  bill that really considers the women and the damage done by the full  complement, if you want to call it that, of this Violence Against Women  Act, as it was labeled.  [[Page H3094]]    We have also heard repeatedly: There is no crisis on the border. It  is not a national emergency. This is a manufactured emergency.   We have heard that over and over. We have seen the montages of the  mainstream media saying: Manufactured crisis. Manufactured crisis.   Apparently Jeh Johnson, former Secretary of Homeland Security, didn't  get the memo that he was supposed to come forward and lie, so he  actually said: Yes, it is a crisis on the border.   It is a humanitarian crisis. It is a crisis for our Nation's  security. And it is so out of hand.   I keep hearing every day from people whose jobs it is to protect  America and to protect Americans, protect people who are legally here.  But they are so busy having to get names, whether they are fictitious  or not. Most of the time there is no proper identification. You have to  take the person's word, take the information on where they say they  have relatives.   I have pointed it out before, but I have been there when, while they  are going through questions with one end of the group, at the other  end, they are moving kids: Why don't you take this kid. You take this  kid, claim it is yours. Oh, here. You take my address. I'll take your  address.   These were addresses, apparently, where the drug cartels needed them  to operate or work in either their drug trafficking or sex trafficking.  So, under the laws the way they exist now, as the border patrolmen have  said, you know, the cartels say: We're the logistics. The drug cartels  get paid, and they hire some person to bring them across the border.   And the drug cartels, as I have heard them say out there in the  middle of the night, when it is not on their list of questions to ask,  but often it gets asked: How much did you pay to be brought into this  country?   And when the question is asked: Where did you get that kind of  money--$5,000, $6,000, $7,000, $8,000. You don't have that. Where did  you get that money?   Well, we got so much here, so much there, some sent from the U.S.   Well, what about the rest?   They are going to let me work it off when I get where I am going.   So then, our own Homeland Security, our own HHS, they ship the drug  cartels' future employees to the place that the cartels want them to  work.   So, I would hope that, as people read stories: Oh, no, another meth  lab busted, and this guy is part of the Mexican drug cartel, and it is  not in Texas, then that is when people should remember: Oh, yeah,  that's right. We use tax money to send the cartels' future employees to  the cities where they want them to work in sex trafficking or drug  trafficking.   I mean, an advanced civilization cannot continue to reach its  potential when we are bringing in the people and paying to put them  where they can destroy the city, the State, and ultimately our country.  This is a crisis.   As I understand, down in the quadrant of Texas, especially down south  of McAllen, where I have spent so many nights, one was saying: We  process 1,200 a day, process 13,000 in about 10 days--one area.   It is incredible. How can an intelligent civilization keep doing that  to itself in the name of helping our country and helping our neighbors,  when the fact is that the most compassionate thing Americans could do  for our neighbors in Mexico is to secure the border completely. Nothing  comes in, like drugs or women being sex trafficked. And, no, the drug  cartels are not going to take lightly to it.    But, you shut down the tens of millions of dollars every year that  are flowing from the U.S. into Mexico that fund the mass corruption in  Mexico, then Mexico, in my opinion, would become a top-ten economy in  the world.   They have got some of the best natural resources in the world, a  better geographic location than the United States because they are  between two continents and two oceans. Their trade ought to be  astounding.   And they have got some of the hardest-working people in the world. So  why aren't they a top economy? It is because of all the money that  flows across from the United States to the drug cartels in Mexico.   And, now, a huge source of revenue for them is the money they get  from sending people across by the thousands each week. It is insane.   We can't prolong this little experiment in self-government when we  are providing corrupt drug cartels with the method to take us down and  to keep Mexico subjugated to their evil intentions.   An article from CNS News by Terence Jeffrey, April 3 of this year,  points out that the five Federal district court districts that sit  along the U.S.-Mexico border were the top five districts in the country  for the number of defendants they convicted and sentenced to  imprisonment in fiscal year 2018, according to the data published by  the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts.   I have a rather interesting chart here. You see the Western District  of Texas has had 7,126 individuals convicted as criminals and sentenced  to prison; the Southern District of Texas, 5,939 people convicted as  criminals, sentenced to prison; Southern District of California, very  close, 5,470 convicted criminals sentenced to prison. So, it isn't just  a wrist slap. Sentenced to prison.   You have got the District of Arizona, 4,378; District of New Mexico,  3,923. Of course, Florida is behind them. And there are a lot of people  coming in illegally there, but it drops off so dramatically. So, you  see a bigger number of these 30 top sentencing courts have 700 or less,  and the Western District of Texas has 7,000.   So why is this? It is because they are border courts, and they are  dramatically affected by criminals coming across our border.   As I understand it, one of the MS-13ers that was caught--supposedly,  for every person we catch coming in illegally, there are many times  that many that are coming in that we don't catch. No reason to doubt  that that is true about gang members, gangsters, part of MS-13.   But, why are we allowing this to go on for ourselves?   The old saying in Washington is: No matter how cynical you get, it is  never enough to catch up. And, the more you hang around this town, the  more you see there is something to that.   Could it be that a majority in the House don't want to stop this  because the thinking is: These may be our future hope for being in the  majority and electing a President?   Heaven help us if that were the case, that power is more important  than preserving a union where freedom once abounded.                                time  1345    Of course, it could never adequately abound as there was slavery.   I just finished a book about the miracle of Yorktown, focused largely  on George Washington. And we know he ended up, though he was from a  State that prohibited the freeing of slaves, he freed the slaves in his  will.   But it wasn't until Martin Luther King, Jr.,   John Lewis, and  others, withstood tremendous oppression in order that a White Christian  boy like me could grow up and treat my brothers and sisters like  brothers and sisters. So we have made great progress.   And then it seemed like, just as we get to the sixties, and the  Constitution finally is meaning what it says, we start moving in a  direction that most civilizations, when you read their history,  actually were moving them to the dustbin of history.   Here we accomplished so much, and freedom for--we spread it around.  The Civil Rights Act helped with that. And now we are going to punish  women who have been victims of assault by forcing them to endure men  coming into their private spaces.   We are going to take a country where a massive amount of crime is  occurring on our border and our border areas--we are overwhelmed with  people that don't understand that it is a lot of education and a lot of  work involved in order to preserve self-government.   So it is not unusual to see socialism become so popular as an idea.  It sounds wonderful. Everybody's going to share and share alike.   But then you dig down, and you find out historically, you can't have  socialism; you can't have communism unless you have a big, powerful  government, strong enough that it can take from those who earn things  and give it to those who didn't, without their permission, and punish  them if they try to object. That takes a big, strong government.  [[Page H3095]]    And our Founders found actually, if you let people keep what they  earn, put a small tax on it so you keep order in the country, that that  is far more productive. That is how the United States has been the  greatest economy, and still is, in the world.   But those freedoms are going away. We are no longer ranked as the  freest country in the world. And as those freedoms diminish, it  shouldn't be a big surprise that freedoms are diminishing as people  that don't understand what it takes to preserve liberty and self- government come in, unabated, virtually. We are not stopping people  from coming in.   I am hopeful, prayerful, I hope that we will be able to have our  government do what has not been done, as far as I know, since Woodrow  Wilson, and that is, have people on the border, use nonlethal means,  and say, you are not coming in to our country illegally.   We ought to have a bipartisan bill passed pretty easily with regard  to asylum that says, You can't come into the United States and claim  asylum. You have got to go to the nearest embassy or an American  embassy, somewhere to claim asylum.   But if you come into the country illegally, and your first act in  America involves breaking the law, then we are not going to allow you  to apply for asylum. And you would see these massive caravans stop  overnight. That is why there is such fluctuation.   Earlier last year, numbers were way down. People in other countries  thought Trump was going to stop them; that we had a President that  wanted to do all he could to stop illegal immigration, secure the  border.   But by the time they found out that his party was not going to be in  the majority in the House, and that people said they want to eliminate  all barriers and let people in, anybody that wanted to come here, not  just the over 1 million that we give visas to, then the numbers picked  up.   And when they got word that if you have a child, whether it is yours  or somebody else's, it doesn't matter, that gets you into the country,  and keeps you in the country, get a child. Bring a child. That is the  thing to do.   It is really outrageous what that has done to children. Now they are  an important commodity to the drug cartels. Make sure, whoever you are,  wherever you are coming from, even if you are an MS-13er, bring a kid  with you, bring a child; because the United States made such a big deal  about we won't separate children from parents, even though, to American  citizens, we separate children from parents every single day of the  year because, in America, at least in the past, we didn't believe in  putting children in confinement for crimes their parents committed.   As a judge, I don't know how many warrants I signed, but I would  never allow a child to be incarcerated because of the alleged crime of  their parents. We don't do that. So we separate children from their  parents every day in America, in every county in America, in every  State in America. It happens all the time, because we don't punish the  children for the sins of their parents.   But once word got out that if you come to America illegally with a  child, you have got a good chance of staying in, claim asylum, the  courts are backed up, and you have got a good chance of staying for  years; and once you are here a number of years, just don't show up for  your asylum hearing, and they won't know where you are, and you will be  in good shape.   It has got to stop. The American people expect us to protect them,  protect the Constitution, and we have not done a good job of that  because there seems, so often, right here in this room, more devotion  to people that hate America, that still want to come here, than there  is to those who are legally here, that are saying, I don't want to be a  victim of a crime; would you please protect me from people coming in  illegally that may commit a crime against me.   And it shouldn't even have to be said, but because we have so many  ``lame stream'' media folks who either are liars by trade, or simply  that ignorant--no, all immigrants are not criminals or people looking  to commit crimes such as robbery, rape, destruction, murder; but they  do happen.    When you look at the percentages of people in our Federal prison who  are in the country illegally, an objective bystander looking on would  go: Wow, why is this country doing that?   Why are they letting all these people in illegally, when they may  have 20, 25 percent in their prison who are there because they are in  the country illegally? Why are they letting that go on?   And the only answer from an accurate cynic would be, Well, it is for  politics. They think it is good for one political party, so they keep  it up.   That is so dramatic, such a dramatic demonstration of where the real  problems are in this country.   And I have heard my friend, now Senator Marsha Blackburn, point out,  every city in America is now a border city, because of all of the  illegal aliens that they are having to take care of.   But an article in the Federalist, by John Daniel Davidson, April 4-- it is actually his testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee--but he says: ``I visited a migrant  respite center in McAllen, Texas, run by Catholic Charities of the Rio  Grande Valley, the charitable arm of the Diocese of Brownsville. Sister  Norman Pimentel helped establish the center in 2014, at the height of  the unaccompanied minor crisis, when Immigration and Customs  Enforcement was overwhelmed with thousands of children and teenagers  turning themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents.   ``At that time, the center was receiving between 60 and 120 migrants  a day, nearly all of them families from Central America. Here's how it  worked: Every afternoon, ICE dropped off the families at the Greyhound  bus station downtown, about a mile from the respite center. Greyhound  employees would call the center to let them know the migrants were  there, and the center would send vans to pick them up.   ``Once at the center, the children would be sent to a separate room  for a hot meal while the parents took turns working with volunteers to  get in touch with friends and family members all over the country.''   Or, as we have seen, sometimes those are not friends and family; they  are people to which the drug cartels have ordered them.   ``The goal was to get them all bus tickets and get them on their way  that same day, usually later that evening, because the next day there  would be another group of families coming in, and there simply wasn't  space for more than a couple dozen people to spend the night there.   ``This wasn't some gleaming facility. The center occupied one half of  a rundown commercial building, consisting of a large multipurpose room,  a bathroom and a shower, a small kitchen, and a separate room for the  makeshift cafeteria. There was an area in a corner of the main room  cordoned off for young children to play and a large stack of blue  plastic mattresses in another corner.''   Anyway, ``in December, the diocese moved the center to a larger  location, a former nursing home, about 16,000 square feet. . . . that's  because the number of migrants turning up at the bus station  skyrocketed. Today, the new respite center is receiving about 800  people a day''--800 people a day--``sometimes more. Last Sunday, 1,300  people were dropped off there and at other shelters around town.''   I mean, this is what is going on on our border, when we are the most  generous country in the world.   Some people even in this room will shout: You know, we are a Nation  of immigrants. That is right. And that is why we are so--we are the  most generous country in the world when it comes to giving free passes  into America. Nobody gives a million or more visas for legal entry into  their country. Nobody. Not these countries that are geographically  bigger. Not countries that have a number of times the population. No,  nobody is that generous as we are with letting immigrants in.   So it is outrageous to say, because we want to limit those coming in  to the very--the most generous number in the world, that we say come in  legally, what is wrong with that?   As has been said before, a nation with no borders will not be a  nation much longer. Not for long.   But, we find out, yeah, it is a moneymaker. It is a moneymaker for  the drug cartels. Some people profit off the people coming in here  illegally. The people that work here, either from  [[Page H3096]]  drugs or legitimate businesses, they send an awful lot of money home,  and that is the kind of people we want, people that care about their  families, want to help them provide, make their way. That is a very  noble thing to send money home to family. Unfortunately, that is not  all the people that are coming in these days.   I want to touch on one other matter, and that's with regard to the  special counsel. I know there are people, the House and Senate, that  say, Oh, you know, Robert Mueller is the gold standard when it comes to  prosecutor. I submit that is some pretty tarnished gold with an awful  lot of impurities, speaking metaphorically.                                time  1400    So I wasn't surprised when we learned that the Mueller report  indicated, really, there is plenty of evidence Russians were trying to  get the Trump campaign to conspire with them; no evidence they did  conspire with the Russians.   Through the years of questioning Robert Mueller in our committee and  doing a lot of research on the man, it would explain why I was so upset  when he was appointed as special counsel, because I wanted somebody who  would be fair and investigate all parts. But when we look back now, we  see all the indictments that came as a result of having a special  counsel, not one single one of the indictments involved a conspiracy of  any kind between anybody at the Trump campaign, including our  President, and Russia.   What we have learned from all the evidence we have gleaned in  committee and in public is that there was a conspiracy, and it involved  top people at the Department of Justice; it involved top people at the  FBI; it involved the Clinton campaign; it involved Fusion GPS; it  involved a foreign agent named Steele. He is a foreign agent.   And, by the way, our great Justice Department, such as it is--or was  in the last couple years--never bothered to tell the FISA court: This  man has no credibility with the FBI. We have stopped using him as an  agent of our government, the foreign agent that he is, because he is  not trustworthy.   Never bothered to tell the judge that.   And I don't know if it was one FISA judge or more, but the fact is  that the FISA judges, nobody has punished any of the applicants, or  affiants, that have come in and sworn before them that this is true to  the best of their knowledge.   That was a lie. They didn't give the judge the best of their  knowledge. It was a lie and they knew it, and they did it four times.   I have lost respect for whoever in the FISA court would not call  those lawyers in, or the FBI agents, and say: You lied to me when you  didn't tell me the full truth. You committed a fraud on my court, and  now I need to decide how long I am putting you in jail.   They haven't done that. That tells me we either need to get rid of  the FISA courts or we need to have such a big overhaul because they  have gotten too comfortable in that star chamber.   And I know all of them haven't, because I know there are some good  judges who have been nominated, confirmed by the Senate, and sit on  Federal benches. I know there are plenty of good ones. I have got too  many good friends not to know that. But we at least have some who don't  care when they are lied to if it furthers their own political ideas,  because that is the bottom line.   Why would the FISA court or courts that have been lied to, had fraud  against the court, why would they not have already punished the people  who committed the fraud against their court?   It seems to me it has got to be one of two reasons:   They must be dishonest people; therefore, they don't mind being lied  to; or   They were so politically aligned with the people who were committing  the fraud upon their court that they are fine with the fraud because it  helped accomplish their political agenda as well as the ones who  committed the fraud.   We need to do something about the FISA courts. It is a real problem.   I know there are a lot of people who think: Well, no, it is not  really a problem because it has only been abused against Republicans,  and we hate Donald Trump, didn't want him to be President, and so it is  okay for them to abuse the FISA court system and the warrant system and  the First and Fourth and Fifth and Sixth Amendments. It is okay to  abuse those because we don't like the people being abused.   But there is a reason that we have an adversarial system. With all  its flaws, it is the best there has ever been anywhere when it comes to  justice. We are not supposed to allow the kind of thing that has now  happened.   I was not surprised when Mueller couldn't help himself, Weissmann  couldn't help himself: Yeah, the evidence is not there to prosecute  anybody, but we want you to know we are not exonerating him.   Well, that is not a prosecutor's job. If a prosecutor learns that a  crime has most likely--has probably been committed and that a person  has probably committed it and they find out a crime has been committed,  they look for a person who probably committed the crime. That is the  job.   When you find the person, you gather enough evidence that you can  have probable cause that they committed the crime. You get them  indicted. You pursue them, prosecute them, convict them, sentence them.  That is how it is supposed to work.   A prosecutor is not supposed to ever go into something to exonerate  somebody. You don't go into it looking for evidence that exonerates  somebody. You are looking for evidence that shows they are guilty. And  if you don't find evidence that establishes they are guilty, then you  are supposed to move on; although, Mueller has had a problem with that.   We also have seen the history, whether it was Comey admitting that-- it sounded like he admitted a crime, because he leaked information that  he knew should not have been disclosed to a professor so that he would  get it to The New York Times so that they could have a justification  for appointing a special prosecutor. Wow.   You have got 18 U.S.C. 1905, disclosure of confidential information.  That is a general provision. It is a felony to disclose confidential  information. You have got other laws.   Well, this from the DOJ, their own regulations. If you look at 1- 7.110, it says: ``It is against the law to disclose classified  information to someone not authorized to receive it.''   But that has gone on during the years Mueller was head of the FBI.   We have had FBI agents make clear: No way we could prosecute a Member  of Congress without the knowledge and okay of the Director of the FBI.    That would be Mueller when they were pursuing Ted Stevens, Senator.  They fabricated a case against the man. He had evidence he was not just  not guilty, but completely innocent.   But you do your investigation. You gather up all the evidence that  would show somebody is innocent, completely innocent, 100 percent  innocent, and you don't let them have all their stuff back and you  manufacture evidence. You threaten a witness to get them to lie so you  can convict somebody. That happened to Ted Stevens.   When I first heard, gee, he had added a $700,000 addition to his  home, something like that, I am going, well, he should have known  better than that. Surely you are going to try a guy for that.   Well, it turns out he overpaid. He even told the contractor: Just  cash my checks. I have to overpay, because they are watching everything  I do, and I have got to keep my nose clean.   They still went after him and convicted him immediately before an  election that he narrowly lost.   Thank God there was an FBI agent with a conscience who did an  affidavit so the judge found out that the prosecutor, the FBI, had  framed Ted Stevens for a crime he didn't commit.   Those people should have been disbarred. They should have been thrown  out of the FBI. But the only guy forced out was the one who did the  affidavit, because Mueller--obviously, it had to be done with his  knowledge, that you run the guy off that had a conscience and reported  it to the court and you keep on the FBI agent that helped fabricate the  case against the longest serving Republican in the Senate at the time.   He wouldn't have been on that plane where he was killed if it hadn't  been for Mueller's FBI and the framing of  [[Page H3097]]  Ted Stevens. So he lost his seat in the Senate, even though he was  later exonerated.   And, of course, you know, we have these repeated examples. I am not  even going to go back into the Whitey Bulger situation when Mueller was  in Boston.   But, you know, Curt Weldon, serving here in the House, he was giving  speeches right here over and over about the FBI could have stopped 9/ 11.   I didn't know what he was saying, whether it was true or not. He  talked about a program Able Danger, but I sure did feel like Mueller  needed to respond, because this was a serious allegation against his  FBI.   Unbeknownst to me, he was going to respond, but not with a statement  that Curt Weldon was wrong. No. What they did, and I put the story--I  have got a lot of examples. I was doing an op-ed so people would know  some about Mueller that I know and had found out and read about.   Anyway, I started an op-ed. I let my friend Sean Hannity know: I am  doing an op-ed on Mueller, and normally papers only want 500, 800  words, max, for an op-ed, and I am already at 2,000.   Sean said: Just do it.   And, you know, it doesn't make me a dime in my case as a Member of  Congress, but I felt like the story needed to get out. So Sean said:  Well, yeah, we can put it up on the Internet. People can download it.   It ended up being 48 pages, but one of the things I brought out was  Curt Weldon's situation.   So I will read from the story that I included. This was from an  article by WND: ``Each of Weldon's 10 previous reelections had been by  sizeable margins. Polls showed he was up by five to seven points in the  fall of 2006. Three weeks prior to the election, however, a national  story ran about Weldon based upon anonymous sources''--they had to have  come from the FBI--``that an investigation was underway against him and  his daughter, alleging illegal activities involving his congressional  work.''   A week after the news story broke, alleging a need to act quickly  because of the leak--and, see, this is typical for Mueller and his  crime team. They leak information and then tell the judge: We have got  to do something quick because this information is getting out.   Yeah. You leaked it.   Just like when they used this dossier. I used to have respect for  dossiers. Now it is a pejorative. But it was prepared by a foreign  agent named Christopher Steele, hired by the Clinton campaign, using  Fusion GPS, using others like Nellie Ohr, wife of FBI top official  Bruce Ohr, and they used this guy's dossier. Information from  Christopher Steele's dossier, as fabricated as it was, was provided to  a reporter who did a story about it.   It was one of the other frauds upon the court. They tell the court:  See, not only do we have this information from Christopher Steele, a  foreign agent that is untrustworthy--unfortunately, they didn't tell  the judge that. They knew it, but they didn't tell it.   And they said: And look here. Here is a story that also has this  information that corroborates Christopher Steele--not bothering to tell  the judge, actually, that is Christopher Steele corroborating  Christopher Steele. And he didn't even--he just talked to people in  Russia.                                time  1415    So, you got a foreign agent using foreign agents. Who knows who they  worked for. Maybe Putin. So a foreign agent using foreign agents in  Russia, as he worked for the Clinton Foundation, Fusion GPS, to prepare  opposition research that was not true against the opposing campaign for  president.   So they didn't bother to tell the judge then here in Curt Weldon's  case. It must have been somebody from the FBI leaked that they were  going after Curt Weldon that helped them get the media involved and a  judge to sign off on a warrant.   And, gee, when they show up early in the morning at 7 a.m., before  business on a Monday morning--local TV and print media had all been  alerted about the raid--well, who would have done that, but the FBI  agents or maybe Mueller or one of his minions. They leaked to the  media: They are all out there and they were in position to cover the  story.   Within hours, Democratic protestors were waving ``Caught Red-Handed''  signs outside Curt Weldon's district office. But it turns out there was  no follow-up, there were no questions, no grand jury investigation,  nothing.   That is why they later called Curt Weldon's family and said: Hey, all  that stuff we got in our raid, you know, you can come get it.  Apparently, we didn't use it in a grand jury investigation.   No, they just used it to defeat Curt Weldon.   So, it shouldn't be a surprise when Mueller's report said: We didn't  have evidence of a crime by the Trump administration or Trump campaign  regarding collusion or any of that, but we didn't exonerate him.   Well, no, that is not your job. Of course, you don't exonerate  somebody.   But as special counsel--it sure seemed just like Comey, these guys  that were all in tight. You know, Comey, there was a great article some  years back about basically he and Mueller are joined at the hip.   What a great gift for Mueller, though. He is begging President Trump  to appoint him again back to being director of the FBI after Comey was  fired based on Rosenstein's memo. And the President said: No, I am not  going to give you a job.   Twenty-four hours later, he grabs a job that will allow him to go  after the man who wouldn't hire him as FBI director.   Mueller, if he had any sense of decency, he would have told  Rosenstein: Look, you and I, Rosenstein, Rod, we were involved in the  original Russia investigation when we know Russia was trying to get  uranium illegally. We really shouldn't be involved in this Russia  investigation. It may bleed over. And the President is supposed to  investigate. He wouldn't hire me yesterday. That will look bad.   But you would have thought a man of decency would have recused  himself, which Mueller did not do. There are so many reasons for both  him, Rosenstein, and certainly Weissman--they were all involved in that  original Russia investigation on uranium that they put a lid on so that  the sale could go through, because, let's face it, the Clinton  Foundation wouldn't have gotten that $145 million from the people  profiting from the uranium sale of U.S. uranium, ultimately to Russia.  It wouldn't have happened.   But Mueller not only did not recuse himself, he accepted the job and  immediately went about hiring people that hated Trump like he did. That  is not the mark of a real man of justice, a real person of justice.   And he had a policy, when he was FBI director, the 5-year up-or-out  policy, that caused us to lose, as was previously reported, thousands  and thousands of years of experience. Why? If you got people  experienced, they can tell you when you are screwing up, doing  something wrong as FBI director. He just wanted young people who would  salute the flag and do whatever he said. Very unfortunate.   So he brought down Ted Stevens. He brought down Curt Weldon. And what  about Dr. Steven Hatfill? I mean, the story was that President Bush  called him in--There is no evidence that Hatfill had anything to do  with this anthrax. Why are you still after it? Are you sure he is the  guy? And Mueller said: I am 100 percent certain; is what was reported.   And that is because, as the saying goes, normally Mueller--well, I  guess the saying is: Often wrong, but never in doubt.   He tells President Bush: I am 100 percent certain. Yes, Hatfill is  the guy.   He wasn't the guy. And that is why it cost the government a $6  million or such settlement for destroying his life.   If you look at Scooter Libby, Scooter Libby was framed, let's face  it. And there is a great story explaining all that, in fact, how Judith  Miller was manipulated. That poor person suffered as a result of trying  to do the right thing. But she was ultimately persuaded that Scooter  Libby said something he didn't. And she later, as it said, when Miller  read Plame's own memoir, in there discovered that Plame had worked at a  State Department bureau as a cover for a real CIA role. That discovery,  in Miller's words, left her cold. The idea that the bureau, in her  notebook, meant CIA had been planted in her head by Fitzgerald or the  FBI. It was a strange word to use for the CIA. Reading Plame's memoir,  [[Page H3098]]  Miller realized that bureau was in brackets because it related to her  work at the State Department. In other words, she shouldn't have  testified against Scooter Libby. She was set up and manipulated and, as  a result, a good man's life was destroyed.   But you will find, Mueller never apologizes when he always gets his  man. It is just sometimes it is wrong. It needs more investigation. Not  the Trump administration, but Mueller.
