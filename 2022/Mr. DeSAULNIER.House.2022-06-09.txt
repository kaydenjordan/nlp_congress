 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend,  Betty Reid Soskin, as she finally enters retirement from the National  Park Service at age 100. Betty has had too many jobs and too many  accomplishments and too many compliments for just 1 minute, so I will  share a few of the highlights of this remarkable woman's life.   During World War II, Betty was a file clerk for the Boilermakers  Union A-36 in Richmond, California, an all-Black union auxiliary.   In 2004, she became a park ranger with the National Park Service  assigned to the Rosie the Riveter Park in Richmond, California. In this  role, Betty shared her story as a young Black woman working during the  war and long held the honorable distinction of being the Nation's  oldest National Park Ranger.   Americans came from all over the country to listen to Betty's voice.  Betty has been recognized over the years for her advocacy and her  commitment to social justice, including by President Obama as Glamour  magazine's Woman of the Year, and recently, had a local middle school  named after her.   Betty is an important part of our community and our country, and I am  proud to call her a friend and a constituent. Her leadership and  passionate spirit are an inspiration to all of us, all who have been  fortunate enough to know her and for all Americans who know of her.   Congratulations, Betty, and thank you for a wonderful life of service  to our community and to our country.                            ____________________
