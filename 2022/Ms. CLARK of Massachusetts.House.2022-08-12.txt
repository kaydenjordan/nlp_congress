 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this is exactly what the American people need. It lowers  costs, it creates great-paying jobs, and it makes our communities safer  by addressing the lethal effects of climate change.   Seniors won't have to choose between putting food on the table and  paying for their prescription drugs;   More families are going to be able to afford healthcare;   Homes and cars will be more affordable and efficient;   U.S. companies will be able to create great-paying jobs and lead the  clean technology revolution;   Billionaires and corporations will finally have to pay their fair  share while working people will have more money in their pockets;   Costs will be lower, water will be cleaner, green jobs will be  plentiful, and our future will be brighter.   In every way, this game-changing bill moves America forward.  Democrats are lowering costs for everyday Americans. We are standing up  to special interests who have blocked cutting the cost of prescription  drugs over and over again and America's critical transition to clean  energy.   We are rebuilding a stronger, greener economy. We are infusing the  tax system with fairness. This is a win for the American public. This  is a win for people over politics.
