 And you've got to be fierce in fighting.         Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.    Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.  [[Page S686]]    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California submits a  question for the House managers.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Having been on the frontlines of combatting the ``big lie''       over the past 4 years as California's chief elections       officer, it is clear that President Trump's plot to undermine       the 2020 election was built on lies and conspiracy theories.       How did this plot to unconstitutionally keep President Trump       in power lead to the radicalization of so many of President       Trump's followers and the resulting attack on the Capitol?    Mr. Manager CASTRO. Senators, Donald Trump spent months inciting his  base to believe that their election was stolen, and that was the  point--that was the thing that would get people so angry. Think about  that, what it would take to get a large group of thousands of Americans  so angry to storm the Capitol. That was the purpose behind Donald Trump  saying that the election had been rigged and that the election had been  stolen.   To be clear, when he says the election is stolen, what he is saying  is that the victory--and he even says one time, the election victory-- has been stolen from them. Think about how significant that is to  Americans. Again, you are right, over 70 million--I think 74 million  people voted for Donald Trump. And this wasn't a one-off comment. It  wasn't one time. It was over and over and over and over and over again,  with a purpose.   We are not having this impeachment trial here because Donald Trump  contested the election. As I said during the presentation, nobody here  wants to lose an election. We all run our races to win our elections.  But what President Trump did was different. What our Commander in Chief  did was the polar opposite of what we are supposed to do. We let the  people decide the elections, except President Trump. He directed all of  that rage that he had incited to January 6, the last chance--again, to  him, this was his last chance. This was certifying the election  results. He needed to whip up that mob, amp them up enough to get out  there and try to stop the election results, the certification of the  election. And, you all, they took over the Senate Chamber to do that.  They almost took over the House Chamber. There were 50 or so or more  House Members who were literally scared for their lives up in the  Gallery.   A woman who bought into that big lie died because she believed the  President's big lie. This resulted in a loss of one of his supporter's  lives. A Capitol Police officer died that day--other of President  Trump's supporters. Two Capitol Police officers ended up taking their  own lives.   Defense counsel--their defense is basically everything President  Trump did is OK, and he could do it again. Is that what we believe;  that there is no problem with that, that it is perfectly fine if he  does the same thing all over again?   This is dangerous. He is inciting his base. He was using the claim of  a rigged election. We have never seen somebody do that over and over  and over again--tell a lie, say 6 months ahead of time that it is a  rigged election.   There is a dangerous consequence to that when you have millions of  followers on Twitter and millions of followers on Facebook and you have  that huge bully pulpit of the White House and you are the President of  the United States. There is a cost to doing that. People are listening  to you in a way that, quite honestly, they are not listening to me and  they are not listening to all of us in this room.   I just want to clear up--the defense counsel made a point about  something that I read earlier. The defense counsel suggested I  misspoke. I just want to clarify for the record that the tweet I  referenced--let me read you the tweet directly:         If a Democrat Presidential Candidate had an Election Rigged       & Stolen, with proof of such acts at a level never seen       before, the Democrat Senators would consider it an act of       war, and fight to the death. Mitch & the Republicans do       NOTHING, just want to let it pass. NO FIGHT!    So Donald Trump was equating what Democrats would do if their  election was stolen. He said they'd fight to the death. Why do you  think he sent that tweet? Because he is trying to say: Hey, the other  side would fight to the death; so you should fight to the death.   I mean, do we read that any other way?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.
