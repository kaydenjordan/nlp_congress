 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Day of  Prayer next week on May 5.   The United States has always been a Nation of prayer. From our very  first settlers to our Founding Fathers, our leaders have understood the  power of prayer and have consistently called the Nation to prayer  during times of consequence, adversity, conflict, and crisis.   Since the first call to prayer in 1775, when the Continental Congress  asked the colonists to pray for wisdom as they worked to form a Nation,  the call to prayer has continued throughout our history.   First officially established by an act of Congress and signed into  law by President Harry S. Truman in 1952, the National Day of Prayer is  a vital part of our country's heritage, and prayers remain very  important in strengthening the fabric of our society today.   I would venture to say that 90 percent of our country's challenges-- everything from drug addiction, to suicides, to infidelity, to the  breakdown of the family, to fraud, to the coarseness and vulgarity of  the language we see every day on television and witness in our  communities, and even political divisiveness--all are a direct result  of a moral and spiritual decline that can only be reversed by our  willingness to come before God, acknowledge our sinful nature, and turn  our hearts back to Him.   Only then will healing begin and divisions subside. For the hubris of  sin distorts our views of truth and creates divisions even among those  with whom we agree most of the time.   Our Founding Fathers understood the sinful nature of man. That is, in  fact, why they devised a government designed to disperse power by  creating three equal branches. Even the U.S. Congress--which is one of  those branches--the legislative branch, has two very different bodies  with different rules and different aims to help ensure that the  minority voice is not trampled, and that it is at least heard if it  cannot be accommodated.                                time  1015    Now, many ask me when we are going to fix Washington. My reply is  always this: When we fix our home life; when we fix our churches; when  we fix our communities, Washington will fix itself.   Those of us who have the honor of serving in Congress are, after all,  a reflection of our constituency, as designed by our Founders. And,  therefore, the two bodies of Congress are no more and no less than a  microcosm of society.   So, on the National Day of Prayer, let us all join in prayer for our  families, our communities, our State, and our Nation. May we pray for  forgiveness, to seek the face of God and to turn from our inherently  sinful ways. For when we do, we will hear, we will learn, we will  communicate, and unhealthy traps of division of all stripes will fall  away.   Through the power of prayer, we will achieve a renewing of our mind,  a renewing of our commitment to that which is honorable and virtuous, a  renewing of the family, our societal structure, and a renewing of this  great Nation we call the United States of America, the greatest lamp of  liberty and beacon of freedom, prosperity, and generosity ever known to  mankind                            ____________________
