 Mr. Speaker, hallelujah.   Yesterday evening, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  resigned. Good.   Under the Trump administration and Secretary Nielsen, both of whom  were empowered by my colleagues across the aisle, the United States of  America ripped children away from their parents and put them into tent  cities.   Ripping children away from their parents and lying about it to the  American people was evil, and it should have ended Secretary Nielsen's  career a year ago. Then, in December 2018, two little children died in  the custody of the Federal Government while under the care of Secretary  Nielsen.   She should have done the honorable thing at that time and resigned.  Those children did not deserve to die. That will be Secretary Nielsen's  legacy.   Mr. Speaker, the next Secretary of Homeland Security must commit to  laying out for the American people a plan of action that ensures our  border policy respects human life, promotes safety and dignity, and  reins in this administration's horrible policies.                            ____________________
