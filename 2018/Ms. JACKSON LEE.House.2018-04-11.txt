 Madam Speaker, outrage is certainly not a tough  enough word to watch the children of Syria, and innocent civilians, be  attacked by poisonous gas. Assad is a vicious dictator, and Russia has  propped him up.   It is important for the American people and for Syrian Americans to  know that we will not tolerate the kind of vile violence, particularly  against children. But Congress must stand for its constitutional  responsibility of debating an authorization to use military force. We  must not, at any time, recklessly ignore actions by the administration  that really should be a collaborative thought-provoking discussion and  debate on the strategy for dealing with the crisis in Syria, but, more  importantly, the propping up of Assad by Russia and its supporters.   The children need us in Syria to be able to stop both the bloodshed  and the terrible tragedy of gas attacks that immediately cause life and  injury. It is time for us--the Members of Congress--  [[Page H3131]]  to come to this floor and debate our strategy in Syria.                            ____________________
