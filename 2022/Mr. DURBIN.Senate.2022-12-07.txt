 Mr. President, it has been nearly 10 months--10 months  since that cold, dark morning when I was in the departure lounge at the  main airport in Vilnius, Lithuania, with my colleague Senator Chris  Coons. We watched on television as Russia attempted to seize another  sovereign country in the heart of Europe. I will never forget those  early scenes of Putin's horror unleashed on Ukraine.   My friends in Lithuania, who remember Soviet oppression all too well,  had warned of Russia's potential strike again in Ukraine, in Europe,  and beyond.   Years earlier, I had seen firsthand the seizure of Georgian land by  the Russian military in 2008. In 2014, my friend and fellow colleague  the late Senator John McCain and I, with a group of Senators, paid  tribute to those slain in Kyiv's Maidan Square just as Russia had  seized Crimea and was looking to forcibly take other areas of eastern  Ukraine.   But Putin and his henchmen failed miserably at understanding Ukraine  and understanding their resolve to halt him and his brutality. His  initial ploy to quickly topple Ukraine's democratic  [[Page S7013]]  government and replace it with a puppet failed immediately. And other  Russian military advances in eastern and southern Ukraine have been  rolled back time and again.   In fact, Ukraine's military has reclaimed hundreds of villages and  more than a thousand square miles of territory--good for them. Quite  simply, despite the horrific violence unleashed by Putin, the Ukrainian  people have prevailed. Their courage and their sacrifice is inspiring.   And the world has rallied to Ukraine's side, leaving Russia  isolated--should be embarrassed--and in retreat of Putin's folly.   Yesterday, I met with our Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda  Thomas Greenfield. We are lucky to have her. She is truly a skillful,  experienced, and talented person.   She reminded me earlier this year, more than 140 U.N. member states  voted overwhelmingly in support of a resolution that deplored in the  strongest terms Putin's aggression.   It also affirmed the international community's commitment to the  sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Ukraine.   Only five Nations dissented--they are the world's worst  dictatorships--aligning with Putin to vote against the measure at the  United Nations. A reminder that Vladimir Putin has utterly failed in  pursuing his twisted nostalgia for Soviet tyranny.   And the NATO alliance has held firm in its strong support to  Ukraine--this administration included--providing weapons to help them  defend their nation. More than 34 other nations joined us. The United  States and several key allies have imposed sanctions on nearly 8,400  Russian oligarchs and their families, 1,500 Russian entities, and 100  Russian vessels. The nations of the free world understand that Ukraine  is, in fact, our common frontline in the battle for freedom in this  world.   President Biden, too, with Secretaries Blinken and Austin, has  rallied unprecedented international support. Other nations clearly  understand what is at stake. The struggle for the rule of law over the  rule of chaos and brute force, that is what is at stake.   And now it is time for the United States and the rest of the free  world to continue to lift up our support.   It can be easy to get impatient, even despair, as Ukraine faces  continued Russian bombardment of civilian targets and, in many cases,  war crimes specifically designed to terrorize civilian populations.   I would like to show you a recent photo. It shows the U.N. High  Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk. He is speaking to defenders  in Kyiv in an underground shelter during a recent air strike.    Another of a child here hauntingly looking at a damaged school. He is  dressed for school. The building has been destroyed by Vladimir Putin.   Ukrainian civil servants are working around the clock to restore  access to electricity, water, and heat to allow hospitals and schools  to function.   The continued unified support and military assistance of NATO is  invaluable, and this Congress has been unified in providing this aid.   Make no mistake, Russia is losing the war in Ukraine. Its leaders now  are trying to break the will of the Ukrainian people.   As an amateur student of history, I know that the winter has often  been a defense for the people of Russia. Napoleon's advance of his  troops on Moscow was stymied by the coldest winter imaginable. They  said it was so cold that the birds fell from the sky. And we remember  well what the Nazis faced when they invaded Russia in a bitter winter  that was also a defense for the Russian people.   Vladimir Putin has turned the tables and, sadly, is using winter as a  weapon of war against common Ukrainian people--mothers, fathers, and  children.   I want to conclude by showing this one photo because it tells such a  story. These are members of the Ukrainian National Philharmonic  orchestra, performing in a darkened theater in Kyiv on Tuesday, lit  only by battery-powered lanterns. It says it all about the resilience  of the Ukrainian people.   Russia will fail.   Slava Ukraini.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Mia Perez to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Pennsylvania.   Judge Perez is an accomplished State court judge with an impressive  record as a litigator. And with her confirmation, this Senate will take  another important step forward in building a Federal judiciary that  reflects the diversity of America.   Born and raised in Philadelphia, Judge Perez received her B.A. from  Tufts University before returning to Philadelphia to earn her J.D. from  Temple University Beasley School of Law. She practiced as a criminal  defense lawyer for a decade, serving for 4 years as a State public  defender and another 6 years in private practice. In that time, she  tried approximately 1,000 cases to judgment, during which she largely  representing indigent defendants. For the past 6 years, Judge Perez has  served as a judge in the criminal trial division of the Philadelphia  Court of Common Pleas. She has presided over approximately 400 trials,  including 52 jury trials. Judge Perez has also taught trial advocacy at  her alma mater, Temple University Beasley School of Law, for more than  a decade.   In recognition of her extensive trial experience on and off the  bench, Judge Perez enjoys the strong bipartisan support of Senators  Casey and Toomey. The American Bar Association has also unanimously  rated Judge Perez as ``well qualified'' to serve on the Eastern  District of Pennsylvania. And if confirmed, Judge Perez would make  history as the second Latina judge--and the first AAPI judge--to serve  in this role.   I support this outstanding nominee, and I urge my colleagues to join  me in doing so.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper), the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine), the Senator from  Virginia (Mr. Warner), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) are  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper), the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine), the Senator from  Virginia (Mr. Warner), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock), are  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Kai Scott to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Pennsylvania.   A native of Philadelphia, Judge Scott earned her J.D. from West  Virginia University College of Law after receiving her B.A. from  Hampton University. After graduating from law school, she clerked for 2  years for the Honorable Donald Poorman of the Pennsylvania Department  of Labor and Industry, Bureau of Workers' Compensation. Judge Scott  began her legal career as a public defender, serving at both the State  and Federal levels for 18 years, including 5 years leading the trial  unit at the Federal Community Defender Office for the Eastern District  of Pennsylvania. During her time in practice, she tried more than 160  cases to verdict or judgment. Since 2016, Judge Scott has served as a  judge in the Criminal Trial Division of the Philadelphia Court of  Common Pleas. In that time, she has authored 60 opinions and presided  over 600 trials, including 120 jury trials.   With nearly two decades of litigation experience and 6 years of  judicial experience, Judge Scott has been rated as ``well qualified''  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by the American Bar  Association. She also enjoys the strong bipartisan support of Senators  Casey and Toomey, and I hope my colleagues will follow their lead in  supporting this highly qualified nominee.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms.  Duckworth), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Hickenlooper), the Senator  from Virginia (Mr. Kaine), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), the  Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr.  Warnock) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  John Frank Murphy to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District  of Pennsylvania.   Mr. Murphy's distinguished legal career will make him an asset on the  Federal bench. He received a B.S. from Cornell University, a Ph.D. from  the California Institute of Technology, and a J.D. from Harvard Law  School before clerking for Judge Kimberly A. Moore on the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Federal Circuit.   In private practice, Mr. Murphy has focused on intellectual property  and patent litigation. He has worked on litigation in Federal courts,  International Trade Commission investigations, and contested  proceedings at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In addition to his  IP and patent practice, Mr. Murphy has dedicated a significant amount  of time to conducting pro bono work for the Eastern District of  Pennsylvania's Prisoner Civil Rights Program. Mr. Murphy has been rated  unanimously ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association, and he  has bipartisan support from his home State senators, Mr. Casey and Mr.  Toomey.   Mr. Murphy's technical expertise and strong background in IP and  patent law will be an asset to the district court. I support his  nomination and urge my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms.  Duckworth), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Hickenlooper), the Senator  from Virginia (Mr. Kaine), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the  Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), the Senator from Virginia (Mr.  Warner), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms.  Duckworth), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Hickenlooper), the Senator  from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner)  are necessarily absent.    Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Jerry Blackwell to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of  Minnesota.   Mr. Blackwell will bring outstanding qualifications and deep  experience to the Federal bench. He received his undergraduate and law  degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill before  entering private practice and, eventually, establishing his own law  firm. Mr. Blackwell has specialized in commercial litigation, including  mass torts, and he has represented Fortune 100 and Fortune 500  companies in a variety of matters.   But in addition to his success in the private sector, Mr. Blackwell  has also answered the call to serve. In 2021, he served as a special  prosecutor in the trial of Derek Chauvin, who was convicted for the  horrific murder of George Floyd. Mr. Blackwell has also committed  himself to increasing diversity in the legal profession by serving as a  founding member of the Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers and the  Minnesota Equity and Justice Project.   Given his broad, extensive experience, it is no surprise that the  American Bar Association unanimously rated Mr. Blackwell ``well  qualified'' to serve on the district court. He also enjoys the strong  support of his home State Senators, Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Smith. I am  proud to support Mr. Blackwell's nomination, and I strongly urge my  colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms.  Duckworth), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Hickenlooper), the Senator  from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner)  are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, anyone who knows Coach Ken Leonard knows  that he cares deeply about football, but more than that, he cares  deeply about people. As Illinois' most successful high school football  coach, Coach Leonard has left his mark on our State by leading Sacred  Heart-Griffin High School to six State football championships and  harnessing the power of sports to build confidence in young athletes.  He never let any challenges get in his way and always inspired others  to follow his lead.   Ken Leonard was born July 7, 1953, in Lexington, IL, to John and Iona  Leonard. He was one of six children in his family, along with his two  brothers and three sisters. He graduated from Chenoa High School in  Chenoa, IL, where he was a four-sport athlete. Following high school,  Ken was a 2-year starter for the Hawks of Harper Junior College  football team in Palatine, IL, and a 1-year starter for the Trojans of  Dakota State University in Madison, SD. Ken then graduated college from  Illinois State University, but his career as a player was just the  beginning of his legendary legacy.   In 1980, Ken took his first football head coaching job at Gridley  High School, in a community of fewer than 2,000 people. A former  smalltown kid himself, Ken felt right at home at Gridley, but the  school struggled to recruit enough student players to field a football  team. And they were forced to shut the program down. This setback,  however, did not stop Ken from pursuing his passion for football.   Later that spring, Ken received a call from Sacred Heart-Griffin High  School, where he would go on to become the winningest high school  football coach in Illinois history.   After 39 seasons with Sacred Heart-Griffin and 43 total seasons  coaching high school football, Coach Leonard is set to retire this  December. By the time he leaves the locker room for the last time, he  will have coached 500 games and taught countless young athletes how to  work as a team.   As a parent of Sacred Heart-Griffin alumni and a fan of high school  football, I feel lucky to have met Coach  [[Page S7026]]  Leonard. Even after my kids graduated, I would catch as many games as I  could. I even had the opportunity to attend a celebration for the  Cyclones after they won one of their many State championships.   From my visits to Sacred Heart-Griffin, it was evident that Coach  Leonard's impressive 419-81 record reflects his deep passion for the  sport and tireless dedication to his athletes. If you ask Coach  Leonard, he would tell you that he has not worked a day in his life  because he loved what he did. And his impact extended well beyond the  gridiron.   Coach Leonard did not just coach football; he coached character. His  players have gone on to become All-Americans, college football players,  and even NFL stars. But Ken knew that life was more than tackles and  touchdowns. He believed that what mattered more than developing players  was developing good citizens, and he spent as much time in the  classroom and chapel as he did on the field and in the weight room.   His coaching style also inspired a legacy. My former staff member's  son, Brendan Daly, played for Coach Leonard at Sacred Heart-Griffin.  After playing and coaching collegiate football, Brendan joined the  ranks of NFL coaches--going onto win three Super Bowl championships  with the New England Patriots and another with the Kansas City Chiefs.   Ken's own son, Derek, now coaches at Rochester High School in  Rochester, IL, and has already won State championships of his own-- sometimes even facing off against his dad. When Ken started coaching  against Derek, Ken and I would exchange letters recounting the familial  showdowns. Now, it is possible that Derek may one day surpass his Dad's  record. And I know Ken will be proud as ever when that day comes.   Despite his long record of accomplishments, Coach Leonard would be  the last to take credit for his team's success on the field. Luckily  many of his friends and colleagues in the Sacred Heart-Griffin  community will be the first to give him the credit he deserves. It is  rare for stadiums to be named after people during their lifetime, but  in 2017, Sacred Heart-Griffin officials surprised Coach Leonard with a  ceremony and announcement that the turfed field would, from that point  forward, be known as Ken Leonard Field. Standing together with the  community and his wife, Liz, in the final year of her life, Coach Ken  Leonard was speechless. And today, we in Illinois are thankful.   Ken Leonard is a reminder that committing yourself to what you love  will shine a light for those around you. It is an honor to know Ken, as  he is an inspiration to so many.   After many accomplishments, including being named the two-time  National Coach of the Year and inducted into the Illinois Football  Coaches Hall of Fame, Ken Leonard will retire from coaching Sacred  Heart-Griffin's football team on December 31, 2022. In true Ken Leonard  fashion, he ended his career by coaching the Cyclones to defeat New  Lenox Providence Catholic 44-20 and bring home their sixth State  championship.   It is with great pride that I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing Coach Ken Leonard. I offer my best wishes and  congratulations to both Ken and his family on this important milestone.                            ____________________
