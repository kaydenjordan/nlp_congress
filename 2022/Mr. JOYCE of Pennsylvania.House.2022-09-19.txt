 Mr. Speaker, last year, over 100,000  Americans lost their lives to drug overdoses and 70 percent of those  deaths involved synthetic opioids like fentanyl.   These lethal compounds have continued to pour across a southern  border that is not secure, and into communities that remain overwhelmed  by this terrible onslaught.   Unless we in Congress act, possessing fentanyl will become completely  legal in just over 3 months.   Unless we work now to permanently make fentanyl a schedule I  narcotic, Americans will wake up on New Year's Day in a country where a  drug responsible for tens of thousands of deaths can freely be sold on  our streets.   Our communities are counting on us.   We need to pass legislation that permanently labels fentanyl as the  deadly drug that we all know that it is.   No more short-term bans.   No more playing politics while lives are at stake.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for holding this important Special Order tonight on an  issue that truly affects all Pennsylvanians and all Americans.   I thank Representative Smucker, my colleague, who is a true leader  and a fiscal conservative, for bringing this discussion to the United  States Congress.   Yesterday afternoon, I conducted a survey in my weekly newsletter,  asking respondents if, during the past year, the rising costs of gas  and groceries had cut into their savings, a relatively simple question.  Eighty-nine percent of the responders said yes.   Unfortunately, this is a sad reality. It is a sad reality in the  American economy that has been decimated by President Biden's failed  tax-and-spend policies that put far-left gimmicks ahead of the needs of  the American people.   During the Biden administration, at a time when small businesses  across our country were begging for workers, we saw legislation that  paid workers to remain at home. We saw the government mandates that had  no basis in science, policies that did not account for natural  immunity, policies that forced highly skilled workers to leave their  jobs, which, unfortunately, again, helped to cripple our supply chains.   During the Biden administration, we saw the so-called infrastructure  bill that spent more money bailing out windmills and solar farms and  did nothing on fixing roads and bridges. We saw the poorly named  Inflation Reduction Act, which the Congressional Budget Office says  will increase our national deficit over the next few years.   This is no time to throw a party celebrating these priorities as  inflation continues to rise. This is no party situation.   Time after time, we have witnessed an administration that cowers to  the radical left and fails to consider that their own runaway spending  has led to these soaring prices at the gas pump and at the grocery  store.   When I was seeing patients as a physician, one of the issues that I  would stress to parents is how important it was for them to provide  milk, whole milk, for their children's growth, whole milk that supplies  the necessary vitamins for bone development, brain development, and  muscle development. In the past year, the cost of milk has soared 17  percent.                                time  2030    That kind of price hike is unsustainable, and no administration can  take the health and well-being of Americans seriously while  deliberately creating policies that make healthy choices, like whole  milk, more expensive for American families, more expensive for the  parents who need to supply that for their growing children.   The cost of eggs is up nearly 40 percent, and the cost of food  overall has risen more in the past year than at any time since 1979  when Jimmy Carter was President.   To make matters even worse, real wages have gone down, and inflation  has outpaced wage growth for the 17 months that Joe Biden has been in  the White House.   The economic situation the American people find themselves in right  now is unsustainable. In the second quarter of this year, household  wealth in the United States fell by $6.1 trillion--a record drop that  has left families unable to pay for the everyday expenses that they  face.   As I traveled through my district in August--like my colleague, Mr.  Smucker, spoke about--I talked to a mother who told me that she was  making difficult decisions, decisions on whether to buy the necessary  groceries for her family, for her children's lunches or put gasoline in  the family car. No American should be making those decisions.   The record inflation that has put parents and families in this  position is the result of failed policies that have wasted taxpayer  dollars and flooded our economy with too much cash while simultaneously  killing the supply chain and causing shortages throughout the market.   When we look at the liberal partisan legislation passed this past  year, we see laws that choose winners and losers.   So let's take stock.   By handing out tax breaks for purchasing an electric vehicle and by  offering money to companies who put up solar farms that fail to produce  baseload power, the Biden administration has sent a clear signal to  Pennsylvania's energy producers that they are not valued by Washington  liberals.   By canceling the Keystone XL pipeline and putting a halt on new  drilling leases, Joe Biden has made one thing clear: He has no interest  in lowering gas prices. He has no interest in lowering energy prices.   Instead of pivoting to failed technologies like wind and solar that  cannot be stored and that can only be used during peak hours, we need  to return to the energy sources that are under the feet of my  constituents in Pennsylvania: the coal, the natural gas, the oil, the  Marcellus shale that can help  [[Page H7958]]  to return our Nation to a position of energy dominance.   After dismantling nuclear energy, Europe is facing the worst energy  crisis in a generation. By signing pro-Green New Deal legislation,  President Biden seems intent on making the same mistake--the same  mistake right here in the United States.   Digging out of that hole that President Biden and the far-left  Members of Congress created will take some hard work, and it is time  for Congress to stop the runaway spending on failed and untested  programs.   We need to stop giving taxpayer dollars to Green New Deal priorities  that only serve to hurt American families.   Right now, our communities are counting on us. The schools in our  district are counting on us to get inflation under control. The  families in our district are counting on us to get this runaway  inflation back under control.   As President Biden creates crisis after crisis in our economy, one  thing is very clear: We cannot spend our way out of the problems that  the Biden administration has orchestrated.   We need to return to fiscal conservatism and pass legislation that  supports Pennsylvania families, American families, instead of burdening  them with crushing inflation.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding this Special Order.
