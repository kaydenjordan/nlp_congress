 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, tomorrow, the Labor Department will  [[Page S4529]]  release the latest monthly update on the Democrats' inflation, but, of  course, the American people hardly need government statistics to  explain to them that Washington Democrats' reckless spending has sent  prices skyrocketing. Working families have been feeling this pain in  their pocketbooks every single day. Nearly two-thirds of middle-income  Americans say inflation is negatively affecting their finances. An  outright majority say they are experiencing ``financial hardship.'' A  third of the country says they are struggling to meet basic family  needs.   One parent shopping for school supplies recently told reporters:         I had to start early because the prices are so high. . . .       Being a parent, I want to give them the world. Sometimes, I       wish I could give them more.    But the back-to-school rush isn't the only headache facing working  families. Since President Biden and this all-Democratic government took  office, prices on grocery store essentials, from meat to produce, have  seen double-digit percentage increases. Some household items, like  furniture, are over 20 percent more expensive than they were on  Inauguration Day. The diesel fuel that moves practically everything  through the supply chain and onto store shelves is up nearly 80 percent  since President Biden put his hand on the Bible. Households' electric  bills are up an average of 20 percent since January of 2021. Commuting  and running errands costs more, with gasoline up 70 percent. As fall  and winter approach, homes that burn fuel oil are set to be more than  75 percent more expensive simply to keep warm.   The American people know who created this mess. They remember quite  well how Washington Democrats spent the spring of 2021 dining out on  leftwing spending and leaving taxpayers to pick up the bill. Poll after  poll has shown they are overwhelmingly dissatisfied with what President  Biden and his party have done since then.   One survey found five consecutive times that more than 70 percent of  Americans say our country is headed in the wrong direction. But that  hasn't stopped Washington Democrats from calling the same disastrous  play over and over and over again.   For months--months--our colleagues' primary focus was on repeating  the mistake they made in 2021. In August, on a party-line vote, they  did it. In the teeth of the worst inflation in over 40 years, every  single Democrat in Congress voted to ram through hundreds of billions  of dollars more in liberal spending.   The American people's top concern is runaway costs. And the supply  chain crisis could get even worse--much worse--in the next few days if  Democrats let their far-left, Big Labor allies engage in massive  railway worker strikes that would hamper the economy even further. But  Washington Democrats' top concerns appear to be something very  different. They prioritized waging war on affordable American energy in  a bill that will have no meaningful impact on global temperatures. They  prioritized inflating the IRS with $80 billion to audit more American  citizens without a word of accountability for when tax collectors allow  confidential information to become a political weapon.    Even the supposed reason for the spending package, ``inflation  reduction,'' is utter nonsense. Nonpartisan experts have concluded that  what Washington Democrats did last month will not meaningfully reduce  inflation at all and will actually make it worse in the near term. This  is what Democrats decided to put first for the better part of a year,  and it is what they are now trying to peddle to the American people as  a victory.   But the American people don't want tens of billions of dollars in  wish fulfillment for climate activists; they want affordable gas and  electricity. The American people don't want a bloated IRS; they want  stronger support for law enforcement at the southern border and in  their communities. Washington Democrats have consistently misunderstood  what the American people have asked them to do. They have repeatedly  ignored the basic challenges they have created for working families.   When the American people's priorities and Washington Democrats'  priorities have diverged, this government has put the people last at  every turn.    Madam President, after five generations and 140 years  of ownership, Bowling Green, Kentucky's Gaines Family has made the  difficult decision to sell their newspaper, the Bowling Green Daily  News. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring these towering  figures in Bowling Green's history, thanking them for their service to  the Commonwealth, and wishing the best for their paper's success under  its new owners.   The Gaineses laid down the roots of the Bowling Green Daily News in  1882 when John B. Gaines founded the Bowling Green Daily Times. At the  time, the city sported several newspapers, but the Gaines family's  paper quickly rose above the rest. The Daily Times later merged with  its chief rival, the Bowling Green Democrat, to create a new daily  called the Park City Daily News. The paper's name derived from Bowling  Green's nickname, ``beautiful park city,'' given to the city in an 1892  speech by Congressman and journalist Henry Watterson. The paper dropped  its new moniker after nearby Glasgow Junction, KY, rechristened itself  Park City in 1938, adopting Bowling Green Daily News as its name  shortly thereafter.   In the decades following, local newspapers around the country  consolidated into large news media corporations. The Gaines family  remained fiercely independent, though, keeping their paper family-owned  and -operated despite outside pressure. They understood that, to  provide the best possible coverage of life, breaking news, sports, and  politics in Bowling Green, the paper had to be run by a local family  with deep ties to the community. The Gaines family passed ownership  down from one generation to another, and by this year, the Bowling  Green Daily News was one of the oldest family-owned newspapers  remaining in the South.   From my first run for statewide office until today, I have had the  pleasure of working closely with the Bowling Green Daily News's  editorial and news teams. Often when I visit Bowling Green, I go  straight to the paper's offices to meet with members of the editorial  board and the Gaines family to discuss current events in the  Commonwealth. Alone among most of Kentucky's largest papers, the  Bowling Green Daily News opinion pages are filled with a diversity of  ideas and discourse. As a result, their editorials usually come closest  to reflecting what most Kentuckians actually believe about their State  and our politics.   Over the decades, I have developed a close working relationship with  the Gaines family and especially Pipes Gaines, the publisher emeritus  of the Bowling Green Daily News. Pipes joined the family paper full- time in 1966, following a career in the U.S. Army that included Active  Duty in Korea. He has been a mainstay of the paper ever since,  navigating rapid changes in the media industry and shepherding the next  generation of talent into leadership roles at the newspaper, including  his sons, Scott and Steve Gaines. Last year, Scott succeeded his father  as the paper's publisher and joined his brother, who serves as an  editor, as the fifth generation of Gaineses to help lead the Bowling  Green Daily News.   The Gaines family delivered an immense service to Bowling Green by  running the city's flagship paper, but refused to keep their public  works confined strictly to the family business. In 2007, the Gaines  family created the Gaines Family Fund for Excellence in Print  Journalism at Bowling Green's Western Kentucky University, forming an  incubator for future local journalists at WKU's School of Journalism  and Broadcasting. This type of generosity was part and parcel of the  Gaineses' success, demonstrating a deep dedication for, and connection  to, life in Bowling Green.   The Gaines family's impact on Bowling Green has been felt all across  Kentucky. From media, to education, to philanthropy, their  extraordinary work on the Commonwealth's behalf will have an enduring  impact. I thank the entire Gaines family for their stewardship of  Kentucky's news media and wish them the best in the next stages of the  family's life.                            ____________________     Madam President, Asbury Theological Seminary in  Wilmore, KY, has charted quite a few major milestones in American  Christian life. The school was the home of the first Christian music  festival in the country; they established the first department of  prayer and spiritual life at an American seminary; they have readied  thousands of graduates to serve at every level of religious life. This  year, Asbury is celebrating another milestone, marking 100 years of  operation. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this renowned  Kentucky institution and recognizing its outstanding contributions to  our Nation's spiritual strength.   When Dr. Henry Clay Morrison founded Asbury Theological Seminary a  century ago, he did so with one simple motto: ``the whole Bible for the  whole world.'' Back then, the school only had three students and a  skeleton staff. But Dr. Morrison was an energetic, effective leader,  and soon, Asbury was attracting theological students from across the  country and world to learn how to spread the gospel in the tradition of  John Wesley.   Since its earliest days, Asbury has grown by leaps and bounds, now  enrolling more than 1,800 students from 80 denominations and 50  countries. It is among the 10 largest accredited theological seminaries  in the country, with satellite campuses in Tennessee, Oklahoma,  Colorado, and Florida and a robust online presence. The seminary also  shares a heritage with Asbury University, one of Kentucky's finest  Christian universities, and helps the school provide a faith-driven  education to students pursuing secular professions.   Today, Asbury's reach extends far beyond Kentucky and all across the  globe. With several U.S. Navy chaplains as graduates, they even have  representation in every time zone on the planet. Asbury alumni have  served as pastors, church planters, missionaries, counselors,  educators, nonprofit leaders, and in government. As much as the school  has grown over the past 100 years, though, Asbury remains firmly rooted  in its Jessamine County home. The vibrant community surrounding the  school is a testament to its founders' enduring commitment to Kentucky.   I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Asbury Theological  Seminary president, Dr. Timothy Tennent, and to all of Asbury's  administrators, professors, alumni, and students, who do so much to  support mission-based  [[Page S4537]]  service in the Commonwealth. They have helped put Kentucky at the  center of America's religious education system. I ask my colleagues to  join me in congratulating Asbury Theological Seminary on a century of  service and success and wish them the best as their school continues to  evangelize and spread scriptural holiness throughout the world.                            ____________________
