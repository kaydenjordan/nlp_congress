 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee  on Rules, I call up House Resolution 829 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 829         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 6119) making       further continuing appropriations for the fiscal year ending       September 30, 2022, and for other purposes. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Notwithstanding clause 8 of rule XX, further       proceedings on a vote by the yeas and nays on the question of       adoption of a motion that the House suspend the rules offered       on the legislative day of November 30, 2021, or December 1,       2021, may be postponed through the legislative day of       December 10, 2021.        Sec. 3.  House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021 (as       most recently amended by House Resolution 774, agreed to       November 5, 2021), is amended by striking ``December 3,       2021'' each place it appears and inserting (in each instance)       "January 21, 2022''.        Sec. 4.  Notwithstanding section 3 of this resolution, on       any legislative day of the second session of the One Hundred       Seventeenth Congress before January 10, 2022--         (a) the Speaker may dispense with organizational and       legislative business; and        (b) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved if applicable.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate  only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today the Rules Committee met  and reported a rule, House Resolution 829. The rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 6119 under a closed rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations and one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides that requested roll call votes on suspension  bills considered on November 30, December 1, or December 2 may be  postponed through December 10.   Finally, the rule provides for recess instruction suspension  authority and same-day authority through January 21, 2022, and allowing  the House to convene the second session of the 117th Congress on  January 10, 2022.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider a continuing resolution to  keep our government open and operating for the American people. A  continuing resolution will allow the Appropriations Committee to  complete its work on full-year appropriation bills and provide needed  funding to many critical programs that help our small businesses, our  veterans, our local governments, and so much more.   It is, frankly, a bit disturbing that we need a structured rule for  this very basic function. I think it speaks volumes that the other side  seems uninterested in engaging in our most essential responsibilities.  I would say I was surprised but, sadly, this appears to be just another  step in a long line of attempts to undermine needed accountability and  investment this year.   In September, we passed a continuing resolution to keep the  government open until December 3 and allow for the House and Senate to  negotiate omnibus government funding legislation.   The other side has so far refused to negotiate for full-year funding  bills.  [[Page H6866]]  They have refused to be responsible with the programs that so many of  our constituents depend upon.   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I know firsthand the  impact that a lack of full-year funding will have.   Without full-year funding, we will not be able to help the VA reduce  its backlog to help our veterans and their families.   We will not be able to provide our military with the funding to  promote readiness, and we won't be able to provide a badly needed pay  raise for our troops.   We also won't be able to help our small businesses, who continue to  struggle because of the pandemic.   Those problems may be acceptable to the other side, but not to  Democrats. As the economy continues to recover from the pandemic, this  bill will ensure that we can keep the government open and avoid the  disastrous consequences of the Republican-led 2018-2019 shutdown.   In the meantime, we hope Republicans will start the process of  offering constructive proposals to address the critical issues facing  our country. Our constituents deserve that much at the very least. I  look forward to that discussion when it does occur.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I once again state that the failure of not being able to pass a  timely budget lies at the feet of the Republican Party. They have  refused to come to the table with actual fair negotiations.   If my colleagues across the aisle want to have a debate on a woman's  right to choose what to do with their bodies, then I would welcome  that.   I would also welcome a debate on issues like gun violence. If we care  about life and we say that we are pro-life, we should be pro-life for  everyone, including our high school students that are suffering every  single day at the hands of the failure of this Republican Party to come  to the table.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I welcome a healthy debate on the future of our children while they  are in school. A healthy debate will also include a responsible code of  conduct, basic respect, and accountability issues.   It would also include accepting the fact that our children every  single day are subject to gun violence, but yet, conspiracy theories in  full display in Congress continue to deny our children and their  parents the safety that they are demanding.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Continuing conspiracy theories, the big lie, drove thousands of  Americans to come to the U.S. Capitol in a violent attempt to overthrow  our government. In full display today, once again we have Republicans  that are continuing with their conspiracy theories about what is and  isn't happening on our school grounds.   Well, let me tell you what is happening in some of the schools in my  district.   For the very first time, under the Biden administration, children  have access to healthy food. They have food programs. They are learning  how to grow their own food.   For the very first time, families that spend hours driving to and  from work, hardworking parents, have the relief of knowing that  childcare is available for their children.   This is what is at stake today, the real issues of what is happening  and not happening in our schools and access to education. It doesn't  just take a healthy family to raise a child. In the words of the former  first lady, sometimes it takes a village.  [[Page H6868]]    Vote on this CR. Fund the government and continue to fund healthy  programs that help our children thrive in their schools.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, by continuing to promote conspiracy theories and  refusing to come to the table to talk about the real issues that we are  funding here today, the Republicans in Congress continue to deny  parents and children the education that they need by continuing to deny  healthy food programs, once again.   So let's focus on what is healthy and not healthy for our children.  Continuing to drink the Kool-Aid that led thousands of people to hurt  our U.S. Capitol Police officers, to beat them with our own American  flag, that is what they are selling here today.   We need to work on a budget for the people. This is the people's  House. That is why they voted for us to come to Congress. Let's focus  on the real issues and not play into the political theater that is  being offered here today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   We have just witnessed, once again, that the other side of the aisle  has zero--zero--interest in governing. Zero. Republicans apparently  have no interest in leading and zero--no agenda on how to lead. Zero.   Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to make sure that the programs that  our constituents depend on will be able to continue. Democrats are  trying to make sure that our troops--you know, the ones that you claim  to support--have the resources to defend our country, to defend the  Constitution that you have sworn to defend.   Democrats are trying to make sure that our hospitals and our health  clinics have the resources to help those who are sick with COVID. You  can boo all you want, but many of you have continued to spread this  pandemic by refusing to wear a mask.    Madam Speaker, we are seeing a full  display of  [[Page H6870]]  the political theater that the Republicans bring to Congress. Zero.   Madam Speaker, as we saw in the last vote, Republicans just want to  go home. They just want to go home. Democrats are here for the people.  We need to keep the government open. We need to work on full-year  funding bills to address the critical challenges that our Nation faces.  Democrats are here to lead.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the CR. I urge a ``yes'' vote  on the rule and the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 829         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 6056) to ensure the rights of parents are honored       and protected in the Nation's public schools. All point of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions of the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one house of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and Labor; and (2) one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6056.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
