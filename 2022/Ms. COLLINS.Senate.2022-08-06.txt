 Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading  of the motion be dispensed with.    Mr. President, the underlying bill provides billions of  dollars to the IRS to hire 87,000 additional auditors, yet more than 50  percent of the current IRS employees have yet to return to their  offices or work sites.   Here are the consequences: Four out of five phone calls from  taxpayers go unanswered; 21 million returns have not been processed;  refunds are taking 6 months or more.   My motion would simply prohibit the IRS from using these billions of  dollars to add 87,000 new employees prior to bringing 90 percent of  their workforce back to the office.   I would note that that 87,000 number is more than the combined  employees at the Pentagon, the State Department, the FBI, and the  Border Patrol agents combined.    Mr. President, I request the yeas and nays.
