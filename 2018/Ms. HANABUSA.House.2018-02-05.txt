 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2371, the Western Area Power Administration  Transparency Act will help foster greater transparency and promote  public confidence in the Western Area Power Administration, also called  WAPA. WAPA is a critically important Federal agency that helps deliver  power to nearly 40 million Americans across 15 States. This bill would  establish a 7-year pilot project requiring WAPA to publish information  online detailing the rates charged to customers for power and  transmission service.   The legislation would also require WAPA to publish a detailed  accounting of all expenditures, capital costs, and staffing costs by  region and at WAPA's headquarter office.   Finally, the legislation directs WAPA to publish information on the  amount of unobligated balances the agency retains each year.   For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2888 establishes the Ste. Genevieve National  Historical Park in the State of Missouri.   Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, is a small town on the banks of the  Mississippi River that was established by French settlers in the mid- eighteenth century.   Due to its unique collection of French vertical log architecture, the  town was designated as one of the Nation's first National Historic  Landmarks in 1960.   In 2016, the National Park Service completed the special resource  study and determined that the area exemplifies an important aspect of  American history not adequately represented and protected elsewhere,  therefore, meeting the suitability criteria for inclusion in the  National Park System.   This site went through the process and has fulfilled all the criteria  for becoming a new unit of the National Park System.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out something that we do not  normally see in the Public Lands and Environmental Regulation  Subcommittee of Natural Resources, and that is the people of Ste.  Genevieve feel so strongly in what they do that they actually came to  support those testifying in time-sensitive dress. As we looked at the  various photographs of what they do to preserve their town, they were  there before us in those same costumes. This is how serious the people  of Ste. Genevieve are of the preservation of their site.   Mr. Speaker, for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to please  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill redesignates the Jefferson National Expansion  Memorial as the Gateway Arch National Park.   The Gateway Arch has become synonymous with the St. Louis skyline,  and this is an important change that gives this national icon an  updated and recognizable name.   S. 1438 passed the Senate by a voice vote, so with our support today,  we will be sending it to the White House for the President to sign.   I congratulate the Missouri delegation for coming together in a  bipartisan fashion and working so hard to move this through the  legislative process.   The House version of this bill was introduced by Representative Lacy  Clay. Unfortunately, he was not able to be here this afternoon, but he  deserves a hearty congratulations for his work on this initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, again, I congratulate the  Missouri delegation for coming together in a bipartisan fashion and  working so hard to move this legislation forward. We are going to, by  passage of this legislation, give this very national icon an updated  and recognizable name, as it has always represented, really, when you  think about it, the Skyline of St. Louis.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues support this great piece of  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree), the sponsor of this bill.  [[Page H754]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I can make this even more real for people. Hawaii, as  you know, my home State, is very close to Asia. We have many of the  cuisines of Asia, and I can tell you that these are delicacies. Sea  urchins are also called uni, for those who frequent sushi bars, and sea  cucumbers are called namako. I grew up eating both, and they are very  critical and a major part of what we consume, especially, not only in  the sushi bars, but during festive holidays in Hawaii. So you can  imagine what it means in terms of an export industry for Maine, not  only to my home State, but also to the Asian market.   For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I join the introducers of this bill,  the sponsors, and I ask that my colleagues support this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor to share the floor with my good  friend from Alaska.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 219 instructs the Secretary of the Interior, after  consulting with the Forest Service, to resurvey the Lost Creek section  and other additional lands by the Swan Lake hydroelectric facility so  the Interior Department can modify the boundary and convey land  necessary for the facility's expansion.   The Swan Lake hydroelectric facility is a tall concrete arch dam at  the head of the Carroll Inlet. The project was authorized by FERC, and  operation began in 1984. It is currently operated by a not-for-profit  Alaskan Joint Action Agency called the Southeast Alaska Power Agency.  These utilities provide an estimated 62 percent of the power consumed  by the communities they serve.   The survey that was used to convey land for the expansion project  contained a mistake and omitted the Lost Creek section and other  additional areas.                                time  1800    More land, however, needs to be conveyed to the State of Alaska to  utilize the additional reservoir storage from the recently finished  expansion project. Because this bill corrects that mistake, conveys  needed land for the facility expansion, and was supported by the U.S.  Forest Service, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that, given the nature of this bill--and we  all know that when it comes to Alaska, no one is a better advocate and  the strongest proponent of what is right and for the State of Alaska  than my good friend, the Representative from Alaska. This is a bill  that corrects that mistake, it conveys the needed land for the facility  expansion, and it is supported by all the necessary Federal agencies.  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
