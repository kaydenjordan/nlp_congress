 Mr. President and colleagues, the Republican tax plan is  now racing to completion in secrecy and shame. Republicans are  finishing it in secret because it is a shameful scheme the American  people overwhelmingly oppose.   Today the Senate is going to debate whether to go to conference with  the House to resolve the differences between the two plans that the  Republicans have passed on a wholly partisan basis. Not a single  Democrat in the House and not a single Democrat in the Senate is in  support of this bill. I think it is clear that the conference committee  that will meet in the days ahead is nothing more than theater. It is  not going to be an honest debate in the light of day. There will not be  an honest debate that the American people can listen to on the prospect  of $10 trillion worth of tax policy changes that will reach into  corners of every part of this country and every household in America.   The truth is, Republicans from the other body and the Senate are  hashing out differences right now--right now, behind closed doors. They  are packing the bill with even more goodies, even more loopholes for  the well connected and special interests. There is no telling what  swamp creatures have crawled up to Capitol Hill to get their fingers on  this bill at the eleventh hour. The basic proposition on offer is this:  taking money and healthcare away from middle-class Americans to pay for  tax cuts for the multinational corporations, the powerful, and the well  connected. That proposition isn't going to change. Apparently, now the  Trump administration is calling for more speed and even more secrecy,  just so the President can claim a victory and Republicans in Congress  can appease megadonors, who made it clear they are frustrated by a  sputtering agenda.   What unfolded here last week is a black mark on this storied  institution of the Senate. It was the climax of a process marred by  recklessness and partisanship. This took place after 17 moderate  Democratic Senators tried again last week, while the Senate still had  the opportunity, to have a bipartisan plan. Well, I renewed my plan, my  ideas--the only two bipartisan Federal income tax reform bills in  decades, written by senior Republicans and moderate Senators.  Bipartisan plans were discussed yet again last week before the Senate  took off on this reckless course.   Senators did come to the floor last Wednesday and Thursday prepared  for a debate, but it was cut short by the partisan reconciliation  process--just 20 hours, evenly divided between the two sides. Wednesday  turned into Thursday, and there was no final Republican bill. Then  Thursday became Friday, and still Republicans had their plan hidden in  the shadows. Then on late Friday--late Friday, well after dark--I was  handed, personally, a new version of a 500-page bill by a key official  in the Republican caucus who said: Here is the bill.   There was no opportunity for review or debate. The distinguished  majority leader had said to me personally during the course of the  afternoon, when I was asking every 30 minutes, that there would be  plenty of time--plenty of time--to review the bill. Not only was there  not plenty of time, there was essentially no time, and it reached a  point as we heard from our colleagues last week, that notes on  technical material were scribbled into the margins.   We had questions about education provisions that seemed to benefit  one academic institution. There are plenty of them that are deserving  in Oregon and Pennsylvania, but this would seem to benefit just one.  Special interest handouts were air dropped right up, apparently, to the  very last minute, with huge giveaways to oil companies and hedge funds.  The unintelligible lines became a metaphor for what this whole debate  was all about--haphazard work that not a schoolteacher in America would  give a passing grade to, if some kind of work product like that was  submitted to them.   Of course, this is what the majority party here, the Senate  Republicans, said was a full and honest debate. The technical term here  is ``regular order,'' but the fact is, those $10 trillion of tax  changes were made in secret. When the bill that was brought to the  floor finally appeared, it was clear that Republicans had played ``hide  the ball'' with their tax plan until the very last minute.   There was not a single hearing on the specifics of the legislation. I  heard so many times in the debate that there were 70 hearings. My  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I wish I had a nickel for  every time I heard that there were 70 hearings. There was not one  single hearing--not one--on the specific provisions of that  legislation. There was no bipartisan input. No Member of this body can  possibly claim to have read everything before they voted.    Now the recklessness continues. Republicans are sticking with the con  job on the middle class as they work out the differences between their  two plans, again, behind closed doors. Whatever product comes out of  these negotiations is still going to raise taxes on millions of middle- class Americans and drive a dagger into the heart of the Affordable  Care Act. Why? To pay for yet more handouts to faceless, multinational  corporations. There are still going to be bigger tax cuts for those  multinational corporations that ship jobs overseas than there will be  for those businesses that create red, white, and blue jobs here at  home.   What ought to cause even more alarm for Americans over the coming  weeks are the special interest goodies that are still being packed in-- the handouts nobody yet knows anything about.   Down on K Street, they seem to be licking their chops as they read  the bill the Republicans wrote so quickly and carelessly. It looks to  me like a whole flock of tax lawyers are scheming and planning their  next moves.   According to reports, the big sticking point in the negotiations  between Republicans isn't about how you are going to help middle-class  families or how you are going to protect healthcare, they are debating  whether the corporate handouts ought to get bigger. They are already  slashing the corporate rate down to 20 percent, and now they are  debating whether corporations should actually be required to pay it.   I note that in both of the tax plans I put together that were  bipartisan, written with two conservative Republican Senators close to  the majority leader, during all of those talks, we didn't hear about  corporations saying they had to have a tax rate of 20 percent.   The American people do not want this plan to become law. I heard that  this past weekend. I had two town meetings in communities where Hillary  Clinton had a lot of support and in communities where Donald Trump had  a lot of support, and I am telling you this tax cut bill is unpopular  all over. It is hard to write a tax cut bill that is unpopular, but  somehow Senate Republicans actually managed to do it. That is what I  heard in townhalls and when I met with folks last weekend at Fred  Meyer, our iconic store. We heard it all over. I can promise every  Member of this body the American people have a sense of what is coming  now.   The Republican deficit hawks who flew away when the proposition of a  [[Page S7870]]  $1.5 trillion budget-busting tax bill came up, they are going to come  flying back. They will be flying over the horizon, returning. There is  already a whole lot of frightening Republican talk about the fiscal  crisis facing our country, exploding deficits, spending run amok. In  fact, Republicans haven't even waited for this tax plan to become law  to crack out the fiscal crisis talking points. We hear all the talk,  the President at rallies and talking on national television about  entitlement reform. It is a whole lot of focus group-tested code for  cutting the safety net, the lifeline programs for the vulnerable:  Medicaid, Social Security, Medicare, the anti-hunger programs. That  sure looks like what is next on the slash-and-burn to-do list.   Here in the Congress, the Speaker said a few weeks ago we have a lot  of work to do in cutting spending. Ways and Means Chairman Brady talked  about welfare reform and tackling the entitlements. The Freedom Caucus,  the far right folks in the Freedom Caucus, are using the tax bill to  lock in promises on spending cuts and the safety net programs, and  nobody knows yet what secret guarantees they have been given.   Last week, as Republicans were getting ready to spend a trillion and  a half dollars on handouts to corporations--just put your arms around  that for a moment, Mr. President--I heard for years in the Finance  Committee and the Budget Committee about how Republicans want to be  fiscally minded and tight with a dollar. Right away, out of the gate,  they said we will spend a trillion and a half dollars in handouts to  corporations--corporations already awash in money. What we heard is the  leadership of the other side of the aisle saying we are already  spending ourselves into bankruptcy, and they were blasting what they  called liberal programs for the poor.   The chairman of our committee, whom I admire greatly, said: When it  comes to helping the vulnerable, we don't have the money anymore. We  don't have the money anymore for the vulnerable, but somehow we can  borrow billions of dollars to have a $1.5 trillion handout to  multinational corporations awash in money? It sure indicates to me some  out-of-whack priorities.   Then we heard our colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey, say on  the floor that there wasn't a secret plan to cut Medicare and Medicaid  and Social Security. I give my colleague from Pennsylvania credit for  his honesty because he is right about one thing. They are not keeping  this tax plan a secret. Republicans are talking about the tax plan and  the prospect of these entitlement cuts now in the open. The tax plan  may be secret, but the plans for cutting entitlements are going to be  right out in the open.   Colleagues, I want to close with this. I heard this weekend, and I  hear at every stop I make, that the people of this country do not want  this partisan tax plan to become law. They understand what is happening  now. The working people and the middle class are being forced to pay  for handouts to multinational corporations; that the Republican plan  puts the interests of the politically connected above the interests of  hard-working American families. I believe the American people are going  to stand up and fight against any fear-mongering attack launched by the  so-called deficit hawks who, as they come flying back, are clearly  looking at cutting Medicare, Medicaid, anti-hunger, and anti-poverty  programs.   It is not too late. It is not too late while this process continues  between the House and the Senate to change course. Instead of going to  a sham conference--a sham conference that is little more than  diversionary theater--there could be a real and bipartisan debate on a  tax plan that would give every American a chance to get ahead.   I have been particularly struck by my conversations with our former  colleague Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. He calls almost every few  days because he, along with President Reagan, were the authors of the  last bipartisan plan. I am particularly struck by how he describes when  Democrats and Republicans came together. Bill Bradley, former Knicks  celebrity all over the country, he would fly all over the United States  to meet with colleagues like the distinguished Presiding Officer from  North Carolina. He would fly all over. Now, we can't get Republicans to  walk down the corridor of the Dirksen building to have a conversation  about how we ought to have a chance to give everybody a good tax plan  so everybody in America can get ahead. That is what I sought to do with  Republican colleagues, former Senators Gregg and Coats, who are plenty  conservative.   So it is not too late for my Republican colleagues to do an about- face and say we can do better than this. I don't, for the life of me,  understand why we can't have Republicans and Democrats, on the basis of  the overwhelming unpopularity of this bill, now say we can do better  than this and change course.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor a longtime public  servant and regional director of the northwest region of the Bureau of  Indian Affairs in my State, Mr. Stanley Speaks. Stan has served the  tribes of Oregon and the Pacific Northwest well since 1982. His  distinguished career with the Federal Government spanned more than 59  years and has resulted in highly recognized and extraordinary  accomplishments that stem from his established knowledge, experience,  and management leadership.   Stan graduated from Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, OK,  and later obtained a master's degree in education administration. By  1959, he had begun his long career with the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  He served as the regional director in western Oklahoma and Kansas and  came to the northwest region in 1982. There he served 14 agencies, 3  irrigation projects, and oversaw a trust land base of 6.3 million  acres, covering five Northwest States. Stan also had the fiduciary  trust responsibility to 45 Northwest Tribes with a membership totaling  115,000 Native-American people. As a Tribal member of the Chickasaw  Nation of Oklahoma, Stan was inducted into the Chickasaw National Hall  of Fame in 2002.   Stan has devoted his life's work to the advancement of Tribes and  Indian people. He has worked hard to uphold and protect Tribal treaty  rights, and through his stewardship of trust property and natural  resources, trust income has helped meet the individual and family needs  of Tribal members. He became the regional director at a time when the  Western Oregon Tribes were being restored.   Stan has long been a champion for Tribal veterans. He has supported  housing, the expansion of veterans benefits, and access to healthcare.  He, along with his lovely wife, Lois, are a staple at the annual  veterans dinner sponsored by the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Indians each  July.   He has assisted the federally recognized Tribes in my home State of  Oregon with both advice and financial assistance on a variety of  business and economic development ventures. His efforts have created  hundreds of job opportunities for Indian and non-Indian people in every  Tribal community across Oregon and the Northwest.   Stan has achieved countless victories for Native Americans, which  will have long lasting beneficial impacts for years to come. He has  been critical in maintaining the relationship between the Federal  Government and Indian Tribes. Oregon has benefited from Stanley Speaks'  career management and leadership contributions. His legacies of  achievement for our Tribes will live on to benefit not only this  generation, but for generations yet to come. I thank Stan for his  service to Indian Country and to this Nation.                            ____________________
