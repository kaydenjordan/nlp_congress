Mr. Chairman, as we pointed out yesterday, the SCRUB Act  requires the commission to identify regulations that should be  repealed. The commission focuses on rules and regulations that are out  of date, no longer useful, and otherwise unnecessary or obsolete.   As I stated yesterday, no regulations should be exempt from this  bill. Not all consumer protection regulations are created equal. If the  regulation is important, effective and still relevant, then let it  stand. If the regulation is not effective, no longer valuable and  unnecessary, then why keep it around?   This amendment is just another wrong-headed carve-out that will end  up hurting student loan borrowers more than it could possibly help  them.   And for those reasons, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose  this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, everybody wants to see gainful employment for  our students, our college students especially.   Those institutions that have preyed on these students also are as a  result of a regulatory environment that has allowed that to happen.  That same regulatory environment would be under review, under oversight  by the SCRUB Act. For those reasons particularly, we need to make sure  that we do not have this amendment, but, more importantly, that we do  allow for the underlying bill.   For those reasons, again, I urge opposition to this amendment by my  colleague.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would exclude from the  commission's review regulations under title I, part A of the Elementary  and Secondary Education Act, as amended.   ESEA provides financial assistance to local educational agencies and  schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low- income families to help ensure that all children meet challenging State  academic standards.   No regulation should be exempt from the review process, especially  those regulations that impact low-income students across the country.  It is imperative that we have smart, targeted, cost-effective  regulations that actually help the people that need the help.   Imposing ineffective regulations on schools and educational agencies  cost taxpayers money--this must be given the opportunity for oversight,  as is given under the SCRUB Act--and overburden our already exhausted  educators, and can cause more harm rather than good.   Why not take a look at these regulations and just consider whether  they are working? And, if they are, then let's leave them alone. But if  not, then, let's change them there.   There is no reason why we should create, again, a special carve-out  from the commission's consideration. For those reasons, Mr. Chairman, I  urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, since 1965, when the ESEA was passed, we have  gone from chalkboards to iPads. Things have changed. The regulatory  environment has changed.   May I remind my colleagues that, under the SCRUB Act, the bipartisan  review committee would make these recommendations for changes in the  regulatory scheme to Congress, who would have the final say as to  whether any regulations need to be changed.    Again, for those reasons, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to  oppose this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this bill, again, requires the commission to  identify regulations which should be repealed. The commission focuses  on rules and regulations that are, again, out-of-date, no longer  necessary, no longer useful, or otherwise obsolete.   Regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act need to be examined  and updated just as much as any other regulations. Reviewing and  revisiting regulations promulgated decades ago allows the opportunity  to improve upon existing standards.   According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Environmental  Protection Agency regulations cost the public $353 billion a year.  Given the high costs associated with EPA regulations, excluding these  regulations from this review process just doesn't make any sense. $353  billion--more than one-third of a trillion dollars--needs review.   Importantly, this bill has several significant procedural hurdles to  pass before any regulation would be repealed: the commission must  determine the regulation is no longer necessary; the commission must  recommend repealing the regulation; and, most significantly, Congress  would need to vote to get rid of the regulation. No regulation would be  repealed without a vote by Congress.   This is reinstating the authority that this body has, and for these  foregoing reasons, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment.  [[Page H1412]]    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this bill, when passed, does nothing to  remove any regulation. What it does is exactly what we were elected to  do: provide transparency and oversight over existing regulations to  determine whether they are necessary or not. For those reasons, Mr.  Chairman, I would again urge opposition to this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is the prime example of why we  need the SCRUB Act. ``Federal Management of Programs that Serve  Tribes'' was added to the Government Accountability Office biannual  high-risk report released earlier this month. The GAO reported: ``For  nearly a decade, we, along with inspectors general, special  commissions, and others, have reported that federal agencies have  ineffectively administered Indian education and health care programs  and inefficiently fulfilled their responsibilities for managing the  development of Indian energy resources.''   Look, the GAO found numerous challenges, including poor conditions at  schools, inadequate healthcare oversight, and mismanagement of energy  resources that limit the ability of tribes to create economic benefits  and improve the well-being of their communities.   Clearly, the Federal Government is not getting this right, and we  need to exercise our oversight. We need more attention to this issue,  not less.   Exempting regulations relating to tribal governments is simply wrong.  It keeps in place outdated and ineffective regulations that are  burdening our tribal governments. For these reasons, Mr. Chairman, I  urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the regulations that we are talking about in  the GAO report that are so ineffective, that have been a failure, are  those regulations that have been imposed by unelectable bureaucrats in  the bureaucracy that we are trying to reach back and gain not only  oversight, but transparency as well. The SCRUB Act needs to be there  for that particular purpose, and, for those reasons, this amendment  should be opposed.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, let me begin by saying that my colleague from  Maryland, the ranking member of the full committee, has been and  continues to be probably one of the strongest advocates for  whistleblower protections, and I thank him and laud him for that. But I  must disagree with him in regard to this amendment.   No one regulation is the perfect and ideal regulation that will last  into perpetuity. All regulations need to be reviewed, and that is what  this rule does. The commission focuses on rules and regulations that  are out of date, no longer useful, and are otherwise unnecessary or  obsolete.   Regulations that were promulgated with the original intent of  protecting whistleblowers need updating and consideration as much as  any other regulation does. Reviewing and revisiting regulations  promulgated decades ago creates the opportunity to improve upon  existing standards.   Excluding whistleblower regulations from this exercise means that  whistleblowers would lose out on the chance to streamline regulations  and reduce burdens that might be harming whistleblowers. In fact, this  process could actually help protect whistleblowers in its oversight and  transparency.   Importantly, this bill has several significant procedural hurdles to  pass before any regulation would be repealed. The commission must  determine that the regulation is no longer necessary; the commission  would then recommend repealing the regulation; and, again, most  significantly, Congress would need to vote on the regulation in order  to get rid of it.   Again, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, nothing in the SCRUB Act does anything  to remove any of the protections that already exist for whistleblowers.  This essentially makes it open for review, but, more importantly, as I  agree with my colleague from Maryland, we need to protect the  whistleblowers. And if it be the focus of Congress to do just that,  then we must, irrespective of the SCRUB Act, focus on strengthening  those laws that protect our whistleblowers to make our government run  more transparently, more effectively, and more efficiently.   Again, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for  5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, it is interesting because creatively my friend  from Maryland is trying to do unsuccessfully what they have done all  along unsuccessfully, and that is just create a carve-out of  regulations for review by the SCRUB Act.   Now, what regulation is so perfect it should never be reviewed again?  None. And that is why the SCRUB Act is so important. You see, this bill  went through regular order.   In the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, we went through a  markup, and my friends across the aisle had an opportunity to make  their amendments. We came to the floor. They had an opportunity to make  their amendments. Two were accepted--made it a bipartisan bill.   But, more importantly, let's take the impact of this bill and what it  does to our economy. The Small Business Administration says that  annually each business must pay $20,000 a year in compliance costs  because of our regulatory environment. The Competitive Enterprise  Institute says that that is $15,000 per household.   Members, we were elected to be accountable to those who elected us;  not to allow some unaccountable, unelectable bureaucracy to make rules  and regulations that have filled up 178,000 pages of the Code of  Federal Regulations.   Let us do what we were elected to do, and reach back and take that  authority that we have given to these regulatory agencies. Let us pass  this SCRUB Act so that we will have the opportunity to not only review,  but eliminate those regulations that are no longer necessary,  inefficient, and ineffective.   Members, I ask for you to oppose this motion and vote for the  underlying SCRUB Act and let us regain the authority that the people  have given us.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote
