 Madam President, over the years, I have taken a moment to  recognize the hard work and dedication of my staff as they depart and  advance their professional development. One of the most capable  staffers I have had the honor of working with is Brad Watts, who served  as my chief counsel for more than 4 years.   Brad is truly one of a kind. He is tenacious, tireless, and  objectively brilliant. He has earned a reputation for being someone you  want on your team advocating on your behalf because he will fight for  you tooth and nail and leave nothing on the table. And he has earned a  reputation for being someone you don't want to see on your opposing  team because he is one tough negotiator who can take you to hell and  back.   Brad became my chief counsel shortly before the 116th Congress, which  is when I first became chairman of the Intellectual Property  Subcommittee. I don't think Brad came in knowing much or anything about  intellectual property, which is regarded as one of the most difficult  areas of law for even the most intelligent lawyers to pick up.   Not only did Brad pick it up, he excelled at it. Our subcommittee was  the most active one on the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 116th  Congress as we explored ways to improve and modernize our intellectual  property system.   Perhaps most notably, we held a historic 3-day sprint of hearings  during which we heard from 45 different witnesses about the broken  state of patent eligibility. Only someone as hard-working as Brad could  have made that happen.   Brad was also instrumental in negotiating, writing, and passing some  of the most consequential bipartisan legislation in generations during  the 117th Congress, addressing issues long considered to be ``third  rails'' in American politics.   One example was the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Brad was  masterful throughout the negotiation process as Senators and their  staff worked  [[Page S1439]]  nonstop to forge a compromise. The end result was passing the first law  in more than three decades aimed at reducing violence, expanding access  to mental health services, and improving community safety. And we did  it in a way that protected the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding  Americans.   Later that year, Brad was assigned another important task: making  major modifications to the Respect for Marriage Act and winning enough  votes to pass it through Congress. It is a sensitive issue for both  sides of the political spectrum that required a well-thought-out  approach, and Brad played a key role in reaching that compromise that  included a number of new legal protections for religious institutions  and nonprofits. These new protections struck the right balance, and the  bill earned the bipartisan support it needed to pass both Chambers and  be signed into law.   Neither of those bills would have even gotten a vote had Brad not  been at the negotiating table and burning the midnight oil every single  day.   I take pride in playing an active role in the professional  development of my staff, and it was no surprise that the private sector  also took notice of Brad's personal dedication and policy expertise.  The Chamber of Commerce hired him to serve as their vice president of  innovation policy. It is a testament to the work he put in to quickly  become of the Nation's top policy experts on intellectual property.   While I am sad to see him go, I am also very proud of the work he has  done through his service to the State of North Carolina and the U.S.  Senate. And I am excited to see the great things he will accomplish in  the coming years. To borrow a line from one of Brad's favorites, the  legendary Dolly Parton, ``You'll never do a whole lot unless you're  brave enough to try.''                            ____________________
