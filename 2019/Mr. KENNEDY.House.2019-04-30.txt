 Madam Speaker, I rise today to join Myrtle Baptist  Church, the Newton community, and the entire Commonwealth of  Massachusetts in mourning the loss of Reverend Howard Haywood.   A little over a year ago, I walked into Myrtle Baptist with my  family, and Reverend Haywood welcomed us with a warm embrace that few  could match. It was that physical, emotional embrace that countless  congregants and visitors will never forget.   With eight generations of his family calling Newton home, the  reverend liked to talk about how the city shaped him. If anything, our  city stands kinder, stronger, and more just because of him.   A journeyman bricklayer and construction worker for five decades, he  literally built Massachusetts into what it is today. Yet he still felt  like he had more to offer, so he spent the little free time he found  fighting for affordable housing and civil rights for his fellow  citizens.   To his wife, Katy; his daughter, Kristen; his son, Howard, Jr.; and  the entire Haywood family, please know how grateful we are that you  shared this magnificent man with all of us.                            ____________________
