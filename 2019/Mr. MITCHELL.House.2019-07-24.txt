 Mr. Speaker, America is an amazing place, and we too  [[Page H7250]]  often, as Americans, take that for granted. Opportunities exist in this  country that simply aren't available in much of the world. And my life  is an example of the extraordinary possibilities in the United States  of America.   I ask you, where else can a kid, born in poverty, beginning life in a  subsidized housing project, become a national legislator? Yet, here I  stand as a Member of Congress.   In how many countries can the oldest of seven children with parents  that are an hourly auto worker and an office worker for the Salvation  Army, become the first in their extended family to graduate from  college, build a career, become the CEO of a major workforce  development company and, after retiring, be elected to Congress?   America is a truly unique and special place that we must love and  respect with all our heart and soul.   My mother raised me to believe that those with talents and resources  were expected by God to make a difference in the world. I tried to do  that in my career throughout my life.   My mission for 35 years was to assist people in identifying and  securing career opportunities. My professional career allowed me to  support my family, while assisting adults of all ages and backgrounds  to develop the skills to support their families and build careers.   I assisted individuals ranging from laid-off steel workers and auto  workers, to long-term public assistant recipients, develop the skills  they needed to build a career and support their families.   I worked with individuals requiring literacy education, English as a  second language, and adults that had worked their same job their entire  lives, and suddenly found their jobs and industries had evaporated, and  their lives turned upside down.   I worked, in some way or another, with tens of thousands of people  searching for assistance in securing a job and a career path. I  believed then, and I continue to believe, that most Americans find  value and opportunity in working. Sometimes they just need a hand and  assistance to overcome adversity.   I brought that passion and commitment to Washington. My mission was  to make a difference in the world. I literally approached being a  Member of Congress like my career, full tilt, leaving no stone unturned  to have a meaningful impact and to make a difference.   It is an honor to stand on this floor, debate issues, and represent  the people of Michigan's 10th District. I am proud to be among the  12,500 or so that have had the privilege to serve in Congress.   But I have also begun to ask myself about making a difference in my  family. My children of all ages, the youngest just 9, have accepted  their dad traveling the country, working a demanding schedule,  frequently interrupted by text messages, emails, and phone calls. My  spouse, Sherry, has been so supportive and more patient than probably  warranted.   A career in Washington was never my objective. My mission has always  been to simply address significant challenges this Nation faces: Trade,  healthcare, immigration, and infrastructure, to name just a few.   However, it appears to me that rhetoric overwhelms policy, and  politics consumes much of the oxygen in this city.   The time has come to make a difference for my family, to focus my  time and energy upon them, their needs, their goals.   George Washington is quoted as saying: ``I would rather be on my farm  than emperor of the world.''   As a result, I have decided I will not seek to represent Michigan's  10th Congressional District next term. After serving out the remainder  of the 116th Congress, I will return to my family and to our small  farm.                            ____________________
