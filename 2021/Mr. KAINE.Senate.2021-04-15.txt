 Mr. President, it is painfully clear that existing Federal  policies do not provide a comprehensive approach to address the  national epidemic of gun violence. In fact, in 2019, for the third  consecutive year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  reported gun violence as a leading cause of premature death in the  United States resulting in the loss of 39,707 American lives--that is  109 American lives lost each day. And unfortunately, 2020 was no  different. Even as the Country was enduring an unprecedented global  pandemic, communities across the country were left dealing with the  ever-present threat of gun violence.   There is single legislative action that can eradicate the complex and  deeply rooted issues of gun violence. However, we must undertake the  correct approach by focusing on many issues, including improvements to  our mental health system, better security protocols, and commonsense  rules about gun use and safety, such that keep firearms out of the  hands of dangerous individuals.   Virginians know all too well the heartbreaking consequences of gun  violence. We have seen it in the tragedies of Virginia Tech and  Virginia Beach and the countless drive-by shootings, domestic violence,  and suicides by firearms. Yet the Commonwealth has chosen to  acknowledge and address its unfortunate history of gun violence, and  this past year adopted a series of gun violence prevention measures.  These measures include legislation to enact an Extreme Risk Protective  Order; an expansion of background checks on all gun sales; a mandate to  report lost and stolen firearms; safeguards that prevent children from  accessing firearms; and a reinstatement of Virginia's successful one- handgun-a-month policy. The Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence Act of  2021 builds on the newly adopted Virginia framework by creating a  comprehensive package of policies at the federal level to reduce gun  violence across the nation.   With public support for commonsense rules at the highest it has ever  been, we cannot wait until the next senseless tragedy before enacting  commonsense gun policies. It is important to remember that gun violence  is preventable and requires we take an evidence-based approach to  create a more peaceful society, free of gun violence. I believe that  the ``Virginia Plan'' will pave the way to advance meaningful gun  reform and ultimately save lives.   Now is the time to act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Ms. Hassan):   S. 1161. A bill to promote focused research and innovation in quantum  communications and quantum network infrastructure to bolster internet  security, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation.    Mr. President, throughout his time in office, President  Donald Trump repeatedly disparaged our NATO allies and reportedly  threatened withdrawal from the NATO alliance, the bedrock of European  and American security for over seventy years. Although our current  President has recommitted the United States to NATO and our  transatlantic partnerships, it is still necessary for the Senate to  consider legislation that prevents any President from withdrawing the  United States from this critical defense treaty. This legislation would  not only help address present national security challenges by  reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Europe, it would also provide  clarity to important constitutional questions regarding the role of  Congress in terminating U.S. participation in treaties and alliances.  Particularly with a treaty obligation that is as central to U.S.  security as NATO, no President should be allowed to unilaterally  withdraw without the advice and consent of the Senate.   Over the past several years, NATO allies, many of whom we have fought  alongside since World War II and earlier in some cases, have questioned  our allegiance for the first time in the history of NATO. In response  to the only invocation of Article 5 of the NATO Treaty following the 9/ 11 attacks, more than 1,000 servicemembers from these allied nations  gave their lives fighting alongside the United States. While the United  States must continue to press every country to increase defense  spending to meet the agreed-upon goal of 2 percent of GDP by 2024, and  ensure that our European allies contribute to their own defense, U.S.  withdrawal from NATO should not be considered without Congressional  input. For this reason, we must use our constitutional powers of advice  and consent and of the purse to block any unilateral executive  withdrawal, and preemptively authorize legal proceedings to challenge  any decision to terminate U.S. membership.   The legislation I am introducing today with Senators Rubio, Collins,  Blumenthal, Coons, Duckworth, Durbin, Feinstein, Graham, King,  Klobuchar, Merkley, Moran, Shaheen, and Warner would provide the  necessary tools to prevent a President from unilaterally withdrawing  the United States from the NATO treaty without the consent of Congress.  The Senate has repeatedly indicated its support for NATO through  previous legislation, including the original vote of 82-13 in 1949 to  grant the Senate's consent to join NATO, and the Fiscal Year 2020  National Defense Authorization Act, which called for the United States  to ``remain ironclad in its commitment to uphold its obligations under  the North Atlantic Treaty.''   I am proud to have bipartisan support for this bill to ensure that  the safety of the American people is prioritized through our continued  membership in NATO, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to  ensure that this legislation is swiftly considered by the Senate.   Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is painfully clear that existing Federal  policies do not provide a comprehensive approach to address the  national epidemic of gun violence.
