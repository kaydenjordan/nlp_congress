 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Saturday morning, I was in Alton, IL. This  picture here is what we saw. You have to look closely to understand  what I am looking at here. These grain elevators are in downtown Alton,  IL, and this is the Mississippi River, which has now risen to the point  that it is just below this red line. I know this red line a little bit  because it marks the 1993 flood level of the same Mississippi River, so  we are almost there. We were hoping over the weekend that the river  would crest and that Alton and so many other communities in the Midwest  would be spared further flooding.   The interesting thing is, when I went down there to talk to the  people engaged in the recovery effort and trying to help fight these  floodwaters, there was an insight I was really surprised to hear. I  asked them what is different about this flood, because we get lots of  floods in the Midwest. The difference with this flood, according to  those who have done the research, is this is a flood of longer duration  than any flood we have seen since 1927.   When I spoke to the mayor of the town of Alton, IL, I said: So this  comes and goes? He said: It never goes, Senator. We have had six floods  in the last 10 years that were supposed to be breaking historic  records.   So let's step back for a minute and take an honest look at this, if  we can, and realize that we are living in a little different world this  year than we did just a few years ago. The extreme weather events,  which we hear reported every single day, suggest that something is  going on beyond just changes in the weather. When we see rainfall and  snowfall in the upper Midwest, which is now responsible for this  flooding situation here, we have to ask ourselves the obvious question:  Is this just a one-off event, or are we seeing the new normal? And if  this is the new normal, are we prepared for it?   When these floodwaters hopefully recede in the very near future,  there will be a lot of repair work to be done. There is a lot of damage  to homes, businesses, and families. But then there will be a big  question: What do we do next? If this is the new normal in our weather  patterns, if we are in fact seeing a change in our climate around  [[Page S3308]]  the United States and around the world, how will we respond? My first  concern, of course, is my home State of Illinois and the folks who are  kind enough to let me serve them in the U.S. Senate.   I want to do everything I can to work with the Army Corps of  Engineers, which is a critical part of flood protection for the  Midwest. These earthen levees you will see along the shorelines of the  Mississippi and Illinois Rivers have been sorely taxed by these  floodwaters. When they are drenched and soaked over long periods of  time, they tend to weaken. We count on the Army Corps of Engineers and  the good people locally to step forward and help us fortify these  levees. We need to continue to do that, maybe even more so because of  the frequency of the floods we are seeing in the Midwest.   But we have a responsibility here in Washington too. What are we  doing about the climate change that is happening around the world? What  are we doing to make sure our kids and grandkids will inherit an Earth  that is habitable and that won't face these kinds of awful occurrences  on a regular basis? Are we willing to make sacrifices and changes in  the comfort of our own lives just a little bit so that our kids and  grandkids have a world that they can live in, a world that is  habitable, that they can pass on to the next generation? I don't think  that is too much to ask.   There was an agreement reached a few years ago in Paris. Every nation  in the world signed up to do something. Every single nation in the  world signed up to do something to reach a common goal of stopping the  warming of this planet and everything that has followed. Then what  happened with the election of this President? President Trump stepped  forward and said: Count us out. The United States is not in the Paris  Agreement any longer. We are the only nation in the world to step away  from that agreement. The rest of the world understands the gravity of  this challenge. Today, it is the floods in the Midwest. Tomorrow, it  will be that tornado in Oklahoma. The list goes on and on and on.   I stand ready to work with everyone I can locally to deal with this,  but I also plead with this administration--open your eyes to the  reality of climate change in the world and what it is doing to the  extreme weather patterns we currently face.   Our Governor, J. B. Pritzker, has declared a disaster in 34 of  Illinois's 102 counties--about a third of the State. Four hundred  Illinois National Guard men and women members are working sometimes  around the clock to do their part, and my hat is off to them and their  families for their extraordinary sacrifice.   The levees, like the Nutwood Levee, which isn't far from Alton, IL,  were breached by floodwaters, and over the past week, a small town was  evacuated. State and local officials have urged everyone there to be  careful and make certain that they do everything they can to protect  themselves and their property.   When you take a look at this picture taken in Alton, IL, you don't  see the real story. There are a few people, families who are looking at  floodwaters, but the real story is the coordinated effort, which is  heartwarming. It is not just the Federal agencies, like the Corps of  Engineers and the Coast Guard; it is not just the State agencies, like  the Illinois Emergency Management Agency; it is the local units of  government, like the city of Alton and so many other cities, that have  come together to coordinate their efforts and to make the best of what  they have.   It is also an effort by a lot of charitable organizations. As you  might expect, the Red Cross was on the scene almost immediately, and we  also know the Salvation Army has been involved as well. They are all  doing their part to make sure we work together.   But the one group that should be recognized--they may not have a  formal title--are the men and women, the families and community leaders  who stepped up and rolled up their sleeves to fill the sandbags to help  their neighbors. It is not just a midwestern thing, but it is a  midwestern thing, as far as I am concerned. Our people and our families  across my State time and again step up to lend a helping hand to one  another. In this time of need with this kind of flooding damage in  Alton and all across our State, it does my heart proud to see that  these folks have once again responded to this call.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  is necessarily absent.

Madam President, on a Spring day in April 1891 in  Lombard, IL, Ellen Martin, an attorney, and 14 other women marched to  their voting place at the local general store to do something most of  us take for granted today. They demanded to be allowed to vote. The  town charter enfranchised all citizens and did not mention sex.   Stunned polling judges were forced to allow Ellen Martin and the 14  to vote. One account had a judge so flabbergasted that he fell into a  flour barrel.   But this momentary right to vote was short-lived. The Lombard town  council quickly changed the charter to, once again, allow only men to  vote, but the spark had been struck. Four months later, the Illinois  State charter was changed to allow women to vote in local school  elections.   It took 28 years after that day in April for American women to  achieve the right to vote. On this 100th anniversary of the passage of  the 19th Amendment, we honor Ellen Martin and the countless other  supporters of women's suffrage.   Sadly, Ellen Martin died in 1916. She did not live to see the 19th  Amendment pass.   The women of my home State of Illinois won limited voting rights in  1913 through the legendary work of Grace Wilbur Trout, Jane Addams,  Frances Willard, and countless others. Women had the right to vote only  for Presidential electors and most local offices, but not for Governor,  State representatives, or Members of Congress.   In Chicago, icon Ida B. Wells-Barnett founded the Alpha Suffrage Club  in 1913 to educate African-American women about the right to vote.  Their power at the polls helped elect Chicago's first Black alderman,  Oscar DePriest, in 1914.   Women continued to organize across the country as many States granted  suffrage. Both parties' Presidential candidates endorsed women's  suffrage in 1916, and Montana elected Jeannette Rankin to the House of  Representatives. There were still many fights ahead, but slowly, the  country came around to women's suffrage.   Five years after Illinois gave women the right to vote in some  elections, Congress passed the 19th Amendment giving women the right in  all elections. This was the same amendment Susan B. Anthony brought to  Congress in 1878. More than 70 years after the Seneca Falls Convention,  the suffragettes had persevered and succeeded.   I am proud to say Illinois was the first State to ratify the 19th  Amendment, but the work is unfinished.   This Congress has the most women in its ranks in the history of the  body. The first woman Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi returned to her  leadership post with 102 women as her colleagues in the House of  Representatives, including Representatives Cheri Bustos, Robin Kelly,  Jan Schakowsky, and Lauren Underwood of my home State. I am privileged  to work with 25 powerful women Senators, one of whom was the first  Senator, Tammy Duckworth, to ever give birth while in office.   The force of history is demanding we do more to make this a fairer  and equal country. We have more women in office than ever, and women  are 51 percent of the electorate, but less than a third of elected  legislative bodies are women. President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay  Act in 1963; yet the pay gap between men and women is just as real  today as it was then. Women are still earning 78 cents for every dollar  earned by men. For women of color, the gap is even greater with  African-American women making 64 cents, while Hispanic women make only  56 cents.   State after State are imposing draconian laws on reproductive rights.  Roe v. Wade has never been in more danger. We have the duty and  privilege of honoring the sacrifice of those who marched for women's  suffrage by ensuring their heirs have the right to choose.   As we honor the passage of the 19th Amendment, let's not forget that  we  [[Page S3315]]  are still waiting to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. In 2023, it will  be one century since the first version of the Equal Rights Amendment  was introduced. Women have waited long enough for its ratification. Our  generation must get it done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
