 Mr. Speaker, I am glad you are up there, but I am  disappointed that the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper), my friend,  has left. He is the dean of the Tennessee delegation, and he has been a  good friend to me since I came to Congress. I would see him every  morning. I think it was kind of a parallel to our lives. He was always  going to do yoga, and I was going to get beat up in boot camp working  out in the morning, but he was always very kind to me, and I believe  there is always a place in Congress for people like   Jim Cooper.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Coach Brian Nix and the  Alcoa High School football team on their eighth consecutive Tennessee  State championship title.   Alcoa defeated East Nashville in a 45-26 win to bring home another  AAA State championship. This win marks the Tornadoes' 21st State  championship, and for Brian Nix it is the first one serving as their  head coach. I am overwhelmingly proud of this team and its resilience.   Mr. Speaker, the Alcoa Tornadoes finished out the season with an  impressive 14-1 record and brought home their eighth consecutive State  title, which is quite an achievement.   The seniors on this team will remember this season for the rest of  their lives, and it is truly a special thing for these younger guys to  be able to come back next year and try for another ring.   Alcoa is well-staffed with coaches Alex Taylor, Ben Love, Brian  Gossett, Chris Collett, Dakota Summers, David Sweetland, Jonathan  Harris, and Peyton Jones.   Congratulations to all the Tornadoes on your big win. You absolutely  have earned it.           Congratulating Knoxville West High School Football Team     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Coach Lamar  Brown and the Knoxville West High School football team on their  undefeated season in the Second Tennessee Class 5A State championship.   Knoxville West earned their ring at Finley Stadium in Chattanooga  with an outstanding 47-13 win over Paige High School. After the big  win, the Tennessee Titans named head coach Lamar Brown as 2022 High  School Coach of the Year.   It is truly special watching a team have this amount of respect and  trust in their coaching staff and vice versa. It is more than just a  game, Mr. Speaker. Head Coach Lamar Brown and the rest of his coaching  staff did a tremendous job in coaching these young men throughout the  season. I happened to see many of their games. One of my dearest  friends, Todd Scott's boy plays for this team and former mayor Madeline  Rogero's grandson was on the team.   Congratulations to all the Rebels on your State title. You earned it  and made the city of Knoxville proud along the way.                            ____________________
