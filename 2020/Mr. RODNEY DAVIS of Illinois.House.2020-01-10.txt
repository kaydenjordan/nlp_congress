 Mr. Speaker, in honor of Law  Enforcement Appreciation Day, I rise today to recognize the officers of  the United States Capitol Police force for their heroic actions to save  lives as part of their highly trained and committed service to this  congressional community throughout 2019.   When they heard the radio call about an unresponsive individual in a  car, two officers responded and ultimately saved the life of a man who  had suffered a heart attack.   Officers administered tactical combat casualty care to the victim of  a shooting and helped get that person to a hospital.   Three officers saved the life of a man who, shockingly, had a heart  attack during his visit to this Capitol Building.   These are only a few occasions in an impressive list of heroic  actions. We owe our gratitude to all of the officers of the United  States Capitol Police force for the hard work they do here.   I thank all of the police force for going the extra mile; not only  protecting and defending us here in the congressional community, but  for all they do in all of our communities.                            ____________________
