 Mr. President, today, I stand here with colleagues--my  partner, Senator Peters, and, of course, Senator Reed and other  colleagues--to pay tribute to an incredible leader and my dear friend  who dedicated his life to serving the people of his beloved State of  Michigan and this Nation--Senator Carl Levin.   Senator Carl Levin was many things: a crusader for truth and justice,  in the real sense of the word; a man of strong convictions; a mentor to  so many of us.   He was a Senator's Senator and a tireless advocate every day--every  day--for the people of Michigan.   He was also my friend, and it was truly an honor of a lifetime for me  to represent Michigan alongside Carl Levin for 14 years of his 36 years  that he served in the Senate.   Thirty-six years is a long time, but Senator Levin remained effective  and at the same time humble right up until the final day he served.  That is because integrity never goes out of style and Senator Carl  Levin never wavered in his dedication to do what was right--what was  right for the people of Michigan and our country.   Perhaps he will be remembered most--although there are so many  things--for his incredible leadership on the Armed Services Committee.  Patriotism was a lot more than a flag pin or a pledge to Carl Levin. He  understood more than anybody what it takes to defend our Nation.  Perhaps no one has done more to ensure that our men and women in  uniform are battle ready with the supplies and technology that they  need and the fair pay and benefits they have earned.   In fact, Senator Levin worked so hard on behalf of our military that  he received a Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public  Service. There is a suite of offices at the Pentagon named after him,  and there is a naval destroyer currently being built in Maine that will  probably bear his name: the USS Carl M. Levin. It was so inspiring to  be with him during the naming ceremony in Detroit back in 2016.   It is fitting that he should be honored in this way because Carl  Levin always believed that our government could be a force for good.  This belief was passed down to him from his parents, who saw firsthand  how the New Deal rescued families from desperate poverty.   A young Carl Levin admired Harry S. Truman, especially Senator  Truman, who drove cross-country investigating defense contractors who  were committing fraud and wasting billions of dollars. I think Truman  himself would have been incredibly impressed with Carl's leadership of  the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.   A former civil rights attorney, Carl Levin relished the chance to  cross-examine those he suspected of ripping off taxpayers and the  public. His committee room was never a literal trial by fire, but he  certainly turned up the heat on unscrupulous executives, special  interests, or anybody who tried to get rich at the expense of everyday  Americans. Those executives were sweating because they knew that  Senator Levin had done his homework. He would dig so deep that he knew  more about what they were going to say than they would.   Carl Levin could topple a tycoon with nothing more than a stack of  subpoenaed documents. And we saw him do it. In 2007, he shined a light  on abusive practices by credit card companies, leading to laws that  required more transparency. Even today, your credit card statement  contains more disclosures and more information, thanks to Senator Carl  Levin.   His fellow Michiganders got to see a kinder, gentler side of Carl as  well, and I know we did as colleagues. And I will never forget how his  eyes sparkled when he smiled, with his glasses down on the end of his  nose.   His heart was always in Detroit, where he was born and raised and  lived his entire life. Meanwhile, his soul was nourished by the  tranquility he found in beautiful northern Michigan in the Upper  Peninsula, especially Isle Royale.   Carl helped Detroit make one of the most spectacular comebacks in  American history, and everywhere you look, you can see evidence of his  hard work. The Levin Center at Wayne State Law teaches future attorneys  and business leaders and lawmakers and public servants how legislative  oversight can be a tool for change and a force for good. He led the way  on getting Federal funding for Detroit's beautiful International  RiverWalk, which, today, features 3 miles of parks, nature areas, and  breathtaking waterfront views.   In the midst of the Great Recession, we worked together closely to  rescue our American auto industry, which for years had been battered by  the forces of globalization. Carl Levin understood that manufacturing  is the backbone of our State's economy and that our country needs to  make things in order to have them.   As a member of the Small Business Committee, Carl also understood the  importance of small business. In fact, in getting dressed today, I was  looking at what I could wear that would symbolize Detroit, and I picked  out a necklace that reminds me of what motivated Carl in Detroit with  small businesses.   Amy Peterson is a Detroit entrepreneur who wanted to empower women  who have employment barriers, and Senator Peters and I have both  visited her shop. So, in 2013, she created Rebel Nell jewelry out of  graffiti that had fallen off of walls on the sides of buildings. Today,  she is incredibly successful, and she is empowering and employing women  throughout the Detroit area.   Carl loved efforts like that. He championed small businesses, folks  who wanted to--one after the other, have an idea and get it going.   Carl also understood that our landscape, our soil, our water are part  of our Michigan way of life. That is why he pushed for years to have  land at Sleeping Bear Dunes protected as wilderness--our beautiful  dunes.   Senator Levin fought for the National Marine Sanctuary at Thunder Bay  in Alpena and for the creation of the Keweenaw National Historic Park.  It was an honor partnering with him in every single fight to protect  our Great Lakes.   I can stand here for hours listing Senator Carl Levin's  accomplishments, but they still only are a small testament to his  character, his compassion, his humor, his strength of conviction.   President Truman once said:         Make no little plans. [Make no little plans.] Make the       biggest one you can think of and spend the rest of your life       carrying it out.    Senator Carl Levin lived those words every day. He wanted to make our  State and our country the best it can be, and he spent his life doing  everything he could to make that happen.   I wish his beloved wife and life partner Barbara; his brother and  best friend Sandy; his nephew and our colleague   Andy Levin; his  wonderful daughters Kate, Laura, and Erica; his grandchildren; and all  of the family my deepest condolences and profound gratitude for your  willingness to share this great man with all of us   I yield the floor.
