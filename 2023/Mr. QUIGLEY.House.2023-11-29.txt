 Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to remember history.   Over 80 years ago, the Greatest Generation fought the Second World  War to keep tyrants from taking over the free world. They fought for  freedom and democracy.   Today, we must honor their sacrifice by continuing to fight for the  same principles.   Today's fight in Ukraine is for those principles--for the right of  Ukraine and any other democratic nation and their people to exist. By  aiding Ukraine, we are ensuring their continued existence.   Without that aid, Putin could have and probably would have wiped  Ukraine off the face of the Earth, leaving it in a battle of  insurgency.   Our aid has always been critical to the survival of nations far away.  During the Second World War, President Franklin D. Roosevelt coined the  phrase, ``arsenal of democracy'' to describe the U.S.'s role to  providing weapons to democracies fighting to defend themselves.   Roosevelt argued that this assistance would enable our allies ``to  fight for their liberty and for our security.'' That is still true  today.   Our continued aid is about preserving the liberty of vulnerable  nations, but it is also about our national security.   In FDR's fourth inaugural address, he said, ``We have learned that we  cannot live alone, at peace; that our own well-being is dependent on  the well-being of other nations far away.''   Those who argue that this is not our fight fail to remember this  critical idea. They fail to remember that Ukraine's fight is for the  same reasons we formed NATO and the United Nations.   Ukraine's fight is ours, for if Putin is not defeated, he would not  stop at Ukraine. His greater aim is to reconstitute the former Soviet  Union, imperiling freedom and democracy in the region and enveloping  them in tyranny.   Putin's intention was to form a federation with Belarus and Ukraine,  where he would have installed a puppet government, to overtake Moldova,  the Baltics, and beyond. It would mean even more of the same  devastation we have seen for well over a year.   When I traveled to Ukraine in July 2022, I saw the flattened  maternity hospital and mass graves that Putin's forces left in their  wake. If not for our assistance, Putin's reign of terror would be  happening on a much larger scale.   Following the Second World War, we vowed never again. Now our word is  being tested. We must make good on that promise.   Our commitment is to that promise and our resolve is on display for  the rest of the world. We must show leaders in Tehran and Beijing and  elsewhere that we will not cower in the face of tyranny. That is why we  must fund Ukraine's defense.   Now some would continue to present a false choice that we must fund  Ukraine or Israel, but not both. They are wrong. We do not have to  choose. In the words of NATO General Secretary Stoltenberg, ``We have  the capability, the strength to address different challenges at the  same time. We don't have the luxury of choosing only one threat and one  challenge.''   The conflict in Israel and the conflict in Ukraine are tied together  by Vladimir Putin. Just as Iran is supporting Hamas' attack on Israel,  Iran is also assisting Putin in his assault on Ukraine. We can help  Israel defend itself from terrorism while also helping Ukraine defend  itself from an evil autocrat.   President John F. Kennedy said, ``We shall pay any price, bear any  burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure  the survival and the success of liberty.''   Right now that price is the request that President Biden has made,  enough to aid Ukraine for the next year of fighting.   It is a small price to pay for our national security and global  security. Failing to do so will show Putin and the rest of the world  our current level of dysfunction and our inability to govern. Our  inability to govern is a national security threat and an international  security threat.  [[Page H5940]]    We are at a critical point in our history, not dissimilar to the  years leading up to the Second World War. We and our allies built a  liberal world order after that war. Now we must protect it.   As Churchill said, ``Now is not the end. It is not even the beginning  of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.''   The choices we make now will influence the fate of the free world for  generations to come. Let's make the right ones.                            ____________________
