 Madam President, first, let me thank my friend from  Missouri for what he and Senator Stabenow are trying to do on mental  health. I know some States were included and other States were not, so  I support that aspect of what he was talking about.                                 2020 Census    Madam President, later today, President Trump will give a news  conference in the Rose Garden about his attempts to create an Executive  order to add citizenship questions to the 2020 census. That is  outrageous. It is outrageous substantively, and it is outrageous  because this President has so little respect for the rule of law. He  thinks he can just issue Executive orders and go around the Congress,  go around established law, and try to bully the courts. I believe he  will be thwarted by the courts, and this will be a real test of John  Roberts and the Supreme Court, whether they stand for the rule of law  or are always looking for an excuse to move the country rightward. We  will see.   Today, the Trump administration has provided no legitimate legal  rationale for adding this question to the census. Just yesterday, the  New York Times reported that Justice Department lawyers ``resigned from  the lawsuit out of ethical concerns and a belief that the suit was  unwinnable.''   Well, we all know what is going on. The Trump administration doesn't  have a legitimate legal rationale. The true motivation was even clear  before the papers of that deceased designer of this question came to  light. The true rationale is blatantly political and self-serving.  President Trump wants to include the citizenship question to intimidate  minorities--particularly Latinos--from answering the census so that it  undercuts those communities and Republicans can redraw congressional  districts to their advantage.   The Census Bureau itself determined weeks ago that including such a  question would result in a significant undercount. That alone is enough  for disqualification. That is not what the Constitution says-- manipulate the census so you don't get an accurate count. The President  knows this. Yet he continues to pursue a cynical idea--typical of the  President--cynical and against minorities, with no respect for the rule  of law, mores, and values that made this country great. Day by day, he  destroys them. Day by day.   The President's action is nothing more than a naked political power  grab, which is one of the few things he is good at as President. It  shows once again just how little respect the President has for our  democracy. It is also one prong in the Trump administration's  multifaceted attack on communities of color. They are doing another one  today in addition to this, which I will speak about in a minute.   Let's not forget that the census is a constitutional mandate. It has  been conducted impartially by Democratic and Republican administrations  alike since 1790. It should be beyond the reach of partisan politics.  But this President has such disdain for constitutional law norms and  the rule of law that he will try anything to set the rules to his  advantage, even if it means circumventing Congress and circumventing  the courts. This is what dictators do in banana republics. They try to  change the rules to consolidate political power no matter what their  constitutions and rule of law say. The President is moving us in that  direction, and our Republican colleagues are supine. They say nothing.  Many of them know what he is doing is wrong, and knees clatter because  they are too afraid to tell the President he is wrong.   The American people should be outraged about this. Republican  Senators should be outraged about this, but, like so many other  instances in which the President subverts our Democratic norms, the  silence from Republicans in Congress has been deafening and degrading  to the very fabric of this wonderful democracy that the President day  by day tries--usually unsuccessfully, thank God--to undo.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from Illinois  (Mr. Durbin), the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator  from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr.  Heinrich), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from  Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.
