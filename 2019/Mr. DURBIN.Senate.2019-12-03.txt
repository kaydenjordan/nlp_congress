 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a few years ago, a woman who works in my  office in Chicago--who actually cleans up the office in the evenings-- was so excited when she learned that her daughter had been accepted to  college. It was a dream come true for a woman who had immigrated to the  United States, taken some of the hardest, most menial manual jobs in  the hopes that her daughter, one day, would have a better life.   She sat down with my chief of staff in Chicago to tell her about the  details, and immediately, we knew there was much more to the story. Her  daughter had been accepted not just to another  [[Page S6798]]  college or university; she had been accepted to a for-profit college in  the Chicagoland area. The for-profit colleges and universities are  notorious. The numbers tell the story, two separate numbers: 9 percent  of all postsecondary students go attend for-profit colleges and  universities--University of Phoenix, DeVry, very well-known names--9  percent of students go to those schools, but 33 percent of all of the  federal student loan defaults are students from for-profit colleges and  universities.   Why? Why is this one category of higher education so notorious for  students starting and ending up deeply in debt to the point where they  cannot pay it back? Well, the reasons are simple and very obvious. They  overcharge the students, and they undereducate them. They make promises  that are wild and cannot be kept. They give them courses of doubtful  value and do not tell them that any credits that they have earned at  these for-profit schools cannot be transferred to city colleges,  community colleges, or universities.   So the students are stuck. At some point, some will quit piling on  the debt and just basically walk away. All the promises and all the  jobs and careers that were supposed to come from this are never going  to materialize. It is a classic fraud, and sadly, our government is  part of that fraud. You see, we recognize the accreditation of those  schools. We tell that cleaning lady and her family that these are good  schools and universities. The Federal Government does that and offers  Federal loans to these students to go to these schools.   Is it any wonder that the students and their families think they are  doing the right thing for their future? The Federal Government gave a  stamp of approval. Well, what happens when those schools reach the end  of the line? What happens when those same for-profit colleges and  universities go bankrupt? The students are in a terrible position,  deeply in debt with courses that are meaningless, with their lives  compromised, and nowhere to turn.   We decided long ago to create an opportunity for these students to  get out of this dilemma--one that we share in by accrediting these  schools--something called the ``borrower defense,'' which allows these  students, if they were defrauded, to discharge their federal student  loans and get on with their lives.   Today, hundreds of thousands of students--who were defrauded by their  for-profit colleges--are desperately waiting for Secretary of Education  Betsy DeVos to discharge their Federal student loans under a provision  in Federal law known as borrower defense. Congress created the borrower  defense provision to ensure students' lives are not ruined by their  schools' misconduct and deception.   In 2014, for-profit Corinthian Colleges collapsed. It left more than  70,000 students nationwide with worthless credits they could not  transfer and mounds of student debt. The students had been lured into  those Corinthian schools with false promises, inflated placement rates  and income projections. We know that for a fact. We have the data to  show they were lying to the students about what graduation from  Corinthian could mean in their lives.   Over the last 5 or 6 years, nearly every other major for-profit  college, nearly every one of these have faced Federal or State lawsuits  and investigations for predatory practices similar to Corinthian  Colleges. The result has been hundreds of thousands of defrauded  students across America who are seeking discharges to which we say they  are entitled under Federal law.   Secretary Betsy DeVos has allowed more than 200,000 borrower defense  applications to pile up at the Department, nearly 11,000 from my own  State of Illinois. But listen to this, Secretary DeVos has not approved  a single claim for more than a year, 200,000 applications stacking up  at the Department of Education, not one approved.   So who are some of these borrowers that are languishing? What is  their story? Let me tell you about two of them.   One is Jessica from Tucson, AZ. Jessica attended the Art Institute of  Tucson from 2009 to 2012. It was owned by the failed for-profit  Education Management Corporation, EDMC. Heartbreakingly, Jessica says:  ``I have experienced unbelievable amounts of stress and depression due  to this situation. I have been placed on anti-depressants and anti- anxiety medication over the years and been through therapy . . . I have  self-harmed and contemplated suicide, because I feel so trapped and  unable to recover or move forward. I have a general feeling of  worthlessness, because I feel like my potential has been squandered.''   She went to the Art Institute of Tucson, and her experience has led  her to this desperate situation. She tried to harm herself. Instead of  a bright future, she is left with a mountain of debt and nothing to  show for it but deep financial and psychological pain. She says,  ``Every aspect of her life has been affected.''   And so, is Secretary Betsy DeVos trying to help Jessica? No.  Secretary DeVos is making it worse. Jessica submitted her borrower  defense application almost 4 years ago in 2016. She has waited for this  period of time to hear anything from the Department of Education. What  is their excuse? I mean, if someone writes a letter to my office and  does not get a reply and they come back to me and say, Are you going to  answer this, Durbin, we send a reply. We try to do it promptly with  everybody.   How can Secretary DeVos be holding these things up for years, while  the students see the mountain of debt growing? As she waits, Jessica's  loans are in forbearance, where they continue to gather interest,  meaning that the total amount owed continues to grow. She is just 1 of  4,518 borrowers from Arizona who are stuck waiting for Secretary DeVos  to use the authority that Congress gave her to discharge fraudulent  loans   I also want to tell you about Jonathan from Colorado--3,600 defrauded  borrowers are waiting for relief. Jonathan from Westminster, CO,  attended DeVry University--sadly a Chicago-based for-profit school-- studying to be an electronics engineer.   He is a father and a husband who was trying to provide more for his  family, so he took out student loans that sounded like an investment.  He currently owes almost $100,000 in outstanding Federal student loans  from attending DeVry, twice what he was told his education would cost.   Of his debt, Jonathan says, ``My credit has been destroyed. I  couldn't repay these loans in two lifetimes, even if my degree had any  value to employers.'' Sadly, it doesn't. Employers don't even recognize  his degree.    Jonathan says:         My student loans are the millstone around my family. The       debt I owe has made my kids not want to attend college at       all. They see no value in it; their own father has an       engineering degree but he can't get hired anywhere because       his school was a scam.    Those are the words of Jonathan from Colorado.   So not only has this fraudulent school taken away his future by  burdening him with a worthless degree and piles of debt; in many ways,  it affects his children's future.   Jonathan applied for a borrower defense discharge in 2017, nearly 3  years ago. He has been waiting to hear from Secretary Betsy DeVos.  Secretary DeVos's failure to provide him with relief, he says, ``has  caused [him] to lose faith that the government will actually protect  students like [him].''   Secretary DeVos has cruelly ignored defrauded borrowers like Jessica  and Jonathan, but what is more is that she is trying to make it almost  impossible for future borrowers like them to secure the relief that  Congress intended by rewriting the rules.   In August, Secretary DeVos released a new version of the borrower  defense rule that places unreasonable burdens on borrowers to attain  relief. The result is that the Department estimates the DeVos rule will  deny nearly $11 billion in relief to borrowers compared to the current  rule.   In September, I introduced a resolution in the Senate to overturn the  DeVos borrower defense rule. Forty-two of my colleagues have joined me  in cosponsoring it. I plan to bring the resolution to a vote on the  Senate floor where it only needs a simple majority to pass. At that  time, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will have a choice: Will  they stand with Secretary DeVos's actions--or, I should say, lack of  actions for 3 or 4 years--will they deny help to defrauded students, or  will  [[Page S6799]]  they stand with young people like Jessica and Jonathan, trying to get  their lives back together and trying to get Congress to implement the  one law it passed that could help them? It is a choice that seems  pretty easy for most American people when they hear this scenario  described to them.   A recent opinion piece in the Anchorage Daily News criticized  Secretary DeVos for siding with ``for-profit colleges that have  defrauded students'' and ``illegally [denying] student loan debt relief  to thousands of students.'' Even in Alaska, hundreds of borrowers are  waiting for borrower defense discharges.   Nationally, Americans agree that these defrauded borrowers deserve  relief. In a 2016 New America poll, 78 percent of Americans said that  students should have their Federal student loan debt discharged if  their school deceived them. That is pretty basic, isn't it? If you were  cheated, you ought to be taken care of.   When you break the numbers down by party, 87 percent of Democrats and  71 percent of Republicans--vast majorities--supported relief for these  students. So when it comes time to vote on my resolution to overturn  the DeVos borrower defense rule denying relief to defrauded borrowers,  I hope my colleagues will stand with students and the American people.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from New York  (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the  Senator  [[Page S6800]]  from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders),  the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren), and the Senator from Rhode  Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator from  California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from Massachusetts  (Ms. Warren), and the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are  necessarily absent.    Madam President, I am honored to stand and join tributes  to Johnny Isakson. A lawyer from Springfield once gave a pretty famous  speech, and it was only 275 words long. This speech may be a little  longer, but I don't believe a speech has to be eternal to be immortal.  So I will try, in just a few words, to say what I feel in my heart this  moment as you are preparing to leave the U.S. Senate.   Your heart is good, and I know that because I saw something on the  floor of the Senate today. Your relationship and your comments about  your friend   John Lewis were so genuine and so heartfelt, and the fact  that you would point to a photograph taken of the two of you embracing  one another as one of the signature photographs of your career in  public service tells me a lot about you, Johnny Isakson.   Our lives have been led along the same path. We know how many changes  there have been in America during the course of our lives and how many  more we need to be even better in the future.   John Lewis was one of  the real leaders in our Nation who led us all to look very closely at  the issue of race and the issue of civil rights. It was painful, many  times unpopular. For his heroic work, he was given the Presidential  Medal of Freedom, and he deserved it more than anyone I can think of.  The fact that he counts you as a friend and comes over here for your  farewell address and that you would embrace him and announce that to  the United States and the world, tells me your heart is good, Johnny  Isakson. That simple experience tells me that.   The other thing I know is that your word is good. It was 2 years ago  when we had a debate on the floor of the Senate about a measure that  means quite a bit to me, the Dream Act--the idea that young immigrants  brought to this country would have a chance to become part of America's  future. I worked on that legislation for 19 years, so I remember when  people voted with me on the Dream Act, and you voted with me. It wasn't  easy 2 years ago. Immigration was not a popular thing, but you stood  up, and when I went to you afterward and thanked you, you said it was  the right thing to do. I will never forget that. It told me that your  word is good, and your heart is good.   And, finally, let me tell you, you have struggled with affliction,  illness, and you have done most of it very openly so that people with  similar challenges in life can watch as you live through this  challenging experience.   All of us can remember moments here when you were willing yourself to  come to this floor, to that chair, to cast your vote. I have never seen  courage like that. Your determination will stick with me forever.   Now you are going to have some time for yourself with your family,  Dianne, and others and have some relaxing time together, but I am going  to miss you. I am going to miss you as a special colleague whose heart  was right, whose word is good, and his courage was there for all of us  to see.   Thanks, Johnny. I wish you the best.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Minnesota  (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the  Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.

Madam President, nearly one-quarter of Illinois'  workforce will see the benefit of a $15 an our minimum wage by 2025.  Also, the State of Illinois is about to embark on a massive $45 billion  infrastructure modernization and construction plan. Simply put, these  are life-changing achievements. And behind both is Michael Carrigan.   Since 2010, Mike Carrigan has served as the president of the Illinois  AFL-CIO, fighting for working families across the State. At the end of  the year, Mike is retiring from his decades' long service to Illinois'  labor unions and its nearly 900,000 members.   In the fall of 2011, Mike was my guest for then-President Obama's  joint session of Congress focusing on the economy. Mike had been an  authority on creating jobs and putting people back to work for years so  the invitation made perfect sense. And Mike was there to applaud a  President he had worked hard to elect.   Michael Carrigan was born in Kankakee, IL, and grew up in Kankakee  County. After graduating from MacMurray College in Jacksonville and  completing a 4-year apprenticeship in Decatur, he became a journeyman  electrician. Mike installed wiring at construction sites for everything  from nuclear powerplants to fast-food restaurants. Later, he became the  business manager and financial secretary for the International  Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 146 in Decatur.   In 1995, Mike ran for the city council in Decatur and won. Four years  later, Margaret Blackshere chose Mike to be her running mate in an  historic bid for the leadership of the Illinois AFL-CIO. Margaret was  the first woman to serve as president of the labor organization, and  they were the right people for the jobs at the right time. Under the  leadership of Margaret and Mike, the AFL-CIO led the fight to raise the  State's minimum wage multiple times, developed infrastructure plans,  and strengthened labor union membership in Illinois. They brought  together diverse groups and built coalitions to improve the lives of  working families in Illinois, from infrastructure to healthcare.   When Margaret stepped away from her post in 2007, Mike seamlessly  continued the hard work of leading Illinois AFL-CIO. In 2008, the mayor  of Decatur resigned abruptly, and the city council picked Mike to  finish the term. Like his work in labor, Mike took to his temporary  role with enthusiasm. He served for 10 months, providing steady  leadership, before returning full time to the AFL-CIO.   In 2015, a newly elected Republican Governor purposely chose Mike's  hometown of Decatur to launch a campaign to break Illinois unions with  right to work laws. Mike Carrigan did not back away. Mike fought then- Governor Rauner's efforts to weaken workers' rights in every corner of  our State. From courtrooms to the picket line, Mike took the fight to  Rauner. In 2018, the voters of Illinois retired Bruce Rauner. Within 6  months, Mike had worked behind the scenes to ensure that State workers  had a new contract under our new Governor, J.B. Pritzker.   After 20 years of service to the Illinois AFL-CIO, Mike is retiring.  Thanks to his hard work and dedication, the outlook for Illinois labor  is bright.   Even in retirement, I know Mike will keep busy and will only be a  phone call  [[Page S6821]]  away. I look forward to catching another Illini/Mizzou Braggin' Rights  basketball game with Mike. And his holiday dinner is a favorite of the  season for my wife, Loretta, and me.   I am excited to see what Mike does next and I am proud to call him a  friend.
