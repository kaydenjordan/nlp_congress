 Mr. Speaker, it looks like Congress has avoided another  government shutdown for now. We will probably pass another short-term  spending bill or two before this latest stopgap bill runs out,  threatening to bring us to the brink once again.   This is no way to govern. As a former mayor and State legislator, I  know that our States and cities need to be able to plan ahead. They  can't do that if Federal funding is up in the air and subject to the  latest political tug of war.   If we expect 50 States to pass a budget every year, there is no  reason Congress can't do the same. It is time for Congress and the  White House to stop playing games and to do the job that we were sent  to Washington to do.                            ____________________
