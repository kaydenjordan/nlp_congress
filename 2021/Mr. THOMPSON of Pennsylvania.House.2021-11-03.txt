 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the National Grain and Feed Association as they celebrate 125  years of supporting every facet of the agricultural value chain.   Established as one of the first industry-based arbitration systems in  North America, NGFA has transformed American farmers' bounties into  safe, nutrition, sustainable, and affordable human and animal food.   The National Grain and Feed Association is a nonprofit trade  association that serves more than 1,000 companies and 7,500 facilities.  They continue to advocate for grain, feed, and processing interests of  the complete value chain and promote the competitiveness of the United  States of America.   In order to recognize this great achievement, House Agriculture  Committee Chairman   David Scott and I introduced a resolution  celebrating the 125th anniversary celebrating the efforts of the NGFA  in transforming the American farmer's bounty.

Madam Speaker, I want to say congratulations on 125 years.                            ____________________
