 Mr. President, our Nation mourns the loss of one of  California's greatest civil rights leaders, whose nearly three decades  in Congress and many more years in public service helped to shape the  lives of countless individuals both at home and abroad.   Ron Dellums was born the son of a longshoreman and raised in Oakland,  CA, a community he would later come to represent both as a Member of  Congress and as mayor. A 1953 graduate of Oakland Technical High  School, Ron enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1954, where he served for 2  years, before graduating from San Francisco State College in 1960 with  a degree in psychology. Two years later, Ron received a master's degree  in social work from the University of California, Berkeley.   Immediately following graduate school, Ron immersed himself in public  service, first through a series of social work jobs at the California  Department of Mental Hygiene, and, eventually, as an elected member of  the Berkeley City Council in 1967. As councilman, Ron became an  outspoken advocate for historically underrepresented and underserved  communities in Berkeley and Oakland, in addition to becoming an anti- war advocate.   The convergence of the free speech and anti-war movements in the Bay  Area in the 1960s drove Ron to launch a campaign for Congress on a  platform for civil and human rights. He was elected to Congress in 1971  as the first African American from northern California. For the next 27  years, Ron  [[Page S5615]]  waged battle on a number of social issues plaguing distressed  communities, including increased funding for education, jobs, housing,  healthcare, and combatting infant mortality and lack of access to  affordable housing.   As the first Black chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,  Ron forcefully advocated peace through diplomacy and disarmament in the  midst of debates on the Vietnam war and excessive military spending.  Ron also became a vocal opponent against LGBTQ discrimination in the  military. A cofounder of the Congressional Black Caucus, Ron advocated  passionately to end American support for the apartheid regime in South  Africa, eventually sponsoring legislation to bring forth economic  sanctions and divestment by American companies and U.S. citizens.   In 1998, Ron left Congress and remained active as a local and  national civil rights leader. His departure from public service,  however, was short lived, and in 2007, Ron was elected mayor of the  city of Oakland in the midst of our Nation's worst economic recession  since the Great Depression. As mayor, Ron secured a record number of  Federal grants for the city of Oakland, supporting major infrastructure  projects, including port developments at the Oakland Army Base and  public transportation wins for California's East Bay.   Ron was a dear friend, trailblazer, and champion for civil and human  rights, whose service and dedication to the United States will forever  be cherished and remembered. His legacy will continue to inspire past,  present, and future Members of Congress who dare to fight for what is  right in the face of political unpopularity and resounding odds.   We wish every Californian and those whose lives were touched by Ron  peace during this difficult time, especially his wife, Cynthia, and his  children, Michael, Pamela, Piper, Brandon, and Erik.                            ____________________
