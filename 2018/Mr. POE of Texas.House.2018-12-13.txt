 Mr. Speaker, the people of Iran have taken to the  streets and continue to protest against the illegitimate regime of the  Ayatollah and the mullahs. These protests have taken place in numerous  cities now for 1 year.   The people protest the war-mongering dictatorship, the tyranny of the  Iranian Government and its terrorist activities. The people want  freedom. However, the mullahs are reacting with crackdowns on the  people.   Arrests, beatings, and jailing continues to occur. It is interesting  that the majority of these protests are led by women and the young.  Even truck drivers have gone on strike in the protest.   Groups such as the MEK have spoken out against the corrupt Iranian  Government and oppression of the people. Further, the Government of  Iran has sworn to destroy the United States. The United States should  stand with the Iranian people in their quest for freedom from the  tyrants of Iran.   As President Kennedy once said: ``Let every nation know, whether it  wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden,  meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the  survival and the success of liberty.''   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
