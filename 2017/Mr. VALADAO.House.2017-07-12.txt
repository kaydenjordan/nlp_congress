 Mr. Chairman, the first slide that I wanted to present  here is one that I think is very important when we talk about water  going out into the ocean.   The first bar there, the dark blue one, is how much water was flowing  through the estuary this past year.   The second bar is actually a little bit of an exaggeration. If we  took every  [[Page H5506]]  single reservoir that we propose in this bill, multiplied it by ten-- ten times the amount of storage that we are proposing--we still  wouldn't use all that water. There would still be quite a bit of water  flowing out into the ocean. So multiply every single project times ten,  and we still don't use up all the water.   So there was a lot of water wasted this year alone that we had the  opportunity to capture if this bill had been presented earlier or  passed into law, and we had the opportunity to actually make a  difference.   Why does that make a difference to so many folks? It makes a  difference because the Central Valley is very important to the country.  We feed the Nation. When you look at all the different commodities, and  this is just a small sample, we produce over 400 different commodities,  and a lot of these, a big majority, some of them as much as 99 percent  of the different commodities that go through.   So everyone sitting at home around the country should pay attention,  because this affects their food supply. Even here in the Capitol, when  you make yourself a salad at the salad bar, those salads, all those  different products are produced mostly in the Central Valley, and so  that is why this legislation is so important.   The reason why it is important to my farmers to get this done, even  in a year like this, where we had a 200 percent rainfall, with the  amount of water that was flowing through that was, again, in my  opinion, wasted, they didn't find out until it was too late. Planning  decisions need to be made over at the beginning of this when the rain  is coming down and they know that the water is there, not in March or  in April, because the opportunity has passed.   Farmers are very optimistic people. They put stuff in the ground,  cover it with dirt, and hope that it will grow so they can feed the  world, but having them wait until April to make those decisions to  plant those commodities and create those jobs is just way too late.   Now, this is the one that I think is the most important. This is  Mendota, California. This is a farm worker. This is what happens when  we allow water to flow out into the ocean that is wasted. People are  living in shantytowns. These are people who want to work and people who  want to feed the world, people who want to provide for their own  families, and not wait for a check from the government. They just want  to know when they are getting their water so that they can start to  produce crops and feed the world, but this, because of the policies  through Washington, D.C., is what we end up with.   Now all the folks who represent parts of my community in different  ways, whether it is the water district, city, city councils, county  governments, they have all sent in letters in support.   I include in the Record a list of all the folks who sent in letters  in support of the legislation.

I think it is time for the Governor and our Senators to play a  role in this as well.   This bill has been passed. We have gotten some things passed, and I  know that my friend across the aisle mentioned that earlier, but even  after the WIIN Act was passed into law, we still had a delay in  decisions made, because our farmers had no clue that they were getting  their water.   So we have to pass legislation like this, this bill right here, and  this is what can be helpful for us in the Central Valley in California  and the Nation as a whole.
