 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Savannah, Georgia, Police Department Patrol Officer Anthony Christie,  who lost his life in the line of duty on May 25 at the age of 37.   He is remembered as a passionate person who was deeply devoted to his  fellow officers and community while simply loving his job. Before  joining the police force, Officer Christie served in the United States  Navy, where he earned a number of accolades, including the Navy Good  Conduct Medal and the Global War on Terror Service Medal.   He carried this excellent work with him from the Navy over to the  police force. In one mission, he rescued a child who was abducted and  abandoned in the woods. His fellow officers always wanted to work with  Officer Christie because of his calming presence and their respect for  his work.   Officer Christie's passing is a reminder to us all of the danger  officers must endure when they go to work to keep us and our families  safe. I encourage everyone to thank our first responders on a daily  basis, not only in the times when we need them the most.   To Officer Christie and his family, we offer our deepest condolences.  Thank you for your service.   May God bless.                            ____________________
