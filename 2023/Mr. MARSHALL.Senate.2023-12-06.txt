 Madam President, twice before, Republicans have come to  this floor to attempt to pass by unanimous consent the House-passed  stand-alone aid package to Israel that would provide our ally with $14  billion in military assistance for their fight to destroy the Hamas  terrorists and send a loud message to Iran and its proxies.   I would like to yield the floor to the Senator from Florida.    Madam President, I would like to yield the floor to the  senior Senator from Tennessee.    Madam President, I would like to yield some time to the  senior Senator from Alabama.    Next, I would like to yield the floor to my good  friend, a staunch supporter of the people of Israel, the senior Senator  from Texas.    Madam President, I sure appreciate the Senator from  Texas speaking up and the wise words he shared. It reminds me of an old  saying, that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, that funding  Israel today is worth two of these other issues that seemingly just  never can come together as we try to solve this four-headed riddle.   As I said earlier, this is now my third time to the floor to try to  pass with unanimous consent the House-passed, stand-alone aid package  to Israel that would provide our ally with $14 billion in military  assistance.   Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stood on the Senate  floor and debated with us and lectured us on why this bipartisan,  House-passed legislation that maintains the exact spending levels  requested by President Biden is somehow unreasonable. But I would like  to share with you what I think is unreasonable. I think it is the  Democrats' unwillingness to help our ally and separate this package to  get it to the President's desk today. Unreasonable is my colleagues  across the aisle using the crisis in Israel to secure more money for  Ukraine. But what is unfathomable is what this body just admitted--that  we are nowhere closer to getting this aid package passed than we were  on October 7 when the war broke out.   In case nobody is paying attention, tomorrow will be 2 months to the  day that Hamas brutally and savagely attacked the people of Israel.   I think we need to be honest with the American people. Negotiations  aren't just stalled; they never started. Meaningful negotiations never  started. We have a better chance of finding an ocean in Kansas than  this $106 billion package seeing the light of day.   Today, every single Republican sent a unanimous message to the  Democrat leadership and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue: We will not be  bullied into voting on massive spending packages that use Israel as  leverage to fund Democrat priorities, and we will not vote for any  legislation that secures foreign nations' borders but not our own.   So here we are once again offering an olive branch to separate this  package out and address each of these issues one at a time. The House  made this easy for us. They passed a bipartisan bill that would grant  aid to Israel and allow us to break this logjam and focus on the more  pressing matter to our national security: the border. The border. The  border. The border.   Now, the Democrats showed their hands 2 weeks ago when they voted  unanimously against our bipartisan, stand-alone Israel aid bill that  would have fast-tracked this package straight to the President's desk  before Thanksgiving. But, sadly, this city loves to make the perfect  the enemy of the good.   The sensible thing for this body to do now is pass this bipartisan,  stand-alone aid bill for Israel. This legislation passed the House over  a month ago and could be delivered to President Biden's desk tonight.  We should pass aid to Israel and then continue debating a potential  broader package.   Now, I have never heard of an American asking for more IRS agents.  And if you are concerned about the pay-fors we presented, as I said  time and time again, show us another pay-for.   It is time to end the political talking points that we have heard on  this floor.   And please don't insult our intelligence. Don't insult the  intelligence of Americans with the fake border security that is in this  bigger, broader package that will only accelerate asylum, leading to  more people crossing our border illegally.   If you plan to object to this stand-alone bill's passage on the  ground that military aid to Israel should include conditions, I want to  note for the record that senior officials from the White House have  said they are not pursuing such conditions.   So, indeed, let's come together. Let's all come to the table. We  tried it your way, and it failed. This is a huge opportunity to secure  a bipartisan win and get to work on the most immediate threat to our  national security--our wide-open southern border.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of H.R. 6126, which was received from the  House. I further ask that the bill be considered  [[Page S5797]]  read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, what we have brought forward tonight is  a House-passed, stand-alone package of aid for Israel. We didn't bring  forward the entire security package, which already failed. We have  tried that. It didn't work.   So many of my colleagues across the aisle, indeed, spoke eloquently  in support of Ukraine as well as Israel. I think back to what my  college track coach said.   He said:         Don't tell me. Show me.    So I am going to quote some words from the Democratic Party, and I  want you to think about the words lining up with the actions. When  people vote against the stand-alone aid for Israel, is that consistent  with their own words?   This is Secretary Blinken on October 13:         No country can tolerate having a terrorist group come in,       slaughter its people in the most unconscionable ways and live       like that. What Israel is doing is not retaliation, it is       defending the lives of its people.    Next is Secretary Austin on October 20:         So, make no mistake: The United States will make sure that       Israel has what it needs to defend itself.    Next, President Biden on October 10:         So, in this moment, we must be crystal clear: We stand with       Israel.    He says it again.         We stand with Israel, and we will make sure Israel has what       it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and       respond to this attack.    Again, President Biden on 20 October:         In Israel, we must make sure that they have what they need       to protect their people today and always.    Finally, the majority leader, the senior Senator from New York, on 15  November:         We will not rest until you get the assistance you need.    Folks, this is the opportunity. This is the time. This is the time to  stand up for Israel, to make good on those pledges. I meticulously  listened to my friends across the aisle and their arguments. What we  are talking about today--what the bill is about today--is aid to  Israel.   As I listened carefully to their objections, their objection with  this particular bill was with the pay-fors, and I respect that. The  second objection was that they wanted more humanitarian assistance to  Hamas and the people of Gaza as well, and I respect that as well.   So bring us that bill--that stand-alone bill--that includes what you  think is appropriate for a pay-for and what type of humanitarian  assistance you want to make sure Hamas gets as well.   But the real argument--the real argument made tonight--was to use  Israel as a tool, to use it as a lever to fund Ukraine. And, again, I  listened carefully. I tried to count how many times my friends across  the aisle said ``Ukraine'' or ``Putin,'' and I stopped when I got to  over 50. Israel was mentioned less than 10 times. They talked  [[Page S5801]]  about their national security package--their supplemental package--and  they really should call it the ``lovefest for Ukraine'' package.    I respect where they are coming from. I think it is how and how much  and when do we give the people of Ukraine right now in a situation that  has been a stalemate for a year--really, no progress made for a year.   Two hundred thousand people have died in that war and 500,000  casualties. There is no end in sight. This looks to me like a 7- or 10- year war. It looks like it is Vietnam all over again.   I remember the early days of Vietnam, when there were a few people  saying: Slow down. Let's stop. There are too many people who are dying  in this situation right now.   Let's have that debate. Let's pull Ukraine out, and let's have that  debate.   I honestly believe, if we would have passed this Israel package a  month ago and then worked on a Ukraine package starting then, we would  have a Ukraine package done.   What I wish is that my friends across the aisle were as passionate,  though, about the security of our own southern border as about the  lines of another country--the property lines of another country, their  boundaries.   I think I heard my friends across the aisle talk about the border  maybe four or five times. The No. 1 national security threat--the most  immediate national security threat to Americans--is our open southern  border. Do we have to repeat the numbers? Ten million people have  crossed the border illegally in the past 3 years, 1.7 million ``got- aways,'' 70,000 aliens of interest, hundreds of known terrorists.   All the lights are blinking red right now. All the lights are  blinking red. That is what Director Wray said, yesterday, up here on  the Hill, that on terrorist threats, all the lights are blinking red.  And why wouldn't they, with these 1.7 million ``got-aways'' throughout  the country doing who knows what?   If my friends across the aisle are serious about a national security  supplemental package, it starts with meaningful security at the  southern border--meaningful security, not a process that actually  promotes more people crossing the border.   It has to include something that impacts asylum and parole. It has to  literally secure the border, I think, even to begin this next debate.  America needs to get its own house in order before we can help fix  other people's houses.   I understand the needs across this world are many. And my compassion,  my heart, whether it is for the people of Ukraine, the people of  Israel--I share those same compassions, but we just can't keep throwing  good money after bad money. We have to have people with accountability.  We have to make sure that there is a goal--that there is a goal that we  can win.   So, at the end of the day, the most prudent thing for this body to do  would be to pass this standalone aid for Israel. Take it off the chess  board. Let's get that one done. But, instead, my friends across the  aisle want to use it as a political tool, a tool to leverage their  funding for Ukraine. Let's have that discussion separately.   I think it is time that this body do what we say we want to do. Let's  not rest until we get this assistance to Israel.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to thank Dr. Carl  Heilman for his many years of service to the free State of Kansas and  Barton Community College, as well as honor him for all that he  accomplished during his career.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S5804, December 6, 2023, in the third column, the  following appears:  Madam President, I rise today to  thank Dr. Carl Heilman for his many years of service to the free  State of Kansas and Barton County Community College, as well as  honor him for all that he accomplished during his career.      The online Record has been corrected to read:   Madam President, I rise today to thank Dr. Carl Heilman for his  many years of service to the free State of Kansas and Barton  Community College, as well as honor him for all that he  accomplished during his career.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      A lifelong educator committed to service, Carl began his journey at  the University of Northern Iowa as a student, where he graduated with a  bachelor of arts degree in social sciences. After graduating, Carl  would continue his education at Northern Iowa, obtaining a master of  arts in counseling, later pairing that with a master of arts in public  administration from Minnesota State University. Carl completed his  formal education with a doctor of philosophy in higher education  administration from Iowa State University.   With this knowledge in hand, Carl served in administrative positions  at several colleges across the U.S. Beginning at Iowa Lakes Community  College in Iowa, Carl was both a chairperson and faculty member. While  at Northland Pioneer College in Arizona, Carl served as vice president  for student services, and at Lincoln Trail College-Illinois Eastern  Community College District, Carl was campus president.   But Carl's service to the State of Kansas began in 2006 when he  became the fifth president of Barton Community College. Carl hit the  ground running, quickly building rapport with the board of trustees,  faculty and staff, local community constituents, and the student body.  With this support, Carl set attainable goals for the future of Barton,  establishing it as a dynamic institution able to weather  [[Page S5805]]  limited access to resources, fluctuating economic conditions, and  shifting State demographics. Under Carl's guidance, Barton has expanded  its online learning options, generated diverse workforce training  opportunities, and expanded services to Kansas military communities. In  fact, Carl was integral in keeping the 1st Infantry Division stationed  in Kansas, as his testimony to the Kansas Governor Military Council on  behalf of Kansas higher education for The Big Red One proved persuasive  to the 2015 Base Realignment and Closure Commission.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S5804, December 6, 2023, in the third column, the  following appears: But Carl's service to the State of Kansas began  in 2006 when he became the fifth president of Barton County  Community College.      The online Record has been corrected to read: But Carl's service  to the State of Kansas began in 2006 when he became the fifth  president of Barton Community College.    =========================== NOTE ===========================         With these accomplishments, it is unsurprising that Carl received  exceptional recognition from the State of Kansas. He served an  unprecedented 3 years as chairperson for the system council of Kansas  Community College Presidents, where he oversaw the statewide  implementation of a public higher education course articulation  process, the introduction of a public higher education reverse transfer  model, and the development of reverse transfer for both community  colleges and the private college system. Thanks to Carl, these actions  have eased administrative processes for Kansas students and  administrators, making life simpler for everyone.   Carl will officially retire from Barton Community College on June 30,  2024, after over 17 years of service to the people of Kansas. I now ask  my colleagues to join me in recognizing the distinguished career of Dr.  Carl Heilman, as well as thank him for all his work on behalf of the  state of Kansas and Barton Community College.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S5805, December 6, 2023, in the first column, the  following appears: Carl officially retired from Barton County  Community College on June 30, 2024, after over 17 years of service  to the people of Kansas.

I am extremely proud that the Mid Kansas Cooperative, a pillar of  prosperity in central Kansas since 1965, has received ARA's extremely  prestigious award this year. Known locally as MKC, the co-op is  headquartered in Moundridge and offers a complete line of products,  programs, and services citizens throughout the State of Kansas. With  more than 600 employees, 11,000 members, and 8,000 customers through a  wholly-owned subsidiary, MKC specializes in grain, agronomy, energy,  feed, and risk management. The farm communities that Mid Kansas Co-op  serves have a long history of fostering innovations in grain  production, and MKC continues that tradition by utilizing technology  like drones and autonomous robots for precision agriculture management  tactics.   White pickup trucks bearing the MKC logo dot the plains from planting  to harvest, and their specialists aid Kansas producers in making  agronomic decisions all year long. While many co-ops provide goods and  services as a complement to agriculture producers, MKC goes above and  beyond through a robust college internship program and investments back  into the very communities that their branches inhabit through  scholarships and sponsorships.   In combining the two facets of a productive workforce and expert  knowledge, MKC maintains its position as an innovative steward of  Kansas farmland, an exceptional provider of customer service, and a  leader in local communities across a great portion of the State of  Kansas. This commitment to excellence and innovation in the  agricultural sector made MKC a more than worthy winner of the Retailer  of the Year Award. They truly embody their motto of ``Shared growth.  Shared success.''   I now ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating MKC president  and CEO Brad Stedman, along with all other MKC member-owners and  employees, for being named the Agricultural Retailers Association's  2023 Retailer of the Year.                            ____________________
