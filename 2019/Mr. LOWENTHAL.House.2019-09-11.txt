 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous materials on H.R. 1941.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The first question is, what do all governors, Republican and  Democratic, along the entire East Coast and along the entire West Coast  of the United States and over 330 municipalities and counties from  these States all have in common? You know what they have in common?  They are all opposed to expanding offshore oil and gas development off  their shores.   Today we are here to ensure that these coasts, the Atlantic and the  Pacific, receive the assurance and the protection that they deserve.  H.R. 1941, the Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act would  permanently protect the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts from offshore oil  and gas drilling. From Maine down to Florida, from Washington to  California, over 3,000 miles of the United States' coasts are  threatened by the fossil fuel industry-driven agenda, which is driven  by the Trump administration.   One of President Trump's first actions upon taking office was  mandating the development of a new and totally unnecessary 5-year plan  for offshore oil and gas lease sales. In January 2018, former Interior  Secretary Zinke released a draft of that plan, which proposed opening  more than 90 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf to oil and gas  development. This proposal included the entirety of America's Atlantic  and Pacific Coasts, and if enacted, drilling could endanger more than  72,000 miles of U.S. shorelines.   Expectedly, there was immediate pushback from citizens, elected  officials, governors, business leaders, all who understood that their  coastal communities are incompatible with offshore oil and gas.   The public knows that bringing in industry as risky and as dirty as  oil and gas to the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts is dangerous on many  levels. Our oceans sustain a rich diversity of marine life, and they  provide immense value to America's coastal communities by helping to  generate billions of dollars in economic output and by supporting  millions of jobs.   For example, thriving fish stocks and healthy marine mammals off the  coast of New Jersey, Maryland, and Florida support tackle shops, whale  watching tours, and a massive seafood industry. And oil-free beaches  and bays in Virginia and the Carolinas drive business for local  restaurants, for vacation rentals, and for outfitters.   But coastal residents are not the only ones who will benefit from  protecting these areas. Some of our Nation's most majestic national  park units belonging to all Americans are along our coast, including  Acadia, Biscayne, Cape Hatteras, and Point Reyes. People from all walks  of life and diverse backgrounds and from both political parties cherish  these special places, and they rely on healthy oceans, clean beaches,  and the abundant fish and wildlife that come with them.   The inevitable spills and the variety of other onshore and offshore  impacts from oil and gas drilling have no place along our East and West  Coasts. Over one million people are employed by the tourism and  recreation industries along the East Coast. These are real  [[Page H7607]]  jobs that exist now and will only grow if we continue to treat our  oceans and coasts with care. That is over four times as many jobs as  the industry-generated fantasies that come with opening the entire  Atlantic seaboard to drilling rigs.   Four times as many jobs would be at risk from the industrial  facilities that would be built along the coast. Four times as many jobs  would be at risk from the chronic pollution and pipeline spills that  are widespread with offshore oil and gas. And four times as many jobs  would be at risk from a catastrophic blowout, like the one we saw in  the Gulf of Mexico only 9 years ago.                                time  1230    None of these facts or the outcry from concerned citizens have  influenced a Trump administration that is laser-focused on doing the  bidding of the oil and gas industry. Instead of protecting our coasts,  President Trump and Secretary Bernhardt have played politics and now  are hiding their plan to drill near our communities.   In January 2018, immediately after the release of the draft leasing  program, then-Secretary Zinke met with then-Governor of Florida Rick  Scott at the Tallahassee airport and tweeted that he was removing  Florida from the leasing program. However, it turned out that this was  nothing more than a ploy meant to boost the political prospects of a  Republican Senate candidate.   First Florida was in, then it was out, then it was in again, and now  nobody except Secretary Bernhardt and President Trump knows for sure.   For 2\1/2\ years, this administration has based its offshore drilling  decisions on politics, not on the needs or the concerns of coastal  communities.   In April, the administration announced that its offshore leasing  plans are now on hold due to a recent court decision that is related to  Alaska. But that is only a short-term reprieve. At any moment, the  administration can restart its efforts to auction off our Nation's  marine resources, which will undoubtedly happen if the President were  to get a second term.   Coastal communities need assurance that their businesses, beaches,  and way of life will not be sacrificed to the fossil fuel industry by  the Trump administration.   H.R. 1941 provides our Atlantic and Pacific constituents, including  those along Florida's Atlantic Coast, the necessary protections from  the dangers of offshore oil and gas, and it deserves this body's full  support.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Maine (Ms. Pingree).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Maine.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Van Drew).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ted Lieu).                                time  1315     Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the majority leader.    Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Carbajal), who is a highly respected Representative.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chair, may I ask a question of the ranking member  about how many more speakers he has.    He just arrived, Mr. Chair, so I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time to  clarify a couple of things that have been said in this wonderful  discussion, and I  [[Page H7614]]  thank all the speakers for coming before us.   The sky is not falling. Let me repeat that: The sky is not falling.  It has been pointed out and reported that if we do not have drilling in  the Atlantic and Pacific, it will badly hurt the Land and Water  Conservation Fund because it is funded from offshore revenues. The idea  that the passage of H.R. 1941 will hurt the LWCF is completely false.  This bill will not affect the LWCF at all.   Let's talk about it. All the money for the LWCF from this fund comes  from the existing oil and gas activities in the central and western  Gulf of Mexico. Of the resources that come into the Federal Government  from these areas, the central and western Gulf of Mexico, the Land and  Water Conservation Fund gets the first $900 million. That is what comes  in, and then it is distributed.   Last year, what came in for the conservation fund should have been  over $4.7 billion. In fact, in the last 19 years, we have brought in,  at a minimum, $2.8 billion, far in excess of the $900 million that goes  to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   There are projections that the existing activity in the Gulf of  Mexico is enough to keep the LWCF funded for many, many decades to  come. We don't need to drill in the Atlantic or the Pacific to fund the  LWCF. Revenues are not the problem.   What is the problem then? The real problem is that only twice in the  history of the LWCF has Congress appropriated the full $900 million. As  I have pointed out, much more money has come into the Treasury. Only  twice have we ever fully appropriated the money.                                time  1330    In fact, we have collected almost $40 billion in revenues that should  have been spent on the LWCF, but we have appropriated less than half of  that, which is $18.4 billion.   So I am glad that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  very concerned about the LWCF, but I would like to point out that we  should make sure we work together, that we get the full $900 million  that we should be getting every year and that we are not getting every  year.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am ready to close, and reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I just, in closing, would like to make a few statements that kind of  reiterate what has already been said, I think so well, and how we must  protect our coast.   Right now, the United States produces, in totality, 12.3 million  barrels of oil a day--crude oil, each and every day. It is an all-time  U.S. record. We have done that in 2018, and we lead the world now in  terms of export production.    Of that 12.3 million, we export over 3 million barrels of crude oil a  day. It is more than is exported from all the other nations of the  world, except for two OPEC nations.   We are the number one producer of natural gas. We are a net exporter  of natural gas, but we also say we do--by not opening up the Atlantic  and the Pacific, we are not putting this tremendous resource of oil  development at risk. Right now, in the Gulf, open for development in  the future, we normally put up almost 80 million acres in the Gulf for  leasing each year.   Right now over 72 percent of the potential Gulf that is open for oil  and gas development, 72 percent has not yet been developed. There is an  estimated 43 billion barrels of oil in the Gulf yet  [[Page H7615]]  to be discovered and produced. There is enough oil there for the next  66 years of production at the same level that we have today. We must  protect our coast. We must protect the future.   Mr. Chair, I urge swift adoption of H.R. 1941, and I yield back the  remainder of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, this is a pointless amendment, and I am, frankly, a little  bit embarrassed that we are even discussing it. Not only does it not  improve the bill, but it is also based on a false premise.   Let's be clear: We are not reliant on Russian energy, and the United  States is not stricken by energy poverty. In fact, it is the complete  opposite of the present reality.   The Atlantic and Pacific have remained off-limits to new oil and gas  development for decades, but the United States now produces 12.3  million barrels of crude oil each day, which is an all-time U.S.  record, and it produces the most in the world. It exports over 3  million barrels of crude oil a day, more than all but two members of  OPEC exported in 2018.   We are the number three exporter of oil. We are also the number one  producer of natural gas in the world, and we are a net exporter of  natural gas.   Look, if we really want to lead in energy, we should be taking a  bigger role in the production of renewable energy. Costs for renewable  energy have plummeted, and our global competitors are jockeying to lead  the world in clean energy development.   Unfortunately, Republicans seem to have dusted off the same tired  talking points that they were using 10 years ago--and even longer, 20  years ago--before U.S. energy production skyrocketed.   Even worse, the Trump administration acts like it believes those  talking points and continues to believe that the future lies in coal,  oil, and gas.   Mr. Chair, this is a silly amendment, and it achieves nothing. For  this reason, I urge opposition to the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose the Gosar amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, we do not have any concerns with the  amendment and do not believe it undermines the underlying legislation.   Furthermore, it is our firm belief that, if the Department of the  Interior were to consult with the Defense Department, they would find  H.R. 1941 poses no national security risk to the United States.   The underlying bill does not affect a single producing offshore  lease, and oil and gas companies now have tremendous opportunities for  new offshore development in the United States.   Let's be clear: The United States offers nearly 80 million acres in  the Gulf of Mexico for new leasing every year, and companies now hold  only 13 million acres of the Gulf under lease, which means that 72  percent of the acres that have been offered are not yet developed.  [[Page H7618]]    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, this amendment has nothing to do with the bill and is  simply an attempt to block protections for the Atlantic and the Pacific  coasts, and it is based upon a false concern for women and minorities'  jobs.   We know that Members from both sides of the aisle understand that our  existing coastal economies are incompatible with more offshore oil and  gas development. I believe that enacting this underlying bill and  protecting the Atlantic and Pacific coast from the dangers of offshore  drilling will, in itself, safeguard jobs in the coastal tourism and  recreational industries, many of which are held by women and people of  color.                                time  1430    For example, thriving fish stocks and healthy marine mammals off the  coasts of Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, and Florida support tackle  shops, whale watching tours, and seafood markets.   Oil-free beaches and bays in Virginia and the Carolinas drive  business for local restaurants, vacation rentals, and outfitters.   People from all walks of life, from diverse backgrounds, and from  both political parties cherish these special places and rely on healthy  oceans, clean beaches, and the abundant fish and wildlife that come  with it.   For example, last week, the Business Alliance for Protecting the  Pacific Coast wrote to this body and expressed its strong support for  the underlying bill. According to the business coalition, which  represents more than 4,000 businesses along the West Coast, offshore  drilling threatens nearly 746,000 jobs and nearly $53 billion in GDP.   The real threat to jobs and economic opportunities in coastal  communities would be failing to protect permanently our shorelines from  dangerous oil drilling.   This is an unserious amendment that does nothing to protect jobs  belonging to women and minorities, and it keeps the Atlantic and  Pacific Coasts at risk.   Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I urge opposition to the amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Castor of Florida) having assumed the chair, Mr. Lawson of Florida,  Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the  Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the  bill (H.R. 1941) to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to  prohibit the Secretary of the Interior including in any leasing program  certain planning areas, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
