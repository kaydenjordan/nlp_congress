 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Combating International  Islamophobia Act.   This legislation creates an office to monitor and combat Islamophobia  at the Department of State. In recent years, we have seen tragedies  like the 2019 Christchurch shooting, as well as the state-sponsored  persecution of Uyghurs in China.   My hometown of Dearborn, Michigan, has a very large Muslim community,  and it is also a constant target of Islamophobic hate. There have been  thousands of documented complaints of anti-Muslim hate and bias in the  United States this year alone. In my community are good-standing  Americans. They are afraid and fearful of these actions, and I have  heard from constituents who are afraid of visiting their mosques or  going to events as a result.   Passing this bill sends a strong message about our shared commitment  to safeguarding religious liberty worldwide.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
