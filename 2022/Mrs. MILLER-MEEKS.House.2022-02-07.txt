 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a young man  from my district who is dominating motorcycle racing. Kole King of  Burlington, Iowa, recently won the Grand National Hooligan Championship  in Pensacola, Florida.   At just 25, Kole has already reached the top of flat-track motorcycle  racing. Through 13 races during last season, he won 8 times, blowing  past his competition. Kole has been racing since he was a young child  and is a great example that if you work hard and do what you love, your  dreams can come true.   Good luck, Kole King, the now-defending champion. Iowa is cheering  for you.                            ____________________
