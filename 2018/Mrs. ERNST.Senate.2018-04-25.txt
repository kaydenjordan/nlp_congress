 Mr. President, I wish to recognize Anfinson Farm  Store, a small business in Cushing, IA, that has been a staple of the  community for 100 years.   Like many businesses, Anfinson Farm Store will be receiving  significant tax relief from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and they are  using this as an opportunity to invest in their most important  resource: their employees. After the legislation was signed into law,  owner John Anfinson, who has owned the business for 46 years, announced  that all seven of their full-time employees would receive $1,000  bonuses and 5-percent pay increases. He was also able to purchase  nearly $400,000 in new equipment with 1-year expensing.   Small businesses make up 97 percent of employers in Iowa, and prior  to the passage of tax reform, they were taxed at marginal rates that  often reached as high as 45 percent. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a  monumental achievement for small businesses, reducing their tax burden  so that they can grow and invest in their employees.   As we celebrate National Small Business Week, I would like to  recognize Anfinson Farm Store and all of Iowa's small businesses, who  are the backbone of our economy. I would also like to express my  gratitude to the President  [[Page S2434]]  and my colleagues in Congress for helping to reduce the tax burden on  our small businesses.                            ____________________
