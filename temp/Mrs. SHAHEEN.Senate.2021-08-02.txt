 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote  against this Barrasso amendment because there is nothing in the  underlying provision that would in any way promote prohibiting natural  gas, and that is what Senator Barrasso is suggesting is in the bill.   Now, if it were such as Senator Barrasso says, I don't think we would  have received strong letters of support for this specific provision  from both the National Association of Home Builders and the American  Gas Association.   I have the letters right here. I would actually like to read from the  Home Builders' letter.   The Home Builders support section 5101, which was the original  section in the Energy bill as it passed the committee.         Cost-Effective codes implementation for efficiency and       resiliency.    And this is the important point:         This section promotes technical assistance and funding for       code adoption while maintaining the flexibility for state and       local governments to deliver safe, energy efficient, and       affordable housing.    Why would we want to get in the way of what States and communities  are already doing?   I ask unanimous consent that both of these letters be printed in the  Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                             National Association of                                                   Home Builders,                                      Washington, DC, July 13, 2021.      Hon. Joseph Manchin,      Chairman, Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee, U.S.           Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. John Barrasso,      Ranking Member, Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee,           U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Manchin and Ranking Member Barrasso, On       behalf of more than 140,000 members of the National       Association of Home Builders (NAHB), we write to express our       strong support for the Energy Infrastructure Act. This       legislation advances  [[Page S5558]]       efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse       gas emissions without stringent energy code mandates that       will increase housing prices for American home buyers.        NAHB strongly supports climate change programs that       recognize and promote voluntary, above-code compliance for       energy efficiency programs. There are several programs,       certifications, and other options that are incorporated into       this legislation that promote verifiable reductions in       greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, NAHB supports Section       5101, Cost-effective codes implementation for efficiency and       resiliency. This section promotes technical assistance and       funding for code adoption while maintaining the flexibility       for state and local governments to deliver safe, energy       efficient, and affordable housing.        We commend your leadership on this vital legislation and       look forward to working as a partner with all levels of       government to encourage energy efficiency.        Thank you for your consideration on this matter.        Sincerely,      James W. Tobin III.                                   ____                                         American Gas Association,                                                      July 12, 2020.      Hon. Joe Manchin III,      Chairman, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee,           Washington, DC.      Hon. John Barrasso,      Ranking Member, Senate Energy and Natural Resources           Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Manchin and Ranking Member Barrasso: On       behalf of the American Gas Association (AGA), we appreciate       your Committee's consideration of the legislative proposal to       address energy infrastructure throughout the country--the       Energy Infrastructure Act. AGA is committed to reducing       greenhouse gas emissions through smart innovation, new and       modernized infrastructure, and advanced natural gas       technologies that maintain reliable, resilient, and       affordable energy service choices for consumers. With these       principles in mind, we are pleased to support Subtitle B--      Hydrogen Research and Development, Section 5002--Energy       Efficiency Revolving Loan Fund Capitalization Grant Program,       and Section 5101--Cost-Effective Codes Implementation for       Efficiency and Resilience within the Energy Infrastructure       Act.        AGA, founded in 1918, represents more than 200 local energy       companies that deliver clean natural gas throughout the       United States. Nearly 180 million Americans and 5.5 million       businesses use natural gas in all fifty states utilize       natural gas served by an infrastructure base that is       unrivaled in the world.        The use of natural gas, in combination with energy       efficiency and renewable gases--such as hydrogen--has       contributed to U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions       declining to the lowest levels in three decades. Furthermore,       methane emissions from natural gas utility distribution       systems have declined 73 percent since 1990, even as natural       gas utility companies added more than 760,000 miles of       pipeline and approximately a customer every minute.        We appreciate the work your Committee is doing to advance       legislation that would put in place fuel neutral approaches       to addressing the country's energy infrastructure needs. The       natural gas industry has a proven track record of reducing       emissions through energy efficiency and innovation, and we       look forward to continuing to work with you on these       important issues.            Sincerely,                                                       George Lowe.     As many of my colleagues know, it is unprecedented to  get the American Gas Association, the National Association of Home  Builders, and the energy efficiency advocates all in agreement, and  that is the result of the extensive negotiations that went into this  section of the bill that Senator Barrasso would overturn.   Now, Energy Chairman Manchin wasn't able to get here to speak to this  provision and this amendment, but he opposes it. And if he were here,  he would say: ``Let's not mess with a good thing.''   This provision doesn't ban--it doesn't even touch natural gas. So I  strongly support the bill as written and urge my colleagues to vote no  on this amendment.   I yield the floor.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote that is  scheduled begin immediately.
