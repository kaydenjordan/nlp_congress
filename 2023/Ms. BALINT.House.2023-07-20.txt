 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. Vermont has  experienced so much devastation over the last 2 weeks.   The images have been shocking. Our capital city is completely under  water, small businesses across the State destroyed, homes and rental  units totally gutted, and thousands and thousands of acres of cropland  decimated.   Seeing my State under water makes it clearer than ever that climate  change isn't coming. It is here.   Disasters like this bring up so much trauma for many of us who lived  through Hurricane Irene. I want Vermonters to know that we, your  congressional delegation, will be there as long as it takes to recover,  but we have a very long road ahead.   With the support of our friends and neighbors, we will get through  this together. That is what I have seen as I have traveled around  Vermont visiting communities--Vermonters pitching in and helping one  another.   We cannot accept what we have seen in Vermont over the last week as  the new normal. We must continue to fight for climate action and  climate resiliency to keep Vermont the Green Mountain State that we  know and love.                            ____________________
