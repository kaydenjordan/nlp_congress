 Madam Speaker, 2018 was a tough year for so many  Americans. We had families and farmers and people all across California  whose homes were destroyed, people who lost their lives, lost their  farms, lost their businesses. In other parts of the country, there were  storms and hurricanes that similarly devastated communities.   My home State of Hawaii was one of them. We were battered by natural  disasters of all types last year on nearly all of our islands, from  major flooding and landslides on Kauai and Oahu in April, an erupting  volcano throughout May and June, and flooding and wildfires on multiple  islands in August.   But, time and again, in Hawaii and across the country, people have  proved their resilience and strength, living aloha, taking care of each  other, even when they have lost everything.   Today, we are voting to pass funding that is sorely needed by  communities like mine, where people are still struggling to get back on  their feet with limited resources.   This bill provides funding for things like crop insurance,  reconstructing facilities, water infrastructure projects, crisis  counseling, rebuilding homes, small businesses, and more.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this necessary funding  [[Page H617]]  bill and provide a helping hand to those whose lives will never be the  same because of these disasters                            ____________________
