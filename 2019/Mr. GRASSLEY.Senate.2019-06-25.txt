 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 1 minute.    Madam President, later today, the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee is scheduled to consider four protocols to the  United States' tax treaties with Spain, Switzerland, Japan, and  Luxembourg. I support swift action on these protocols both in committee  and in the Senate, and I urge my colleagues to vote yes on them.   I encourage the committee to also take up the new tax treaties with  Chile, Hungary, and Poland as soon as possible. These new treaties will  provide important benefits to U.S. taxpayers and the U.S. Government.   After years of discussion and debate, the time has come to move  forward on all of these bilateral agreements.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
