 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Lead-Free  Drinking Water for All Act.'' This legislation would authorize $45  billion to replace every lead pipe and service line in America over the  next 10 years, ensuring clean water for all.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most  common sources of lead in drinking water are lead pipes, faucets, and  plumbing fixtures. Nationwide, there are 6 to 10 million lead service  lines serving up to 22 million Americans, affecting Americans living in  all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The only way to  guarantee lead-free drinking water is to remove and replace every lead  pipe and service line in America--and that's precisely what this  legislation calls for.   The Lead-Free Drinking Water for All Act would reauthorize EPA's lead  reduction projects grant program and increase the authorization to $4.5  billion per year for 10 years. It would prioritize disadvantaged  communities and set a ten-year deadline for projects to complete the  lead service line removal. It would also guarantee that funded projects  pay a prevailing wage.   Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated that there is no  safe level of exposure to lead. According to the EPA, lead is  particularly harmful for young children: low levels of exposure have  been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous system,  learning disabilities, impaired hearing, impaired physical development,  and impaired formation and function of blood cells. EPA has set the  maximum contaminant level goal for lead in drinking water at zero  because lead can be harmful to human health, even at low exposure  levels.   This problem is particularly prevalent in California's Central  Valley, where, for example, in 2017 approximately 25 percent of schools  in Fresno County reported lead in their drinking water while statewide,  almost 1 in 5 kids attended a school that served drinking water with  lead contamination.   The Lead-Free Drinking Water for All Act would protect public health  by guaranteeing that all Americans have access to lead-free drinking  water. By providing funding for grants and prioritizing disadvantaged  communities, this legislation would also reduce disparities in access  to clean water and ensure that the burden of paying for lead service  line replacement does not fall on disadvantaged communities.   I thank my co-lead, Senator Stabenow, for her tireless leadership  fighting for clean water for her constituents in Michigan and all  Americans. I also thank the cosponsors of this bill for championing  this vital effort with us in the Senate.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the ``Lead-Free  Drinking Water for All Act'' as quickly as possible.   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. King):   S. 2304. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to  require that direct-to-consumer advertisements for prescription drugs  and biological products include an appropriate disclosure of pricing  information; to the Committee on Finance.
