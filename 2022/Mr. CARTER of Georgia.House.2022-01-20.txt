 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and  recognize one of the First District's finest, quarterback Stetson  Bennett of the Georgia Bulldogs.   Football is filled with stories of triumph, tribulation, and heart.  The saga of Stetson Bennett has now cemented itself as one of those  great stories that football fans will talk about for generations.   Hailing from Blackshear, Georgia, in Pierce County, Stetson Bennett  grew up with a dream and a drive to turn that dream into reality.   As a young quarterback at Pierce County High School, Stetson was able  to accumulate 3,700 passing yards, 500 rushing yards, and 40  touchdowns, along with Class 3A second team all-State honors.   Despite his accomplishments, Stetson was overlooked by many top  football programs, but he never gave up the dream and walked on at the  University of Georgia.   Following his freshman year, he chose to transfer to a junior  college,  [[Page H257]]  where he went 10-2 and won a championship. He returned to the  University of Georgia his junior year and earned a starting role.   This past season, Stetson Bennett spearheaded the Dawgs to their  first college football national championship in 42 years. The dream has  become reality.   Stetson inspires me and will inspire others for many years to come.   Congratulations, and go Dawgs.                            ____________________
