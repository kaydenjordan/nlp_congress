 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my good friend, Captain  Bill Robinson, as Tennessee's Second District Veteran of the Month.   Captain Robinson was born in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina. In 1961  he enlisted in the United States Air Force. He was trained as a  helicopter maintenance technician and worked at Air Force bases in the  United States, South Korea, and Thailand during the Vietnam War.   On September 20, 1965, Captain Robinson's helicopter was shot down  over North Vietnam during a rescue mission. He was captured and taken  as a prisoner of war. During his time in captivity, Captain Robinson  endured inhumane conditions at infamous camps like the Hanoi Hilton and  the Briarpatch. By the time he was released on February 12, 1973,  Captain Robinson had spent 2,703 days as a prisoner of war, making him  the longest-held enlisted prisoner of war in American history.   Captain Robinson credits four faiths for his survival during his 7\1/ 2\ years in captivity: Faith in himself, faith in his fellow prisoners,  faith in his country, and faith in the Lord, Mr. Speaker.   After he returned home, he continued serving in the Air Force until  his retirement on December 1, 1984, to Madisonville, Tennessee.   Since his retirement, Captain Robinson has dedicated his life to  helping his fellow veterans. He is heavily involved in Chapter 1078 of  the Vietnam Veterans of America, which made me an honorary member,  which is now named after him.   Thank you Captain Robinson for your service and your sacrifice. It is  an honor to recognize you on the House floor and call you my friend.                            ____________________
