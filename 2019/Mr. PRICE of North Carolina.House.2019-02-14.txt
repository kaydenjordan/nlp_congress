 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this conference agreement-- bipartisan and bicameral--averting a second reckless Trump shutdown.   This legislation represents the best possible deal to responsibly  fund our government and secure our border, while holding true to our  values as Americans.   This agreement denies the President billions of dollars for an  unnecessary wall. It includes a number of provisions to hold the  administration accountable. And it boosts funding for humanitarian  support for migrants, alternatives to detention, and family case  management.   The bipartisan agreement also includes six additional appropriations  bills beyond Homeland Security. For example, the Transportation-HUD  bill, on which Chairman Diaz-Balart and I worked cooperatively for many  months, is included in this package.   It increases the Trump budget for infrastructure by $23 billion, and  it includes investments that were totally eliminated in the Trump  budget: community development block grants, the HOME program, New  Starts for transit, and the BUILD program. All these are made whole,  having been, of course, eliminated in that earlier Trump budget.   These six bills were all caught up in the Trump shutdown. They are  now salvaged by this agreement. The deal is not perfect. We know that.  But it represents the best way to reject the President's outrageous  border demand, keep our government open, and address our pressing  national needs.   Mr. Speaker, let's send this bill to the President's desk. Then let's  fight to overturn this phony ``national emergency.''
