 Madam Speaker, yesterday's public impeachment hearings  produced some noteworthy facts. Representative  Mike Turner's question  of Ambassador Volker took apart the Democrats' entire case. Volker  confirmed that President Trump never said that Ukraine must investigate  the Bidens in order to receive defense aid from the United States.   Further, Representative Elise Stefanik's questioning of Tim Morrison  showed there was no quid pro quo, no bribery, no extortion, and no  mention of withholding aid in exchange for investigating the Bidens.   Witnesses have repeatedly stated that no quid pro quo, no bribery  took place. These facts, which indeed clear our President, do not  change. Meanwhile, President Trump continues to be denied basic due  process rights.   Democrat leadership continues to put politics before the people  obsessing over impeachment and refusing to work on policies that would  actually benefit the American people: ratifying the USMCA, permanently  extending the 2017 tax cuts for families, and lowering the cost of  prescription drugs.   The people are tired of this Congress spending their tax dollars on a  politically-motivated impeachment charade.                            ____________________
