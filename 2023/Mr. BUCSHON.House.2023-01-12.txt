 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of the Protecting  America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act.   Under the Biden administration, we have seen a continuous assault on  American energy that has killed jobs, increased our dependency on  foreign energy sources, and caused energy costs to soar.   In an attempt to lower energy prices, the administration has sold  millions of barrels of petroleum from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve,  depleting our own supply and helping China to build the world's largest  crude oil reserve.   This must stop. I call on all my colleagues to join me in voting for  this legislation to stop the Secretary of Energy from selling any more  petroleum products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China.
