 Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the leadership of the Armed  Services Committee in the Seapower Subcommittee on both sides of the  aisle to accept this amendment and its important modifications to the  underlying bill provision limiting the availability of funds for prior  fiscal year DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers.   My revised amendment, Mr. Chair, is agreed to by the committee and,  importantly, removes the additional, or third, fiscal year 2016 DDG-51  ship from the provision's proposed requirements.   Additionally, sir, and again, as agreed to by the committee, it  states the sense of Congress that the Navy should bear the majority of  the share-line risk for the fiscal year 2017 DDG-51 Flight III  destroyer contract, which will represent the first ships to integrate  the Air and Missile Defense Radar, which is 30 times more effective and  better than the legacy radar system.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Thornberry and Chairman  Wittman for their support on my important amendment. Bath Iron Works is  a critical national security asset to our country. It is a source of  great pride for all Mainers, and the shipyard employs some 6,000 of our  most talented, hardworking citizens who care greatly about their  contributions every day to keeping America safe and keeping America  strong.
