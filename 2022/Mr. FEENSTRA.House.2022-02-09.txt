 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Turner Syndrome  Awareness Month and my constituent, Nicole Cleveland, for bringing  attention to this little-known disease.   At birth, Nicole was diagnosed with TS and was told she may never  walk.  [[Page H1091]]  She did. Nicole was told that she would never go to college. She did.  She graduated from Morningside University with a degree in political  science and journalism.   But Nicole did not stop there. She went on to be the youngest woman  ever elected to the Sergeant Bluff City Council and will be releasing  her first book this spring called ``The Butterfly Chronicles.''   Now, she commits her time and talent to advocating for the more than  70,000 American women and girls who have TS.   In conjunction with her advocacy, I will soon be introducing a bill,  the Protecting Girls with Turner Syndrome Act, to criminalize the  abortion of any baby diagnosed with TS because my faith teaches me that  every person is created for a purpose, and Nicole was certainly created  as a special one.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Nicole for bringing awareness of TS and sharing  her message of optimism and hope with so many people.                            ____________________
