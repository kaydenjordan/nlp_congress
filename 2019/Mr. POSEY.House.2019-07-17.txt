 Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here today to speak  about the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11.   I can remember sitting in class with the teacher discussing President  John F. Kennedy's speech about going to the Moon at Rice University in  1961, when he committed this country to putting a man on the Moon and  bringing him safely back to Earth within the decade.   He said: Great nations do things, not because they are easy, because  they are hard. And it certainly was hard.   I remember doing the math on my fingers and saying, you know, I am  going to be old enough to be involved in that program. And my goal  became to have my fingerprints on the rocket that took the first man to  the Moon. To make a long story short, 5 years later I was an inspector  working on the third stage of the Apollo rocket, one of the highlights  of my life.  [[Page H5920]]    Americans were united in those days in their zeal for space; the  Apollo Moon landing being the greatest technological advancement in the  history of mankind. Some writers described those times as a Camelot  era, where people respected their President, even if they didn't vote  for them. Not until 9/11 had I seen Americans as united as they were  around the Apollo program.   Space, of course, is important to our national security. It is  important to our economic prosperity. It is important to our  technological advancement.   I ask people how often they benefit from space, and the response  usually averages, 6 percent say they benefit from space once a year; 4  percent say they benefit from space once a month; and only 2 percent  say they benefit from space once a week. And we won't even go to once a  day.   I guess those people have roosters in the backyard that give them  their weather reports. They don't pay any attention to the images we  have from the satellites. I guess they don't use cell phones, or use  credit cards, or even make cash transactions, because those are all  satellite-linked.   Ultimately, space is important to us for the ultimate survival of our  species.   Neil deGrasse Tyson lectured our Science, Space, and Technology  Committee several years ago on the benefits of space. And while he was  here, he gave a lecture for staff and Members over at the Jefferson  Building at the Library of Congress; very well-attended and well-taken.   During his presentation, he mentioned that space is the only thing  Congress really spends money on to truly benefit the next generation,  and I believe that. I believe those are trees that we plant without the  expectation of being around to enjoy all the shade.   I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee for helping keep space a  bipartisan issue. I hope we can build on the legacy of Apollo 11 and  that, some day, our children and their children can come together and  enjoy positive achievements for their generation and generations to  follow.                            ____________________
