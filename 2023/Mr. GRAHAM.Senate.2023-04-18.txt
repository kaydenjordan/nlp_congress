 Reserving the right to object.    I will be very brief. To my colleague and good friend  Senator Schumer, I want to let you know that 99 Senators agree with  what you said about Senator Feinstein. We all hope--I am the ranking  member of the Judiciary. She is a dear friend, and we hope for her  speedy recovery and return back to the Senate.   But with all due respect to my colleague Senator Schumer, this is  about a handful of judges that you can't get the votes for. I have been  a pretty consistent vote in the Committee on the Judiciary in a  bipartisan fashion. I understand you won the election and we lost. I  want to make sure we process judges fairly.   The reason this is being made is to try to change the numbers on the  committee in a way that I think would be harmful to the Senate and to  pass out a handful of judges that I think should never be on the bench.   With that in mind and with all due respect to Senator Feinstein, I  object.
