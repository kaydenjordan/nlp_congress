 Mr. President, I am proud to join with my friend and my  colleague from New Jersey today in urging the Senate to take up and  pass the resolution affirming U.S. recognition of the Armenian  genocide. From 1915 to 1923, the Ottoman Empire carried out a forced  deportation of nearly 2 million Armenians, of whom 1.5 million were  killed. It was an atrocious genocide. That it happened is a reality  that no amount of political doublespeak can cover up.   In fact, the word ``genocide,'' which literally means the killing of  an entire people, was coined by Raphael Lemkin to describe the horrific  nature of the Ottoman Empire's calculated extermination of the  Armenians. That is the genesis of the word ``genocide.''   As America, we must never be silent in response to atrocities. Over  100 years ago, the world sat silently as the Armenian people suffered  and were systemically murdered. Many people today are still unaware of  what happened. With this resolution--a bipartisan resolution--we are  saying it is a policy of the United States to commemorate the Armenian  genocide through official recognition and remembrance.   Let me echo what my colleague from New Jersey just said. Doing so is  not incompatible with continuing to deal with Turkey as an ally. Just  last week, I sat down with President Erdogan and President Trump in the  oval office. Turkey is a NATO ally and an important one, but friends  and allies can speak the truth, and we are not honoring America and who  we stand for if we are afraid to speak the truth and willing to  participate in covering it up. We have a moral duty to acknowledge what  happened to 1.5 million innocent souls. It is the right thing to do,  and it is my hope that the Senate will do so in a bipartisan manner.   I yield back the floor.
