 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, the most important words in our  Constitution are the first three--``We the People''--written in a  beautiful script and written in a font size so that one can see it from  across the room. They set out the mission statement for our  Constitution, for our vision of government--not government of, by, and  for the privileged and the powerful but government of, by, and for the  people, as President Lincoln so eloquently summarized.   It is our responsibility as elected officials to look out for  decisions that serve this mission of government of, by, and for the  people, to fight in times of trouble for policies that provide a ladder  of opportunity and a foundation for families to thrive. But at this  very moment, a secret group of 13 Senators is devising a healthcare  plan with the intention of bringing it to this floor with no public  debate, no committee meeting, and no public notice. They want to just  bring it to the floor, have a few hours of debate, and put it forward,  even though it will affect millions of Americans. It probably will hurt  millions of Americans, but the secret 13 want to craft this policy. And  why in secret? Because they are plotting a plan that will hurt so many  people, they don't want the public involved in the process. They don't  want to hear from the citizens from rural America or urban America who  are so concerned about the TrumpCare bill--the bill that will  immediately destroy healthcare for 14 million Americans; the bill that  will immediately undermine the solvency and success of our rural  healthcare clinics and our rural hospitals; the bill that breaks every  promise the President put forward on healthcare.   It breaks the promise that every person will be covered, breaks the  promise that people with preexisting connections will get the same  price as everyone else, breaks the promise that the  [[Page S3308]]  policies will be even better, higher quality. Instead, it guts the  essential benefits. It breaks the promise that the insurance will be at  a lower cost. In fact, for someone roughly 64 years of age earning  about $26,500, their healthcare bill would go from $140 a month to  $1,200 a month--a sum that is clearly impossible to pay on an annual  income of $26,500. That is why it is being done in secret--because it  involves broken promise after broken promise, destroying healthcare in  every town and hamlet across America.   That is quite a contrast to the way ObamaCare was forged. ObamaCare  had a yearlong debate. It proceeded to be in committee markup--that  means with amendments being offered--in the HELP Committee for about 5  weeks, with television cameras rolling and 150 Republican amendments  accepted during that process. Then the Finance Committee had its turn,  and it had a very long markup, and it had dozens and dozens, if not 100  or more, Republican amendments adopted. The debate was all over the  country. It was in the newspapers. It was in every forum. It was right  there, square center, nothing hidden. But this is quite different. The  majority leader today has started the rule XIV process, specifically  intending to bypass those Senate committees and bring the TrumpCare  bill to the Senate floor, completely bypassing government of, by, and  for the people.   This is unacceptable. I think my colleagues know it is unacceptable,  but they are hoping to do it so quickly and so fast that they will have  a minimum of criticism across the country. There should be a maximum  amount of criticism on the floor of the Senate. Every Senator who  believes that this democracy--this democratic Republic--is one in which  we do the people's work should see the light of day. The debate should  see the light of day in the forging of the bill, as well as the final  debate here on the floor.   We know another reason this bill--this replacement or addition or  modification of the House bill--is being crafted in secret. That is  because the very premise of it is to give a massive tax break to the  wealthiest Americans, another promise broken in which Trump said that  this would not be done. But there it is, TrumpCare out of the House,  $600 billion given away to the richest Americans while devastating  healthcare for working Americans.   Has no one noticed that we have an incredible gap in income in this  country, with massive numbers of people earning very little and a few  at the top earning massive amounts? Has no one noticed that we have a  huge wealth gap in this Nation, with those at the bottom having few, if  any, savings and those at the top having billions upon billions? If we  have noticed, then we should care that that is not a foundation for  families to thrive. Indeed, it is something that is only made much  worse in a bill that takes away the foundation of healthcare-- essentially, the quality of life for families across America--and, in  turn, takes the savings and gives it to the wealthiest families.   There is a reason to hide this bill. There are a lot of reasons to  hide this bill. But it is undemocratic to have this secret group  developing this bill with an intention to bring it to the floor without  a committee hearing, without public exposure.   Folks back home are very worried, and I would like to share a few of  their stories.   Lynda of Talent, OR, who survived her battle with stomach cancer,  thanks to the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion--Lynda's friend  wrote to share her story. Lynda was a self-employed plumber, working  hard to get her business off the ground, but she was diagnosed with  stage IV stomach cancer. Lynda couldn't afford insurance, and she and  her husband couldn't afford to pay for treatment out of pocket because  they were already paying off enormous debt from care her husband had  received.   So what did Lynda do? She ignored the symptoms. She tried to go about  her life as best as she could. As her friend wrote, ``She would have  died rather than take on more debt that she was not sure she could  pay.'' But that changed with the Affordable Care Act the day Lynda  found out she would receive coverage under the Oregon Health Plan-- Oregon's Medicaid expansion.   Now there is good news to share. Lynda received treatment. She has  been cancer-free for almost a year, and her friend describes this as  ``nothing short of a miracle.'' ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act,  delivered a miracle to an individual who was planning just to die  rather than get treatment and then could get treatment, thanks to  Medicaid expansion, and is now in remission.   TrumpCare is being reworked in secret by 13 of my colleagues out of  public sight. It wants to strip away that expansion of Medicaid, wants  to rip away the chance for people like Lynda to receive lifesaving  care.   Yvonne from Elmira, OR, sent a note to us about the high-risk pools  that Republicans want to institute under TrumpCare. She says:         Before the ACA existed, I was in our state's high risk pool       because no company would insure me because I had Asthma and       had an ovary removed because of cysts.        The $1500 deductible and $550 per month was hard to pay and       then it only covered 70%.        When I was severely injured in an accident and required       reconstructive surgery I ended up bankrupt.    But then, 2 years ago, she qualified for the Oregon Health Plan. Now  Yvonne has her medical needs covered at an affordable price and can't  be denied coverage or charged a higher premium because of her  preexisting conditions. Yvonne, like so many others, would suffer under  the Republican plan to strip away the protection for preexisting  conditions. She has had an accident, she has had an ovary removed, she  has had asthma. It would be extraordinarily difficult for her to get  insurance without the protection of everyone being in the same  healthcare pool together. If she could get insurance--which is not at  all clear--it would be at sky-high, unaffordable prices.    Bernard from Portland wrote to us. He said that an important thing  that often gets lost in this whole debate over the future of the  Affordable Care Act is the support it gives for Americans to innovate.   In 2011, Bernard in Portland chose to leave his job and pursue his  passion of becoming a freelance artist. Here is what he said, in his  words:         With my departure, I left behind the security of medical       coverage. For two years, I was not covered by medical       insurance, and fortunately nothing happened, but that is a       gamble nobody should have to take. And it's a gamble that I       could take being under 40 years old, and in relatively good       health.        A person should not have to stay in a job they may not even       like, and could be better filled by someone else, just for       fear of not having medical coverage.    He is right. One of the powerful things that has occurred under  ObamaCare is that individuals worked for firms and wanted to become  entrepreneurs but were afraid to do so because of the loss of  healthcare coverage, but now, either through the expansion of Medicaid  or through the exchanges, they can acquire insurance without being part  of a large company. That has unleashed entrepreneurship across the  country. People are pursuing their dreams and contributing to the  economy in all kinds of ways because they can now access healthcare  without being part of a company that provides healthcare.   Eventually, Bernard was able to afford a basic coverage plan. But it  didn't provide much, and it cost a significant portion of his income,  but it all changed with the ACA.   An October 2016 survey of American small businesses and a January  2017 followup survey found that one-third of 5,400 small business  owners interviewed had the confidence to start their own businesses  because they had access to healthcare through the ACA. According to the  Department of Labor, between 2013 when the ACA went into effect and the  end of 2015, the number of self-employed Americans increased by 3.5  percent.   These are just different ways of noting what we hear about all the  time--people launching their entrepreneurial efforts, launching their  companies because of the confidence they have that they can get  healthcare. That is the powerful unleashing of creativity. It is an  economic engine. It is a small business driver.   Lisa from Phoenix also wrote to share her powerful story. Lisa's  daughter suffers from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, so Lisa has stayed  home and  [[Page S3309]]  cared for her for the last 15 years while her husband worked. Now,  thanks to ACA's Medicaid expansion, her family has been able to hire  in-home help and it has been transformative.   Lisa's daughter has become more connected to the community, gained  new skills and independence, is contributing to household chores, and  has shown a great deal more vitality and engagement since the family  was able to get some assistance. It has gotten to the point where Lisa  can start thinking about her own needs a bit more. In fact, for the  first time in quite a while, she is considering taking on a job outside  her home to help provide more income.   The ACA isn't just saving lives in emergency health situations or by  addressing diseases. It is improving the quality of life for millions  of American families like Lisa's.   I will share one more constituent story today. It is hard to pick  just one more because there are so many stories coming in each and  every day. As we continue to talk about the assault on the health and  peace of mind of millions of Americans, I will be coming back to the  floor to share those stories coming in from other Oregonians. But this  last story comes from Warren in Tigard, OR.   Warren and his wife Joyce have been happily married for over 60  years, but in the last few years, Joyce has been suffering from  Alzheimer's. Joyce's disease has progressed very far. Among other  things, she has lost her mobility, much of her cognition, and she is  wheelchair bound. Her condition has progressed so far that Warren and  the home caregivers who were helping him care for his wife just  couldn't meet the need requirements any longer, so they admitted Joyce  to a nearby adult care facility, where she is now secure, stable, and  comfortable. But, as we know, the kind of care Joyce is receiving is  expensive. Warren writes:         This care costs $4,000 per month. Our long-term care       insurance is currently covering most of this cost, but only       about 4 months' worth of insurance coverage remains. So we       will have to obtain Medicaid coverage for her continued care.        But proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act could       jeopardize this coverage. I have not anticipated this       disastrous change, but fear it would be a tragedy for both of       us.    Yes, it would be a tragedy for Warren and for Joyce to have TrumpCare  pass and dismantle Medicaid and dismantle the exchanges. It would be a  tragedy for so many others in similar situations across the country.   Many people don't realize that Medicaid helps pay for nursing home  care for more than half of the nursing home residents--residents like  Joyce. But here is TrumpCare, planning to cut $880 billion in direct  Medicaid spending. It is basically: Well, too bad Warren and too bad  Joyce. We want to save some money so we can give big tax breaks to the  wealthiest Americans.   I must say, there is not a lot of caring in that perspective. It  embodies a principle, but is it really the principle we want in the  United States of America--the principle that the goal of the majority  party is to take away from those who have little to give more to those  who have most? Is that really the principle my Republican colleagues  want to embrace on the floor of the Senate?   Is that really the principle the secret 13 with their secret meetings  out of public sight to develop a new version of TrumpCare want to  embrace? I would suggest that is simply wrong. It is wrong from the  point of view of providing an opportunity for all Americans to thrive.  It is wrong from a moral point of view to pull healthcare--and the  peace of mind that comes with healthcare--out of the hands of  struggling Americans and working Americans across our country.   Finally, I want to address one more issue. We heard earlier today  that Anthem is pulling out of Ohio. Why are they pulling out? Because  of President Trump. Why is that connected? Because he refuses to  confirm that his administration will make the cost-sharing reduction  payments that have been part of the Affordable Care Act. Those payments  reduce the premiums. Those payments proceed also to reduce the level of  deductibles so you get more care sooner. So insurance companies don't  know whether to raise their insurance policy a little or a tremendous  amount, and that instability means they simply can't price their  policies.   In addition, my Republican colleagues have assaulted the risk  quarters, or reinsurance programs, that make it possible for an  insurance company to go into a new market and know that if they get a  disproportionate share of sick patients, they will get compensated for  that risk and that result. So that reinsurance is essential for more  companies to be in a particular market.   Moreover, the administration proceeded to not spend the money on  advertising in the last stage of signups and reduced the number of  people who were in the markets. So that is another assault on the  stability of health insurance in America. This is a deliberate,  straight-out effort to undermine healthcare in America to the  disadvantage of millions of Americans. It is being done by the  President without any action even happening on TrumpCare here in the  Senate. It is wrong. It is hurting a lot of people, and the President  should stop.   With that, I conclude my comments.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague Senator  Wyden for submitting this resolution. I am proud to partner with him as  we address this senseless, deadly attack that occurred back home in  Oregon just 12 days ago.   Robert Kennedy once said: ``We must recognize that this short life  can neither be ennobled or enriched by hatred.'' We have been reminded  of that in this part of our history in the last year and a half in  which we have seen acts of hatred flourishing across the country,  preying on divisions among parts of our society. It is incumbent on all  of us to call out the unacceptability of hate speech and certainly to  work to bring unity where there has been division.   This all came together in dramatic, deadly fashion on the MAX train  when a man spouting hatred and anti-Muslim rhetoric accosted two young  women sitting on the train. Three men stood up and sprang into action  and told him that was unacceptable.   I wish we could turn back the clock and have the incident stop right  there with that intervention. These men, by being willing to stand up  in that setting, are champions of justice. They were saying that this  is unacceptable. They were saying that it must stop. But then this  confrontation turned deadly, with the man spouting the hate speech  pulling a knife, stabbing all three of these champions, killing two of  them, and nearly killing the third. These individuals, Rick Best and  Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, paid with their lives. The third  individual, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, came very close to losing his as  well.   We have been holding the families in our hearts and in our prayers.  The community came together and had a vigil and another ceremony at the  Muslim educational center and at the funerals to let the families know  that, across Oregon, people are carrying them in their hearts and  prayers. Certainly, one of those prayers was for the full recovery of  Micah David-Cole Fletcher. He is back on his feet, and it is just a  beautiful thing to see that he is out of the hospital. He spoke very  eloquent words that I would like to share with you. In the days after  the attack, he said:         I want you to imagine that for a second, being the little       girl on that MAX. This man is screaming at you. His face is a       pile of knives, his body is a gun, everything about him is       cocked, loaded and ready to kill you. There's a history here       with this. You can feel that this has happened before. And       the only thing that was different was the names and faces.    Micah continued. He said:         And then a stranger, two strangers, three strangers, come       to your aid, they try to help you, and that pile of knives       just throws itself at them. Kills them.    Well, this was an extraordinarily traumatic experience for these  young girls simply to be accosted on the train and all the more so to  see that those who came to their rescue were stabbed, with two of them  dying and the third badly injured.   Our hearts are, again, so connected to the families. We must have a  determination as a society to put healing where there has been  division, to put empathy where there has been antipathy, to replace  hatred with a connection, with a love.   Robert Kennedy said in that same speech when he was commenting on the  fact that nothing has ever been ennobled or enriched by hatred--he  continued to say this:         But we can perhaps remember--if only for a time--that those       who live with us are our brothers, that they share with us       the same short moment of life, that they seek--as do we--      nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose and       in happiness, winning what satisfaction and fulfillment that       they can.    Can't we come together as a society and enable each person to be able  to live out their lives in purpose and happiness and set aside this  divisiveness and this hatred?   I hope on this occasion, as we honor the incredible heroism of the  three men who sprang into action and as we mourn the loss of two of  them, that we all will dedicate ourselves to this purpose of creating a  connection, creating unity, and creating respect and that we shall see  the banishment of hate speech and hate violence.   Thank you, Mr. President.
