 Mr. Speaker, February is Career and  Technical Education Month. As co-chair of the bipartisan Career and  Technical Education Caucus, and a senior member of the Education and  Labor Committee, I have long been aware of the importance of CTE  programs that provides learners of all ages with career-ready skills.   From agriculture to the arts, from marketing to manufacturing, CTE  programs work to develop America's most valuable resource: its people.   Together with my friend and colleague, Congressman   Jim Langevin,  co-chairman of the Career and Technical Education Caucus, we introduced  a resolution officially designating February as CTE month. I encourage  all of my colleagues to sign on as cosponsors because CTE truly  benefits all Americans.   CTE is taught in a range of settings: from high school and area  technical centers, to technical and 2-year community colleges. Millions  of high school and college students are enrolled in CTE programs across  the Nation, bringing CTE to every community in the country.   Fortunately, in July 2018, President Trump signed into law the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.  I authored this bill with Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi and it  aims to close the skills gap by modernizing Federal investment in CTE  programs, and connecting educators with industry stakeholders.   It marks the first major overhaul to the Carl D. Perkins Career and  Technical Education Act since 2006. The Perkins Act is important for  educational institutions as well as local businesses. Small business  owners rely upon Perkins programs to increase the number of skilled  candidates in emerging sectors. Future workers in fields such as  manufacturing, information technology, healthcare, and agriculture also  rely on career and technical education programs to obtain the skills  necessary for high-skill, high-wage, family-sustaining jobs and  careers.   Essentially, Mr. Speaker, we are providing the education and tools to  equip a 21st century workforce for this Nation. For students who pursue  a career in technical education, it isn't some kind of plan B option.  CTE has established itself as a path that many high-achieving students  choose in pursuit of industry certification and hands-on skills that  they can use right away out of high school in skills-based education  programs or in college.   By modernizing the Federal investment in CTE programs, we can connect  more educators with industry stakeholders and close the skills gap in  this country. There are good jobs out there, but people need to be  qualified to get them. A career in technical education is a pathway  forward for each and every one of these people.   CTE gives people from all walks of life an opportunity to succeed.  During CTE month, we celebrate the achievements of students and spread  awareness that there is no one-size-fits-all plan for success in life.  I thank Congressman Langevin for his dedication to this issue, and urge  all of my colleagues to support this important resolution.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, yesterday marked the 10th  anniversary of the flight 3407 crash that went down outside of Buffalo,  New York, resulting in the untimely deaths of 49 people. I rise today  with a heavy heart as we commemorate this tragedy.   A decade has gone by, but for families who lost loved ones, the pain  will live with them forever. These individuals have suffered an  unspeakable loss, yet so many of them have traveled to Washington  numerous times over the past 10 years to advocate for improved airline  safety.   They advocate for regional flights to operate under the same  standards as major airlines and to ensure that the tragedy of flight  3407 is never repeated. They advocate in memory of their loved ones  whose lives were cut short.   Nothing can bring back their loved ones, but the standards  implemented, thanks to their advocacy, have saved lives, and for that  we are grateful.                            ____________________
