 Madam Speaker, 2 years ago, on July 23, the Carr fire  broke out in Shasta County, California, near the city of Redding. For  over a month, the Carr fire burned nearly 230,000 acres and 1,600  structures. Tragically, it claimed eight lives.   In the 2 years since this fire, people in northern California have  proven to be resilient in the face of this adversity.   We continue the recovery process, but for those impacted, it is  difficult to make them whole again.   The Carr fire, caused by a wheel sparking against the asphalt from a  flat tire, is a sobering reminder that fires are preventable.   So I have introduced the CARR Act, which allows us to clear  vegetation sources of ignition within 150 feet of rural roads.   Better management of our vegetation and our forests near power lines  and roads and elsewhere on our public lands would prevent much human- caused wildfire.   As we remember the Carr fire victims, I will continue to advocate for  better fire prevention to prevent further disasters.                            ____________________
