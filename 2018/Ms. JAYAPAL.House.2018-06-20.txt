 Madam Speaker, 10 days ago, I visited a Federal prison  south of Seattle that holds 174 women. I met with all of those women.  They are seeking asylum. One woman had three children. The first child  was shot and murdered by gangs. The second child was shot and paralyzed  by gangs, and the third child was the child she tried to bring here to  safety.   These are the stories of the people who are coming across the border.  All of the mothers and the 174 people who were at the Federal prison  had not even been able to say good-bye to their children. They did not  know where their children were. They had been subjected to the worst  conditions at the border.   Madam Speaker, what is this country coming to? This is a country that  should value our children, that should value the rights of our  children; and these children are sitting in cages on the border in tent  cities.   This President created this crisis, and this President can stop this  crisis right now with a phone call. Do not tell us it is about  Congress. It is about the President of the United States who has chosen  to take this democracy to its very bottom.   This is the bottom. This is abuse. It is a human rights violation,  and we must end it. He must end it.
