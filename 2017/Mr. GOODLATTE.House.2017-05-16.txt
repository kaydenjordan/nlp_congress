 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 510) to establish a system for integration of Rapid DNA  instruments for use by law enforcement to reduce violent crime and  reduce the current DNA analysis backlog.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 510         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rapid DNA Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. RAPID DNA INSTRUMENTS.         (a) Standards.--Section 210303(a) of the DNA Identification       Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14131(a)) is amended by adding at the       end the following:        ``(5)(A) In addition to issuing standards as provided in       paragraphs (1) through (4), the Director of the Federal       Bureau of Investigation shall issue standards and procedures       for the use of Rapid DNA instruments and resulting DNA       analyses.        ``(B) In this Act, the term `Rapid DNA instruments' means       instrumentation that carries out a fully automated process to       derive a DNA analysis from a DNA sample.''.        (b) Index.--Paragraph (2) of section 210304(b) of the DNA       Identification Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14132(b)(2)) is amended       to read as follows:        ``(2) prepared by--        ``(A) laboratories that--        ``(i) have been accredited by a nonprofit professional       association of persons actively involved in forensic science       that is nationally recognized within the forensic science       community; and        ``(ii) undergo external audits, not less than once every 2       years, that demonstrate compliance with standards established       by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; or        ``(B) criminal justice agencies using Rapid DNA instruments       approved by the Director of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation in compliance with the standards and procedures       issued by the Director under section 210303(a)(5); and''.       SEC. 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS RELATING TO COLLECTION OF DNA                     IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION.         (a) From Certain Federal Offenders.--Section 3 of the DNA       Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14135a)       is amended--        (1) in subsection (b), by adding at the end the following:       ``The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation may       waive the requirements under this subsection if DNA samples       are analyzed by means of Rapid DNA instruments and the       results are included in CODIS.''; and        (2) in subsection (c), by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) The term `Rapid DNA instruments' means       instrumentation that carries out a fully automated process to       derive a DNA analysis from a DNA sample.''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 510, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The House of Representatives works on many important issues, but few  are more important than making sure that innocent arrestees are  promptly released and that culpable suspects are not released to strike  again.   Rapid DNA technology has the potential to do both of those things  and, as such, can be an important tool for law enforcement and a key  component of this body's ongoing efforts on criminal justice reform.   I applaud the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) for  reintroducing H.R. 510, the Rapid DNA Act of 2017, in this session of  Congress.   With Rapid DNA technology, it is possible to test the DNA of  arrestees as soon as they are in custody and determine within hours  whether they match the DNA profile from a crime scene or from other  earlier crimes.   This technology would also enable police to check the Federal DNA  database to see if an arrestee matches the DNA profile from previous  crimes for which a DNA sample exists but no known suspect has been  identified.   Rather than waiting weeks for a DNA sample to be processed and risk  releasing a suspect back into the public to potentially reoffend,  creating new victims, police will be able to determine at initial  booking if the suspect is a person of interest in other crimes.   This bill will provide important tools for law enforcement. For  instance, it will inform decisions about pretrial release or detention  and their conditions. It will solve and prevent all crimes, including  violent crimes. By freeing up forensic analysts, it will prevent DNA  analysis backlogs.   I believe this is necessary, responsible legislation that will aid  law enforcement and protect American citizens by keeping offenders off  the streets. I again thank Congressman Sensenbrenner for sponsoring  this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), the former chairman  of the House Judiciary Committee and the chief author of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I don't have any additional speakers, and  I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. It is a bipartisan  bill. I thank Members on both sides of the aisle for their  contributions to this effort. I again commend the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) for reintroducing this bill. I urge my  colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1616) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  authorize the National Computer Forensics Institute, and for other  purposes, as amended.  [[Page H4206]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1616         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101 et       seq.) is amended by inserting after the item relating to       section 821 the following new item:  ``Sec. 822. National Computer Forensics Institute.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1616, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the National Computer Forensics Institute serves a vital  purpose in preparing State and local law enforcement to combat computer  and cybercrime.   Last Congress, the House passed this legislation by voice vote under  suspension of the rules. I am pleased to support this legislation once  again, and I am confident that this bill will once again receive  bipartisan support.   The United States Department of Justice has declared that cybercrime  is one of the greatest threats facing our country and that it has  enormous implications for our national security, economic prosperity,  and public safety. We have seen this just in the past few days after  cyber vulnerabilities led to widespread computer disruptions around the  world.   With this in mind, the National Computer Forensics Institute serves  the vital purpose of providing legal and judicial professionals a free,  comprehensive education on current cybercrime trends, investigative  methods, and prosecutorial and judicial challenges.   The National Computer Forensics Institute is a 32,000-square-foot  facility located in Hoover, Alabama. The institute boasts three  multipurpose classrooms, two network investigations classrooms, a mock  courtroom, and a forensics lab.   The special agents of the United States Secret Service staff the  institute and work diligently training attendees in modern counter- cybercrime procedures and evidence collection.   When the attendees leave, they take with them the critical knowledge  and equipment required to conduct autonomous and thorough cybercrime  investigations at their home agencies.   Since its creation in 2008, the institute has earned praise for its  work in preparing America's local law enforcement in how to deal with  these important technology issues.   Over the last 7 years, the institute has instructed law enforcement  professionals from every State in the country and from over 500  different law enforcement agencies.   In fact, law enforcement in my own district has benefited from NCFI  training, including Lynchburg Commonwealth Attorney Mike Doucette and  his staff.   Each professional educated at the institute is a force multiplier for  the Secret Service. The institute itself is a force multiplier for  other law enforcement cyber forensic efforts, complementing vital  training offered by entities like the National White Collar Crime  Center, otherwise known as NW3C. After successful completion of the  NCFI and the NW3C programs, the students can bring their new knowledge  back to their local agency to inform their colleagues how to properly  conduct computer forensic investigations.   Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that for our Nation to successfully  combat the cybercrime threat, we must support legislation such as H.R.  1616.   I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe), a member of  the Judiciary Committee, for sponsoring this important legislation.   Authorizing the existing National Computer Forensics Institute in  Federal law will cement its position as a high-tech cybercrime training  facility and will help law enforcement professionals nationwide in  their efforts to combat cyber-related crimes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                       Washington, DC, May 15, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: I write concerning H.R. 1616, the       ``Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of       2017''. This legislation includes matters that fall within       the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland       Security.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1616, the       Committee on Homeland Security agrees to forgo action on this       bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual       understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill would       not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment       of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation       that fall within the Committee on Homeland Security's Rule X       jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members       of the Committee to any conference committee named to       consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the       Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on       the House floor.

[[Page H4207]]                                          ____                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                       Washington, DC, May 15, 2017.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1616, the ``Strengthening State       and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act,'' so that the bill may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 1616 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.        Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, at this time I am pleased to yield as  much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Ratcliffe), the chief sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this good  legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1892) to amend title 4, United States Code, to provide for  the flying of the flag at half-staff in the event of the death of a  first responder in the line of duty.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1892         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Honoring Hometown Heroes       Act''.       SEC. 2. PERMITTING THE FLAG TO BE FLOWN AT HALF-STAFF IN THE                     EVENT OF THE DEATH OF A FIRST RESPONDER SERVING                     IN THE LINE OF DUTY.         (a) Amendment.--The sixth sentence of section 7(m) of title       4, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking ``or'' after ``possession of the United       States'' and inserting a comma;        (2) by inserting ``or the death of a first responder       working in any State, territory, or possession who dies while       serving in the line of duty,'' after ``while serving on       active duty,'';        (3) by striking ``and'' after ``former officials of the       District of Columbia'' and inserting a comma; and        (4) by inserting before the period the following: ``, and       first responders working in the District of Columbia''.        (b) First Responder Defined.--Such subsection is further       amended--        (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``, United States Code;       and'' and inserting a semicolon;        (2) in paragraph (3), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(4) the term `first responder' means a `public safety       officer' as defined in section 1204 of the Omnibus Crime       Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796b).''.        (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this Act shall       apply with respect to deaths of first responders occurring on       or after the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1892, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   On June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed a resolution  establishing an official flag for the new American Nation. The  resolution, now known as the Flag Act of 1777, stated that the flag  would be ``thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be  thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new  Constellation.''   For the last 240 years, the American people have celebrated Flag Day  every June 14, and, over that time, the flag has evolved. As we all  know, changes have been made to its design, shape, and arrangement. The  Flag Act of 1794 changed the design from 13 to 15 stars to accommodate  the admission of Vermont and Kentucky into the Union. The Flag Act of  1818 mandated that the 13 stripes represented the Thirteen Original  Colonies, the number of stars matched the number of States, and  provided that subsequent changes in the number of stars would be made  on the 4th of July.   What has remained rock solid over that quarter millennium, however,  is what our flag represents. It represents one nation, freedom, and  justice for all, and the sacrifices made in pursuit of those core  American values.  [[Page H4209]]    Current law provides guidance for displaying and handling the flag so  it is afforded the respect it deserves and has earned. In abiding by  these guidelines, we all commemorate the value and love we hold for  what our flag represents. That is why the legislation before us today,  H.R. 1892, the Honoring Hometown Heroes Act, is not only appropriate  but necessary.   This bill amends Federal law to permit State and Territorial  Governors and the Mayor of Washington, D.C., to order that the flag be  flown at halfstaff in the event that a public safety officer dies in  the line of duty. For purposes of this legislation, ``public safety  officers'' include local police officers, firefighters, and EMS  professionals. These are individuals who make great sacrifices so we  all can live in a free country. These men and women work long hours,  separated from their loved ones, and consistently place themselves in  harm's way so we as Americans can enjoy our freedom and our way of  life. These sacrifices often go unappreciated.   When an officer dies in the line of duty, he or she is making the  ultimate sacrifice for their community, their family, and for their  country. H.R. 1892 allows the American people to show their  appreciation to these men and women, who are truly the bulwark between  order and chaos. They represent the values the Founders held so dear  nearly 250 years ago, and their sacrifices must be publicly  acknowledged so they are not taken for granted.   I thank the lead sponsor of this bill, Congressman John Larson. On  May 3, the House Committee on the Judiciary approved the Honoring  Hometown Heroes Act with unanimous, bipartisan support. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation and the other bills before the  House today to honor the men and women who have made the ultimate  sacrifice to ensure the safety of our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1428) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets  Act of 1968 to authorize COPS grantees to use grant funds to hire  veterans as career law enforcement officers, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1428         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``American Law Enforcement       Heroes Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. PRIORITIZING HIRING AND TRAINING OF VETERANS.         Section 1701(b)(2) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control       and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd(b)(2)) is       amended by inserting ``, including by prioritizing the hiring       and training of veterans (as defined in section 101 of title       38, United States Code)'' after ``Nation''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1428, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Police officers and military veterans have much in common: Both wear  uniforms, both protect and serve, and both face great physical risk in  executing their duties. It is understandable, then, that many military  servicemen and -women seek employment as police officers upon returning  to civilian life.   Similarly, police departments are seeking men and women who are  physically and mentally fit to assume these roles, who are used to  working in teams, and who have experience making quick decisions under  stress. To a police department, a military veteran may be a perfect  fit.   In recent years, we have strived for community-oriented approaches to  policing. A community-oriented approach requires officers not just to  enforce laws, but to wear many other hats, like first aid provider,  social worker, counselor, crisis manager, and peacemaker. If there is a  problem, we expect the police to solve it. The knowledge, skill, and  abilities military veterans bring to police departments enhance the  departments' problem-solving mission.   H.R. 1428, the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act of 2017, is good  legislation introduced by our colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Hurd). The bill authorizes grantees who receive grants under the  Community Oriented Policing Services program at the Department of  Justice, commonly known as COPS, to use them for prioritizing the  hiring and training of military veterans.   When military veterans return from deployment and enter civilian  life, it is important we recognize their sacrifices by assuring they  can obtain employment and support their families. This bill helps to  ensure veterans can do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hurd for introducing this legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as  he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd), the chief author  of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I again commend the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Hurd) for his thoughtful legislation and his outstanding  leadership on this issue. This is good legislation that will help young  military men and women find employment in law enforcement where they  can provide great continued service to our country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
