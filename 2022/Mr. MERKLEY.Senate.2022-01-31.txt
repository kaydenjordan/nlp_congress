 Mr. President, when freedom and democracy are  threatened, we have a responsibility in this body of the U.S. Senate to  speak up and speak out. It doesn't matter if it is a challenge here at  home or if it is happening somewhere else around the globe; we cannot  remain silent.   For the past year, Burma has been descending into chaos, violence,  and authoritarian military rule. So I have come to the floor here  tonight, the anniversary of the Burmese military's illegal coup  overthrowing the nation's democratically elected government, to call on  all of my colleagues to join me in passing S. Res. 35, a resolution  condemning this desecration of democracy in Burma and a year of  atrocities that have followed, and urging our allies around the world  to join us in doing so.   I also urge this body to pass the BURMA Act, which will give  President Biden the tools he needs to apply pressure to try to reverse  this coup and help restore democracy.   For those who are not aware of the situation in Burma, a year ago,  the  [[Page S403]]  people of Burma took to the streets. They engaged in general strikes to  peacefully protest the military's overthrow of their fledgling  democracy. One woman who was part of the General Strike Committee--one  of the main groups behind the protests--said she was participating  because ``I have a little girl. She's one . . . I don't want her to  grow up under a dictatorship like I did.''   Before taking to the streets, she told her husband: ``Take care of  our baby and move on with life if I get arrested or die in this  movement.''   And she finished by saying: ``We will finish this revolution on our  own and not hand it over to our children.''   Early last year, the country's Parliament was expected to sign off on  the recent national elections in which the leading civilian party, the  National League for Democracy, and its head, Aung San Suu Kyi, had won  more than 80 percent of the seats that were available.   The Burmese military was never under civilian control, and it wasn't  happy with these overwhelming results--these results for the National  League for Democracy. They had been deluded into thinking and believing  that the people of Burma supported their military policies, and so they  would support a strong military role in Parliament, which the people of  Burma did not.   Thus, the military leaders refused to recognize the outcome of the  election. They tried to have the country's supreme court throw out the  results as fraudulent. And when that didn't work, they declared a  national emergency and surrounded Parliament with soldiers.   Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian leaders were arrested, the  nation's infrastructure was seized by the military, and, almost  overnight, Burma's decade-long experiment with democracy, as imperfect  as it was, was thrown out the window, and the kind of brutal military  rule that had governed the country for roughly half a century was  reinstated.   The initial reaction from the new military junta seemed restrained.  The protests were allowed to go on peacefully, but only for a little  while. The restraint didn't last long.   The military leaders who had been leading a brutal, yearlong genocide  against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority turned to violence. They  turned to violence, as they had done in 1988 and as they had done in  2007, to crush the protests.   One local filmmaker in Yangon, who took it upon himself to document  the protests, said that at one protest in late February, ``about 100  people marched towards us quickly. I don't know if they were police or  they were soldiers. Without warning, they started shooting at us with  sound bombs, [with] bullets and [with] gas bombs.''   Since then, the military's violence has escalated. They have fired  rocket launchers, burned down homes, launched airstrikes, cut off food  supplies to starve entire communities, and shot at unarmed civilians as  they fled.    Just last week, there was a report that members of the military went  to one village looking for two specific individuals, one of whom was  disabled. After shooting and killing these two individuals, they set  fire to the entire village.   According to one organization monitoring the situation, nearly 1,500  Burmese citizens have been killed since this coup began a year ago;  another 12,000 arrested; with warrants issued--often death warrants  issued in absentia--for another 2,000 or so. Those are just the numbers  that can be verified, and who knows what the total amount is.   For the Rohingya people, a Muslim population in a largely Buddhist  country, the situation has only grown worse. They have been the target  of military oppression and genocide. Hundreds of thousands have fled  across the border. But the military has continued to crack down even  more on the Rohingya population in Rakhine State--a state I visited a  few years ago, leading a delegation of Senators and House Members,  after the horrific genocide, when some 700,000 people fled, villages  were fire-bombed from the air, and helicopters carrying soldiers shot  from the air. On the ground, babies were killed in front of their  parents, wives were killed in front of their husbands, husbands were  killed in front of their wives, and women were raped. It was one of the  most horrific genocides in hundreds of villages that occurred at that  moment.   But the military now, in spite of all that happened then, is enacting  new draconian restrictions on freedom of movement of the Rohingya that  remain in Rakhine State. They have engaged in continuous intimidation  efforts. They have warned of the dangers of collaborating with rogue  groups resisting the military's authority.   Colleagues, the Senate cannot stay quiet in the denial of freedom and  the presence of massive human rights violations in Burma. America  cannot stay silent in the face of such atrocities. The world must not  stay silent in the face of genocide being carried out against any group  of human beings.   We must make it undeniably clear to any government around the world  that when you systematically persecute your people; when you deny their  human rights; when you murder innocent men, women, and children; when  you burn down their homes and their communities; when you starve them  of food, deny them the opportunity to earn a living or even travel to  the next community to see a doctor, there are consequences; that a  community of nations will not stand by idly as you commit these  horrendous acts; and that we in the Senate will not sit by and fail to  give voice about these atrocities.   So for the sake of all the Burmese people who have lost their lives  in this coup, for the sake of all those striving to restore democracy,  let us pass S. Res. 35, and let us do it this week--``A resolution  condemning the military coup that took place on February 1, 2021, in  Burma and the Burmese military's detention of civilian leaders, calling  for an immediate and unconditional release of all those detained and  for those elected to serve in parliament to resume their duties without  impediment.''   Let's pass that resolution, and let's do it this week, the 1-year  anniversary of the coup. And let us work with our allies around the  globe to restore freedom in Burma and hold the perpetrators of these  atrocities accountable for the crimes that they have committed.
