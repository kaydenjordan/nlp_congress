 Madam Speaker, this past Saturday, I was proud to  attend the Eagle Scout Court of Honor for Thomas Scott Jefferson in  Whitesboro, south Jersey. TJ is a member of Whitesboro Troop 104.   TJ not only was an exemplary student, maintaining a 4.0 GPA  throughout high school, but he was also a committed volunteer at CCWI,  a homework club, among other after-school activities.   He is currently studying classical performance voice at William  Paterson University. He has an avid love for the arts, performing and  starring in numerous plays, operas, and choirs.   TJ has become recognized for his singing voice, and he has continued  to perform not only across the region but even training on Broadway in  New York City.   We are so proud of you, TJ. I look forward to big things from you. I  am confident you will live up to the name ``Thomas Jefferson.''   Congratulations to you and to your family. Some people look to sports  or movie stars or, heaven forbid, politicians as role models. But it is  individuals like you that inspire me.   You are one of my heroes. I know your future is bright, and may God  bless you.                            ____________________
