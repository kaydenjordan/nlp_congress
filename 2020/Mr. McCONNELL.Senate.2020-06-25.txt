 Madam President, the American people have been asked  to swallow a number of contradictions over the past few weeks. I have  already discussed some of them here on the floor.   Many citizens were told by their mayors that small religious services  were just too dangerous. At the same time, massive political protests  were not just allowed but encouraged.   Americans have been told they should very carefully distinguish good  people from bad apples if they are talking about protests and riots,  but they must not make the same distinction if they are talking about  the police.   Recently, the country was informed by hysterical journalists that a  rational policy essay from our colleague Senator Cotton was just too  inflammatory to publish, but the Speaker of the House can say Senator  Tim Scott and his 48 cosponsors are ``trying to get away with . . . the  murder of George Floyd,'' and Democrats just cheer her on--cheer her  on.   Americans have been ordered to rethink and relearn our Nation's  history by a movement that is itself so historically illiterate that  they mistake George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant, and a 19th-century  abolitionist for enemies of justice and destroy their monuments.   One common thread seems to connect all this: The far left wants you  to play by one set of rules if you think like they do and a completely  different set of rules if you dare to think anything else.  [[Page S3278]]    Well, yesterday here in the Senate, the latest absurdity was added to  the list. Our Democratic colleagues tried to say with straight faces  that they want the Senate to discuss police reform while they blocked  the Senate from discussing police reform. They declared that Senator  Scott's bill, which contains many bipartisan components, which  literally contains entire bills written by Democrats, was beyond the  pale. Senator Scott offered a wide-open, bipartisan amendment process,  and they walked away.   Over in the House, when Democrats shoot down every Republican  amendment in committee and allow zero amendments on the floor, you can  bet it will be anointed a big, big success.   Now, as an aside, I could not help but notice that in the Democratic  leader's lengthy remarks yesterday morning, he did not once address or  acknowledge the junior Senator from South Carolina as the author of the  JUSTICE Act--not one time. Not one time did the Democratic leader  address Senator Tim Scott as the author of the legislation he was  trashing.   I cannot see why the Democratic leader talks right past Senator Scott  as if he were not leading this discussion, as if he were barely here.  All I can say is that it was jarring to witness, especially in a  national moment like this. Senator Scott was the leader of the working  group. He wrote the bill. He has been studying and working on and  living these issues since long, long before the Democratic leader came  rushing to the microphones on this subject a few weeks ago.   I can certainly take all the angry comments my colleague from New  York wants to throw my way. I don't mind. But if he would like to learn  something about the substance of this issue, he might want to stop  acting like Senator Scott hardly exists and learn from the expert who  wrote the bill.   The American people know you do not really want progress on an issue  if you block the Senate from taking it up. They know that most police  officers are brave and honorable and that most protesters are peaceful.  They know our country needs both. We need both. The American people  know they don't need history lessons from common criminals who are  dragging George Washington through the dirt. They know prayer is no  less essential than protest. They know that a politician who compares a  policy disagreement to a brutal murder has just permanently forfeited  the moral high ground to the grownups who want solutions.   Some forces are desperate to divide our country any way they possibly  can, but if people of good will and common sense stick together, the  radical nonsense will not stand a chance.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a completely different matter, the  Senate does not have the luxury of letting these disagreements prevent  needed bipartisan progress on other fronts.   While the House has been missing in action on the longest spring  break in human history, the Senate has been conducting the people's  business alone. We have confirmed nominees. We have conducted critical  oversight. We passed historic legislation for our national parks and  public lands. We have kept a close watch on the bad actors abroad who  would love nothing more than to take advantage of a distracted and  divided United States.   Today, months of focused work from our colleagues on the Armed  Services Committee will let the Senate start to move toward this year's  National Defense Authorization Act. Thanks to Chairman Inhofe and the  committee, for a 60th straight year, the Senate has an opportunity to  lay out our priorities for the U.S. military with a united voice.  Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed guided a collaborative,  bipartisan process.   The committee considered 391 amendments and reported out their final  bill on a nearly unanimous basis. The result is legislation that honors  the unique sacrifices of our men and women in uniform, from authorizing  a pay raise for Active-Duty personnel to ensuring high-quality housing,  health, and childcare services for families stationed at home and  abroad.   Their product will help ensure our military continues to attract the  next generation of warfighters and leaders and that those men and women  will have cutting-edge equipment and tools to face off with competitors  and defend our security and our interests around the world.   In just the last several weeks, China has grown even bolder in its  supposed ``enforcement'' of disputed waters and picked deadly fights  with the world's largest democracy in the Himalayas. Russia has  deployed aircraft to within eyesight of U.S. airspace and has kept  testing the free world's tolerance for cyber attacks. North Korea has  threatened a new round of the Korean war. Iran continues to flout  international agreements and fuel instability throughout its region.  Terrorists prey on the instability to advance their own extreme  violence.   Clearly, those who mean us harm will not wait for America's domestic  challenges to fade away, and they certainly will not wait for the  United States to quit bickering. So, notwithstanding all our other  differences, I hope and expect this body will be able to put  partisanship aside and honor the bipartisan tradition that has defined  this crucial bill for decades.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
