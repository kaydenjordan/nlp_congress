 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a strong  partnership between the United States and Taiwan.   I recently returned from a bipartisan congressional delegation to  Taiwan, where I met with the president and government officials of both  parties, business executives, and military commanders.   The scope and severity of the threat from the Chinese Communist Party  is crystallized in the Taiwan Strait, which is under constant  harassment. But so also does Taiwan's vibrant democracy and strong  economy represent opportunity in the Indo-Pacific.   The United States and Taiwan should help support each other's  democracies through collaboration on countering disinformation and  propaganda. We should also strengthen one another's economies through  increased flows of trade and investment by negotiating expanded market  access, common rules, and the end of double taxation on Taiwanese  investment in the United States, which is especially critical as we  seek to revive U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.   As the United States seeks to strengthen our position in the Indo- Pacific, let us commit to Taiwan as a long-term ally.                            ____________________
