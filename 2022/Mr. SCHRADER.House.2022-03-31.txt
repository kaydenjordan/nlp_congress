 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Affordable Insulin Now Act. The bill before us today will finally  deliver the financial relief Oregonians whose lives depend on insulin  so desperately need.   By capping the costs to no more than $35 month in Medicare part D and  commercial insurance, Congress is making it clear that no one should  have to cut back, ration, or skip doses of lifesaving medication.   I am proud that this policy is a central tenet of my own drug pricing  bill that I have worked on with leadership, secured in the House, and  passed in the Build Back Better bill. We need to rein in all drug price  prescriptions. That is why it is important to negotiate drug prices  without stifling innovation, like we do in our bill. Limit the price  increases of everyday drugs to the price of inflation, and perhaps more  importantly, limit out-of-pocket costs to seniors to $2,000 or less.
