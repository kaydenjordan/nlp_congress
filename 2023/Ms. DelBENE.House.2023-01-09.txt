 Mr. Speaker, later this evening, my colleague and  friend, Congresswoman DeLauro, will offer a motion to add the expanded  child tax credit to the rules package, This gives us an opportunity to  start the 118th Congress on the right foot.   Instead of focusing on an extremist agenda, we can advance a proven  solution to an issue that impacts every community in our country-- childhood poverty.   The United States, shamefully, has one of the highest rates of  childhood poverty in the developed world. We have a solution that we  know works, the expanded child tax credit that delivered up to $300 per  child each month to over 40 million families. These resources helped  parents pay for food, rent, gas, and other essentials.   We must bring back the expanded child tax credit and deliver for  children and families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this motion to  commit. Reducing childhood poverty should be a bipartisan effort.
