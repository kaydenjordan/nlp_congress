 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Katko for cosponsoring this  bill.   For as long as women have been in the workforce, they have faced  discrimination because of their sex, which is only amplified when a  woman is pregnant. Pregnant workers are often passed over for  promotions, forced out on leave, whether paid or unpaid, and sometimes  even fired. As we have seen time and again, these policies  disproportionately impact women of color and low-wage hourly workers.   We all agree that pregnancy is not a disability, but sometimes  pregnant workers need an easy fix, such as a stool or an extra bathroom  break, to stay on the job. These accommodations are short in duration,  and typically cost very little to provide, but they can mean the  difference between keeping your job or putting your pregnancy at risk.   Given the low cost of these accommodations, we must ask why so many  employers are unwilling to provide them and keep their pregnant workers  employed. The answer, unfortunately, is that for many employers, a  pregnant employee embodies negative gender stereotypes regarding  motherhood and pregnancy. Society still expects women to conform to  stereotypical notions that to be a good parent, you must choose between  pregnancy and work.   This harmful stereotype puts working women in an impossible position  of having to choose between their family's health and their financial  well-being. While pregnancy may create some known physical limitations,  this choice between work and pregnancy is a fallacy and can be remedied  with a reasonable accommodation. Despite repeated attempts by Congress  over the years to address this persistent gender discrimination, many  employers still view pregnancy and work as incompatible.   Current law continues to allow employers to simply force most  pregnant workers out on leave rather than even considering providing an  accommodation. The Americans with Disabilities Act does require  employers to accommodate a pregnant worker if her work limitations rise  to the disability impacting one or more major life functions. Women who  have limitations that do not rise to this level are not protected under  the ADA, which was not designed to address pregnancy-related gender  discrimination.   Furthermore, the courts have hamstrung other attempts by Congress to  address pregnancy-related gender discrimination. Courts have  interpreted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act to only require employers  to provide an accommodation if they also accommodate nonpregnant  employees similar in their ability or inability to work and employed in  similar working conditions.   In order to prove discrimination, pregnant women must have perfect  and complete employment and medical histories for every other employee  in their workplace. It is obviously nearly impossible for employees to  have that information, as evidenced by the fact that in over two-thirds  of cases, courts have sided with employers who denied a pregnant worker  accommodation.  [[Page H2334]]    Current law lets women fall through the cracks in every sector of our  economy, including the public sector. Take, for example, the story of  Devyn Williams, a correctional officer trainee with the Alabama  Department of Corrections. From the moment Ms. Williams told her  employer she was pregnant, they started a campaign to fire her.                                time  1000    When she presented a note from her doctor requesting to be excused  from a monthly physical training session during her pregnancy, the  State fired her. Her employer actually wrote an email stating that her  doctor's note gave them grounds to dismiss Ms. Williams.   Even with that email in her possession, Ms. Williams is still  litigating her case 5 years later. No one should have to go to Federal  court to get a simple accommodation to safely stay on the job while  pregnant.   The bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act before us today will  close this gap in the law and create an affirmative right to  accommodation for all pregnant workers. Using the familiar language of  the ADA as a framework, the bill requires employers to provide  reasonable accommodations to pregnant workers as long as the  accommodation does not impose an undue hardship on the employer.   Courts know exactly how to interpret that language.    Employers know exactly what their responsibilities will  be. But most importantly, women will have the certainty they can safely  stay on the job.   That is why 30 States have passed pregnancy accommodation laws  similar to the PWFA and over 200 business, civil rights, health, and  labor organizations support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from two of  those organizations, A Better Balance and the National Women's Law  Center.                                                       May 11, 2021.      Re The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 1065).         Dear Representative: On behalf of A Better Balance, I write       to express our strong support for the Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act (``PWFA''; H.R. 1065). This legislation will       ensure pregnant workers, particularly low-income workers and       women of color, are not forced to choose between their       paycheck and a healthy pregnancy. The bill will require       employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant       workers unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the       employer, similar to the accommodation standard already in       place for workers with disabilities.        Forty-two years after the passage of the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act, pregnant workers still face rampant       discrimination on the job and treatment as second-class       citizens, as I explained in detail in my Congressional       testimony before the House Education & Labor Committee in       March 2021 and October 2019, as well as in A Better Balance's       May 2019 report, Long Overdue. We urge you to support healthy       pregnancies, protect pregnant workers' livelihoods, and end       the systemic devaluation of women of color and vote YES on       the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.        A Better Balance is a national non-profit legal       organization that advances justice for workers so they can       care for themselves and their loved ones without sacrificing       their economic security. Since our founding, we have seen day       in and day out the injustices that pregnant workers continue       to face because they need modest, temporary pregnancy       accommodations and have led the movement at the federal,       state, and local level to ensure pregnant workers can receive       the accommodations they need to remain healthy and working.       As I wrote in my 2012 Op-Ed in The New York Times ``Pregnant       and Pushed Out of Job,'' which sparked the PWFA's       introduction in Congress, ``[Gaps in our civil rights laws       leave this enormous class without the right to the modest       accommodations that would protect them.'' As a result, ``for       many women, a choice between working under unhealthy       conditions and not working is no choice at all.''        We founded A Better Balance 15 years ago because we       recognized that a lack of fair and supportive work-family       laws and policies--the ``care crisis''--was       disproportionately harming women, especially Black and Latina       mothers, in low-wage jobs. As I recently shared before       Congress, ``This bias and inflexibility often kicks in when       women become pregnant and then snowballs into lasting       economic disadvantage. We call this the `pregnancy penalty'--      and since day one, A Better Balance has recognized it as a       key barrier to gender equality in America.''        Through our free, national legal helpline, we have spoken       with thousands of pregnant workers, disproportionately women       of color, who have been fired or forced on to unpaid leave       for needing accommodations, often stripping them of their       health insurance when they need it most, driving them into       poverty, and at times, even homelessness. Other women we have       assisted were denied accommodations but needed to keep       working to support themselves and their families and faced       devastating health consequences, including miscarriage,       preterm birth, birth complications, and other maternal health       effects.        In the past year alone, we have heard from women across the       country who continue to face termination or are forced out       for needing pregnancy accommodations, in situations often       exacerbated by the pandemic and economic crisis. Tesia, a       retail store employee from Missouri called us in 2020 after       she was forced to quit her job because her employer refused       to let her carry a water bottle on the retail floor even       though she was experiencing severe dehydration due to hot       temperatures in the store this summer. A massage therapist       from Pennsylvania called us in June 2020 requesting to return       to work on a part-time basis on the advice of her OB-GYN       after experiencing cramping in her uterus. Her employer       responded that they would not accommodate her and cut off all       communication with her after that, forcing her out of work       just three months before she was due to give birth. A nurse       we spoke with from Pennsylvania who was six months pregnant       requested to avoid assignment to the COVID-19 unit. Though       her hospital was not overwhelmed by the pandemic at that       time, had many empty beds, and other workers were being sent       home, her employer refused her request and made heartless       comments mocking her need for accommodation. She decided not       to jeopardize her health and lost pay for missing those       shifts as a result. She also worried about being called to       the COVID unit shift constantly. Without the law on their       side, these women had little legal recourse because they       lived in a state without a state-level pregnant workers       fairness law.        Although the pandemic has shined a spotlight on these       issues, the stories we heard in 2020 are in many ways similar       to those we've been hearing for over a decade. ln 2012,       Armanda Legros was forced out of her job at an armored truck       company because her employer would not accommodate her       lifting restriction. Without an income, she struggled to feed       her newborn and young child. As she told the Senate Health,       Education, Labor, and Pensions committee in a hearing in       2014, ``Once my baby arrived just putting food on the table       for him and my four-year-old was a challenge. I was forced to       use water in his cereal at times because I could not afford       milk.'' The need for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act       preceded our current public health crisis and will remain in       place beyond the pandemic, until the law is passed.    Current Federal Law is Failing Pregnant Workers: The Pregnant Workers                        Fairness Act is the Solution         Gaps in federal law, namely the Pregnancy Discrimination       Act (PDA) and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), mean       many pregnant workers in need of accommodation are without       legal protection in states that do not have statewide PWFA       protections. As we explained in our report Long Overdue,       ``[w]hile the PDA bans pregnancy discrimination, it requires       employers to make accommodations only if they accommodate       other workers, or if an employee unearths evidence of       discrimination. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires       employers to provide reasonable accommodations to workers       with disabilities, which can include some pregnancy-related       disabilities. However, pregnancy itself is not a disability,       leaving a gap wherein many employers are in no way obligated       to accommodate pregnant workers in need of immediate relief       to stay healthy and on the job.''        Original analysis we conducted for Long Overdue found that       even though the 2015 Supreme Court Young v. UPS case set a       new legal standard for evaluating pregnancy accommodation       cases under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, in two-thirds       of cases decided since Young, employers were permitted to       deny pregnant workers accommodations under the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act. As I shared in my recent testimony, women       are continuing to lose their cases because of this uniquely       burdensome standard.        That statistic, as devastating as it is, does not account       for the vast majority of pregnant workers who do not have the       resources to vindicate their rights in court. Beyond being       resource strapped, most pregnant workers we hear from do not       have the desire to engage in time-consuming and stressful       litigation. They want to be able to receive an accommodation       so they can continue working at the jobs they care about       while maintaining a healthy pregnancy.        The Americans with Disabilities Act is also inadequate for       pregnant workers for two reasons. First, because pregnancy is       not itself a disability under current disability law, a       pregnant worker who has no complications but seeks an       accommodation in order to avoid a complication, will not be       able to get an accommodation under the Americans with       Disabilities Act. Second, even though Congress expanded the       Americans with Disabilities Act in 2008, courts have       interpreted the ADA Amendments Act in a way that did  [[Page H2335]]       little to expand coverage even for those pregnant workers       with serious health complications. As one court concluded in       2018, ``Although the 2008 amendments broadened the ADA 's       definition of disability, these changes only have had a       modest impact when applied to pregnancy-related conditions.''     The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a Critical Economic Security,                Maternal Health, and Racial Justice Measure         Pregnant workers who are fired or forced on to unpaid leave       for needing accommodations face significant economic       hardship. In addition to losing their livelihood, many of       these workers lose their health benefits at a time when they       need them most, forcing them to switch providers, delay       medical care, or face staggering health care costs associated       with pregnancy and childbirth. Many workers must use up saved       paid or unpaid leave they had hoped to reserve to recover       from childbirth. We worked with one woman who was eight       months pregnant and whose hours were cut after she needed an       accommodation which meant she also lost her health insurance.       As a result, she asked her doctor if they could induce her       labor early, despite the health risks in doing so, so that       she would not be left facing exorbitant medical bills. In the       long term, being pushed out for needing pregnancy       accommodations also exacerbates the gender wage gap, as it       means not only a loss of pay, but also losing out on many       types of benefits such as 401K and retirement contributions,       social security contributions, pensions, as well as       opportunities for promotion and growth.        To be clear, most pregnant workers may not need       accommodations. However, for those who do, reasonable       accommodations can avert significant health risks. For       instance, in a Health Impact Assessment of state level       pregnant workers fairness legislation, the Louisville,       Kentucky Department of Public Health and Wellness concluded,       ``Accommodating pregnant workers, upon their request, is       critical for reducing poor health outcomes . . . Improving       birth outcomes makes a sustainable impact for a lifetime of       better health.'' The report noted that those poor health       outcomes can include miscarriage, preterm birth, low birth       weight, preeclampsia (a serious condition and leading cause       of maternal mortality), among other issues. According to the       March of Dimes, in the U.S., nearly 1 in 10 babies are born       pre-term and the preterm birth rate among Black women is       nearly fifty percent higher than it is for all other women.       Preterm birth/low birthweight is a leading cause of infant       mortality in America. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a       key measure to reduce poor maternal and infant health       outcomes.        Pregnancy accommodations are also a key solution, among       many, needed to address the Black maternal and infant health       crisis. Systemic racism has led to the shameful reality that       Black women in this country are three to four times likelier       to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, and       Black babies are more than two times as likely to die in the       first year of life than white babies. At the same time, we       know Black women also face devastating health consequences       when they are unable to obtain needed pregnancy       accommodations to maintain their health and the health of       their pregnancies. When Tasha Mureil, a Black woman who       worked at a warehouse in Tennessee, received a doctor's note       saying she needed a lifting restriction and complained of       extreme stomach pain, she was forced to continue lifting on       the job. One day, she told a supervisor she was in pain and       asked to leave early. Her manager said no. Tragically, she       had a miscarriage the next day. Tasha was not alone. Three       more of her coworkers, also Black, miscarried after       supervisors dismissed their requests for reprieve from heavy       lifting. As Cherisse Scott, CEO of Memphis-based SisterReach,       explained ``It doesn't surprise me that this is the culture       of that workplace. I think it's important to look at the fact       that since we arrived here in chains, we [Black women] were       regarded as producers to fuel a labor force that couldn't       care less for us . . .'' The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act       will ensure pregnant workers and their health are valued and       that Black mothers, especially, are not treated as expendable       on the job.     The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a Bipartisan Bill That Has the             Support of This Country's Largest Business Groups         The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is not a partisan bill.       Not only does it have strong bipartisan support in Congress,       but thirty states and five cities including Tennessee,       Kentucky, South Carolina, West Virginia, Illinois, Nebraska,       and Utah already have laws requiring employers to provide       accommodations for pregnant employees. All of the laws passed       in recent years are highly similar to the federal       legislation, and all passed with bipartisan, and often       unanimous, support.'' Many, including Tennessee's and       Kentucky's, were championed by Republican legislators.        Pregnant workers are a vital part of our economy. Three-      quarters of women will be both pregnant and employed at some       point during their lives'' Ensuring pregnant workers can       remain healthy and attached to the workforce is an issue of       critical importance, especially as this country faces a       devastating economic crisis. That is why leading business       groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Society for Human       Resources Management, many major corporations, and local       chambers around the country including, Greater Louisville       Inc., one of Kentucky's leading chambers of commerce, support       this measure. The PWFA will provide much needed clarity in       the law which will lead to informal and upfront resolutions       between employers and employees and help prevent problems       before they start. Furthermore, accommodations are short term       and low cost. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will help       employers retain valuable employees and reduce high turnover       and training costs. The reasonable accommodation framework is       also borrowed from the American with Disabilities Act       framework so employers are already familiar with the       standard. Furthermore, keeping pregnant workers employed       saves taxpayers money in the form of unemployment insurance       and other public benefits.      The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act Uses a Familiar Framework That   Provides Key Protections to Pregnant Workers and Clarity to Employers         The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act has several key       provisions that will address the inequality pregnant workers       continue to face at work. Employers, including private       employers with fifteen or more employees, will be required to       provide reasonable accommodations to qualified employees       absent undue hardship on the employer. Both the term       ``reasonable accommodation'' and ``undue hardship'' have the       same definition as outlined in the American with Disabilities       Act. Similar to the Americans with Disabilities Act,       employers and employees will engage in an interactive process       in order to determine an appropriate accommodation. In order       to prevent employers from pushing pregnant employees out on       leave when they need an accommodation, the bill specifies       that an employer cannot require a pregnant employee to take       leave if another reasonable accommodation can be provided.       The bill also includes clear anti-retaliation language such       that employers cannot punish pregnant workers for requesting       or using an accommodation. This is critical as many pregnant       workers often do not ask for accommodations because they are       afraid they will face repercussions for requesting or needing       an accommodation.        Critically, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is also very       clear that a pregnant worker need not have a disability as       defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act in order to       merit accommodations under the law. Rather, the bill       indicates that pregnant workers with ``known limitations       related to pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical       conditions'' are entitled to reasonable accommodations.       ``Known limitations'' is defined as a ``physical or mental       condition related to, affected by, or arising out of       pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions that the       employee or employee's representative has communicated to the       employer whether or not such condition meets the definition       of disability'' as set forth in the Americans with       Disabilities Act. This addresses the two challenges with the       ADA outlined above.        Now, more than ever, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is       an urgent maternal health, racial justice, and economic       security measure to keep pregnant workers healthy and earning       a paycheck. We cannot delay justice and fairness for pregnant       workers any longer. For the sake of this country's pregnant       workers and our nation's families, we implore Congress to put       aside its many differences and pass this legislation with a       strong bipartisan vote. We ask every Member of Congress to       vote YES on the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. It is long       overdue.            Sincerely,                                                     Dina Bakst,                                          Co-Founder & Co-President,      A Better Balance.                                   ____                                                       May 11, 2021.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the National Women's       Law Center, we urge you to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness       Act (H.R. 1065). The National Women's Law Center (``the       Center'') has worked for nearly 50 years to advance and       protect women's equality and opportunity--and since its       founding has fought for the rights of pregnant women in the       workplace. For the last nine years, the Center has been a       leader in advocating for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act,       and for pregnancy accommodation protections in states across       the country. We are eager to build on the momentum from       September 2020, when the bill passed with overwhelming       bipartisan support in the House, 329-73.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would clarify the law for       employers and employees alike, requiring employers to make       reasonable accommodations for limitations arising out of       pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, just       as they already do for disabilities. Providing accommodations       ensures that women can work safely while pregnant instead of       being pushed out of work at a time when their families need       their income the most.        Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant workers were       all too often denied medically needed accommodations--      including simple accommodations like a stool to sit on during       a long shift or a bottle of water at a workstation. COVID-19       has only increased the need for clarity regarding employers'       obligations to provide accommodations for pregnant workers.       COVID-19 poses grave risks for pregnant workers, who are       urgently seeking, and far too often being denied,       accommodations like proper personal protective equipment,       telework, moving to a less  [[Page H2336]]       crowded work area or changing start times so as not to risk       riding public transit during peak hours. The Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act uses an already-familiar framework modeled on       the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to ensure that when       such a request is made, employers and employees can engage in       an interactive process to determine whether the employee's       pregnancy related limitations can be reasonably accommodated       without an undue hardship to the employer. This will help       ensure that employees are not forced to choose between a       paycheck and a healthy pregnancy.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will close gaps and       clarify ambiguities in the law that have left too many       pregnant workers unprotected for too long. The Pregnancy       Discrimination Act (PDA), passed in 1978, guarantees the       right not to be treated adversely at work because of       pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, and the       right to be treated at least as well as other employees ``not       so affected but similar in their ability or inability to       work.'' Unfortunately, many courts interpreted the PDA       narrowly and allowed employers to refuse to accommodate       workers with medical needs arising out of pregnancy, even       when they routinely accommodated other physical limitations.       In Young v. UPS, the Supreme Court held that when an employer       accommodates workers who are similar to pregnant workers in       their ability to work, it cannot refuse to accommodate       pregnant workers who need it simply because it ``is more       expensive or less convenient'' to accommodate pregnant women       too. The Young decision was an important victory for pregnant       workers, but the standard it set out still left many       important questions unanswered and created uncertainty for       employers and employees about when exactly the PDA requires       pregnancy accommodations. In addition, the Americans with       Disabilities Act (ADA) requires employers to make reasonable       accommodations for employees with disabilities. However,       courts have consistently held that pregnancy is not a       disability. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would fill the       holes left in these protections with a common-ground and       commonsense approach that ensures pregnant workers are       accommodated when the accommodations they need are reasonable       and do not pose an undue hardship to employers.        Accommodating pregnant workers is not only good for working       women and families, it is good for business. Moreover, today,       women make up about half the workforce. More women are       continuing to work while they are pregnant, through later       stages of pregnancy. For example, two-thirds of women who had       their first child between 2006 and 2008 worked during       pregnancy, and 88 percent of these first-time mothers worked       into their last trimester. When employers accommodate       pregnant workers, businesses reap the benefits of avoiding       the costs of turnover and keeping experienced employees on       the job. And since pregnancy is temporary, pregnancy       accommodations are, by definition, short-term; many of these       accommodations are low and no cost.        The time is now to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.       Thirty states and the District of Columbia have enacted       provisions explicitly granting pregnant employees the right       to accommodations at work, from Massachusetts, New York, and       California, to South Carolina, Utah, Nebraska, West Virginia,       and Tennessee. Millions of pregnant workers have benefitted       from these protections, but a pregnant employee's ability to       work safely should not depend on where she lives.        We strongly urge you to support pregnant workers by voting       for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.            Sincerely,                                                Emily J. Martin,         Vice President for Education & Workplace, Justice National                                                 Women's Law Center.     Mr. Speaker, that is why, last Congress, the House passed  identical legislation with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. But as the  economy reopens, the problem persists. The House must act again to pass  this bill, and the Senate must take it up.   Providing reasonable accommodations to pregnant workers helps  businesses, workers, and families. Passing this bill is long overdue,  and I urge a ``yes'' vote.
