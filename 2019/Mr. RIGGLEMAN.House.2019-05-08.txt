 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about an issue of  grave concern in my district. The Skyline Drive corridor in central and  western Virginia has become the center of a drug trafficking problem  that is ravaging my district.   This challenge has warranted the creation of a Skyline Drug Task  Force to combat drug problems in the community. This counter-drug team  has carried out searches and made arrests, including of an individual  suspected to be a high-level member of a Mexican drug trafficking  organization, a cartel, who had, according to the judge, caused  unfathomable damage to the community.   The damage caused by this organization and the many others  trafficking in our communities and in the Fifth District of Virginia is  very real and very lasting.   It is necessary, for the safety of my constituents, to have the  region designated as a High Intensity Drug Area to give law enforcement  the funding and support they need to continue the fight against the  dangerous drug dealers.                            ____________________
