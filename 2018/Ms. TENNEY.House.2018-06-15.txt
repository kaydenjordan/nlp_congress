 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Hank Leo and  Amanda Larson, members of the Oneida Rotary Club. Hank and Amanda both  recently received the Roses to the Living Award at the Kallet Civic  Center. This award is given to Rotarians who have demonstrated  exceptional commitment to the community through good works and  involvement in needy and worthy causes. This dedication and devotion to  community embodies the spirit of the Rotary motto: Service Above Self.   In 2002, Ms. Larson was nominated as president and chief executive  officer of what is now The Gorman Foundation, an organization dedicated  to improving the quality of life for present and future generations in  central New York and around the world. Amanda has worked diligently to  ensure that access to healthcare for uninsured and underserved citizens  is obtained. Many of these people had not had the opportunity to even  meet with a doctor or medical professional for many years.   In addition to his tireless work at the YMCA, Hank Leo has lent his  helping hand to all of the Oneida community and throughout the region  for many years. He has served as a member of the Oneida City School  District Board of Education for 5 years and as a member of the Oneida  Healthcare Foundation Board of Directors for several years.   In June of 2013, when many Oneida residences suffered devastating  losses due to flooding, it was Hank who immediately offered the YMCA's  Oneida facility as a place to stay for those who needed shelter.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in extending sincere thanks and gratitude  to Amanda Larson and Hank Leo for their unparalleled contributions to  our community. They truly embody the Rotary motto of Service Above  Self.                            ____________________
