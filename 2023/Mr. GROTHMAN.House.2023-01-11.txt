 Madam Speaker, one of the scary, ongoing stories over  the last few years, more typical of an atheistic totalitarian regime  than our wonderful constitutional Republic, has been a tax on pregnancy  counseling centers.   They are hated because they try to persuade women to keep their  babies, and they articulate how precious life is in the womb, which is  considered to be dangerous speech to those who desperately want to  legalize 8-month abortions.   Some of these attacks, like those in other venues by antifa and Black  Lives Matter have become more physical in nature.    The lack of urgency by law enforcement to protect the speech of those  who want women to keep their children is dangerous. This effort to  muzzle those who express a wide variety of conservative Christian  viewpoints has become more and more common and should scare anyone who  does not want to live in a religiously hostile, large government State.   Please vote for H. Con. Res. 3.
