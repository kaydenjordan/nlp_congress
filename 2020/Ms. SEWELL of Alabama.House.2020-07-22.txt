 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and outstanding legacy of our colleague, friend, mentor, and my hero,  Congressman John Robert Lewis.   Growing up as a little girl in Selma, Alabama, John's incredible  legacy was a hero's tale as familiar to me as any Bible story or family  lore.   As a little girl singing in the choir, the children's choir at Brown  Chapel AME Church, my home church, it was the church where John and so  many wonderful foot soldiers would come time and time again to honor  the legacy of the Bloody Sunday march.   But to know John was to know a man without ego, who, despite his many  well-deserved accolades and successes, loved every person he met. He  looked them in the eye. Can't you hear him? ``My brother, my sister,''  he would say.   John loved this country more than any person who I have met, and it  was his deep-seated patriotism that will live on.   His legacy, indeed, was the Voting Rights Act. And, we, in this body,  can do something about that. Yes, we can  [[Page H3676]]  name things for John, but the biggest thing that we can do is rename  H.R. 4. We should call it the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Act of  2020 and fully restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That is the  legacy of John Lewis.   He gave us the road map. Can't you hear him? Never give up, never  give in. Keep your eyes on the prize. Keep the faith.
