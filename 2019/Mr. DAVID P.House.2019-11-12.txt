 ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4625, as amended, the  Protect the GI Bill Act.   Earlier this year, we celebrated the 75th anniversary of the original  World War II GI Bill that helped launch the modern middle class. In the  past 75 years, the GI Bill has helped millions of transitioning  servicemembers get the training and education they need to be  successful and help grow our economy. I used the GI Bill myself when I  got out of the military.   Part of our role on the Veterans' Affairs Committee is to protect the  GI Bill's important legacy and ensure that the incredible benefit the  GI Bill provides remains available for veterans for generations to  come.   The Protect the GI Bill Act would advance that goal by putting  important protections in place to help student veterans make the right  choice when using their GI Bill benefits by helping regulators flag  and, if necessary, remove bad schools and programs from being eligible  for the GI Bill.   This bill would also double down on our support for student veterans  whose school has closed before they finish their program by restoring  their GI Bill entitlement if the student is unable to transfer their  credits to another institution.   I thank my friend and fellow long-term committee member, Congressman  Gus Bilirakis from Florida, for his hard work on this bill. Gus is the  ranking member of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, and this  bill includes the text of his bill, H.R. 4085, the Student Veteran  Empowerment Act, and builds off his work in the 113th Congress to  create the GI Bill Comparison Tool.   I would also like to thank Student Veterans of America, Veterans of  Foreign Wars, and, especially, Veterans Education Success for their  help in crafting this legislation. Their expert advice and counsel are  critical to ensuring that we preserve the legacy of the GI Bill for  another 75 years and beyond.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), my good friend, a tireless  working member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I know of no one on  our committee who works harder for veterans, whether it is on PTSD or  the benefits they have earned, than Gus Bilirakis.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I, too, am ready to close. I yield myself the balance of  my time.   I do want to say that this bill is indicative of how, when we work  together, we can solve problems. You heard various issues from both  sides of the aisle that were brought to bear and worked in the  subcommittee and committee to solve these problems for constituents all  across the country.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 4477, as amended, the Reducing High  Risk to Veterans and Veterans Services Act. This bill was introduced by  Congressman Chris Pappas from New Hampshire and my good friend,  Congressman Jack Bergman from Michigan, the chairman and ranking  member, respectively, of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigation.   Every 2 years, the Government Accountability Office, the GAO,  publishes its High-Risk List identifying those activities that are  considered high risk due to their vulnerabilities to fraud, waste,  abuse, and mismanagement or that need transformation. GAO added  managing risks and improving Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare  to  [[Page H8753]]  its High-Risk List in 2015, and it remains there today.   Last Congress, the committee held a roundtable discussion with  representatives from VA and GAO to address VA's progress towards  addressing GAO's concerns. While it takes an agency, on average, 7  years to be removed from the list, VA has demonstrated little progress.  Additionally, GAO added that VA Acquisition Management to its 2019  list.   H.R. 4477, as amended, would require VA to develop a plan of action  to address deficiencies in acquisition management and healthcare that  led GAO to place VA on their High-Risk List in 2015 and again in 2017  and again in 2019. It would also incorporate a provision under H.R.  698, a bill introduced by Representative   Jim Banks of Indiana, to  direct VA to report on its efforts to address GAO's priority  recommendations and GAO's top 30 open recommendations.   Our Nation's veterans and taxpayers deserve a VA that is high  performing and that acts quickly to address areas of concern as they  arise. This help will help ensure that they get it done.   I am grateful to Congressman Pappas and General Bergman for  sponsoring this bill, which has my full support, but I would be remiss  if I did not point out that this is another bill that did not go  through regular order.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to  yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Bergman), a lieutenant general--and for those of you all who don't  know what that is, it is three stars; I only made it to a major--to  describe his bill.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members  to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4771, as amended, the  Department of Veterans Affairs Tele-Hearing Modernization Act. This  bill would expand the Board of Veterans' Appeals hearing options to  include tele-hearings.   I appreciate my colleagues, Chairman Isakson, Chairman Takano, and  Ranking Member Tester, for working with me on this bill to ensure that  the virtual hearing concept included in this bill represents the input  of all four corners of Congress.   Madam Speaker, we all depend on and use our smartphones for just  about everything we do these days. This legislation would allow  veterans to use their personal device for a VA hearing.   I am happy that we are moving this legislation to make hearings more  accessible to veterans, especially those in rural areas where I live or  for whom travel might be physically challenging.   This bill was amended in committee to include additional reporting  requirements that will help Congress monitor the implementation of this  program. Specifically, the Board would be required to report on its  outreach to veterans and stakeholders on the option for a tele-hearing,  including the advantages and potential technological challenges of a  tele-hearing, the IT modifications needed to conduct tele-hearings, and  the partnership between the Board and the Veterans Health  Administration, VHA, to share lessons learned from their respective  programs since the tele-hearing program is modeled after the telehealth  program that VA uses to increase access to care for veteran patients.   The amended bill would also require VA to collaborate with veteran  service organizations and other stakeholders to ensure that those who  represent veterans at these hearings will have input into how the  program is developed so that it can best meet the needs of  our veterans.    Madam Speaker, this bill has my full support, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I have no further  speakers. I also am prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I encourage everyone to support this. This is  obviously, in rural America, how we are going to have access to  healthcare in the future. It absolutely makes sense. This technology is  available to almost everyone.   It makes no sense to make an infirm veteran or other patients go  miles and miles and hours. This just makes sense. We have the  technology to do it today, and I strongly support this and encourage my  colleagues to do the same.  [[Page H8755]]    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4360, the VA  Overpayment Accountability Act.   Veterans receive overpayments for many reasons. For example, a  veteran may erroneously receive drill pay and disability compensation  at the same time. A veteran may reduce their course load after their GI  Bill payment has been sent from the Department of Veterans Affairs to  the school, or a veterans' marital status may have changed, but they  continue to receive additional compensation for dependents. As a  result, VA creates a debt that the veteran must pay back.   In some instances, the veteran may be aware that he or she had been  overpaid and that VA will most likely ask them to return the money, but  in other circumstances, they may not.   I am concerned that many overpayments are caused by VA's negligence,  not the veterans.   Unexpectedly receiving a debt notification letter can create big  problems for veterans and their families, especially if they can't  afford to pay VA back; therefore, it is critical that the VA has the  tools it needs to effectively prevent overpayments, and that if certain  types of overpayments are unavoidable, VA's recoupment process is fair  and considerate for veterans.   This bill is sponsored by Congressman   Andy Kim from New Jersey and  is intended to ensure that veterans are not unduly harmed by VA's debt  collection process.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate his leadership on this issue, and I urge  my colleagues to support H.R. 4360.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my good friend.   He is incredibly committed to our veterans. I have toured two  different veterans' medical centers in his home State of Arkansas.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know about New Jersey and California, but a  crack operation where we are is a good one, so I think I would take  that as a compliment.   I thank Mr. Kim and my good friend Mr. Hill for their work on this.   It does create, as the chairman said, tremendous anxiety and problems  for our veterans. It is needless. Many times, it is just a bureaucratic  mistake. I think all of us have suffered those with the IRS or  whomever, so this is a way to correct that. I thank these Members for  bringing it up.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill, and I urge Members to.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4356, as amended, the  Protecting Families of Fallen Servicemembers Act.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief  Act to give a spouse or dependent of a servicemember who experiences a  catastrophic injury or who dies while in military service the ability  to terminate telephone, multichannel video programming, or internet  service contracts.   This bill would also extend SCRA protections to members of the  National Guard and Reserve who are executing Active Duty orders or  performing inactive duty training. These are worthwhile protections for  our servicemembers and are worthy of our support.   This bill is sponsored by Congressman Josh Harder from California,  and I appreciate his work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), my good friend. Dr. Colonel Brad  Wenstrup is a combat veteran of Iraq who is still on Reserve duty and  has served at both Fort Belvoir Hospital and Walter Reed Hospital.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, this is commonsense legislation--I talk  about this a lot when I go home--about a grieving spouse, a husband or  wife, who has lost a family member in combat in service to our country.  I saw many of those this past weekend, as many of us did, as we  attended veterans events.    I can't think of anything worse than being a spouse who is in a city  that is unfamiliar to them, away from family, and to have these  contractual obligations through our catastrophically injured veteran or  a deceased veteran.   It is the right thing to do. Everywhere I go and talk about this  throughout the country, our fellow Americans want this done.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this much- needed legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  [[Page H8759]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4162, as amended, the GI  Bill Planning Act of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, in order to be eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill,  servicemembers automatically have $100 a month deducted from their  paycheck for the first 12 months of their service for a total of  $1,200. Currently, servicemembers have to elect to opt out of these  payments just a few short days into their basic training or boot camp.  From personal experience, I can say that is not the time to be making  such an important decision.   This bill would extend the time the servicemember has to elect out of  the Montgomery GI Bill to a 90-day period beginning 180 days after the  date the servicemember enters training. It gives them 6 months to kind  of think about it a little bit and then some time.                                time  1715    By delaying the decision to elect out of that Montgomery GI Bill,  servicemembers will have more of an opportunity to research which GI  Bill, the Post-9/11 GI Bill, or the Montgomery GI Bill is best suited  to meet their educational needs in the future outside of the pressure  and constraints of boot camp.   In addition, this bill would responsibly sunset the Montgomery GI  Bill benefit for new enlistees in 2029. This would mean that current  servicemembers or anyone who chooses this benefit before 2029, would  not be impacted.   While the legacy of the Montgomery GI Bill benefit has helped  thousands, it only makes sense to move to the more generous Post-9/11  GI Bill. This change would help ease confusion among student veterans  and make things easier for the Department of Veterans Affairs to  administer the benefit.   I am also glad that the text of my bill, H.R. 3608, which would  extend in-state tuition benefits to veterans is also included in this  bill. The 2014 CHOICE Act required that public schools charge veterans  who are within 3 years of their discharge in-state tuition rates  regardless of whether they meet the State's residency requirements in  order to be eligible for GI Bill programs.   That requirement was waivable, but to date, all States and public  schools are complying with it. Last Congress I was proud to coauthor  the Forever GI Bill, which, among other improvements to the Post-9/11  GI Bill, eliminated the requirement that a veteran's 36 months of GI  Bill benefits expire 15 years after their last discharge from Active  Duty.   Now that this change has become law, it makes no sense to require  that the veteran be within 3 years of their discharge to receive in- state tuition rates if they have their entire lives to use their GI  Bill benefits.   I want to thank my good friend and colleague Congressman Jack Bergman  from Michigan for all of his hard work on this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support the GI Bill Planning Act of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), to debate his bill. General  Bergman served as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations in the 115th Congress, and he is now the ranking member.   Mr. Speaker, I didn't get a chance to wish the gentleman a belated  happy Veterans Day.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I, too, wish the Marine  Corps a happy birthday, but as usual, they are behind the Army. Their  birthday is later than the U.S. Army which is older than the Marine  Corps. I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I, too, have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close. I  recommend that all of my colleagues support this very commonsense  legislation, the GI Bill.   I used the GI Bill in 1975-1976, when I got out of the Army. It was  an amazing piece of legislation. It helped me then. I am appreciative  to this day that my country invested $300 a month in me for 2 years,  and that I got to use that. It really helped me a lot.   This bill that we have now, the Forever GI Bill, is a phenomenal  benefit for young people. We know the GI Bill helped transform a  generation after World War II. I believe this Forever GI Bill will  transform this generation, and I wholeheartedly encourage my colleagues  to support it.   I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3996, the VA Design- Build Construction Enhancement Act of 2019.   This bill is sponsored by my good friend Congressman   Jim Banks from  Indiana. Congressman Banks is a former chairman and current ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Technology Modernization and a tireless  advocate for his fellow veterans.   His bill would encourage the use of the design-build construction  method in the Department of Veterans Affairs by adding a reference to  VA's construction statute, to existing government-  [[Page H8761]]  wide design-build construction procedures; prohibiting VA from  discouraging other Federal agencies that manage construction projects  on VA's behalf from using design-build; and incorporating design-build  into VA's construction management training curriculum.   Design-build is a construction delivery method that is characterized  by combining architectural, engineering, and construction services into  a single contract. Design-build has been used successfully across the  Federal Government since the mid-1990s.   When used appropriately, it can accelerate the completion of  construction projects, reduce change orders, and increase warranty  protections.   However, design-build has been used infrequently by VA, particularly  after it was unfairly blamed for the troubles that plagued the  replacement medical center construction project in Aurora, Colorado,  which is just outside of Denver, despite not being used until 4 years  into that project when the majority of the design-build had already  been completed.   As the chairman said, that project was $1 billion over budget. And to  put that in perspective for just regular folks like me out there where  I live, that is 1,000 million dollars over budget. That is how much a  billion is.                                time  1730    I believe that VA could have avoided these excessive change orders  and other issues that caused the delays and cost overruns that came to  characterize the Denver project had they incorporated design-build  principles much earlier.   Moving forward, I hope that the Department learns from the difficult  lessons that Denver taught and does not shy away from using the design- build method, when appropriate, to deliver high-quality construction  projects to serve our Nation's veterans.   I thank Congressman Banks for his work on this bill; and while I wish  Chairman Takano had used regular order to bring it forward, I am  pleased to support its passage today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks), my good friend. I have had a chance  to visit his district and VA and talked to many groups in his district.  There is no more passionate member of our committee than Congressman  Banks.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I think this is commonsense legislation, and certainly we can avoid  what happened in Denver. That thousand million dollars could have been  spent on veterans' healthcare or benefits or other much-needed projects  in the VA. We don't have an endless supply of money.   I certainly appreciate Mr. Banks' work on this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1424, the Fallen Warrior  Battlefield Cross Memorial Act. This bill would require the Department  of Veterans Affairs' national cemeteries to allow the display of the  battlefield cross, which is a monument that depicts a fallen  servicemember by an inverted rifle with a helmet and dog tags on top  and a pair of combat boots at the bottom. We have all seen this.   In 2017, a VA employee misinterpreted VA policy and removed a  battlefield cross from the Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery, as  well as two other similar memorials in cemeteries in Illinois and  Michigan. The objection to the memorials were that they contained  realistic depictions of firearms.   As one Ohio veteran described, this image is one that veterans ``have  seen in battlefields, on ships, on aircraft carriers, wherever we lost  men. It's a symbol of respect and thanks. . . . It means a lot to  veterans.''   I could not have said it better myself, Mr. Speaker; although, I do  note that the battlefield cross is a powerful symbol that is used to  honor all of our fallen warriors, both men and women.   In response to veterans' and congressional concerns over the  incident, the Department reinstated the memorial monuments and  clarified that VA cemeteries can display this image. However, this bill  is necessary to codify that policy and to ensure that VA does not ban  this image ever again.   This bill has my full support, and I appreciate Congressman Anthony  Gonzalez from Ohio for introducing it and for his leadership on this  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez), the author of this bill. I  appreciate the gentleman is a new Member, but it didn't take him long  to jump into gear and to recognize a wrong and to right that wrong.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers. I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I can think of no other time better than the day right  after Veterans Day to bring this up and to vote on this legislation.   I have lost friends in combat in the Vietnam War and know many  families, as most of us have visited with families who have lost  members.   I also want to say that nowhere in the country--really, in the  world--do we honor our cemeteries more than the VA does. The VA does a  phenomenal job in our national cemeteries. And I have had an  opportunity to travel to Europe and visit those cemeteries in Normandy,  Flanders Field, Chateau-Thierry, and many others.   It is really a place of sacred honor, these cemeteries are, and it is  only appropriate that we allow and have this symbol there codified by  law.   I thank Congressman Gonzalez for his first bill. He can take great  pride in having this bill passed and signed into law by the President.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of our Members to support H.R. 1424, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3224, as amended, the  Deborah Sampson Act.   For as long as the United States has been a reality, brave women have  been stepping up to serve on behalf of her and defending her from her  enemies.   This bill is named after one of those amazing women, Deborah Sampson,  who so believed in the ideals of the American Revolution that she  disguised herself as a man so that she could join in the fight for  freedom and independence.   Deborah Sampson's spirit of bravery, patriotism, and commitment to  service are still very much alive in the approximately 2 million women  veterans in the United States today and the almost 400,000 women  serving on Active Duty or in the Guard and Reserves.   Those women have fought in defense of the American Dream--on the  frontlines, in the Pentagon, and everywhere in between, in every branch  of the armed services. And, once they leave the military, they are,  increasingly, seeking care from the Department of Veterans Affairs. In  fact, the number of women using the VA healthcare system has more than  tripled since 2001 and is expected to continue rising significantly in  the years ahead.   VA leaders have been working to make the department more welcoming to  women veterans, but the fact remains that the VA healthcare system was  designed for men.   That is, perhaps, most upsettingly evidenced by the VA study  published last December that found that a full quarter of the women  veterans who seek care from the VA are subjected to inappropriate or  unwanted comments from male veterans on VA grounds.   That is tragic and unacceptable, just like it is anytime the VA falls  short of providing the high-quality care, benefits, and services that  women veterans have earned and certainly deserve, which still, sadly,  happens all too often.   The Deborah Sampson Act is legislation introduced by Congresswoman  Julia Brownley from California--and she is to be applauded for that-- the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Health and the bipartisan Women  Veterans Task Force that would help put an end to this.    The bill would create an Office of Women's Health within the VA,  require VA to establish an environment of care standards for women  veterans and ensure that VA medical facilities are retrofitted to meet  those standards, require and fund VA programs to train providers in VA  medical facilities and in the community on women's health,  [[Page H8770]]  and improve access to care for women veterans and their newborn  children.   It also includes provisions that would help all veterans, women and  men alike, who experience military sexual trauma, intimate-partner  violence, sexual assault, or sexual harassment to get the support and  care that they need.   Mr. Speaker, there have been a lot of allegations made by Chairman  Takano, and I make the following remarks with a heavy heart.   There have been a lot of allegations made by Chairman Takano and  others in the 2 weeks since the Deborah Sampson Act was marked up in  the committee about how I and my Republican colleagues feel about this  legislation and about the women that it is intended to serve.   So let me be crystal clear. I stand here in strong support of the  Deborah Sampson Act and all the good it would do for the millions of  women veterans that it would serve.   I intend to call for a recorded vote on this bill, and I fully expect  the vote to prove that there is overwhelming bipartisan support for  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, when I left the Army in 1974, I returned home to  Tennessee to finish my residency in obstetrics and gynecology and spend  the better part of my life caring for women in private practice.   My dedication to ensuring that women, whether they be civilian or  veteran, have the care that they need is personal, deeply felt, and  informed by three decades of direct action on behalf of the women who  are my patients, my friends, my family, my neighbors, my colleagues,  and my fellow veterans.   That is why it is so disappointing that, when my Republican  colleagues and I walked out of the committee markup where this bill was  being considered in protest to the chairman's actions surrounding it,  he decided to launch a baseless, identity-politics fueled attack on me  and other Republican members of the committee by alleging that we were  walking out on women veterans.   Nothing can be further from the truth. The chairman knows full well  that our decision to leave that markup had nothing to do with our  support for the Deborah Sampson Act, much less our support for women  veterans, and everything to do with the unprecedented partisanship that  he displayed when this bill was being considered by our committee.   So I would like to take this opportunity this afternoon to correct  the record.   Chairman Takano has called this bill historic and monumental, yet,  during the committee's consideration of it, he allowed one Democrat  member, Congresswoman Brownley, exactly 4 minutes to talk about it  before cutting off all debate for every other member in the room by  invoking a procedural tactic that hadn't been used by our committee in  more than a decade.   And I will say this: I never used this when I was chairman, nor did  Chairman Miller.   He did that to avoid debate on certain Republican amendments that he  erroneously characterized as toxic and partisan. They were offered in  good faith to address barriers to care for veteran women and men across  the country that we have been requesting the chairman to act on for the  better part of a year.   One of the amendments that the chairman refused to debate or vote on  was offered by Congressman   Andy Barr from Kentucky to prevent those  charged with a serious crime, including violent or sexual crimes  against children, from caring for children while their veteran parent  is receiving care from VA until their case has been favorably resolved.   The lack of childcare services is a serious barrier to care for  veterans, including many women veterans, as the chairman himself has  mentioned many times.   Our committee rightly acted on a bill, H.R. 840, which passed the  House in February, to break down that barrier by authorizing VA to  provide childcare for veterans who are engaged in VA treatment. But if  the veterans cannot rest assured that their children are safe in the VA  childcare program, they won't use it--they won't use the care--and the  lack of childcare services will continue to prevent veterans from  getting the care that they need.   Congressman Barr's amendment would close a loophole in that bill that  would allow an individual charged with a serious offense--like child  molestation--but who is awaiting his or her day in court to be  responsible for caring for a veteran's child in a VA childcare program  while their case is pending before the courts.   Mr. Speaker, I know that there are a lot of things that we cannot  agree on, but protecting vulnerable children should never be one of  those things. Yet Chairman Takano has repeatedly refused to address  this issue and employed a rarely used procedural tactic in our  committee to disallow debate and votes on it twice in recent months.   He has also failed to even respond to 11 committee members who wrote  him in July asking for a legislative hearing on Congressman Barr's  legislation. It defies understanding.   Another amendment that the chairman has repeatedly refused to allow  our committee to debate was offered by Congressman Chip Roy from Texas  to prohibit VA from sending the name of a veteran or other beneficiary  to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Instant Criminal  Background Check System, NICS, solely because VA has determined that a  person has a service-connected disability or solely because a fiduciary  has been appointed on their behalf, without the order or finding of a  judge, a magistrate, or other judicial authority that the person is a  danger to themselves or others.    Infringing on a law-abiding American citizen's constitutionally  protected rights should never occur in a free society unless a very  high bar has been met. For example, criminals must be convicted in a  court of law before their names are provided to the NICS list; but,  under current practice, VA sends veterans' names to the NICS list if  they have been appointed a fiduciary to help manage their compensation  benefits.   This is because, once VA decides that an individual needs help with  their finances, even though there may be no evidence the individual is  a danger to themselves or anyone else, a VA bureaucrat sends that  person's name to the FBI to be added to the NICS list and the veteran  loses their second amendment right to own a firearm. And these are the  very people who gave us those rights, protected those rights.   Legislation that the House passed on a party-line vote earlier this  year, H.R. 1112, would compound this injustice by requiring VA to also  report a veteran or beneficiary to the NICS if they have been  adjudicated by VA as having a mental illness when the veteran files for  a disability claim--for example, PTSD or depression.   I have personally heard from veterans across the country--and I mean  from Long Island to Los Angeles--who tell me that they don't seek VA  care and benefits that they have earned through their hard-fought  service for our country because they fear they will lose their Second  Amendment rights if they do so.   This is unacceptable at any time and is particularly unacceptable  during a national suicide crisis when we know that 14 of the 20 veteran  and servicemember suicide deaths per day already occur among those who  are not engaged in VA care prior to their deaths.   Veterans risk their lives to protect our rights. The least we can do  for them is to protect theirs. But Chairman Takano has once again  refused to do that, despite making a public vow 8 months ago before the  American Legion that he would act, as chairman, to protect the Second  Amendment rights of our Nation's veterans.   He also, once again, failed to respond to 12 committee members who  wrote him in July asking for a legislative hearing to discuss veterans'  Second Amendment issues.   There are precious few avenues available to the minority party in  Congress to influence the legislative agenda of the majority party.                                time  1800    Since February, my Republican colleagues and I have been asking  Chairman Takano, publicly and privately, to address these issues in our  committee. Our requests have been ignored. Our letters have gone  unanswered.   The only remaining option we have left is to attempt to amend bills  being marked up by the committee so that we can have an open debate and  an up-  [[Page H8771]]  or-down vote on these issues. If we win, we win. If we lose, we lose.   We attempted to amend the Deborah Sampson Act with these amendments 2  weeks ago, on the advice of the Parliamentarian about the  appropriateness of these particular amendments, which address serious  issues facing female and male veterans alike in each one of our States  and districts, to this particular bill. But the chairman denied us even  this opportunity.   That kind of partisanship has never been how this committee has  operated as long as I have been there. Under the 8 previous years of  Republican chairmen, debate was never cut off when Democratic members  offered difficult amendments during committee markups. We allowed our  Democratic colleagues the opportunity to have their say, and we took  tough votes when we needed to.   Mr. Speaker, I wish that we could have had such a different  conversation today, the day after Veterans Day, than this one. But I  would be remiss in my duty as ranking member if I did not call out this  behavior and ways in which it fails our Nation's veterans.   Chairman Takano has spoken movingly about how he wants us to use his  chairmanship to stand up for the rights of minority veterans, and I  commend him for that and have stood alongside him in doing that work,  including in May, when we stood side-by-side to launch the bipartisan  Women Veterans Task Force.   Yet, I urge him now, in carrying out that commitment, not to spurn  the historical bipartisan traditions of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, not to trounce on the rights of the minority members of that  committee, not to cut corners in favor of expediency over doing our due  diligence, and not to cast aspersions against me or any other member of  our committee when we could be debating the issues at hand like our  constituents sent us here to do.   Despite our deep disagreements here, I consider Chairman Takano a  friend, and I know him to be a good and fair man who is motivated by a  sincere desire to do the right thing for the millions of veterans and  their families who have sacrificed so much for this great Nation. That  desire is shared by me and every member of our committee, Republican  and Democrat alike. I do not doubt that for a second.   I also do not doubt our ability, under the chairman's leadership, to  put this unfortunate recent chapter of the committee's history behind  us and return to the productive bipartisan tradition that our committee  has known and respected throughout the United States Congress and the  Nation. In doing so, we will, once again, live up to the example that  our Nation's veterans, including Deborah Sampson herself, have set.   I thank the chairman in advance for that. I stand ready to assist him  however I can, as ranking member and as his friend.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Lexington, Kentucky (Mr. Barr), my good friend who is a  member of our Veterans' Affairs Committee. He has been a tireless  supporter of veterans. I have been in his district on several  occasions, and the veterans have no better friend than Congressman  Barr.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman  from Kentucky another 30 seconds.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, certainly I think, on our side of the aisle, we are  going to call for a recorded vote on this. This bill will pass  overwhelmingly, and I congratulate Congresswoman Brownley, who is a  good friend, for bringing this legislation forward. She has worked  tirelessly for this, and I think you are going to see great support.  The VA has a long way to go in doing this.   I will say this. If I am privileged enough to get reelected to this  body and to be placed on the Veterans' Affairs Committee again and to  chair this committee, I will make this statement right here on the  floor now: I will not treat the minority the same way we have been  treated.   The only way we have been able to bring legislation up on this floor  when we are shut out is the amendment process, and we can debate it and  vote it up or down. That is what Americans do.   We should bring these bills up, and if they don't float on their  merit in the majority, I am a big boy, I understand that. If you lose,  you lose, and if you win, you win. But we should be allowed to be  heard.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
