 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  rule we are considering and to speak to the necessity of Congress  repealing the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force against  Iraq.   Repealing the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force is a good  first step towards Congress reasserting its constitutional authority  over when and if the United States goes to war. This country has been  in a state of perpetual war for almost 20 years. We now have members of  the Armed Forces deployed overseas who are the children of soldiers who  were sent to war under the 2002 AUMF.   Under Article I of the Constitution, Congress has the sole authority  to decide whether to allow the President to take the country into a  prolonged war. Before this Nation sends our children, our  servicemembers into harm's way, Members of Congress have the duty to  consider and approve or disapprove such use of force. Americans have  the right to hold us accountable for those decisions.   Repealing the 2002 AUMF does not impede the President's ability to  use military force without congressional approval in the event of a  sudden threat or imminent attack, but we cannot continue to operate  under a system where U.S. Presidents can place American troops in  harm's way with no checks or balances. That is unacceptable.   Congress' failure to repeal or replace the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs for  two decades has done lasting damage to the constitutional separation of  powers between Congress and President. It is time for this practice to  end.   I urge all of my colleagues to approve this rule and vote to repeal  the 2002 AUMF.
