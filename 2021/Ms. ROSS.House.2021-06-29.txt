 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise today in support of the Inspector General Independence Act.  Inspectors general are vital to the integrity, efficiency, and efficacy  of our Government. It is crucial that they operate free from political  influence.   This critical legislation includes a bipartisan bill I introduced,  the Inspector General Access Act, which grants the inspector general of  the Department of Justice the authority to investigate misconduct by  DOJ attorneys.   The DOJ inspector general is currently the only Federal inspector  general without this authority. This is simply unacceptable.   DOJ attorneys wield a tremendous amount of power, including the  ability to make life and death decisions. It is crucial that these  attorneys are held to the highest level of professionalism, and that  their actions and conduct are subject to independent oversight.   For this reason, I wholeheartedly support the Inspector General  Independence Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
