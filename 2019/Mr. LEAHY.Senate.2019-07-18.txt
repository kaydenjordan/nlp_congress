 Mr. President, this week America celebrates the fiftieth  anniversary of a monumental achievement for our country and all of  humankind, the Apollo 11 mission that landed the first human beings on  the Moon.   Like families across America and across the world, our family  gathered in front of the television in our living room that Sunday  night of July 20, 1969, to watch this history unfold. I was State's  attorney then, and we lived in a duplex in Burlington.   Our 5-year-old son Kevin asked if he could stay up late to watch, and  of course, Marcelle and I agreed. He stretched out on the floor in his  PJs. He had nodded off by the time the images from the Moon started to  come across, and we roused our little fellow.   We knew this was a night we would always remember.   The next day, I went to court for an arraignment. Then I met with  police officers about several matters, and we all had a hard time  concentrating as we excitedly discussed what we had seen the night  before.   As Neil Armstrong so famously said, his one small step was a giant  leap for all of humanity.   As he and other astronauts often noted, that leap was made possible  not just by his step, but by the small steps of thousands of men and  women across America who participated in the space program, including  some from the town of Vergennes, VT.   Today, 50 years ago, the Apollo 11 mission was hurtling toward the  moon, but getting to the Moon is not a matter of just pointing the nose  of a craft and igniting the powerful engines. First, the command module  had to dock with the lunar expeditionary module, then leave Earth's  orbit, then navigate to get into lunar orbit, and then return.  Throughout the process, Michael Collins needed to use the craft's  engines, known as a burn, to adjust the heading.   But with no option to refuel, these burns had to be precise and  effective, and any deviation from the planned fuel usage had to be  worked into future plans. Otherwise, there would be no return for  America's heroes. This is where Vergennes came in.   Vermont has a long tradition of building precision tools and  machinery, and NASA turned to Simmonds Precision of Vergennes, VT, to  ensure that the Apollo 11 crew and Mission Control knew exactly how  much fuel they had. The fuel probes and valves had to be as nearly  perfect as possible, and they had to perform perfectly in varying  levels of microgravity. It was an immense technological challenge,  which the engineers and workers in Vergennes met.   Fifty years later, the company is still there. Now operating under  the name Collins Aerospace, they still make fuel probes, along with  other aerospace technology that seems to be able to do the impossible.  When you enter the factory, along their wall of history, the Apollo  Program commands a special place of pride. It is a reminder of how the  small steps taken by Americans everywhere, when working together, can  accomplish tremendous leaps.   I ask unanimous consent that a recent article about one of the  engineers from Vergennes, published by the Burlington Free Press, be  printed into the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              [From the Burlington Free Press, July 17, 2019]           Vermont Company Played Key Role In Apollo Moon Mission              (By Joel Banner Baird, Free Press Staff Writer)   A former engineer with Vergennes-based Simmonds Precision describes the                 company's role in the Apollo space program         Something clicked when Dominique St. Pierre heard President       John F. Kennedy declare, in 1962, that the U.S. would land       men on the moon by the end of the decade.        ``It was gutsy,'' St. Pierre, now 74, remembers.        JFK's challenge prompted St. Pierre, then an 18-year-old in       St. Albans, to hone his engineering skills at Vermont       Technical College, sign on with Simmonds Precision in       Vergennes in 1965 and help design and build a fuel system for       the Apollo moon mission.        Three years later, the first-ever astronauts to orbit the       moon were measuring their craft's precious propellant with       Vermont-made gauges, valves and meters.        His collaboration with more than 200 employees at Simmonds       yielded a tool that performed flawlessly throughout the       Apollo program, St. Pierre said.        A thrilling, disruptive American decade        Simmonds, subsequently bought by Goodrich and then United       Technologies, went on to design and build fuel sensors for       Boeing and Airbus, among other customers. St. Pierre stayed       with the company until he retired in 2019.        But the fast-paced years leading up to the successful moon       landing on July 20, 1969--and Apollo 11 crew's safe return--      remain vivid for St. Pierre.        The space program offered a welcome, uplifting message for       Americans shocked by the Chicago riots of 1968, as well as       the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F.       Kennedy in that year, St. Pierre said.        `We had a schedule to meet'        Engineers at NASA kept the Simmonds crew very busy and       focused, he added: ``We worked long, long days. Come hell or       high water, we had a schedule to meet.''        St. Pierre remembers the dust-free workplace in Vergennes,       bustling with technicians in white smocks and surgical caps.        But, despite America's global, cold-war rivalry with the       Soviet Union that extended into those countries' space       programs, there was little secrecy at Simmonds--beyond the       safekeeping of papers that documented test results, St.       Pierre said.        Excitement built when NASA flew him to Cape Kennedy (now       Cape Canaveral), where he joined hundreds of other engineers       in fitting together thousands of interconnected pieces of a       never-before assembled puzzle.        ``To this day, 50 years later,'' St. Pierre said, ``it's       still viewed as the greatest technological achievement of       mankind.''   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)  [[Page S4943]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, ``Show me your papers.'' Those are words  that you should never hear once inside the United States. Unless a  government agent has a legitimate reason to stop and search you--a  reasonable suspicion or probable cause--Americans should not be subject  to questioning and detention for merely going about their daily lives.  This is a fundamental tenet of the Fourth Amendment. Yet Customs and  Border Protection (CBP) operations are effectively immune from the  Fourth Amendment within a broadly defined ``border zone.''   And this so-called border zone need not be near the border at all:  Seventy-year-old regulations define it as up to 100 miles from any  border, land or sea. According to the CBP, southern Vermont is in the  border zone, as is the entire State of Florida, and even Richmond,  Virginia. In fact two-thirds of the entire U.S. population is in the  border zone.   In Vermont, under the Trump administration, the border zone has  resulted in highway checkpoints and bus boardings. In May, Customs and  Border Protection (CBP) agents set up the first highway checkpoint in a  decade. The checkpoint was set up miles from the Canadian border in  South Hero, Vermont. It was in operation for hours. We do not know how  many hundreds of cars were stopped, but we do know that it did not lead  to a single arrest or seizure. Last month, the CBP established a second  checkpoint in the same location. This time nearly 900 cars were  stopped, and only one individual was detained--for a visa overstay.  Border Patrol agents have also boarded Amtrak trains in White River  Junction and boarded a Greyhound bus at the Burlington airport,  demanding to know whether passengers were citizens.   Today, I am joining with Senator Murray in reintroducing the Border  Zone Reasonableness Restoration Act of 2019. Our legislation would  establish critical privacy protections by reducing the unjustifiably  large border zone from 100 miles to 25 miles.   I find it difficult to believe that these checkpoints are an  effective use of law enforcement resources. Border Patrol stations in  Vermont are already stretched thin, And just last month the Senate  passed a bipartisan $4.6 billion emergency supplemental appropriations  bill to address the humanitarian crisis on the southern border. The  Department of Homeland Security's limited resources should be focused  on improving conditions of detention and providing food, appropriate  shelter, and medical care to families fleeing violence and dire  poverty, not conducting pointless vehicle checkpoints miles from the  northern border in Vermont.   The Border Zone Reasonableness Restoration Act is based on an  amendment that Senator Murray and I successfully attached to  comprehensive immigration reform legislation in 2013. The 100 mile  ``border zone''--and the similar 25 mile zone where many types of  warrantless property searches are permitted--predates this current  administration, but the actions of this administration have shown just  how much we need it. That bill passed the Senate with a bipartisan vote  of 68 to 32.   Americans' right to privacy does not end simply because you are  within 100 miles from our land and sea borders. I hope all members of  Congress will join us and support this commonsense legislation to  ensure that every person in this country receives the constitutional  protections to which they are entitled.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Brown, Mr. Cardin, Ms.          Baldwin, and Ms. Smith):   S. 2184.
