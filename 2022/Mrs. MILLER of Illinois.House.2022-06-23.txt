 Madam Speaker, today is a historic day as  the Supreme Court upheld the Second Amendment right to keep and bear  arms.   I thank President Trump for appointing Justices who defended the  constitutional rights of gun owners.   It is unfortunate that at the same time the Supreme Court is  upholding our Second Amendment rights, Congress is working behind  closed doors to push unconstitutional red flag gun confiscation.   I strongly oppose efforts by the House and Senate to infringe upon  the Second Amendment rights of my constituents, and I urge this body to  reject the gun control legislation.                            ____________________
