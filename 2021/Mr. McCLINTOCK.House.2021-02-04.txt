 Mr. Speaker, we are now nearly 1 year into the most  self-destructive social experiment in the recorded history of human  civilization.   On this day 1 year ago, we enjoyed the greatest economic expansion in  our lifetimes. The poverty rate was at its lowest in 60 years. The  unemployment rate was the lowest in 50 years. Wage growth was the  strongest in 40 years. The wage gap was narrowing, with blue-collar  wages rising the fastest. Unemployment rates for minority groups and  women were at the lowest ever recorded.  [[Page H328]]    Then, over the course of just a few catastrophic weeks, our  government took a wrecking ball to it all. In the second quarter, GDP  plunged by one-third, the worst decline in productivity ever recorded.  Unemployment skyrocketed to its highest levels since the Great  Depression. Tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs. Trillions of  dollars of the Nation's wealth were squandered.   In the months since, our children have been robbed of a year of their  education. Millions of Americans have been forbidden from earning a  living by their own government. Shopkeepers have seen their life's work  destroyed, and when in desperation they try to hold on, they are led  away in handcuffs.   Our most cherished rights to worship freely; to peaceably assemble;  and not to be deprived of our lives, liberty, or property without due  process of law have all been destroyed.   Now, COVID did not cause this damage. Public officials did. They  promised us it was for our own good and that it would save lives. But  mounting evidence in multiple scientific studies is putting the lie to  these sophistries. It is becoming increasingly, tragically, and  bitterly clear that the lockdowns have not only failed to save lives,  but they are costing lives.   Last month, the University of Denmark released the results of a study  comparing Danish municipalities that locked down with those that did  not. Their conclusion: The lockdowns had ``statistically insignificant  effects.''   Their conclusion mirrored a similar study out of Stanford University  that compared eight lockdown nations and two non-lockdown nations. They  concluded: ``We fail to find an additional benefit of stay-at-home  orders and business closures.''   Now, these are studies based not on assumptions and models but on  actual, real-life, hardcore data. That is what the science is telling  us, and it is telling us the same thing for multiple studies: The  lockdowns have not saved lives, certainly not to any statistically  significant level.   But it gets worse, much worse. We are now seeing mounting evidence  that the lockdowns are costing lives on a staggering scale. Last month,  the National Bureau of Economic Research warned that increases in  poverty caused by the lockdowns will cost more than 800,000 American  lives over the next 15 years due to higher poverty levels, with the  deaths disproportionately affecting African Americans and women. That  comports with a U.N. warning that tens of millions of people worldwide  are being pushed to the brink of starvation.   Suicide rates have jumped dramatically over the past year. Dementia  deaths between March and September jumped 13,000 as patients were left  with little means of social interaction. San Francisco reported that  additional deaths from drug overdoses exceeded the total COVID deaths  in 2020.   According to The Wall Street Journal, the CDC reported 475,000 excess  deaths in the United States at a time when it was reporting 281,000  COVID-related fatalities. Now, that difference is 192,000 additional  deaths unexplained by normal mortality and COVID combined.   Could it be this is the butcher's bill from a folly that has produced  skyrocketing suicides, drug and alcohol deaths, domestic homicides,  isolation-related deaths, delayed health screenings, delayed health  treatments, and poverty-related deaths?   Unlike COVID, which is a curse brought us by nature, lockdown deaths  are the fault of specific individuals in positions of public trust who  imposed draconian restrictions out of panic, fear, ignorance, or  egotism. They preened and virtue-signaled and boasted how much they  cared for the lives of others while they have pursued a folly that is  needlessly taking an appalling toll of lives and livelihoods.   Some of those responsible hold power by virtue of appointments by  elected officials while others are elected officials themselves, and I  fear this nightmare will not end until the officials who are  responsible for it are removed from the offices they hold.                            ____________________
