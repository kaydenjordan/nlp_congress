 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Madam President, in December of 2015, nearly 200 nations  gathered in Paris in order to reach an agreement that each country  would make a commitment to the reduction of dangerous greenhouse gases  that were warming the planet and causing more and more havoc across  this entire world.   That agreement is something that was hard-won. It took the leadership  of the United States because so much of the CO2 that had  been sent up into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial age  was red, white, and blue. It called upon each nation to make a  commitment, and they did. The countries making commitments equaled 80  percent of the world's greenhouse gas emitters.   The Trump administration has many advisers telling the President that  he should pull out of this Paris Agreement, that he should cede  leadership to  [[Page S2791]]  the Germans, to the Chinese, and to other nations rather than having  the United States continue to be the leader. That would be very  dangerous for our country because we would be ceding leadership in this  clean energy revolution to other countries around the planet.   There are still many who do not understand the role this clean energy  revolution is already playing inside our country. In 2016, we deployed  nearly 24,000 new megawatts of wind and solar on our planet. To put it  another way, in 2005, the total amount of solar energy that was  deployed in the United States was 79 megawatts--79. In 2016, we  deployed 14,000 megawatts of new solar power.   Wind--last year, we deployed another 8,000 megawatts in our country.  We are heading toward a point where we have an incredible number of  people who are working in these industries. Remember, there are no more  than 65 to 75,000 people who are still working as coal miners in the  United States. In Massachusetts alone, we now have more than 100,000  people who work in the clean energy sector. In wind and solar alone in  our country right now, we have 360,000 people who work in those  sectors.   By the year 2020, if we just continue at the pace at which we have  been moving over the last several years, there will be 600,000 people  working in the wind and solar sector. That is the future. That is where  we should be going. Those are the goals we should be trying to reach.   Instead, what President Trump is saying is that the United States is  a technological weakling, that the United States cannot do it, that the  United States can't find the capacity to be able to meet this  challenge, that we have to give up.   The President says he is going to revive the coal industry, a 19th  century industry, instead of trying to have the United States be the  leader in this world on the production of clean energy technologies.   Last night, I was at the Kennedy Library, and we were celebrating the  100th birthday of President John F. Kennedy. On that occasion last  evening, the library presented to Barack Obama his Profile in Courage  Award. Amongst other things that were cited was his commitment to  dealing with this challenge of climate change that is affecting our  planet and the role that the United States can and should play in the  solving of that problem.   President Obama promulgated last year a Clean Power Plan. That Clean  Power Plan was intended to reduce greenhouse gases in the utilities  sector by 32 percent by the year 2030. President Trump has already  said: We can't accomplish that. We can't figure that out. We don't know  how to reduce those greenhouse gases.   In 1961, President Kennedy said that we were going to put a man on  the Moon in 8 years and return those pilots back to Earth safely. We  had to invent new metals. We had to invent new propulsion systems.  President Kennedy said that we were not going to do it because it was  easy but because it was hard.   We were threatened by the Soviet Union for supremacy in outer space.  President Kennedy challenged our Nation to respond to the threat of the  Soviet Union, and we won.   Here we are, nearly 60 years later, with another challenge, a  challenge that threatens this planet. President Trump says that as a  nation we are not up to the challenge. As a nation, we can't figure out  how to solve this problem, even though the solutions are already out  there and being deployed across this Nation.   Another example of solutions like wind and solar: Elon Musk has a new  all-electric vehicle that is going to cost $35,000 and is going to be  deployed next year; 400,000 of these vehicles are to be sold. That is a  game-changing moment in the history of the automobile, going back to  its invention. It is a game changer. To a certain extent, for existing  industries, it is a game-over moment unless they get into this all- electric vehicle revolution.   What is Elon Musk doing? Elon Musk is creating a Darwinian, paranoia- inducing environment within which all of the rest of these automotive  companies are now going to have to operate--go electric or perish  economically as a company.   This is how far it has come: Right now, Tesla has a market value that  for all intents and purposes is equal to Ford and to General Motors.  That is how much the American people have given in terms of confidence  in this company, in this man.   We can do it. It should be the President of the United States who is  saying we can do it. The rest of the world expects us to do it.   Why do we continue to import oil into our country from Saudi Arabia?  Why do we continue to import oil from other countries around this  planet? Why can't the President set as a goal that we are going to have  100 percent renewables in our country by the year 2050, that we are  going to accept it as a national challenge in the same way that  President Kennedy accepted the challenge in 1961 to put a man on the  Moon, to control, to dominate in outer space?   This is a letter to President Trump, which is in today's New York  Times. The full-page ad says:         Dear President Trump,        As some of the largest companies based or operating in the       United States, we strongly urge you to keep the United States       Paris Agreement on climate change.    What are the names of these companies? Adobe, Apple, Danfoss,  Facebook, Gap, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Ingersoll Rand,  Intel, Johnson Controls, Mars Incorporated, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley,  National Grid, PG&E Corporation, Salesforce, Schneider Electric,  Unilever, VF Corporation.   This isn't the President challenging companies in our country to  respond to the challenge. These are the companies in America  challenging the President to respond to the challenge. It is the  Kennedy era on its head; it is like JFK in reverse. He is saying we  can't do it when the private sector is saying we can.   Ultimately, this challenge to our competitiveness globally is  something that Donald Trump is going to forfeit for our workers. This  opportunity to create jobs and markets and growth is going to be  something that we lose.   We need a President who is going to stand up for this stable,  practical framework, which is giving an incentive to the private sector  to solve this problem. We will be creating jobs while saving all of  creation. That is what the winning formula is going to be.   This Paris Agreement is going to lead to increased competitiveness in  jobs, in economic growth. By remaining a party to the Paris Agreement,  rather than retreating, we will give Americans the opportunity to  harness that can-do spirit and technical know-how to create new  businesses and jobs. We will give our Nation the opportunity to be a  leader in the global effort to address climate change. We will give  America the opportunity to lead in this century and into the next.   I urge the United States to remain in the Paris Agreement. We can  either be the leader or the laggard internationally in developing the  new clean energy technologies that will drive our economy and help  combat climate change.   It is a sad day for our Nation when the President of the United  States is challenged by the private sector to step up, especially when  he calls himself the CEO President of our country. He is turning his  back on these innovative companies that want to be able to create jobs  here in our country in order to save our planet. I pray for the well- being of our planet and that the President honors this commitment.   I think that the French made a huge statement yesterday in electing  their new President, Macron. He was saying to the French people: We  must engage the rest of the planet. We must work with the rest of the  planet.   The Paris Agreement was signed in France in December of 2015. That  election yesterday, I think, should be taken as a signal that we should  not be retreating from our global leadership.   I urge this administration to adopt an approach that does unleash  further this wind and solar and all-electric vehicle revolution.   With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
