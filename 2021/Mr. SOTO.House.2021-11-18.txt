 Madam Speaker, headline: Democrats deliver for the American  people again. Democrats deliver for Central Florida, again. Lowering  prescription drug prices and capping costs for seniors. Extending child  tax credit payments. Paid family leave and lower childcare costs for  Central Florida families.    Providing nearly 1 million Floridians with an expansion of the ACA,  boosting affordable housing, immigration reform, the largest effort to  combat climate change in history.   And unlike the GOP tax scam that busted the deficit by $400 billion  and $4 trillion in debt, we pay for ours with major corporations, and  the wealthy paying their fair share.   Madam Speaker, the Republicans are doing nothing but divide. The  Democrats are delivering for America.
