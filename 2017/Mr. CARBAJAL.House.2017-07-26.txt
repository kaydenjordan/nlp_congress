 Mr. Chair, I want to thank all of my colleagues for  their leadership and work on this important amendment to strike this  harmful rider, to prevent implementation of the National Ocean Policy.   The National Ocean Policy ensures we are able to implement marine  planning efforts based on management components of the National Ocean  Policy. It also allows coordination between Federal agencies to make  sure they are working in a collaborative manner to improve our ocean's  health.   This brings all stakeholders together, including conservationists,  fishermen, scientists, shipping companies, and those who live and work  in our ocean communities, and it will allow them to have a voice in  finding solutions for effective management of our oceans.   Healthy sustainable ecosystems and economic growth are not mutually  exclusive. That is why we need to make sure we strike this harmful  rider.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
