 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3462, the  bipartisan SBA Cyber Awareness Act.   As we all know, small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and  they are certainly the backbone of my community. However, these small  businesses are also increasingly the target of cyberattacks and theft  of data and intellectual property.   Unfortunately, Federal agencies are not immune to such attacks  either. For more than 20 years, SBA's Office of Inspector General has  listed IT security as one of the most serious management and  performance challenges facing the agency.   During the pandemic, demand for relief programs like PPP and EIDL  have overwhelmed SBA's IT systems. As a result, a glitch in the EIDL  application system led to an exposure of personal information of over  8,000 applicants with no public announcement of the data breach until  weeks later.   The SBA Cyber Awareness Act would direct SBA to issue an annual  report assessing its cybersecurity infrastructure. The bill would also  require the SBA to report cyber-threats, breaches, and cyberattacks to  the House Small Business Committee and the Senate Small Business and  Entrepreneurship Committee and notify affected individuals and small  businesses within 30 days of an incident.   Cyberattacks are one of the biggest threats to our economy, small  businesses, and way of life. This bill would ensure that we are doing  everything we can to protect the millions of small businesses that the  SBA serves and prepare them for 21st century threats.   I would like to thank Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member  Luetkemeyer for the bipartisan support and my friend, Young Kim from  California, for joining with me on this very important effort.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join with us and  support this bill.
