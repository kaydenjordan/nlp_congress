 Madam Chair, I rise for the purpose of placing  a name in nomination.   What a privilege we all are enjoying tonight, we are all enjoying as  elected Members of this great body; the people's House, as it has been  said. What a great representation of the constitutional Republic in  which we enjoy living, the greatest country in the history of the  world, as we play out as the people's Representatives in selecting the  all-important position of the Speaker of the people's House.   I was out on the southeast balcony here just a few moments ago  looking out at the Supreme Court, looking at the flag flying above this  Capitol Building, looking at the Jefferson and Madison--both  Virginians, by the way--Library of Congress buildings, and pausing to  do what probably most of us recognize we fail too often to do, to take  it in, this high privilege, this distinct honor that we have to be the  people's Representatives from our respective districts in this House  here in this Congress.   This is the greatest Nation in the history of the world. With all of  our imperfections as people and as a Nation, no nation in the history  of the world has freed more people, has rescued more people, has  ministered to more people, has evangelized to more people than the  United States of America. And that would be a good time to respond with  some applause.   There is a reason why people from all over the world are trying to  get into this country, many of them illegally, due to the policies of  the current administration. People from all over the world are  literally taking on a treacherous journey, risking life and limb,  [[Page H31]]  subjecting themselves to abuse to try to sneak their way into our  country because they know this is the greatest country in the history  of the world.   No country in the history of the world has provided more upward  mobility, more advancement opportunity to people of all races, all  nationalities, all ethnicities like the United States of America.   However, we as a Nation, we are teetering on the brink, aren't we?  Isn't there just a window of opportunity to save the Republic? Crisis  after crisis. $32 trillion in national debt, which equates to over  $90,000 per citizen, almost $100,000 now per citizen, some $300,000 per  household. When I said that on this very floor a few months ago in a  budget debate, the then-chairman of the Budget Committee said, ``Stop  saying that; we are not asking anybody to pay it back,'' as if it is  not real, as if it is Monopoly. As I heard someone say, don't tell the  other side what happens after trillion, what comes after trillion.   We just spent $1.7 trillion, both parties--Republicans joining in the  Senate, a few in the House--to pass a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending  bill.   Sadly and unfortunately, part of the reason why I stand here today,  that was the kind of bill that has been supported by our former  minority leader every time it has come up in the House, no matter who  was in control in the 12 years that he has been in leadership,  contributing to the $32 trillion in national debt. Yes, the other side  is better at raising the debt than we are, but we have been  participants.   We are in crisis. We are in crisis with 5 million illegals having  invaded the border in the last 2 years. When is it too much?   We are in crisis with the state of our education system, K-12,  college campuses, indoctrination of our kids.   We are in crisis with the weakening of our military, with these NDAA  bills.   We are in crisis with trampling on our most basic and essential  freedoms over the last 2 years in ways we couldn't have imagined pre- 2020: Whether we can assemble, whether we can worship, whether we can  earn a living, whether we can travel, what we have to put on our face,  what we have to take into our body, whether or not we have to disclose  what we have taken in; trampled in ways we couldn't have imagined just  a few years ago.   The greatest reflection of where the people in the country are is the  House of Representatives, and the people spoke back on November 8 and  gave the majority by some 3 or 4 million votes to the Republican Party.   It is not the White House, it is not the Senate, it is the people's  House that reflects where the American people are, and they have  trusted us on this side of the aisle with the leadership of this House.  We have a window of opportunity to validate that trust, to do whatever  we can to save the Republic, to earn them giving us the Senate and the  White House and this House back in 2024.   We have got to have a leader who not only has true conservative  convictions that reflect the majority of Republicans who sent us here,  but yet a courageous leader. It doesn't matter what you believe, by the  way, unless you are willing to take risk to yourself personally to  fight for it. We need a leader who has proven to do that very thing.   We have an opportunity to make history. We will live with the  decision on this side of the aisle for the next 2 years. We will answer  for how we voted.   I know how people in all the respective districts, like mine, Madam  Chair, how they are telling us to vote. They have been telling me how  to vote for 3 years, to vote for transformational change in the  leadership of this Republican Party. They have told me not to vote for  the status quo, not to vote for the next in line establishment creature  of the swamp cartel, but to vote for transformational change.   And they are watching us. They are wondering if we will hang in there  or will we cave or will we give in or will we let them down one more  time.   I say, we are not going to do that. They are looking to us.   You look and see what a great job a recent businessman did in the  White House, did things no one else has ever done in the White House,  did things that no one else has ever done to try to change the country,  showed courage, common sense, and judgment we have not seen before.   We need a businessman as the Speaker of the House. We need a  businessman like Kevin Hern as Speaker of the House. We need a  businessman like Kevin Hern who has led the Republican Study  Committee's Budget & Spending Task Force that I have served on for 2  years and put forth the only balanced budget that I have seen--heck,  the only budget that I have seen--in the 2 years that I have been here,  who fought alongside us to say why don't we adopt the Republican Study  Committee's budget for the Republican Party? And we didn't get  agreement to do that.   We need someone who will do that. We need someone who is the head of  the largest caucus in the Republican Conference, someone like Kevin  Hern.   It is my privilege to put into official nomination Kevin Hern for  Speaker of the House.   The CLERK. The Reading Clerk will now call the roll.   The tellers having taken their places, the House proceeded to vote  for the Speaker.   The following is the result of the vote:                               [Roll No. 13]                               JEFFRIES--212       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Auchincloss      Balint      Barragan      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bowman      Boyle (PA)      Brown      Brownley      Budzinski      Bush      Caraveo      Carbajal      Cardenas      Carson      Carter (LA)      Cartwright      Casar      Case      Casten      Castor (FL)      Castro (TX)      Cherfilus-McCormick      Chu      Cicilline      Clark (MA)      Clarke (NY)      Cleaver      Clyburn      Cohen      Connolly      Correa      Costa      Courtney      Craig      Crockett      Crow      Cuellar      Davids (KS)      Davis (IL)      Davis (NC)      Dean (PA)      DeGette      DeLauro      DelBene      Deluzio      DeSaulnier      Dingell      Doggett      Escobar      Eshoo      Espaillat      Evans      Fletcher      Foster      Foushee      Frankel, Lois      Frost      Gallego      Garamendi      Garcia (IL)      Garcia (TX)      Garcia, Robert      Golden (ME)      Goldman (NY)      Gomez      Gonzalez, Vicente      Gottheimer      Green (TX)      Grijalva      Harder (CA)      Hayes      Higgins (NY)      Himes      Horsford      Houlahan      Hoyer      Hoyle (OR)      Huffman      Ivey      Jackson (IL)      Jackson (NC)      Jackson Lee      Jacobs      Jayapal      Jeffries      Johnson (GA)      Kamlager-Dove      Kaptur      Keating      Kelly (IL)      Khanna      Kildee      Kilmer      Kim (NJ)      Krishnamoorthi      Kuster      Landsman      Larsen (WA)      Larson (CT)      Lee (CA)      Lee (NV)      Lee (PA)      Leger Fernandez      Levin      Lieu      Lofgren      Lynch      Magaziner      Manning      Matsui      McBath      McCollum      McGarvey      McGovern      Meeks      Menendez      Meng      Mfume      Moore (WI)      Morelle      Moskowitz      Moulton      Mrvan      Mullin      Nadler      Napolitano      Neal      Neguse      Nickel      Norcross      Ocasio-Cortez      Omar      Pallone      Panetta      Pappas      Pascrell      Payne      Pelosi      Peltola      Perez      Peters      Pettersen      Phillips      Pingree      Pocan      Porter      Pressley      Quigley      Ramirez      Raskin      Ross      Ruiz      Ruppersberger      Ryan      Salinas      Sanchez      Sarbanes      Scanlon      Schakowsky      Schiff      Schneider      Scholten      Schrier      Scott (VA)      Scott, David      Sewell      Sherman      Sherrill      Slotkin      Smith (WA)      Sorensen      Soto      Spanberger      Stansbury      Stanton      Stevens      Strickland      Swalwell      Sykes      Takano      Thanedar      Thompson (CA)      Thompson (MS)      Titus      Tlaib      Tokuda      Tonko      Torres (CA)      Torres (NY)      Trahan      Trone      Underwood      Vargas      Vasquez      Veasey      Velazquez      Wasserman Schultz      Waters      Watson Coleman      Wexton      Wild      Williams (GA)      Wilson (FL)                               McCARTHY--200       Aderholt      Alford      Allen      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bean (FL)      Bentz      Bergman      Bice      Bilirakis      Bost      Buchanan      Bucshon      Burchett      Burgess      Burlison      Calvert      Cammack      Carey      Carl      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chavez-DeRemer      Ciscomani      Cline      Cole      Collins      Comer      Crawford      Crenshaw      Curtis      D'Esposito      Davidson      De La Cruz      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Duarte      Duncan      Dunn (FL)      Edwards      Ellzey      Emmer      Estes      Ezell      Fallon      Feenstra      Ferguson      Finstad      Fischbach      Fitzgerald      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flood      Foxx      Franklin, C.
