 Madam President, the Senate has a lot of important  business to attend to before we adjourn for the August State work  period.   As a reminder to all of our colleagues, here is our considerable to- do list for this week: Later this morning, we will vote to confirm two  more of President Trump's impressive nominees for district courts:  Michael Liburdi for the District of Arizona and Peter Welte for the  District of North Dakota.   They are just the first two in a significant group of judges--19 in  all--that the Senate needs to process before we wrap up the week. We  can't head home without making another big dent in the backlog of  qualified district judge nominees whom partisan obstruction has already  kept waiting entirely too long.   In addition, the Senate is not going anywhere until we confirm two  impressive nominees to executive branch positions that play a vital  role in U.S. foreign policy and national security. Ambassador Kelly  Craft is President Trump's excellent choice to serve as our Ambassador  to the United Nations. David Norquist is his pick for Deputy Secretary  of Defense.   Needless to say, these are troubling times in a troubled world. We  need to get both of these highly capable public servants on the job  this week.   Finally, we must also pass the bipartisan government funding  agreement that President Trump's negotiating team worked out with  Speaker Pelosi. Given the realities of divided government, it is a  strong deal that achieves my Republican colleagues' and my No. 1  priority: continuing to invest seriously in rebuilding the readiness of  our Armed Forces and modernizing them to meet the challenges of today.   The Trump administration has negotiated their way to a major win on  defense. The House has passed the compromise legislation. The President  is ready and waiting to sign it.   Once the Senate passes it later this week, he can sign it into law,  taking funding crises and long-term continuing resolutions off the  table, and pave Congress's path toward a regular appropriations process  that will provide the resources our military commanders and our  servicemembers need to keep us safe.   I urge all of my colleagues to join President Trump in support of  this legislation when we vote on it later this week.  [[Page S5152]]                                ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, as Senate  majority leader, it is my honor this morning to acknowledge a truly  remarkable legacy of service to the Senate and really to the Nation.   Next month, the Senate Page School will say goodbye to its beloved  principal. After 26 years heading up this unique institution, our very  own Mrs. Kathryn Weeden is starting a new chapter as a very deserving  retiree.   For more than a quarter century, Principal Weeden has been a constant  anchor in a place where rotation and change are par for the course.   The Page School, as we know, welcomes a new class of high-achieving  young people from all across the country every semester. These  students' experience is most famous for the fast-paced, hands-on  exposure to the inner workings of American government it involves, but  in the early mornings and late evenings, when they are not delivering  bill text around the Capitol, assisting Members on the floor, or  engaged in any number of tasks that help this place actually run, they  are also dealing with the academic rigors of the 11th grade.   There are 30 teenagers at a time living, studying, and working full  time on Capitol Hill. Needless to say, keeping this unique arrangement  running smoothly is less than an ordinary job--even a full-time one-- and more like a life's mission. By all accounts, it is a mission  Principal Weeden has executed with constant competence, total  professionalism, and the utmost grace.   Now, if I had to guess, a large share of that grace was spent in 5  a.m. meetings most mornings. That is typically when she would first  encounter what I am sure were the most chipper and alert 16- and 17- year-olds around. While the hundreds of pages who have worked, studied,  and grown under Principal Weeden's watch may not miss their early  morning math class, they sure will miss her. They are left with lasting  memories of her attentive mentorship and compassion.   Among recent graduates of the Page Program, some of whom I have been  proud to sponsor through my own office, the conclusion is clear:  Principal Weeden is simply the best.   They remember the way she would make time for weekly one-on-one  meetings to check up on their progress and talk about their future  goals. They remember the way she radiated excitement leading the school  in assembling care packages for servicemembers deployed overseas. They  remember her knack for reassuring words and for helping them put the  daily stresses of high school in perspective.   Inevitably, after 26 years, Principal Weeden's legacy is counted in  the flood of letters sharing stories like these following the news of  her retirement, but it is also measured in her commitment to transform  the Page School as a top-notch academic institution.   It is thanks to her no-nonsense leadership that this unique program  has earned and maintained accreditation, that its rigors have earned  the attention and respect of prestigious universities, and that it  continues to attract talented and passionate educators to carry on in  her example.   Unsurprisingly, the colleagues and faculty whom Ms. Weeden has  mentored and supervised are no less enthusiastic in their praise than  her former students. Talking to them about their departing boss, you  hear words like disciplined, nurturing, and patriotic. You are painted  a picture that looks something like a Mother Superior, a no-nonsense  administrator, an exacting leader, and a true friend all in one.   Being entrusted with the care, feeding, education, and maturation of  so many young men and women over so many years would be an  accomplishment no matter where Principal Weeden had worked, but to do  all that at the Senate Page School means something even more. To a  special degree, her legacy will have helped, formed, and shaped  America's civic future for the better.   Because she gave of herself so generously to a special class of young  people--those who are so interested in our American Government that  they just had to come see it firsthand--today, the Senate celebrates  this outstanding legacy and warmly congratulates Principal Weeden on  such a tremendous accomplishment. We thank her for all she has done,  and we wish her nothing but happiness in the years that lie ahead.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture  is invoked on the Hendrix nomination, all postcloture time expire at  2:45 p.m. today and the Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination;  further, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, following disposition of the Jordan  nomination, the Senate vote on the motions to invoke cloture on the  following nominations in the order listed: Executive Calendar Nos. 205,  231, 232, 233, 326, 327, 345, 350, 352, and 364, and then up to 10  minutes of debate under the control of Senator Menendez prior to the  vote on cloture on Calendar No. 402. I further ask consent that if  cloture is invoked, the confirmation votes on the nominations be at a  time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the  Democratic leader. Finally, I ask consent that the cloture motions on  the following nominations be withdrawn: Executive Calendar Nos. 48, 55,  344, 346, 351, and 394, and the Senate vote on the  [[Page S5178]]  nominations at a time to be determined by the majority leader in  consultation with the Democratic leader.    Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to  H.R. 3877 be withdrawn and that at a time to be determined by the  majority leader in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate  proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3877. I further ask consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, if cloture is filed on H.R. 3877, there be  up to 2 hours of debate, equally divided between the leaders or their  designees. I ask consent that the only amendment in order be Paul  amendment No. 932 and that following the use or yielding back of that  time, the Senate vote on the amendment with a 60-affirmative-vote  threshold needed for adoption. Finally, I ask consent that following  the disposition of the Paul amendment, the Senate vote on the motion to  invoke cloture and that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be  considered expired.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of the Norquist nomination, as  under the previous order.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.
