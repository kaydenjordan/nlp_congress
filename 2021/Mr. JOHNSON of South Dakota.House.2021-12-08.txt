 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   It is impossible for any American to ignore the supply chain crunch,  a supply chain crunch that seemingly impacts most every part of the  American economy.   In that kind of an environment, I want to echo so much of what my  friend from California said. I am indeed thrilled that the House is  taking up this bill today. I am grateful for his leadership. I am  grateful to be the lead Republican on this, and I am grateful that this  bill has been endorsed by 360 national, State, and local groups. This  is much-needed legislation.   How did we get here? With a massive influx of Federal dollars into  the economy and with COVID-19 changing how Americans purchase goods,  for more than a year, United States ports have faced unprecedented  volumes of cargo. Some estimates say that American demand for consumer  electronics has gone up 40 percent compared to prepandemic. This  pressure on our ports has trickled down to every other part of the  supply chain, leading to what Americans have seen: delays and product  shortages.   Now, those constraints and the resulting extremely high shipping  rates have made it more difficult not just for our country to receive  imports but also for us to ship our manufactured goods and agricultural  goods out to the rest of the world.                                time  1100    We have seen unprecedented rejection of American container loads by  the large ocean carriers. They are in contravention of their  contractual obligations, just refusing to haul that cargo, preferring  instead to take the empty containers and get them back to Asia for a  quick turn. That has caused serious problems, not just conceptual  dollars, real dollars, real cents. The American dairy industry has seen  $1 billion worth of losses just in the first 6 months of this year.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I am a big fan of the free market, but the free  market is many buyers and many sellers, and that is not in place today.  Mr. Garamendi so rightfully talked about the consolidation we have seen  in this industry. And indeed, 30 years ago the largest foreign-flagged  ocean carriers controlled about 15 percent of this traffic. Today, they  control about 75 percent. That is not quite the free market that we  used to have.   And so, H.R. 4996, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021 helps to  address these supply chain bottlenecks. It helps to promote American  competitiveness. And it holds accountable these foreign-flagged ocean  carriers, which I would note are increasingly dominated by Chinese  state-backed firms.   Now, let me be honest and let me be clear, this bill is no silver  bullet, but shame on us if we fail to act. This supply chain crunch has  laid bare the deficiencies in the marketplace, and we have an  opportunity today to address many of those deficiencies.   Probably the most common question, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues ask of  me about this bill is why a Congressman from the plains of South Dakota  would be so interested in maritime law. I would just remind them of the  world's great hunger for American beef, American beans, American corn,  and American dairy. Indeed, 60 percent of South Dakota's soybeans are  exported abroad.   In that environment this is not just a coastal issue, but it is an  issue that impacts lives from the farm gate to every Main Street.   And indeed, I have been hearing from South Dakota businesses like  Strider Sports International in Rapid City to Valley Queen, a cheese  processor in Milbank, and they are telling me about how these issues  are having a real impact on dollars and cents.   Valley Queen has two million pounds of lactose. This is a product  that has already been sold to Asian markets, and it is just sitting  there in their warehouses waiting for an opening at  [[Page H7477]]  the ports. A recent container load of this lactose waited on the ports,  Mr. Speaker, for 75 days. The lactose began to turn, and, of course,  that meant a big deduction on the price that Valley Queen could get for  that lactose. Just a destruction of American value.   This bill is about American competitiveness. Broadly speaking, the  legislation provides the Federal Maritime Commission--that is the cop  on the beat--the tools they need to make sure that this system runs  more efficiently and runs more fairly and makes sure that the interests  of the foreign-flagged ocean carriers are better aligned with the  interests of American shippers.   So the bill does a number of things, but I will quickly hit on just  five.   First off, under this bill the FMC can set minimum standards for  ocean shipping that makes sure that U.S. shippers are protected from  the actions of others which leave export cargoes stranded at U.S.  ports.   Number two, it protects U.S. shippers from retaliation if they file a  complaint with the FMC.   Number three, this bill prohibits the foreign-flagged ocean carriers  from unreasonably denying American export cargo on their vessels.   Number four, it requires foreign ocean carriers to certify the  accuracy of the detention and demurrage fees. These are fines they can  hit shippers with; they have to certify that those fines are accurate.   And number five, it would authorize the National Academy of Sciences  to study how best to improve transparency in the supply chain.   Now, I just don't know, Mr. Speaker, how any of my colleagues can  allege any of these things are not reasonable. These are very basic  guardrails. These are very basic rules of the road that people who are  using American ports should be obligated to follow.   And so the choice for my colleagues is simple, a vote for H.R. 4996  is a vote to put U.S. shippers, manufacturing, farmers, truckers,  retailers, and consumers first. That is where they should be.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just note Mr.  Costa's unyielding advocacy of this project, this issue and thank him  for that support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Carbajal for  his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.  Gibbs), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and  Maritime Transportation.    Mr. Speaker, I want to take an  opportunity to thank Chair DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves for the  various hearings they have had in talking with Chairman Maffei,  Commissioner Dye, and others on the FMC about these issues. I thank Mr.  Garamendi and others for bringing up this legislation in a number of  hearings we have had on the supply chain crunch. I think it has helped  to fill out the record on these incredibly important issues and the  role that this legislation can play in advancing this cause.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and  I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, there are a few things that I know for sure. The first  is that when you use American ports you should be subjected to some  very basic rules of the road. Things like not being allowed to  unreasonably discriminate against American cargo, that is one thing I  know for sure.   Another thing I know for sure is that although this bill is not a  silver bullet, and nobody is alleging that it is only the ocean  carriers that are responsible for this supply chain crunch, this will  help. This better aligns the interests of the ocean carriers with the  interests of American manufacturers and American farmers and ranchers.  That will go a long way toward helping to resolve the supply chain  crunch.   Mr. Speaker, finally, one more thing that I know for sure, and that  is when you have 360 national, State, and local groups, when you have  90 Members of Congress, when you have a bipartisan coalition that has  come together to embrace this concept in what is all too often a  partisan environment, then I think you know you have a good policy  solution.   With that in mind, I once again thank the gentleman from California  for his leadership, and I urge all of my colleagues to support the  bill, and ask the Senate for their expeditious consideration of it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just echo the  thoughts of Mr. Garamendi that there have been so many who have worked  together, and really a broad national coalition, and he is exactly  right to call attention to the people who do the work behind the  scenes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let's be honest. It has been a pretty difficult few  years to be a cattle producer. People in that business understand the  cyclical nature of prices, so that is not so much their beef, if you  will.   But in that environment, it is much more difficult to have black swan  event after black swan event hit these hardworking men and women. From  [[Page H7489]]  the Holcomb fire to COVID-19 disruptions, it has been an incredibly  volatile marketplace. They are trying to make a living and they are  trying to pay their bills in that kind of environment with less price  transparency than they have ever had.   Now, it used to be relatively easy. Of course, I think we all know  that price discovery is a critically important part of any fully  functional marketplace. It used to be easy. You just went down to the  sale barn, you sat in the seats, and you were able to see exactly what  Mr. Mann was selling his cattle for and exactly what Mrs. Hartzler was  buying them for.   But as we have seen a migration of sales away from the sale barn and  to alternative marketing agreements, that has left our producers less  prepared to understand what is going on in the marketplace.   That is why I was so grateful to see a broad cross-section of  stakeholders come together in Phoenix a few months ago. They said: Gosh  darn it, we are tired of having the livestock industry fight amongst  each other. Let's settle on what we can agree on, things that we can  actually get done in the 117th Congress.   Mr. Speaker, they came out of that meeting with a clear clarion call  for what Congress can do to help. There were three majors items, but  the cattle library, along with the bill we just passed, the Livestock  Mandatory Reporting program, were the heart of one of the three  recommendations.   What this bill does is takes the information, basic nonconfidential  information, from those alternative marketing agreements and makes it  available, and it makes sure that there is a mechanism for that  information to be put into resources that can actually be used by the  independent cattle producers and the small feeders that are so  critically important to this marketplace.   This has been widely bipartisan, and this is embraced by a fantastic  cross-section, from the U.S. cattlemen to NCBA to Farm Bureau to  National Farmers Union to the Livestock Marketing Association, good  people who have come together and understand that while this does not  solve the problem, it is a critically important step in moving us in  the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the  real leadership that Mrs. Hartzler has shown on these issues for years  and thank her for that.   One of the great things about Congress is most of us were just normal  people before we got here, leaders in our industry, and the next  speaker is certainly that. He is somebody who understands the finance  of ag operations and the operation of these farms and ranches. He is  one of the strongest freshman voices in Congress.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Miller), a Member who has firsthand  experience with the true operation of America's farms and ranches.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know that I can say it any better than the  Members of Congress here who have so much firsthand experience with  working ranches and farms. This is a beautiful bipartisan solution.   If you believe in the marketplace, then you understand the importance  of price discovery, and you cannot have price discovery if you don't  have transparency. This just provides additional leverage and  additional tools to the hardworking, independent cow-calf operators and  small feeders who have seen their position, their leverage, in the  marketplace erode in recent years.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enthusiastically  support this promarket legislation. I look forward to the Senate  expeditiously taking up this issue as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa), the lead  Republican on H.R. 4489.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Rosendale), another leader  in this effort.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   I think it has been said very well. Mr. Rosendale just reminded us  that this only mirrors the authority that other agencies have to be  able to gather up the interest from those interest-bearing accounts.   Ms. Schrier did a good job of reminding us that had this been in  place in recent years, it would have been $7 million more that could  have been invested in forest management and in forest health. And I  just want to echo all of those findings.   This is absolutely a commonsense, bipartisan bill, and I am looking  forward to its passage.   But I can't let the passage of this bill, which would be a big  success, go by without calling attention to how much more needs to be  done with regard to forest health.  [[Page H7492]]    I remain disappointed, as so many do, of the fact that this Congress,  this administration has not prioritized highly enough forest  management.   Mr. Speaker, here is what I know from the Black Hills of South  Dakota: A managed forest is a healthy forest. And I want to say that  one more time because there will be no truer statement spoken on the  House floor on this day: A managed forest is a healthy forest.   Today, millions of acres in this country are at risk of severe  wildfire with potentially catastrophic impacts to our communities. Six  of the worst fire seasons on record have occurred just over a period in  the last few years.   Our agencies, Federal partners, communities, and our States need more  tools to proactively manage and mitigate this threat. Again, a managed  forest is a healthy forest.   And so, yes, by all means, let's celebrate this bill. It is an  important technical fix that will improve in a narrow way the funding  needs of the Forest Service. But let us keep in mind, to an even  greater extent, in the days that follow that the resiliency of our  forests remains a critically important national priority, and one that  deserves greater attention from this body.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, I encourage the Members to  vote ``aye,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I hope the body will forgive me a digression before we  talk about chronic wasting disease, which is, as the chairman says,  critically important. I do also want to talk about Mr. Kind.   So many Americans believe that every Member of Congress is a kind of  villain with scales and fangs and horns, and that they are all just  despicable people, or at the very least somebody who belongs to the  opposite tribe is a despicable person. I just don't know anybody in  Congress who believes that is true of Ron Kind.   I will recount a story about a dinner where I had my two oldest boys  with me. One of them was seated next to Mr. Kind. My son stole Mr.  Kind's dessert, and rather than erupt in anger or an accusatory finger  wag, he handled it with great grace and friendship. My boys remind me  still of that evening spent with Mr. Kind.   Mr. Speaker, as he seeks, certainly, a less stressful and perhaps a  better and more rewarding future, let us remark on the type of impact  that a decent person can still have in these Halls, and this bill  before us today is ample evidence of that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  would consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), one of  this body's leading voices in policing, in mining, in infrastructure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thought Mr. Kind, Mr. Stauber, and Mr. Scott said it  all very well. This is important because chronic  [[Page H7495]]  wasting disease can wreak such havoc upon our herds.   I want to start by thanking Chairman Scott for facilitating the  timely consideration of this bill, and not just this bill, sir, but  also livestock mandatory reporting, the cattle contract library, and  Ms. Schrier's forestry bill.   These came together, sir, and I want to thank you for that. I want to  recognize Mr. Kind, as well as Mr. Thompson, for the work that they put  into this important bipartisan solution.   I also want to express my appreciation for the coalition that Mr.  Kind mentioned, such a broad coalition of stakeholders from the farmed  and wild deer stakeholder groups and the sportsmen community at large.  They provided a tremendous amount of insight so we could get this  legislation right, and they were relentless in working with all of us  to find common ground to craft this legislation and make sure that it  was able to pass out of committee unanimously, and, hopefully, we can  get a similar vote off the House floor.   As it has been said, but as it bears repeating, chronic wasting  disease is a contagious, neurological disease that affects deer and elk  and moose. It is always fatal. Unfortunately, it is not a highly  localized disease particular to a particular State or region of the  country. CWD has been detected in 27 States. Given the lack of any  known cure, I fear that that number of States will only continue to  grow.   H.R. 5608 authorizes up $70 million of much-needed appropriations  each year with the funding split evenly between CWD research and  management efforts, all of this with the hope of one day eradicating  this disease altogether.   The funding would support high-priority research to improve CWD  detection methods and to continue invaluable research on genetic  resistance. It would support the use of the latest and most effective  on-the-ground management tools and strategies at the State and Tribal  levels.   The bill would also help improve public awareness of the disease by  requiring the development and dispersal of educational materials which  would be based, obviously, on the latest available science.   Mr. Speaker, I know combatting this devastating disease would be a  slow and challenging process, but I think we should all acknowledge  that passage of this bill would be a critically important step in that  journey and can help us protect those vulnerable deer populations.   I appreciate my colleagues' attention to this matter, and I urge the  entire House in casting a resounding ``yes'' vote on the bill. I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. LaTurner for  yielding.  [[Page H7528]]    It has been said before, but it bears repeating: 24 days. That is how  long Tribal Governments have to utilize their CARES Act funding before  the December 31 deadline.   I talked to a number of Tribes that, rather than rushed to spend this  money in recent months, tried to be thoughtful and deliberate about how  to make these critically important investments. As a result, a number  of them have millions of dollars left unspent.   In that kind of environment, it is proper and prudent for us to  extend the deadline, and we should do so. That is why I wholeheartedly  support this bill.   But I wouldn't feel right if I didn't point out that there is a  better way, and it is, indeed, right before us, Madam Speaker. The  solution is S. 3011, the State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Fiscal  Recovery, Infrastructure, and Disaster Relief Flexibility Act.   Now, the House companion to that Senate bill has been led by  Democratic Representative Carolyn Bourdeaux and myself. It has  overwhelming support--125 bipartisan cosponsors.   Our bill would do the exact same thing as the one before us tonight.  Well, that is not quite right. I think our bill is superior in a few  ways.   First off, it doesn't just provide flexibility to Tribal Governments  as this bill would rightfully do. It also provides that kind of  flexibility to States and localities that also desperately need it.   That is not the only way in which the Bourdeaux-Johnson bill is  superior, and the dean of the House alluded to it earlier when he was  talking. Our bill has already passed the Senate. This bill has not. In  fact, the bill that I am talking about passed the Senate unanimously,  and it has been sitting on the Speaker's desk since October 20.   Yes, it is true we find ourselves with only 24 days for Tribal  Governments to act, but it didn't have to be that way, and it doesn't  have to be that way.   My question for the Speaker would be: If our bill was good enough for  100 Senators, why is it not good enough for the House?                                time  1715    And this legislative approach just means that we are going to go a  few more days until tribes have the certainty they need.   So Madam Speaker, I would close with this. If we brought S. 3011 up  tonight and passed it, it could be law before midnight and tribes would  not have the uncertainty that they continue to face.
