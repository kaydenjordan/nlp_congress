 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the passage of  legislation this week called the AMIGOS Act. It is a bill that will  spur Portuguese investment in our economy and help create jobs here in  America.   As a proud Portuguese American and a co-chair of the Congressional  Portuguese Caucus and a member of the Hispanic Caucus, I joined with  Congressmembers Cicilline, Nunes, and others, in being the original  cosponsors of the AMIGOS Act. I want to thank my colleagues this week  for their support in the passage on a bipartisan basis.   Our friendship with Portugal and the contributions of hardworking  Portuguese American immigrants are an important part of our country's  history and our heritage, as well as our economy.   The United States is Portugal's largest trading partner outside the  European Union. In 2018 alone, trading between our two countries  reached in excess of $5 billion. This will only increase that economic  activity, because this bill will make it easier for Portuguese  investors, business people, to increase their operations in the United  States, growing both our economies, drawing our nations even closer  together, and creating more jobs.    More than 100 Portuguese companies today already have operations in  the United States. What do those operations do? They create jobs. They  create opportunities. And they build additional prosperity on both  sides of the Atlantic.   We have done our part. Now it is time, we hope, that the United  States Senate will do their part so that we can send this bill to the  President that has, again, strong bipartisan support. It will obviously  be good to get this measure passed, hopefully, before the end of the  year.   Senators Whitehouse and Toomey, again bipartisan, have already  introduced their version of the legislation, the AMIGOS Act, in the  United States Senate. We thank them for their strong efforts and their  partnership.   Sharing prosperity in this instance can only benefit both the United  States and Portugal, and it is this kind of commonsense trade policy  that we need to be advocating for, along with continuing to build on  our partnerships both within the European Union as well as within South  America and with Asia, and, of course, with our closest neighbors,  Canada and Mexico.   Trade obviously done properly can create good-paying jobs in America  and benefit our relationships and our economic activity with those  countries who we value the most.                            ____________________
