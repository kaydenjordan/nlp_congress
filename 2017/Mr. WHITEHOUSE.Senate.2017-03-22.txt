 Mr. President, on the day of the news reporting the  World Meteorological Organization is  [[Page S1922]]  declaring that 2016 was the hottest year ever recorded, and further  declaring that the planet is now in what they call, ``truly uncharted  territory,'' I rise for my 161st ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, in this  case to update my colleagues on the state of our oceans.   I am from the Ocean State. In January, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration released a report with the U.S. Geologic  Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency, researchers at Rutgers  University, Columbia University, and the South Florida Water Management  District.   The report updates global sea level rise estimates--perhaps not a big  issue for Colorado but a big issue for Rhode Island. It made region- specific assessments for our American coastline. Based on updated peer- reviewed scientific literature, the report raised the previous upper  range, or extreme, scenario for average global sea level in the year  2100 by an additional half a meter.   NOAA and its partners then tailored their findings to the U.S.  coastline based on regional variations in ocean circulation and  gravitational pull and local land conditions like erosion, subsidence,  and groundwater depletion, all of which affect the local impacts of  global sea level rise. They found that under the higher scenarios, all  regions in the United States, except Alaska, can expect sea level rise  higher than the global mean average. The news was particularly harsh  for the western Gulf of Mexico and for the northeast Atlantic coast-- Virginia through Maine, including my home State of Rhode Island.    Our coastal managers, like Rhode Island's Coastal Resources  Management Council--the CRMC, we call them--are taking these new  estimates seriously and incorporating the high scenario into their  planning. Under the new scenario, the Northeast is expected to see 9  vertical feet of sea level rise by the end of the century. That means  that a child born today in Providence, RI, at Women & Infants Hospital  is likely to live long enough to see this 9-foot vertical sea level  rise take place along our shores.   By the way, when you go up 9 feet, the shore goes back many, many  hundreds of feet in many places. In Rhode Island, what CRMC is now  planning for is between 9 and 12 vertical feet of sea level rise for  our State. That is going to hit Rhode Island communities pretty hard.   Rhode Island's CRMC and our University of Rhode Island have developed  together something called STORMTOOLS. It is an online research tool  that projects the effects of this sea level rise and additional storm  surge onto the State's coastal properties.   The tool actually now needs to be updated because it currently maxes  out at 7 feet of sea level rise, which was the previous high scenario.  Now that we have raised it to 9 to 12 feet, they are going to have to  go back and redo it.   This is what it looks like based on the 7-foot max. Here is 7 feet of  sea level rise in Newport, RI. This is the harbor. This is downtown  Newport. America's Cup Avenue, which runs right through there, will be  taken out. Through this area are a lot of very successful businesses  that appeal to the people who come to visit historic Newport, RI.   Through here, we have some of the most significant working wharves  still in the Newport area. Then this area here, called The Point, is a  historic section that goes back into the 18th and in some cases 17th  centuries. These buildings, of course, will be flooded. There is the  downtown Newport fire station in the middle of that as well, so it  affects our safety infrastructure.   This is further up the bay in Rhode Island. This is Barrington here.  This is the town of Warren. As you can see in the blue, there are a lot  of places where homes and businesses go underwater just under the 7- foot scenario. Some of the stuff that goes underwater is pretty  critical.   Here in this bluish part is the Warren wastewater treatment plant.  You can't have a wastewater treatment plant that is under water, so  that is a very significant investment for Warren to have to face.   I went to the Warren Town Hall not too long ago to meet with the  manager and the folks who work there to hear from them about what they  needed in order to accommodate this new risk.   Remember that the sea level rise that we are looking at here is just  the floor that high tides and storms ride in on. In this simplified  illustration, we can see a coastal city with sea level rise encroaching  on its infrastructure. Then we add to that the king tides. When  celestial bodies line up so the tides are stronger than usual and,  therefore, higher than usual, they are called king tides. That is not a  scientific term, but it is the lay term for them.   These king tides already push water into the streets of Miami and  over the tops of the wharves of Boston on clear, sunny days--just from  the tide. If you add on top of that a strong coastal storm, our city  here does not stand a chance. Homes are destroyed, businesses are  ruined, damages reach the billions, and lives perhaps are lost.   America's coastal communities are not prepared for the future. Part  of that is because so many people are denying the prospect of this  future, but also we haven't caught up.   Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps are the things that  guide flood insurance for most coastal property owners. FEMA's  estimates, however, fall alarmingly short, we have discovered, for  coastal communities like those in Rhode Island, as the FEMA studies  rely on outdated data and incomplete models. This means that people  along America's coast who rely on these models can be lulled into a  false sense of comfort if their home falls outside one of FEMA's high  risk zones but, in actuality, is in harm's way. So Rhode Island  officials are out right now trying to educate everyone living and  working along our State's coast about the flooding dangers that are  fueled by climate change.   It is not just State officials. Insurance and mortgage companies are  starting to take these changes into account. Even the government-backed  mortgage giant, Freddie Mac, is girding for broad housing losses from  climate-driven flooding. Let me quote them: ``The economic losses and  social disruption may happen gradually,'' Freddie Mac says on its  website, ``but they are likely to be greater in total than those  experienced in the housing crisis and great recession.''   Think about that. That is pretty serious business, if you are saying  that the housing damage and the consequent financial harm is going to  be greater than the housing crisis and great recession that we just  lived through.   Some effects of climate change may not even be insurable, Freddie Mac  says, and unlike the 2008 housing crash, owners of homes that are  literally under water--not just financially under water--would have  little expectation of their homes' values ever recovering and,  therefore, little incentive to keep making mortgage payments which  would, in turn, add to steeper losses for lenders and for insurers.  This is deadly serious economic business.   Shoreline counties are just 18 percent of the United States in land  area, but they account for around 38 percent of the country's  employment and 43 percent of our GDP. Each year, the sea and storms  will take a higher toll on the roads, the bridges, the seawalls, the  power and wastewater treatment plants, and the military facilities that  serve that economically productive shore.   Despite all this, President Trump's proposed ``America First'' budget  blueprint zeros out the Global Climate Change Initiative, ends U.S.  contributions to international climate change programs, eliminates EPA  programs that conduct climate change research and implement the Clean  Power Plan, ends NOAA's coastal and marine management, research, and  education grants and programs, including the sea grant cooperative  research program, shifts NASA's Earth science budget, which includes  climate research, out to deep space exploration, and cuts funding for  the Department of Energy's Office of Science.   Obviously they don't like science very much.   The President's proposal--if enacted--would accelerate the grim  future laid out in NOAA's sea level rise report and in Rhode Island's  STORMTOOLS projections. As that grim future accelerates, it is actually  science that gives us the headlights to perceive the oncoming threats.  Cuts to CRMC of as much as 60 percent would cripple the STORMTOOLS  project that provides Rhode Island our headlights.  [[Page S1923]]    The laws of thermodynamics will still govern the rise of our warming  ocean waters. That is not going away. The laws of chemistry will still  cause carbon dioxide to acidify seawater. That will not stop. The laws  of biology will still affect vital coastal ecosystems and valuable  ocean species and transmit the harms of climate change into those  areas.   The laws of economics mean that this will all have a pretty bleak  effect on the prosperity of Americans. All that it gains is that we  will just be blinder to what is coming at us.   If the President were to forgo just one weekend at Mar-a-Lago, which  POLITICO and the Washington Post estimate costs U.S. taxpayers $2 to $3  million each weekend, that money from one weekend could fund Rhode  Island's entire sea grant program for a year, helping us guide offshore  energy and commercial ocean development, protecting important fishing  grounds and the State's vital fishing industry. That is economic effect  in Rhode Island.   When the ocean starts lapping on the stairs of Mar-a-Lago, President  Trump may be hard-pressed to continue denying what all of our  scientific agencies are reporting and predicting. This graphic from the  Boston Globe shows at 7 feet of sea level rise what is in store for the  President's posh resort. The NOAA high scenario for that area actually  projects for Florida's Atlantic coast sea level rise just over 8 feet  by the end of the century--though this image understates the flooding  that is going to take place at Mar-a-Lago in this century. That just  shows 7 feet of sea level rise. An added foot of water not shown, plus  that king tide problem I discussed, and storm surge--when you have a  good wind kicking up, and it blows the surface of the ocean and raises  the tide further--will all amplify these effects. Bye-bye, Mar-a-Lago.   It is time that we in Congress put fossil fuel interests aside. They  have had their way with us quite long enough. It is time for us to  start doing what is right by all of the Americans who live and work  near the coast and will be facing this predicament in the real world.   If the President and this Congress remain beholden to this shameless,  polluting industry, we will lose our chance to protect ourselves. It is  time that we wake up to the reality of climate change, wake up to the  reality of sea level rise, wake up to the reality of ocean  acidification, and start to do something about it.   We can't say we weren't warned. We are just rotten with fossil fuel  money and will not listen.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.
