 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in opposition to the amendment.   Many of these amendments reflect, frankly, the costly Green New Deal  policies of the Progressive left. We think they mandate dramatic and,  frankly, unrealistic changes to our energy and transportation systems  with little to no consideration for affordability, or especially the  reliability of energy for Americans, or our growing dependence on China  for critical minerals.   That China supply chain is something I think we could find common  ground on at some point, and we must, as a country.   The bill ignores hardworking blue-collar workers and rewards so- called green-collar workers instead.   Provisions that we thought we had reached common ground on in the  Energy and Commerce Committee were stripped out.   These amendments will provide billions of dollars of additional  grants and assistance to cities in urban areas, but at the expense of  rural America. We are one country, and we should be united in assisting  our people, regardless of where they live.   The amendments expand rebate programs and create a patchwork of new  energy-efficiency standards, raising costs for consumers.   If there is one thing I hear most, it is people are concerned about  how costs are going up, especially during this period.   They provide even more green giveaways, things like appliances and  vehicles, at a time when most Americans are struggling with the  economic fallout from this pandemic.   Clearly, Democrats want to spend the taxpayers' dollars on their  Green New Deal wish list, following the lead of California, who has had  its own set of problems with reliability on its energy grid.   None of these issues raised by these amendments have gotten a hearing  or debate in committee. One of them, dealing with the Klamath River  Dams around my district, would short circuit the public licensing  process at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It steps all over  this public process that is enshrined in law.   It is a blatant attempt to legislate the removal of these dams, and  wherever you are on that issue--for or against removing the dams--we  think this sets a dangerous precedent by rolling back the longstanding  protections and due process afforded through the well-established  Federal licensing process. So both sides should be concerned about that  amendment in this bill.   Republicans offered amendments to lower the cost of energy. We  offered amendments to develop innovative new technologies, and we  offered amendments to reduce permitting delays.   Unfortunately, Democrats refuse to let those amendments be debated on  this House floor or voted on this House floor.   The Democratic amendments we are all debating today will not result  in meaningful reforms to the permitting and licensing process so we can  rebuild our economy and recover from the COVID pandemic.   So I have to urge my colleagues to join me in opposing these  amendments and the underlying bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have one more speaker who wanted to speak,  but he is not here.   I apparently have the right to close, so if the gentlewoman would  like to go ahead while we wait for our other Member, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, and I, again, I think I outlined pretty clearly some of  our concerns with this measure. I think there is a lot we could find  common ground on in the energy picture, certainly for working Americans  and especially those dealing with the pandemic. But raising costs and  increasing delays is not part of what we can support.   I urge opposition, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of these amendments which are  focused on ways to improve options and reduce the cost of energy for  American consumers. Our amendments put consumers first.   These amendments also address important issues such as grid  reliability--that means when you flip the light switch, the lights come  on consistently; streamlining research at the Department of Energy to  promote innovation and technological development and nuclear research  for advanced nuclear power.   There are also much-needed efforts to reduce our reliance on critical  minerals, especially from China. Republicans have been sounding the  alarm about our growing reliance on critical minerals and their use in  all sorts of energy technologies. This is how we make batteries,  windmills, and solar panels and we have become too dependent on foreign  countries for those critical minerals.   We are also very concerned that the underlying bill, which is based  on the Green New Deal, will trade away our energy independence and make  us more reliant on countries like China and their abysmal record on  human rights, environment, and trade.   So, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  these commonsense amendments to H.R. 4447, and I reserve the balance of  my time.                                time  1200     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), who is the top Republican on the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee and the former chairman of the Agriculture  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to say in response to my friend and the  words that he read, the groups he has identified, the notion that they  would have these statements about wildfires in the West when, for 20  years, I have battled them to try to get more active forest management  in our Western forests, and they oppose nearly everything we have tried  to do to get our forests back into balance with nature. It is just a  bit absurd today, as someone who has seen the devastation, and then  seeing their politics and the fundraising they do off this and the  scare tactics they level, and then the destruction that occurs to  habitats, wildlife, forests, and forested communities. And they stand  in the way of it all. So the gentleman can have them.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Johnson).    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time each side has  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my friend from New  Jersey, the chairman of our committee. Unfortunately, however, the fact  of the matter on the blue collar to green collar jobs program is that  the workforce training program would open the door for grants to help  Americans get the education resources they need to be able to work in  these areas. We had agreed that both those who worked in coal jobs and  those who worked in nuclear jobs would be eligible for those grants as  well.   The underlying proposal that came out of our committee provided for  workforce training for those men and women who work in coal-related  jobs as well as in nuclear, but that got stripped out.   So, Madam Speaker, if you are working in the nuclear energy industry  or you are somehow connected to the coal industry, you have just been  taken out of the mix to get additional grants for workforce training.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Graves).                                time  1215     Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much each side has  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the chairman and I have had a wonderful working  relationship during our time on the Committee on Energy and Commerce.   I understand where he is headed with this. I just wish some of the  things had been agreed to in a bipartisan way and the committee would  have held firm as we moved forward with energy legislation. Everybody  has got to do it their own way.   I always figured that if I could come out of the House with a 300- or  400-vote margin and a big bipartisan push, we would have a lot more  leverage with our friends in the Senate, regardless of who controlled  the Senate. But a different path has been chosen here.    Part of what we are concerned about on the Republican side is this  supply chain vulnerability. And what we are arguing here is that we  have witnessed what happens when we have a supply chain vulnerability  during this pandemic. In fact, the very face mask that we are wearing-- this one, actually, my wife made--we couldn't get because China locked  it down.   We have seen that play out. Heck, you couldn't even get toilet paper  and  [[Page H4938]]  paper towels. Now that wasn't necessarily a China problem, but supply  chains matter. Reliability on supply chains matters.   And we have, as a country, locked up access to many of our areas on  mining where you would get critical minerals. And we have relied on  other countries and now, principally, China for our critical mineral  supply chain. And you have to have that for our mobile phones, you have  to have it for batteries. And a lot of things, frankly, we all agree  on, is the future for technology requires critical minerals.   And meanwhile, China has gone around the world and locked up these  resources in Africa and elsewhere, and as a result, they are really  dominant in this space. And I don't want us to be reliant on any other  country, if we can avoid it. I realize we are global and there are  things we don't have here that we need to acquire elsewhere.   Madam Speaker, we offered up these amendments and we look forward to  further debate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber), the distinguished member of the  Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.    Madam Speaker, point of parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, I thought we had gotten past where we  couldn't reconsider, that was part of the motion, and so a recorded  vote was not in order.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend from California's  comments, especially about the smoke and his sympathy for the folks all  across the West, and especially in the Pacific Northwest. I am a native  Oregonian and, tragically, we have been choking on smoke for a very  long time, for decades and decades, as these forest fires have burned  unnaturally because fuel concentrations are unnatural.   You know, we did a great job as Americans with Smokey the Bear and  putting out fires. For 100 years we have fought fire. The problem is  that in the last 50 years there have been court decisions, lots of  litigation, lawsuits to stop active forest management. We lost tens of  thousands of jobs that used to take place in our rural forested  communities of people that would go out and tend to our forests. When  they would harvest, they would replant. If there was a fire, they were  on the scene to help put it out. All that went away through litigation  and lawsuits.   In the early 2000s, I worked with then-President Bush to pass the  Healthy Forests Restoration Act, to allow us to get in, at least in the  wildland-urban interface, and thin out these unnatural stands, get them  back in balance with nature. The Forest Service tells us today 63  million acres of our national forests, America's people's forests, are  at high risk of fire. It is out of balance. We have 7 million of those  acres in my home State of Oregon. 7 million acres. We treat something  like 2 million a year.   Under President Trump and his administration, they have taken this  seriously and they have increased the amount of thinning that is going  on out there to reduce the fuel load by 20 to 25 percent over what it  was when he took office.   Timber harvest is up, too, but you can't catch up at that rate  because forests are very dynamic, they continue to grow, they continue  to die. I have forest scientists who will tell me in some parts of my  State there are literally 1,000 trees on an acre, where in historic  times there might have been 10 or 12.   See, fire naturally would come through and thin out on a regular  basis, and then humans interceded, and said, Well, we are going to stop  fire. And for a long time, they weed-managed it and thinned the forest,  and now all that kind of went by the wayside as well. And, tragically,  now the U.S. Forest Service budget, more than half of it goes to fight  fire. We have had to set up enormous funds to fight fire. It didn't  used to be that way, and now our citizens suffer from the smoke.   In my home State of Oregon, the 10 worst air quality cities in the  world were in Oregon. Oregon. The smoke was so bad when I drove from  southern Oregon, where tragically, one of these fires--it was not a  forest fire, it was a grass and brush fire that got away with an  unusually strong wind, and it just became a blowtorch, and most likely  was started by arson. That fire destroyed more than 2,600 housing units  and deeply, sadly, most of these were mobile homes, mobile home parks,  and low-income housing. The poorest of the poor got hit the hardest.   This was not forest, this was between a freeway and a highway, and it  just took off. It was dry, because, you know, in the West we dry out in  the summer, unlike back here where they get rain with a thunderstorm.  But this wasn't even lightning-caused.   Meanwhile, in the canyons off the great Cascade Mountains, fire  started up there, we don't know how and, in some cases, again, this  high wind may have triggered it with power lines or something of that  nature. People lost their homes, habitat destroyed, communities that  had been there forever, wiped out, lives lost.   So, indeed, we have this situation where, with climate change,  drought, disease, bug infestation, and a neglected forest, conditions  are ripe for destruction. They are ripe for fires like this. But if you  care about--and I think we all do--about the planet and about the  climate and about reducing emissions, then it is a failure of this  Congress, under Democrat rule, to not move forward with the legislation  our colleague, a Yale forestry graduate, Bruce Westerman, has put  forward, to go in and more actively treat these forests to get them  back in balance with nature.   And, more importantly, when 70 percent of the carbon emissions from a  fire occur afterwards from the dead and decaying material that is left  behind, we should be going in like Tribal governments do, county and  State governments do, they go in and manage their forests by removing  the burned, dead debris, where it makes sense, and while it still has  value, and they replant a new, healthy forest. I think we can all  agree, new green trees sequester carbon better than dead, dying ones.  [[Page H4943]]    Science is on our side in this matter, but the politics have not been  on our side in the West. So we have not been able to make progress on  changing Federal law that would actually make our forests and forest  communities healthier and safer, more economically dynamic, and reduce  emissions and fire and smoke.    I have choked on that smoke the last 10 days, as have my constituents  and, sadly, we sent that smoke all the way to Europe and around the  globe, and none of us wants to repeat that.   So, hopefully, we can put old battles behind us. We can do something  to treat American's great forests and get them back in balance. We can  go in and remove burned debris while it has value, creating jobs in our  most impoverished counties, and plant new, green, healthy forests for  the next generation. Indeed, that is our obligation and our duty, and  we should do more.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa), my friend and colleague, a real leader on  natural resource issues.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for  his remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to go back to the issue underlying this, which is wildfires  and smoke. When I chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee, I held  hearings each year, which have been continued under Chairman Pallone,  looking at the health impacts of wildfire smoke on our citizens in  America as relates to the Clean Air Act.   I remember we had a gentleman from southern Oregon who had sent me a  photo of his CPAP, his air-breathing filter, that had turned dark  within a day or two. We had county commissioners tell me that when they  opened their windows at night, the smoke alarm went off in their house.  It was that bad.   We continue to have that, and it has been going on for a very long  time. It is sad we had to get to this point for many to recognize who  don't have to live with that as we all have to.   There is so much more we can and should do, and I appreciate Speaker  Pelosi's comments about fixing the fire borrowing problem. We did that  jointly and in a bipartisan, bicameral way. It was long overdue.   But I am just going to close by saying you still have 60, 70 million  acres of lands out there that we have responsibility for. They are the  public's lands that are completely out of balance. Nature tells us  that. Scientists reinforce that. And we need to do something about  that.   Hopefully--I am leaving Congress at the end of this year--future  Congresses will figure a way through this thicket because if we don't  act, you won't have forests left, and a whole generation will never  know what we have had the great joy to see, big healthy tree stands and  habitat, freshwater and fish, and all of that that is the Northwest. It  is going away in large measure every summer, and it will be a  generation before you can drive over the Cascade Mountains on these  routes and see what we got to see for our generation as it burns up and  goes away.   We need to take out the burned, dead material while it has value. We  need to plant green, new trees. We need to fully understand the impacts  of smoke and then do everything in our power to minimize these fires  and their devastating, tragic, and deadly effects.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
