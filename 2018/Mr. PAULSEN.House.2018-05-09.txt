 Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize National Charter  Schools Week.   Minnesota was a pioneer in the charter school movement, opening the  Nation's very first charter school in St. Paul in the fall of 1992.   Charter schools are tuition-free, independent, public schools that  are open and welcome to all students, no matter ability or need. They  are governed and operated jointly by licensed teachers, parents, and  community members.   Today, more than 56,000 Minnesota children are educated every day in  charter schools, many of them from low-income families. A child's ZIP  Code should not determine the outcome of their education.   As co-chair of the Charter School Caucus, I am pleased with the  bipartisan work we have been able to do to strengthen charter schools  and enable the replication of successful charter programs nationwide.   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the great work being done in charter  schools across the country and thank the teachers and community leaders  who work so hard educating their children.                            ____________________
