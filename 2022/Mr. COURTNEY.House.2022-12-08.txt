 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  bipartisan fiscal year 2023 NDAA.   Madam Speaker, as you know, Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution  mandates that Congress ``shall provide and maintain a Navy.'' The  Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee's work does exactly that.   Our mark increased the number of battle force ships from 8 requested  to 11 and invests in the workforce and supply chain necessary for their  construction. The bill also authorizes the Maritime Administration, for  the first time, to buy 10 new-build sealift vessels to recapitalize our  National Defense Reserve Fleet built in American shipyards by American  workers.   Also included is the first congressional action in support of the  AUKUS security agreement between the U.S., Australia, and U.K. which  establishes joint nuclear training for U.S. and Australian naval  officers, which is critical for an Australian nuclear-powered submarine  fleet of their own.   I thank my colleagues on the subcommittee, particularly Ranking  Member  Rob Wittman, our outstanding  [[Page H8842]]  staff: Jay Vallario, Kelly Goggin, Dave Sienicki, and Naajidah Khan,  and our defense fellow, Lieutenant Logan O'Shea, all who contributed so  much to this measure.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and join Chairman Smith and  Ranking Member Rogers in fulfilling our constitutional duty to our  Nation.
