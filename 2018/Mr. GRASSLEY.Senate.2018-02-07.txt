 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of the following  nomination: Executive Calendar No. 387. I ask consent that the Senate  vote on the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; that no further motions be in order; and that any statements  relating to the nomination be printed in the Record.    Did the Senator make his formal objection?    Thank you.   Normally, I would speak right after the Senator from Texas, but I am  going to call on three of my colleagues who are here to speak because I  have more time than they have. I know the Senator from Texas has to go.  He accurately did describe our relationship, generally, in this body as  Senators from Iowa and from Texas. I want to let everybody know that we  have that good relationship.   We sure disagree on this issue. I am sorry we do. With that said, I  am going to defer to the Senator from Michigan. I want to say that she  is the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee and represents the  farmers of Michigan very well, but also, in her leadership position as  former chairman of the Agriculture Committee and now the ranking  member, she has done a great job of leadership in the area of  agriculture.   Would the Senator proceed.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague who spoke very  highly of the qualifications of Mr. Northey to be Under Secretary at  the Department of Agriculture. I may say just a little bit about his  qualifications, but I want to spend most of my time expressing my  thoughts to my colleagues in the Senate, and to Senator Cruz primarily,  on what I think about the argument over RINs being an impediment to  some refineries operating efficiently, going into bankruptcy, or other  problems they have.   Senator Cruz has said there are some things that could be put  together to help this situation. I will name three of them that I think  would work, and then I will say why I disagree with the Senator from  Texas about the RINs issue and why he thinks that is a solution to it  and why I feel it is not a solution to it.   First of all, my colleague from Texas said there is a problem with  Wall Street speculators. I don't know whether that happens every day,  but it happens sometimes, and it is something that should be taken care  of. I recognized that back in November of 2013, when I wrote a letter  on that very subject urging the regulators to take a position on that.   I think greater transparency of this whole market would be very good  as well. I think that is a possibility. That is something the Senator  and I have discussed as being very helpful, the EPA putting out  regulations on vapor so we could get more ethanol in the percentage of  E15.   I would say his idea of putting caps on RINs will not work because  when you do that, you are getting--the marketplace isn't working. I  suppose I am a little surprised that a free market person like Senator  Cruz would suggest the government step in and cap that. Also, I would  like to speak to the point that in November of last year, 2017, as an  agency, the EPA itself said the RINs market was working, which puts the  Agency in a little bit different position than where we think Mr.  Pruitt, the Administrator of EPA, is coming from.   So, with that in mind, I am going to go to my remarks right now and  express that it is very unfortunate that there is an objection to  advancing President Trump's nomination of Iowa secretary of agriculture  Bill Northey to be Under Secretary at the Department of Agriculture all  because of unrelated concerns over the renewable fuel standard, which  is a law passed by Congress and obviously administered by the EPA.   I am very disappointed that a highly qualified and honorable man like  Bill Northey is being held up for an issue unrelated to his position.  As you heard my colleague say, Secretary Northey enjoyed unanimous  support from the Senate Agriculture Committee and has the support of  numerous agriculture groups from around the country.   Now I will get to the RINs issue and my feeling that this is not a  legitimate reason for either holding up this nomination for the  bankruptcy that has been referred to or for any other refinery that has  trouble.   I think it is a manufactured and baseless rumor that the RFS, the  renewable fuel standard, has caused an oil refinery in Pennsylvania to  file for bankruptcy. This example has been cited repeatedly as a  justification for forcing the renewable fuel standard supporters to  agree to sudden and drastic changes in how the renewable fuel standard  was designed.   I have been trying to work in good faith with the Senator from Texas  and have offered several options--some of them I have just expressed  here in my off-the-cuff remarks--that would result  [[Page S692]]  in lower prices on the RINs issue. As has been said, that stands for  renewable identification number. That is what we call the compliance  credits--to make sure the refineries use the right amount of ethanol to  meet the renewable fuel standard.   However, I keep being told by the Senator from Texas that I need to  accept a proposal for a guaranteed cap on RIN prices in the short term  to save this Philadelphia refinery. Unfortunately for those who are  spreading the rumors that the problems the Philadelphia refinery has  are due to high RIN prices, from my point of view--and I hope I backed  this up in a paper that we have widely disseminated within the last  week--the facts don't add up very well for the people making the  argument that RIN prices are the problem.   My staff and other analysts have read the SEC filings and the  bankruptcy filings of the refinery in question and have come to the  conclusion that the Philadelphia refinery cannot pin its problems on  the renewable fuel standard. The No. 1 problem the Philadelphia  refinery has faced is the result of the petroleum export ban being  lifted, which cost it access to cheaper feedstocks. Another reason, and  the second biggest problem it has, is that a pipeline opened which  diverted rail shipment of Bakken crude oil away from the east coast  because of the pipeline sending it someplace else, obviously raising  the price of the feedstock to the Philadelphia refinery.   We keep being told the refinery is facing hardship because it cannot  afford to buy enough RINs to comply with the renewable fuel standard.  If that is the case, then why did this Philadelphia refinery sell off a  significant quantity of RINs just last fall? That is quite odd,  considering the company needs to turn them in later this month for  compliance with the renewable fuel standard.   Some have said it is executing a market short on RINs, which is  dependent on some sort of Federal action that will suddenly drive down  the cost of RINs. I would point out that shorting the RIN market is  something Carl Icahn is reportedly being investigated for by Federal  investigators. I hope that the Philadelphia refinery is not trying to  follow that same playbook. I certainly want nothing to do with that  kind of chicanery.    Finally, the Philadelphia refinery could have avoided needing to buy  any RINs at all if it had just invested in blending infrastructure  years ago like many of its fellow merchant refineries did. In fact, the  Philadelphia refinery is partly owned by Sunoco, which owns blending  infrastructure.   We also know that refinery has an arrangement whereby it supplies  ethanol with RINs attached to Sunoco for blending with its gasoline.  Other independent refiners with similar arrangements have an agreement  to return the RINs to the refiner once they are detached.   The RFS was created to bring cleaner burning renewable fuels to  consumers. The RINs system was developed as a flexible system that  would allow obligated parties to choose between investing in blending  infrastructure or buying RINs for Renewable Fuel Standard compliance.  The Philadelphia refinery made the decision to buy RINs instead. That  hasn't worked out very well for that refinery apparently, but that was  the bet that refinery made. A cheaper option for Renewable Fuel  Standard compliance exists, and the Philadelphia refinery chose to  pursue other investments.   None of this has anything to do with President Trump's choice to  oversee farm programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.   Bill Northey should be confirmed by this body. He has overwhelming  bipartisan support. Taking a nominee hostage to try to force an ill- conceived policy change is only going to cause more problems for this  body in the future.   I don't know what the next step is, but I think that Bill Northey is  such a good person for this position, I am going to continue to work as  long as he wants me to work for his nomination to proceed.   Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in  the Record an article on this issue of the Philadelphia refinery.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         [From Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), Feb. 6, 2018]                               (By Tom Kloza)      Verleger: PES Bankruptcy Judge Could Inflict Lehman-Like Moment         Noted oil economist Phil Verleger has read the Philadelphia       Energy Solutions (PES) bankruptcy filing and makes no bones       about his verdict. The company is scapegoating the Renewable       Fuel Standard for its financial woes, Verleger says, instead       of properly attributing the demise of the 330,000-b/d       refinery to the end of the long-time crude oil export ban,       antiquated equipment and a lack of investment that kept the       plant competitive with other northeastern refineries.        But most importantly, Verleger sees a possibility that the       bankruptcy judge just might render a decision that could       wreak havoc with the RFS and throw the RINs market into utter       chaos. Bankruptcy papers clearly indicate that PES would like       to get its RIN obligation discharged in the reorganization.       If not, the company would have to purchase and retire RINs       with an aggregate market value of approximately $350 million       at current market prices before a compliance deadline this       spring. It would also need to buy about 550 million 2018       vintage RINs. A buyer of that quantity under current       circumstances might lead to a quick doubling of the renewable       credit asking prices.        But if a bankruptcy judge allows cancellation of the RINs'       obligation, any credibility associated with the RFS program       might be thrown out the window.        There is a legal obligation to blend ethanol and other       biocomponents into transportation fuels and the EPA might       have great difficulty administering the program, even though       the agency has been an advocate. A court decision granting       PES' request for relief might lead to a ``Lehman-like       moment'' that could completely halt RINs' trading, plunge the       value of accumulated RINs to near zero and bring about pure       chaos.        PES' owners blame the U.S. renewable fuels' standard for       their woes, but Verleger disagrees. Failure came about       because the refinery complex is out of date and it is a       merchant refinery with no downstream outlets. It also       operates in a region where flat demand is a victory and       decelerating demand a probability. Financially solvent and       technologically advanced companies can operate under these       circumstances, but the noted oil economist finds no evidence       that critical investments were made PES in the refinery.        The PES bankruptcy filing took place on Jan. 22, and the       RINs' cost of $217 million was the largest expense other than       crude oil costs. When the Trump administration reaffirmed the       government's commitment to the RFS in the autumn, it dealt a       blow to merchant refiners and other processors who hoped to       shift the compliance burden to others. PES CEO Gregory Gatta       told the Philadelphia Inquirer: ``It is unfortunate that the       company was driven to this result by the failed RFS policy       and excessive RIN costs.'' He added that the company ``can       only hope that our filing . . . will provide the necessary       catalyst for meaningful long-term reform of the RFS       program.''        In contrast, Verleger notes that megarefiner Valero       reported net income of $4.1 billion for the year and saw a       quarterly profit of $509 million excluding the Trump tax cut       benefits. Expense for RINs was $311 million in the fourth       quarter, but the company invested $2.4 billion, with half of       it going to ``growth projects.''        Some of those past investments have included logistical       additions and refinery tweaks so that properties could run       heavily discounted Canadian crude.        ``Valero invested. Canadian producers have not. And       clearly, PES has not,'' notes Verleger.        He backdates the lack of investment for several decades.       Some 35 years ago, the Washington Post acknowledged that the       refinery owner at the time (Sun Oil, and then Sunoco) bucked       the trend toward expensive refinery upgrades in favor of       keeping a light sweet more expensive feedstock dependence.        That luck ran out for Sunoco, but PES had a run of several       years during which it could bring inexpensive landlocked U.S.       crude to Philadelphia, thanks to the U.S. export ban. An       investment was made in a $186 million rail-unloading       facility, but refineries were not upgraded. Nowadays, Bakken       crude trades within a few dollars of WTI, so shipping the       North Dakota crude to the East Coast doesn't make economic       sense.        In contrast, Delta Air Lines bought the closed       ConocoPhillips refinery in Trainer, Pa., in 2012, renamed it       Monroe Energy and upgraded the refinery to meet tougher U.S.       specifications. In 2016, some $70 million was invested so       that the plant could produce the lower-sulfur gasoline       required by EPA.        PES hoped to make investments in the refinery from funds       from a proposed IPO, but investors balked at terms. There was       no IPO and no investment.        The end of the export ban on U.S. crude combined with the       completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline eliminated PES'       access to favorably priced crudes. PES had a favorable       position only so long as the export ban was in effect, notes       Verleger.        The refinery isn't just dependent on expensive light sweet       crude. It also produces about 12% of low valued industrial       products that ultimately fetch prices beneath crude costs. It       is much less competitive than nearby PBF, which boasts about       double the PES margins.  [[Page S693]]         ``The owners (of PES) gambled that the large discount of       U.S. crude to world prices would continue enabling the       refinery to continue earning profits.''        Verleger concludes that PES lost the gamble and the growth       of U.S. crude exports has made it impractical and       unprofitable to move Midcontinent crude to East Coast sweet       refineries.        Verleger acknowledges that the RIN market isn't a       particularly efficient market, with inequities incurred by       small marketers who don't get RIN discounts passed along.       Distortions can create an unequal playing field. But finding       the source of the problems is a difficult task, with possible       flaws including hoarding by large traders in the credits.        But he suggests that rather than declaring amnesty on RIN       obligations, a more appropriate decision might be to scrap       the refinery, which was once headed for closure earlier in       the decade. Part-owner Carlyle Group gambled with its own       money (and some government funds) that it could profitably       rail crude to Philadelphia and make money. Instead, the       export ban was lifted, dooming that flawed strategy.     Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I just need 1 minute because all of my  colleagues are waiting to speak now.   For the benefit of the Senator from Texas, I wish to just say one  thing. I don't question that he accurately quoted the union leader at  the Philadelphia refinery, but I also, maybe within the last 2 weeks,  read a statement by the so-called president--and I believe it is the  same person whom we are talking about--that RINs were not an issue.   The other thing that I would add just for clarification of what the  Senator said, that nobody has offered any relief, I have offered to  make two offers. One of them would be the Reid vapor pressure thing,  the issue connected with E15--that could be done by a regulation out of  EPA--and also transparency to make sure the markets work.   I thank the Senator from Texas for his consideration of my effort to  get Secretary Northey confirmed. I am sorry that he has objected, but  that is the way the Senate can work and will work, and we will have to  keep working to get Secretary Northey confirmed.   I thank my colleagues for their patience.    Mr. President, two decades ago, I championed passage of  the Congressional Accountability Act. It was the first piece of  legislation passed by the 104th Congress and the first time in history  that Congressional employees enjoyed any legal protections relating to  harassment and discrimination.   Today, I am introducing a measure to update and improve this landmark  legislation. I call on my colleagues to support these proposed reforms,  which already have passed the House of Representatives. Doing so will  promote greater transparency, accountability, and an improved work  climate in the halls of Congress.   For decades before the enactment of the original Congressional  Accountability Act, our branch of government adopted legislation  setting workplace safety, civil rights, labor and health policies that  directly impacted workers and employers in our hometown communities.  Until 1995, Congress was exempt from these Federal laws, which meant  that Congressional staff enjoyed none of the employment protections  that applied to private sector and executive branch employees.   Because Members of Congress are elected to represent the people, it  seemed to me rather disingenuous that the people's branch had authored  laws that applied to the men and women on Main Street but didn't apply  to the members of Congress who wrote them. Why shouldn't Congress be  held to the same set of standards as everyone else?   That's what prompted me to champion the development of the original,  bipartisan Congressional Accountability Act.   My initial good government effort wasn't met with open arms on  Capitol Hill. It took tremendous effort and half a dozen years to  secure enough support to pass these reforms. The Congressional  Accountability Act finally passed when Republicans gained majority  control of both houses of Congress for the first time in four decades.  President Bill Clinton signed this legislation on January 23, 1995.   The Federal legislative branch employs tens of thousands of workers  on Capitol Hill, in state offices around the country, and in associated  offices, such as the Capitol Police. Thanks to the Congressional  Accountability Act, these legislative employees are covered by over a  dozen Federal workplace laws, including provisions that mandate minimum  wage and regulate overtime; make accommodations for workers with  disabilities; spell out anti-discriminatory policies for workers based  on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or  military service; guarantee family and medical leave; require hazard- free workplaces; clarify collective bargaining rights for union  members; and explain rules about lie detector tests for employees.   The legislation I'm introducing today makes significant reforms, in  three areas, to the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA). The purpose  of these reforms is to enhance transparency, ensure accountability, and  promote a more respectful work climate in both chambers of Congress.   First, this legislation would streamline and enhance the dispute  resolution process for Congressional staff and interns. For example, it  would enable Congressional employees to have access to an advocate who  can offer assistance in proceedings before the Congressional Office of  Compliance. It would require that every Congressional office adopt an  anti-harassment policy. It would make it optional, not mandatory, for  staffers complaining of harassment to engage in mediation. And it would  institute a periodic survey of employees to assess attitudes about  harassment in Congress.   Second, this legislation would make Congressional lawmakers  personally liable for their harassment of employees and interns. It  imposes a 90-day deadline by which Congressional lawmakers must  reimburse the Treasury for awards or settlements of harassment claims.  It bars the use of official House or Senate funds to cover a settlement  of a harassment claim. It also ensures the automatic referral of  harassment claims against a lawmaker to the Ethics Committee.   Third, and finally, this measure would increase public transparency  of Congressional settlement awards. It does so by ensuring that  detailed information on awards and settlements will be reported twice a  year and posted online.   These reforms are overdue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting the immediate passage of the Congressional Accountability  Act of 1995 Reform Act. I also want to take this opportunity to thank  Congressman Gregg Harper for introducing and championing the passage of  very similar legislation in the House of Representatives earlier this  week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, two decades ago, I championed passage of  the Congressional Accountability Act.
