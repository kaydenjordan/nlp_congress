 Madam Speaker, the foundation of America's greatness  stems from its remarkable ability--our remarkable ability--to meet the  moment during times of crisis.   Whether our foremothers and forefathers faced threats from overseas,  economic depressions, natural disasters, or attacks on our own soil,  they rose to the occasion. They met the moment, and history shined  favorably upon their legacies.   And now it is our turn.   The pandemic is an enemy that has already killed 276,000 of our  neighbors across the Nation, and by the time it is over, it will have  likely claimed more lives--American lives--than World War II.   Families are hungry, restaurants and businesses are closing, millions  are unemployed, and each one of them is waiting on us.   But common ground has been found, my friends. A bipartisan, bicameral  framework awaits our action. Time is short, the need is great, and I  implore that we all come together and get it done.                            ____________________
