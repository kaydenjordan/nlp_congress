 Mr. President, we know that America is hurting. It is  reeling from a deadly pandemic that has taken more than 100,000 lives  and then from witnessing the broad daylight murder--murder--of yet  another Black man by an officer of the law. It seethes with rage and  sorrow about the racial injustices that still plague our society.  America is suffering from unprecedented political divisions that are  routinely worsened and deepened by a President whose every utterance  only tears us further apart. In my decades in the U.S. Senate, I have  never seen our country so in need of healing.   I was a prosecutor. So, when I first saw the video of George Floyd's  murder--a human being who was pinned down by the neck, cried ``I can't  breathe,'' and desperately called out for his mother--I was shocked to  my core. For millions of Americans and for me, that shock swiftly  turned into anger.   How could a police officer, who has sworn an oath to protect and  serve, so casually take a human being's life? Why did his fellow  officers who witnessed the murder that we all witnessed on video stand  there and do nothing to stop it? How could this happen in plain sight  when multiple onlookers begged the officer to relent--stop his  murderous conduct--as George fell unconscious?   I was left sickened and shaken.   I do not know and did not know George Floyd, but imagine if he were  your neighbor or your friend. Imagine if George Floyd were your  brother, your son, your husband, or your grandchild. Imagine if George  Floyd simply looked like your loved one and shared the same skin color.  Imagine the concern you would have for such a person who lived in  constant fear of those who are responsible to protect us all. So it is  no surprise that protests swept our Nation in the wake of this murder.  Communities of color and all those who sympathize with them are fed  up. They are sick and tired of the fact that African Americans are  nearly 2\1/2\ times as likely as White Americans to be killed by police  officers. No one of good conscience can sit idly by while African- American lives are treated with less worth. Our country long ago  promised equal rights and equal justice.    Now protesters are aching for real accountability for officers of the  law who engage in lawless violence. It is not simply justice for George  Floyd; it is justice for Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice. The  list goes on and on, which is why the protests go on and on. Too often,  people feel the police officers who take Black lives are treated like  they are above the law. They feel the justice system has been fueled by  a culture of impunity that shields the same officers who abuse the  public's trust. Too often the accountability comes after  incontrovertible evidence, such as a damning video, happens to surface  and the public demands justice.   I can say, as one who served proudly in law enforcement and has  served proudly in the Senate, ultimately accountability will require  dismantling this culture of impunity, as well as ensuring that law  enforcement agencies have training and policies in place to serve to  rebuild trust in communities of color.   The protesters demand more from our justice system. They demand more  from a nation that promises that nobody is above the law. Well, I stand  with them, and Congress has to, too. None of us condone, and indeed I  have strongly condemned, the looting and violence that has sadly taken  place alongside the peaceful protests and the extremists and  opportunists who have co-opted the peaceful process. They are not  serving justice. They are not going to bring the change our country so  badly needs.   My hero, a dear friend who has called me his brother, Representative  John Lewis, said just a few days ago:         [L]ooting and burning is not the way.        Organize. Demonstrate. Sit-in. Stand-up. Vote. Be       constructive, not destructive.    I hope everybody will listen to what Representative Lewis said. I  hope our fellow Americans will heed his wise words. I refuse to partake  in efforts seeking to delegitimize all protesters and create even more  distrust and division. Demonstrators demanding accountability are not  thugs, as President Trump has called them. No one should threaten  state-sanctioned violence against protesters, as this President and  some of his allies have. I strongly oppose any efforts to invoke the  Insurrection Act to unleash our military against these domestic  demonstrations, as President Trump has absurdly threatened.   Our military is one of our Nation's most sacred institutions. It  serves to safeguard our constitutional rights against enemies abroad.  They should never be ordered to American streets as the battlefield,  which would only incite further chaos and deprive Americans of their  right to peacefully assemble. That is not the America we know and love.  It is not the America I know and love.   Unfortunately, President Trump has proven that he is incapable or  perhaps he is uninterested in healing and uniting our Nation. At every  turn his instinct is to divide and escalate. During every crisis he  manages to manufacture another of his own making. When Americans are in  desperate need of a consoler in chief, a role that I have seen every  past President play during my years in the Senate--every one of  [[Page S2668]]  those Presidents, Republican and Democrat alike--President Trump,  instead of being consoler in chief, shows that he knows only how to be  instigator in chief. He has revealed himself really to be a President  of his country in name only. I never imagined I would say that of any  American President of either party, certainly not of all the  predecessors I have had the honor to know.   So we must instead look to ourselves and each other. How do we heal  our country? At the local, State, and national levels, we must carry on  the cause of criminal justice and police reform. We must push for  systematic law enforcement reform. We must elect leaders who will  prioritize racial justice and work tirelessly to achieve some measure  of that. We must work to build bridges in communities so that we better  empathize with the struggles faced by those who have been marginalized  for decades on end.   On Monday, Terrence Floyd, George's brother, stood on the spot where  his brother died. He made an emotional appeal to the hundreds of people  watching and to the Nation. He pled for the protests to remain  peaceful. He pled for those who believe they are marginalized and  disenfranchised not to give up hope, that their voice matters, and he  pled for justice.   His brother died because he needed a breath. His family now asks to  take a breath for justice, a breath for peace, a breath for our  country, and a breath for George. We should honor his memory by heeding  their anguished advice.   There is so much to do. Congress must get to work. During my years in  the Senate, I have seen America in crisis. But every time, without  exception, I have seen America emerge a more just and stronger nation.  The crises America faces today feel overwhelming, historic--some would  say existential. But if we stay true to the values that define our  Republic--equality, justice, the rule of law--I am hopeful we will make  it through as a slightly more perfect union.   I weep for our country; I pray for our country; and I look for better  days.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the authors of our Constitution  purposefully built checks and balances into the foundation of our  democracy, and the power of the purse is a critical part of those  checks and balances. Article 1, section 9 of the Constitution states  ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of  Appropriations made by Law.'' That means Congress, not the executive  branch, is charged with making decisions about how to invest and spend  Federal revenue. As the vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee,  I take this responsibility very seriously.   When Congress appropriates Federal dollars, we expect those dollars  to be used as directed. We expect appropriations laws to be upheld, and  we expect the administration to be transparent in its actions.   But for too many years, Presidents of both parties have encroached on  the power of the purse as they have tried to expand their budgetary  powers and, in some cases, substitute their judgement for that of  Congress. This has been acutely true under this administration. No  President has pushed the boundaries of and contorted appropriations law  more than President Trump.   When Congress refused to give President Trump the money he requested  for a wall on the southern border, he directed his administration to  sidestep Congress and take it from funding for our military and their  families. He continues to do so to this day.   The President wanted to pressure the Government of Ukraine into  investigating his political rival, so he withheld security money for  Ukraine in violation of the Impoundment Control Act. An action that  would eventually lead to his impeachment.   Last year, the administration asserted to Congress that it had the  power to propose rescissions in the last quarter of the fiscal year and  further asserted it had the power to allow the funds to lapse if  Congress did not act on its proposal, essentially claiming the  executive branch, not Congress, had the last word on spending. The  Government Accountability Office, GAO, thankfully and rightfully,  disagreed. Last year, this administration also overturned a long held  precedent that the executive branch did not need to respond to findings  by GAO of violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act. Finally, this  administration has suppressed OMB and executive branch agency  cooperation with GAO in investigating the execution of appropriated  funds.   The push and pull over the power of the purse between Congress and  the executive branch did not start with President Trump and will not  end when he is no longer in office. Administrations of both parties  have clashed with Congress over this authority. But the actions of this  President make clear that Congress needs to reassert itself and defend  its constitutionally granted prerogatives. This should not be a  partisan issue. The Founders chose to vest the power of the purse with  Congress. It is an important part of our system of checks and balances,  and we must defend it.   That is why I am introducing the Congressional Power of the Purse  Act. This bill will restore Congress's central role in funding  decisions, increase transparency in the executive branch, and add teeth  to existing budget laws.   The bill strengthens the Impoundment Control Act, including the  addition of penalties for failure to comply. The bill strengthens  administration reporting requirements and congressional oversight  tools, so Congress can better follow the money and ensure the law is  being complied with. Finally, the bill reforms the National Emergencies  Act of 1974 to provide more Congressional control over these  designations and how they are used. I hope all members can support it.   I commend Representative Lowey and Representative Yarmuth for  introducing a similar bill in the House, and I hope that the House will  send the bill to the Senate in July.   I ask unanimous consent that the following members be listed as  original cosponsors: Senators Murray, Van Hollen, Feinstein, Coons,  Baldwin, Wyden, Merkley, Whitehouse, Schatz, Sanders, Shaheen, Tester,  Udall, Cardin, Reed, Durbin, Murphy and Manchin. I would note that this  list of cosponsors includes every Democratic Member of the  Appropriations Committee.   (At the request of Mr. Durbin, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
