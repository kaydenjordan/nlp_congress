 Mr. Speaker, January 6 is going to haunt this institution  for a long, long time. No, it was not the joyous day on Capitol Hill  with our constituents celebrating the start of a new Congress and a new  administration. COVID came first, then this.   So nearly 5 months later, we still don't have the answers to the  basic questions: Who knew what? When? What did they do about it?   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Katko and Thompson, for the  really good job on working together to establish a bipartisan  commission seeking to find the answers to the questions that are still  out there.   Hundreds of people were arrested. People died. Millions of dollars of  damage to this building, feces spread on the walls, and, yes, the very  core of democracy, this institution, was threatened.   I wasn't in the Chamber that day when the breach was attempted, but I  heard the shouts, saw the flash bangs, smelled the gas on that sorry  day. And if it had not been for the brave Capitol and Metropolitan  policemen and women that day, who knows how many of our heads would  have been swinging on those gallows that were constructed on the east  front of the Capitol.    I talked to the exhausted SWAT team members, the police, and watched  some of the body cams. I talked to some of our still-shaken colleagues  who endured that day.   Mr. Speaker, we need the answers, not political rhetoric. That is  what this bipartisan commission can provide for all of us, for our  country. Let the truth shine in.
