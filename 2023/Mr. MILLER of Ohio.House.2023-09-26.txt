 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support a vital  amendment included within the bipartisan en bloc amendment to foster  rural skills training and workforce development.   The amendment that I offered with several of my colleagues would  restore funding for one of USDA's primary rural skills and workforce  programs, the Rural Innovation Stronger Economy, also known as the RISE  Grant Program.   As authorized in the 2018 farm bill, this workforce training  initiative provides assistance to rural areas to establish job  accelerators to cultivate the growth of high-wage jobs and support  rural economies.   Rural America and regions throughout the country face economic  challenges that are compounded by a lack of access to training and  workplace skills.   This is an urgent issue that requires our attention; therefore, I  urge all of my colleagues to support the amendment.
