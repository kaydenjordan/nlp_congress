 Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to be  here with Congresswoman Jackson Lee.   The culprit is not only the Republican Party, but it is also the  Supreme Court. The rightwing majority on the Supreme Court gave the  Voting Rights Act the narrowest possible meaning in order to render it  powerless against 21st century voter suppression.   Congress deliberately wrote the Voting Rights Act broadly so as to  protect against both obvious and insidious forms of voter  disenfranchisement. The broad language of the Voting Rights  [[Page H3893]]  Act prohibits not only the denial, but also the abridgement of voting  rights. It prohibits not only discriminatory intent, but also racially  disparate impact. It requires that all methods of voting be equally  open to communities of color, and that communities of color have an  equal opportunity to cast their ballots.   And so anything that undermines equal openness and equal opportunity  is a violation of the Voting Rights Act properly interpreted. I would  submit to you that voter suppression in America has no greater ally  than rightwing judicial activism.                                time  2030    Instead of interpreting the Voting Rights Act as written, the  rightwing majority on the Supreme Court has chosen to rewrite the  statute out of existence. The enforcement mechanisms of the Voting  Rights Act have been all but eviscerated. There was section 5, which  provided for preclearance, which enabled the executive branch to  protect voting rights. Then there was section 2, which provided for  litigation, which enabled the courts to protect voting rights.   Both of those enforcement mechanisms had been gutted at the hands of  the Supreme Court, the former in Shelby County v. Holder and the latter  in Brnovich v. DNC.   We know from history, Madam Speaker, that the most effective tool for  preventing voter suppression is preclearance. According to Justice  Kagan, from 1965 to 2006, the Federal Government harnessed the power of  section 5, the power of preclearance, to prevent 1,200 voting  restrictions from taking effect.   We should see the desecration of both section 5 and section 2 as a  call to action, as a call for the United States Congress to pass the  John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would restore our preclearance not  only for select jurisdictions but for every State and locality across  the Nation.   Let it be known that the greatest obstacle on the path to 21st  century voting rights enforcement is the filibuster. The filibuster  perpetuates a status quo that disenfranchises communities of color. If  you are a defender of the filibuster, then you should dispense with the  pretense that you are a champion of voting rights. If you are a  defender of the filibuster, you are not part of the solution, but you  are part of the problem.    Madam Speaker, both the 2020 and 2021  election cycles have been a powerful testament to the influence of the  Black vote.   I proudly come from New York State where we have seen a golden age of  Black political power: the attorney general, the State Senate majority  leader, the State assembly speaker, the mayor, are all Black.   And we know that but for the Black vote, President Biden would have  never won the Presidency, and the Democrats never would have won a  majority in the Senate. And the attempts at voter suppression that we  have seen threatens to reverse the racial progress that has been made.   Increasingly, we are becoming a multiracial democracy. You know, 70  percent of the Democratic Caucus consists of people of color, women,  and members of the LGBTQ community. But you would never know that from  the structure of the Senate. The structure of the Senate concentrates  power in a small subset of States that are much Whiter, much more  rural, much more conservative than the rest of the country.   Before the Democratic party won the Senate in 2021, the Senate  Republican majority represented 10 to 15 million fewer people than the  Senate Democratic minority. And the problem is that the filibuster  takes the undemocratic structure of the Senate to an even greater  extreme.   The notion that one Senator, who represents a State smaller than our  congressional districts, should have the power to overturn the will of  the President and the Senate and the House, is profoundly undemocratic.  It makes an absurdity of the democratic process.   One particularly egregious example of the filibuster can be found in  the area of gun safety. In a rational world, every gun would be  registered and safely stored. Every gun owner would be licensed and  trained. Every gun sale would be subject to a background check.   But there is nothing rational about a political system that enables  one Senator from a State smaller than my congressional district to  filibuster gun safety at the expense of 330 million Americans.   Name any cause: LGBTQ equality, voting rights enforcement,  immigration reform, democracy reform, criminal justice reform, all of  these causes have died at the hands of the filibuster.   I would submit to you that we have a party in America that is intent  on holding power at any cost and by any means necessary. If the  Republican party cannot win democratically, then it will insist on  winning undemocratically through voter suppression, gerrymandering, the  structure of the Senate, the electoral college, right-wing judicial  activism on the Supreme Court. All of these are means of holding onto  power by any means necessary. All of these are means of subverting  democracy at any cost. That is the challenge that lies before us.
