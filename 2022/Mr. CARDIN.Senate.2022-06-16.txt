 Mr. President, this Sunday, we commemorate the 157th  Juneteenth, a portmanteau of June and the nineteenth, which celebrates  the liberation of the last remaining enslaved Black Americans at the  end of the Civil War. This is our newest Federal holiday, which we will  observe on Monday, but African-American communities have celebrated  Juneteenth as Emancipation Day, Jubilee Day, or Black Independence Day  as far back as 1886 in Texas.   On this date in 1865, U.S. Army Major General Gordon Granger arrived  at a Confederate outpost in Galveston, TX, where he delivered the news  of Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation to 250,000 still- enslaved Texans. Many United States Colored Troops--USCT--who fought  for freedom and to preserve the Union, accompanied Granger. Lincoln had  issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which granted Black Americans  their freedom, 2 years earlier. Robert E. Lee had surrendered to U.S.  Army Lt. General Ulysses Grant 2 months earlier at Appomattox.   In my home State of Maryland, abolitionists Frederick Douglass and  Harriet Tubman paved the way for future civil rights activists by  risking their lives to help bring enslaved people to freedom. Their  work has had a profound impact on our community and on Maryland's rich  cultural history.   African-American history is American history. We all must learn the  lessons of Juneteenth and understand how our lives have been changed  because of it. We cannot celebrate the freedoms brought forth on  Juneteenth without acknowledging there was slavery in the United States  of America. Slavery is a part of American history. The Constitution  originally protected slavery through the fugitive slave clause and  three-fifths clause.   We cannot and should not hide from these facts or try to erase them  from our history books or suppress them in our classrooms.   In Maryland, we often look to the work of Justice Thurgood Marshall,  who spent his life fighting for the rights of Black Americans and  trying to reverse systemic discrimination. Marshall, arguing before the  Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education and later serving as the  first African-American Associate Justice on the Court, set a precedent  for future generations of Black men and women that even the highest  honors are within their reach. The Senate recently confirmed Ketanji  Brown Jackson to be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court.   While Thurgood Marshall was an inspiration, his work of reversing  systemic racism is far from complete. It is our responsibility as a  Nation to continue the work Justice Marshall and activists like him  started. Though we have made progress, the fight for racial justice  will never be complete until we have achieved equitable treatment for  people of all races and can truly guarantee equality of opportunity.  The pursuit of racial justice will ensure that we live up to our  Nation's promise of equality for all people, regardless of the color of  their skin.   Countering systemic racism and advancing racial justice should be a  daily occurrence. We must learn from our past, actively challenge our  own prejudices, and take conscious steps to dismantle the racist  structures embedded in our society.   On President Biden's first day in office, he signed an Executive  order entitled ``Advancing Racial Equity and Support from Underserved  Communities Through the Federal Government.'' The President directed  Federal Agencies to assess how their programs and policies might be  perpetuating systemic barriers to opportunity and to propose Equity  Action Plans that contain specific Agency commitments to redress  inequities and promote equitable outcomes in communities.   The Biden-Harris administration has already taken numerous steps to  expand opportunities for African-Americans. The Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law permanently reauthorizes the Minority Business  Development Agency for the first time and enhances its authority. The  administration has stepped up its efforts to combat racial  discrimination in the housing market and to help African-Americans get  fair treatment when it comes to staying in their homes and on their  farms and receiving disaster assistance after tragedy strikes.   In particular, as the pandemic exacerbated preexisting racial  disparities, the administration took strong steps to improve outcomes  for African-Americans with respect to education, healthcare, and  transportation.   As we commemorate this historic holiday, I encourage all Americans to  reflect on the many lessons of the story of Juneteenth and commit  ourselves to the pursuit of racial justice and reconciliation. If we do  that, individually and collectively, Juneteenth truly will become a  Jubilee.                            ____________________
