 Mr. President, I speak on behalf of myself and  Senator Harris to reintroduce legislation to establish the Sacramento- San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area, California's first National  Heritage Area. I am very pleased to work with Senator Harris,  Congressman John Garamendi, and our colleagues in the State on this  much needed legislation. Our legislation will establish a new national  heritage area in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to promote  environmental stewardship, heritage conservation, and economic  development across five delta counties.   The Delta Protection Commission will manage the heritage area in  accordance with California law and in partnership with delta  communities. The management planning process provided by this  legislation will be open to the public and collaborative. Federal,  State, Tribal, and local governments, private property owners, and all  stakeholders will have a voice in the management planning for the  heritage area.   The goal is to conserve and protect the delta, its communities, its  natural resources, and its rich history.   In short, this legislation does not affect water rights or water  contracts, nor does it is impose any additional responsibilities on  local governments or private landowners. Instead, this legislation  authorizes federal assistance to support local projects as part of an  inclusive process required by State law.   The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is the largest estuary in the  Western United States and perhaps the most productive and ecologically  important watershed in North America. This extensive inland delta is a  natural marvel and national treasure that must be protected. The delta  offers recreational opportunities enjoyed by millions of Californians  and out-of-State visitors alike, who come each year for boating,  fishing, hunting, and sightseeing.   The delta provides critical habitat for more than 750 wildlife  species, including sandhill cranes and other migratory birds along the  Pacific Flyway. It also provides habitat for iconic native fish like  the chinook salmon, some as large as 60 pounds, which return each year  to travel through the delta to spawn in tributaries upstream.   These same waterways provide freshwater to millions of California  households and irrigated farmland south of the delta and elsewhere in  the State.   Before being converted for farmland starting in the 19th century, the  delta flooded regularly following the springtime snowmelt and once  supported the continent's largest Native American communities.   Later, the delta served as the gateway for the California Gold Rush,  after which Chinese immigrant workers built hundreds of miles of levees  to make the delta's rich peat soils available for farming and to  control flooding.   Japanese, Chinese, Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch, Greek, South  Asian, and other immigrants began the area's farming legacy and  established proud communities that continue today.   Over the years, the vibrant ``river culture'' endemic to delta  communities has attracted the attention of celebrated authors from Mark  Twain and Jack London to Joan Didion.   A national heritage area designation would help to preserve this  uniquely American story by providing supportive local governments  across the delta with a needed management framework, technical  assistance, and modest Federal funding.   Today, the delta faces crisis due to proliferate invasive species,  urban and agricultural runoff, wastewater overloads, channelization,  dredging, formidable water exports, and other stressors.   Many delta islands are now 10 to 20 feet below sea level due to  subsidence, and the present levee system is inadequate in providing  reliable flood protection for historic communities, agricultural  enterprises, and infrastructure. Alarmingly, many existing levees were  simply not engineered to withstand earthquakes. Should levees fail,  [[Page S2000]]  a rush of saltwater into the interior delta would damage this already  fragile ecosystem, disrupt drinking water supplies, flood agricultural  land, inundate towns, and damage roads, powerlines, and water  infrastructure.   Establishing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area  will secure much needed Federal resources for delta communities. Our  legislation recognizes the delta as a working landscape central to  California life and seeks to further local projects already underway  that promote environmental stewardship, heritage conservation,  community revitalization, and economic development throughout the  delta.   This legislation also seeks to fulfill the broadly supported 2009  California State law that called for a heritage area designation for  the delta and the Delta Protection Commission's own feasibility report  in 2012.   Our legislation is a small part of the commitment the Federal  Government must make to the California delta. I look forward to  continuing to work with my colleagues at every level of government to  restore the delta and its native species, upgrade California's water  supply, safeguard against flood risk, improve water quality, and  preserve delta communities' rich heritage and continued vibrancy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I speak on behalf of myself and  Senator Harris to reintroduce legislation to establish the Sacramento- San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area, California's first National  Heritage Area.
