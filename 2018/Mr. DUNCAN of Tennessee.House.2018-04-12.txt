 Mr. Speaker, in the days leading up to the  congressional vote on whether to go to war in Iraq years ago, Fortune  magazine had an article headlined: ``We Win--What Then?'' The article  said that a prolonged war in Iraq would make American soldiers  ``sitting ducks for Islamic terrorists.''   Another national magazine at that time, U.S. News & World Report, had  an article headlined: ``Why the Rush to War?'' Now that war has been  frequently referred to as possibly the greatest foreign policy mistake  in U.S. history.   The night before the Iraq war vote, a television station in Knoxville  ran a poll showing 74 percent in favor of the war, 9 percent against,  and 17 percent undecided. I was one of six Republicans who voted  against going to war. For 3 or 4 years, that was certainly the most  unpopular vote I ever cast. But slowly, slowly, slowly it ended up  being the most popular vote I ever cast.   We were basically conned into that war by a group of neocons, so- called neoconservatives, whom George Will once described as being  ``magnificently misnamed'' because they were really the ``most radical  people'' in this city, meaning Washington.   In addition to our disaster in Iraq, we have now been at war in  Afghanistan for 17 years, seemingly permanent, forever wars that have  cost us trillions of dollars and caused many thousands of Americans to  be killed or maimed. What a waste.   President Reagan once said that we should never go to war unless  there were no other reasonable alternatives, and then only as a very  last resort.   We have had too many leaders who never went to war themselves, such  as the new National Security Advisor, John Bolton, who seem far too  eager for others to go to war so these chicken hawks can feel more  important or think of themselves as modern-day Winston Churchills.   Now we seem to be rushing into another war in Syria. I am thankful  that conservatives like Tucker Carlson and Pat Buchanan are questioning  this new rush to war. At some point, with a $21 trillion national debt,  we have to realize there are limits to American power.   Civil wars and really terrible things are happening all over the  world--in Africa, in the Middle East, and in other places--all the  time. As President Kennedy said at the University of Washington in one  of his most famous speeches, with only 4 percent of the world's  population, ``we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity-- and that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world  problem.''   Most of the time, a military solution is the worst solution. There  are many other ways we can help people who have been harmed: through  humanitarian, religious, or charitable organizations, or through the  United Nations.   Pat Buchanan wrote that President Trump is being ``goaded into war''  and that Congress should ``debate our objectives in this new war and  how many new casualties and years will be required to defeat the  coalition of Syria, Russia, Hezbollah, Iran, and the allied Shiite  militias from the Near East.''   Tucker Carlson said that we need to ask some skeptical questions now,  at least in part, because Secretary Mattis said in February that we  have absolutely no proof that Assad used the chemical weapons he was  accused of using last year. He added that there is no real proof Assad  did chemical attacks this time because such an attack would really help  only the rebels fighting Assad, and they also have chemical weapons,  and they have been described as Islamic terrorists, although we are  supporting them. Mr. Carlson pointed out that Assad had every reason or  incentive not to use chemical weapons in a civil war his government  basically had already won.   President Trump was elected in large part because he promised to get  us out of these very unnecessary wars in the Middle East. Almost  everything we have done in the Middle East over the last many years has  been wrong. There has been fighting going on there for several thousand  years. Throughout history, other wars have been started over incidents  or information that turned out to be false or greatly exaggerated.   We do not need nor can we afford to get into another trillion-dollar  war in the Middle East without first making absolutely certain that it  is in America's interest to do so and that it will not make the Middle  East even more messed up and chaotic than it already is.                            ____________________
