 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a dear friend  and community member, Zack Earp, on receiving the Riverside Spirit  Award.   Zack was a longtime educator and Marine veteran who saw combat in  Vietnam.   Despite the health challenges he has faced, Zack continues to serve  actively in our community by working with local volunteers, advocating  for local students, and volunteering with the Boy Scouts.   Zack has inspired so many people, including me, with his positive  attitude and his will to make our community a better place for all.   Zack has dedicated his life to service and to activism, and we are  lucky to have him in Riverside.   Zack is deserving of this award, and I am glad that the Riverside  City Council is recognizing such an outstanding citizen.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Four years ago, during Pride Month, our country awoke to the  devastating news about a shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida.  The Pulse nightclub, a safe haven for the LGBTQ-plus community in  Orlando was the target of an act of hate.   Forty-nine lives were taken and 53 were wounded after a gunman opened  fire. The victims and survivors were LGBTQ-plus and members of the  Latinx community.   This shooting was one of the deadliest attacks on LGBTQ-plus  Americans in our history, and it left our community hurting, fearful,  and skeptical about the progress our Nation had made towards  acceptance, understanding, and belonging for LGBTQ-plus people.   Four years later, we are still grieving, we are still healing, and we  are still demanding action to make equality the law of the land and to  end gun violence in America.   When I visited Orlando to pay my respects to the victims and to honor  their memories, what I saw at Pulse during such a painful time gave me  hope. I saw a community that had come together to condemn hate, to  reject intolerance, and to celebrate the lives of every single soul  that was lost that night.   Our community's pride and the bravery we exhibit when we choose to  embrace our identity, even in the face of hate and homophobia, is proof  of how resilient we are.   Designating Pulse as a national memorial would honor the lives of  those lost and it would forever stand as a symbol of pride, hope, and  courage, which will always triumph over hate.   Madam Speaker, as the co-chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus, I thank  Representative Soto for his leadership, also Representative Murphy and  Representative Demings.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3094.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, so when the Trump administration and Secretary DeVos  approved its new borrower defense to repayment rule late last year, it  was clear that they had chosen to pander to the for-profit college  industry and cheat thousands of borrowers out of the relief that they  deserve.   Predatory for-profit institutions consistently put their profits over  students' education. They make false promises about job prospects,  drain Federal resources, and leave millions of students with useless  degrees and high student loan debt.   Mr. Speaker, yes, veterans are among that group of people, and that  is why major veteran service organizations have come out in favor of  this veto override in support of the original legislation. Veterans,  women, and minorities are aggressively recruited by these institutions  who only see them as a benefit to their bottom line:   ITT Technical Institute, Corinthian Colleges, Dream Center Colleges  are just some of the predatory for-profits whose lofty promises turned  student dreams into a nightmare. The student borrowers who were  defrauded by these schools are desperately seeking relief, but  Secretary DeVos is making that task nearly impossible. And that is why  this year, both Chambers of Congress passed a bipartisan Congressional  Review Act resolution that rejected Secretary DeVos' harmful rule.   Students, consumer advocates, and student veteran groups spoke out in  favor of this CRA and urged President Trump to sign it into law. But  the President refused to heed their call, choosing instead to uphold  Secretary DeVos' watered-down rule to put additional burdens on  borrowers.  [[Page H2552]]                                     time  1215    We must override the President's veto. Congress must again stand with  student loan borrowers and stop the Trump administration's attack on  America's students and his attempts to rig the rule in favor of  Secretary DeVos' cronies. More than 200,000 student borrowers are still  waiting for relief.
