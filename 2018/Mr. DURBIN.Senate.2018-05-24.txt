I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth)  and the Senator from Hampshire (Ms. Hassan) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, it was about 5 or 6 weeks ago that I  accepted an invitation and an opportunity to visit Caracas, Venezuela.  I had never been to that country before and spent 4 days. It turns out  that not many Members of Congress go to this country and very few are  given permission if they ask, but for some reason, I was given  permission and went down there to meet with the leaders of the  government and to take stock of what was happening in Venezuela.   Sadly, I have to report that Venezuela--that proud nation--is  teetering on collapse. I met with President Maduro, members of his  government, opposition leaders, civic and humanitarian leaders, medical  experts, victims of the regime's political repression, and an American  who is currently jailed on political charges in Caracas.   What I found there and recounted on the floor a few weeks ago was a  heartbreaking set of overlapping crises--humanitarian, economic, and  political. While these three inexcusable crises of the government's  making continue, the people of this poor nation are increasingly  suffering and leaving in desperation. It is one of the most desperate  situations I have ever seen in a country that is not in the midst of a  war. In my discussion with President Maduro, I urged him to help get  his country out of the international isolation that it currently faces  and put an end to the human suffering by starting with a clean  election.   Last Sunday, there was an election. It was a farce. I asked him to  release political opponents so they could run for office. I asked him  to authorize parties to field candidates. I asked him to  [[Page S2898]]  create enough time in the election cycle so there could be a real  campaign. I told him, if he didn't and went through with his election  campaign, it would not be a credible result. We know the Maduro regime  was using food, among its starving people, to manipulate votes. The  regime had, unfortunately, no credible election monitors before or  during the vote, and, of course, it rushed the election to get the  result it was looking for.   I recently joined with Senator Menendez of New Jersey. We said, quite  simply, that Maduro should have the courage to have an open election, a  democratic process. As we arrived at the airport, we noticed the great  hero of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez. Hugo Chavez won his first election in a  democratic manner, and I urged President Maduro to now do the same.   I was also direct in saying to him that he had to release the  American, Josh Holt, who is being held in prison, in Caracas, on  political charges. Why is he being held? It is that he traveled to  Venezuela to be with and to marry the woman he loved and to bring her  and her two daughters back to his home State of Utah? He crossed the  Maduro regime, and in that process, he was arrested on charges that are  outrageous. He has been held now for almost 2 years without having had  a meaningful trial or a resolution of the dispute.   As the events of the last few weeks have shown, the obvious path  forward for Venezuela has been rejected by the Maduro regime. Instead,  it went ahead with last Sunday's widely discredited election in which  his regime jailed or disqualified any meaningful opponent. It was a  farce. It will only result in the further isolation and suffering of  the Venezuelan people. I know President Maduro is blaming Yankee  imperialists for the problems his country is facing or the opposition  to his leadership. He need only look to neighboring nations in Central  and South America to see that they also reject what he has done  politically.   Despite stirring video pleas from the prison in which Josh Holt, the  American, is being held, Maduro's regime wouldn't even meet with our  top diplomat in Caracas. Todd Robinson is the Charge d'Affaires who  represents the United States since we are not allowed to have an  ambassador in that country. He went to the Foreign Ministry on behalf  of Josh Holt when he heard about the prison riot and the danger to this  American prisoner who is being held on political charges. Obviously, he  got under President Maduro's skin, and he has now expelled him.   The Trump administration has been unequivocal in claiming that the  Venezuelan election was a sham and also in imposing new economic  sanctions in order to put pressure on the leaders in the Venezuelan  Government to change. As I told President Maduro and members of his  government, both parties in America may have their squabbles and  differences, but when it comes to Venezuela, we stand together.  Republicans and Democrats agree that things need to change dramatically  in Venezuela if it wants to enter the family of civilized nations  around the world.   President Maduro has responded not by reaching out to the opposition  and not by showing any true reform but by rejecting every overture. He  refuses to release Josh Holt and his Venezuelan wife and daughters to  allow them to come to the United States. He still keeps Leopoldo Lopez,  a political leader in Venezuela, under house arrest. I spoke to Mr.  Lopez by phone and met personally with his wife. It is shameful what  they are doing to him.   By restoring the power of a legitimate national assembly, President  Maduro would show he is willing to move toward the Constitution which  guided his country, but he refuses. He refuses to start a meaningful  dialogue with the Lima Group--other nations in the region--that want to  work with him toward moving Venezuela to a better day. He refuses to  work with neighbors and humanitarian groups that truly want to address  the suffering in that country.   It was not until the public health briefing I had in Venezuela and a  personal visit to a local hospital that it really hit me and hit me  hard how bad things are. This is a country--one of the few on Earth-- that is not at war but that is currently facing epidemics of measles,  diphtheria, and malaria. When you go to Caracas city hospitals--not to  remote, rural hospitals--and ask them what they need, they tell you  vaccines, antibiotics, cancer drugs--the basics. They don't have them  in that country.   You can just see on the streets of Caracas that the people are  starving. They are starving. They don't have enough food to eat in that  country. The inflation is so out of control that people stand in line  for an hour a day to get the maximum withdrawals on their credit cards,  in hard currency, because the withdrawals are worth the 60 cents they  need for round trip bus fare to their places of work. At 11 o'clock at  night, in the darkness, you will see people standing by ATM machines to  withdraw wads of currency worth 60 cents so they can board the buses  the next morning.   The expulsion of our Charge d'Affaires, Todd Robinson, was really  disgraceful. He was accused of conspiring against the Venezuelan  Government. What did he do? He stood up for the American prisoner, Josh  Holt. That is all. Todd Robinson is one of the Nation's highly  respected diplomats who carries the rank of Ambassador and has served  with distinction in some of the most challenging countries in the  world. I spoke with him on the phone yesterday. He is disappointed. He  knows there is much work to be done in Venezuela to protect innocent  people and to make sure the Americans have a strong presence in order  to protect them as well, and now he is being expelled.   During my visit to Caracas a few weeks ago, I watched him try to  establish a dialogue with the Maduro regime. It was next to impossible.  A dialogue requires someone on the other side who will listen and  respond in good faith. That was not the case. When I spoke to him--our  Charge d'Affaires, Mr. Robinson--he was packing up and helping the  Embassy staff prepare for his departure. He will be back in the  Washington area over the weekend. I thanked him for his service in  Venezuela and for his team that continues to soldier on under some of  the most difficult circumstances in the world.   Until the Maduro regime stops dismantling its country's democracy and  starts to address the true humanitarian crisis which exists in its  country, I will continue to support U.S. and regional measures to put  pressure on the Maduro regime to change. I know of no other way to do  this that will not bring more suffering and death to the innocent  people of Venezuela. This once great nation will not be great again  until its leadership understands that the current approach--denying  democracy, denying the electoral process, refusing to have an open  dialogue with democratic nations around the world--will only sink them  further into the abyss.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms.  Duckworth), the Senator from New Hampshire (Ms. Hassan), and the  Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, last month, during Workers' Memorial Day,  we honored and remembered those killed or injured on the job. It is a  day we reaffirm our commitment to workers and their families to do all  we can to prevent these tragedies.   Forty-seven years ago, when the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration was established, an estimated 14,000 workers were killed  on the job. By 2016, the number was reduced to nearly 5,200. We have  come a long way in worker safety, but when more than 14 people die on  the job every day--and only 2.9 million work-related injuries are  reported annually even though the real number could be as much as 7.4  to 11.1 million--more work needs to be done. Clearly, the workplace  remains too dangerous. We owe it to America's working men and women to  ensure their safety, but too often, we are reminded of our failure to  do so.   I want to talk about Pamela Knight, from Dixon, in my home State of  Illinois. An employee of the Illinois Department of Children and Family  Services, Pamela was asked last September to check on the welfare of a  child. When Pamela arrived, sensing a dangerous environment, she  decided to remove the 2-year-old boy from the home and place him in  protective custody. That is when the child's father knocked her to the  floor, kicked her in the head, and continued beating Pamela's fractured  skull. After this horrific incident, she was airlifted to a hospital in  nearby Rockford, IL, where she underwent two surgeries, but it was too  late. Pamela suffered permanent brain damage and passed away about four  months after the attack. Pamela Knight was 59 years old.   The job of our investigators and first responders, like Pamela, at  the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services is not easy.  They are on the frontlines to those in crisis, but we can all agree, it  should never be fatal. My heart goes out to Pamela's family, friends,  colleagues, and all our public service workers protecting and serving  the most vulnerable in our communities.   The theme of this year's Workers' Memorial Day was ``Safe Jobs. Every  Worker's Right.'' While the administration attempts to walk back many  vital protections and existing safeguards for our workers, let's  recommit ourselves in Congress to live up to those words and provide  the right every worker deserves: a safe job. In doing so, we can honor  the legacy of courageous Americans, like Pamela Knight, who simply did  her job.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in fighting for secure workplaces  everywhere and once and for all, live up to the promise of the  Occupational Safety and Health Administration's mission to assure the  dignity of a safe and healthy working condition for all Americans. With  the right commitment, we can protect, strengthen, and advance the gains  we have made over the last half century and make the safety of all  workers a reality.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
