 Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, many of us heard of the  Marines United Facebook page for the first time. On this page, women  marines found that their intimate photos were posted without their  knowledge and without their consent. Some had no idea these photos had  ever been taken.   Beneath the photos, marine members of the Facebook group wrote  obscene and abusive comments about their comrades. This betrayal of  marines by marines disgracefully disrespects fellow members, sows the  seeds of distrust, and undermines the unit cohesion so essential to  military readiness, putting our national security at risk.   Today we bring a bill to the floor to make sure military members who  have broadcasted or distributed certain private images are held  accountable. H.R. 2052 creates a separate article under the Uniform  Code of Military Justice that specifically criminalizes the wrongful  sharing of intimate photos without explicit consent to do so.   H.R. 2052 sends a clear message to all servicemembers and to our  military leadership that this kind of abusive behavior will not and  must not be tolerated. Members from both sides of the aisle have come  together, and I thank Representatives McSally and Speier for their  leadership in support of this commonsense legislation, and I encourage  all of my colleagues to vote for it.
