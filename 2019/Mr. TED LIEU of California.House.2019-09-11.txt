 Mr. Chair, I thank Representative  Lowenthal for his leadership.   Today, I rise in support of this legislation by Representative  Cunningham to ban offshore oil drilling in both the Atlantic and  Pacific. This would apply to new offshore oil drilling. Such oil  drilling is both dangerous and harms coastal economies.   My congressional district spans the coast of Los Angeles from Palos  Verdes to Malibu. Its natural beauty is rivaled by few, and the  tourism, recreation, and other ocean-related industries flourish  because of it.   Just a few years ago, in 2015, an oil pipeline ruptured in Santa  Barbara to the north of my district, spilling 100,000 gallons of oil  into the ocean, killing wildlife, and forcing closure of beaches in my  district as their oil flowed down. This oil spill can affect large  pieces of land and our environment, and our economy suffered.   H.R. 1941 is a forward-thinking bill that will protect California's  coast and help turn us away from fossil fuels. At a time when tackling  the climate crisis is absolutely critical, I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation.
