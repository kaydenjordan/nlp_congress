 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck) for  extending me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, we are only one month into 2017; and today we have  another closed rule or, as I call them now, Putin rules. This is the  kind of process they have in Russia: no amendments, no debate, no  nothing, completely shut down. It is your way or the highway.    This is not the way the United States House of Representatives, the  greatest deliberative body in the world, should be run. This is  shameful. I have very serious concerns about the road that we are  traveling down, Mr. Speaker.   The 115th Congress is only a few weeks old, and we have already  ushered in a process that is alarmingly restrictive. Sadly, it has  become routine in this Republican House for the majority to close down  the process, rush bills through the House without regular order,  enforce the rules for Democrats but not for Republicans, and insist on  spending all of our time on partisan legislation instead of working  together to find bipartisan compromises and solutions to the real  problems facing American families and workers.   Mr. Speaker, today's legislation makes clear that the Republicans are  eager to repeal protections put in place to help the American people.  We should be working to expand opportunity for hardworking families and  strengthen safeguards to put the American people first, not  corporations, not wealthy CEOs, not big donors, and not special  interests, but the people ought to come first.                                time  1230    Today is another sad day. We are engaged in what I would call  mindless legislating. While my Republican friends say they want to  repeal needless regulation--something that we all want to do--the  process my Republican friends have embraced, to put it gently, is  reckless. No matter what you think of a particular regulation, or  rule--or, in many cases, they are protections--no matter what you may  think of a particular regulation, there is no denying that these rules  that my Republican friends are bringing to the floor to repeal went  through a vigorous process that took months and months, and even years  to complete.   They went through agency review. They went through a lengthy comment  period, oftentimes thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people  weighed in on the pros and cons of a particular idea. But the idea that  we would just erase them with the blink of an eye, no hearings, no  markups, nothing, it is a mindless way to legislate and a disturbing  way to govern.   The ``act first and think later'' approach was on full display with  President Trump's Muslim ban. It was so hastily enacted that his own  Secretary of Homeland Security didn't even know that the President was  signing the executive order until he saw it on cable news. The Trump  White House did such a poor job of briefing the Federal agencies  charged with enforcing the policy that airports across the country were  caught completely off guard, and there was widespread confusion and  chaos about how to carry it out.   That is what happens when you don't embrace a process that is  thoughtful. You get confusion, you get chaos, and you usually get bad  policy.   The mindless approach to governing by Republicans continued this  week. On Monday, President Trump announced that, for every new  regulation passed, two regulations must be repealed. That is it. No  details on what kind of regulations would be repealed, or why they  would be repealed. This is a blind shotgun and arbitrary approach to  our Nation's laws. We shouldn't be dumbing down the way we govern. The  American people deserve better from their leaders in Congress, and I  think they deserve better from their leaders in the White House.   Now, when this legislation came before the Rules Committee the other  night, there were plenty of questions. The hearing went on for a long  time. Lots of the questions came from my Republican friends. And I will  tell you, the chairman's answers were not always that enlightening. I  think maybe some more hearings would have helped. But in response to  some of these objections, namely, did the bill undergo any review by a  committee, one of my Republican friends--and it may have been the  gentleman from Colorado--said: We don't have time. We don't have time  for hearings. We have so many regulations that we want to repeal.   Don't have the time for a hearing? Don't have the time to understand  what we are doing? I thought that was part of our job. We were supposed  to deliberate. We were supposed to read the bill. We were supposed to  understand the impact of the actions that we may or may not take in  this Congress. That is our job.   The American people have given us the responsibility to take the time  to do our job right and to carefully consider the laws we pass. To say  that we don't have time for hearings and deliberation--never mind, we  don't have time to allow an open process where people might want to  offer amendments--is ridiculous. It is shameful. And I will tell my  Republican friends, stand up to your leadership on this. This is not  the way this House should be run.   So as we consider the repeal of the NICS rule, we should remember  that Congress has failed to take any meaningful action on gun violence  at all. We have massacres on a regular basis in this country. All we do  is we have a moment of silence. That is our response. We have a high  rate of suicides in this country due to gun violence. It is something  we ought to talk about. And I think that the NICS rule is a  commonsense, responsible gun safety measure that could potentially save  the lives of thousands of people in this country. I think Congress has  the responsibility to keep our families safe, not remove safeguards  that help prevent gun violence.   Far too many have lost their lives to preventable gun violence. This  rule is intended to keep firearms out of the hands of those suffering  from severe mental illness. That is a commonsense idea that I think we  all should agree on. In 2007, President George W. Bush signed a  bipartisan bill to identify individuals ineligible to possess firearms  because of severe mental health issues. This rule allows for a  reporting method to ensure that the law is implemented effectively.   It is intended to save lives. Every year in the United States, more  than 21,000 people kill themselves, and mental illness is also an  important factor. A gun is used in the majority of these cases. The  people listed on NICS are the 75,000 dealing with the most severe  mental illnesses. These are people who need help, not access to a  dangerous weapon like a gun.   I think this rule is a critical step, but we must close the online  gun show loopholes, and we must ensure universal background checks. I  think we ought to bring to the floor a bill that says that if the FBI  and our security agencies have put you on a terrorist watch list and  think that you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane, then you ought  not to be able to go out and buy a gun.   But under the way this House is run, we can't even bring those things  to the floor for a debate. The Republican leadership and the Republican  Rules Committee blocks it so that there can't be real deliberation on  the House floor.   When people ask me all the time, Why can't you have a debate on this,  or why can't you have a vote on it, I have to explain that the House  Rules Committee, run by nine Republicans, says  [[Page H833]]  no to everything, says no to every idea that they don't absolutely  embrace. And that is not the way Congress should be run.   Mr. Speaker, even if you disagree with me on the value of this rule,  I think it is an important enough issue that there ought to have been a  hearing. There ought to have been that opportunity to deliberate and to  talk about it and what the impacts are. But no, nothing. We don't have  the time. So here we are.    Mr. Speaker, the other bill before us is a naked attempt by  Republicans to undo anticorruption rules. The rule that they are so  upset about would require energy companies on the U.S. stock exchange  to disclose payments they make to foreign governments for access to  their natural resources.   Now, there are reasons for this. It is important that there be  transparency. We heard all about the plans to drain the swamp, but  President Trump and the Republicans are doing all they can to turn the  swamp into a cesspool.   Putting aside all of his conflicts of interest that, I think, are on  a collision course with corruption, I mean, repealing things like this,  is just a bad idea. The Republicans in Congress are trying to roll back  regulations like this one that are aimed at increasing transparency and  fighting corruption.   ExxonMobil heavily lobbied against this rule. And now, with former  ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson on the cusp of becoming our country's new  Secretary of State, Republicans are proposing to kill this  anticorruption rule that benefits Big Oil. That is reckless, and it is  irresponsible.   When this rule was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank bill in 2010,  the Big Oil lobbies strongly fought against it in court, but Congress  fought back to assert America's traditional role as a global leader in  fighting corruption. American leadership delivered results. The  European Union promptly moved to enact nearly identical legislation, as  did Canada with support of its global mining companies.   But now, Big Oil is back seeking repeal of the rule so their payments  can be kept secret from the American people. They claim they will be at  a competitive disadvantage to foreigners, or they will have to reveal  commercially sensitive information.   But with Europe and Canada in the same disclosure system, the playing  field is now level and the companies already filing have suffered no  commercial harm, nor revealed vital secrets. The fact is, this won't  cost a single American job, and the only thing oil companies will need  to do differently is report their numbers.   Aside from Big Oil, those most eager to repeal this rule are  autocrats in places like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela--with oil wells,  gas fields, or copper mines--who want to keep the money secret from  their citizens. Why should we do their bidding? Why should we be in  league with them?   On top of that, this rule is our most affordable and effective way to  fight corruption abroad. We cannot afford to betray our own principles  and severely undercut our allies in Europe and Canada. It would cost  countless lives over the long run and endanger our security. We need to  put American interests first, ahead of the special interests, ahead of  the corporate interests, and retain that important rule.   Obviously, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the repeal of these  two rules, but you got to do what you got to do. But I urge you to vote  ``no'' on this rule.   And I ask you to vote ``no'' because it should be a principle vote.   This place is becoming so closed up, so restrictive, that this is not  a deliberative body anymore. We are not talking about things anymore.  It is basically whatever the leadership wants, whatever Donald Trump  wants, you bring to the floor, rubber stamp it, and that is it.   I don't care what political party you are in, nobody who got elected  by the people of this country should stand for that kind of process.   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   With regard to the NICS bill, I have a very different version of  history than the gentleman does, including one that represents a  bipartisan compromise with the Bush White House.   So I have a very, very different recollection of history than he does  on that. And on the other bill, it is all about corruption, and it is  all about giving Big Oil what they want.    At the end of the day, the two interests that are most happy with the  repeal of this rule are Big Oil and Russia. And if that is where we  believe that we ought to be using our energy to help then go ahead and  vote to repeal it. But again, I think that this process speaks for  itself.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous  question, and, if they do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to  bring up Representative Lofgren's bill to overturn and defund President  Trump's immoral, unconstitutional, and discriminatory executive order  banning Syrian refugees and suspending immigration from certain  countries.   President Trump's executive order flies in the face of our Nation's  values. It compromises our national security by providing terrorist  groups with a recruiting tool. This executive order needs to be  overturned, and, if we defeat the previous question, we will bring up  legislation to do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) to discuss our proposal.    Does the gentleman have any other speakers?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, as my distinguished colleague, Ms. Lofgren,  stated, we want to defeat the previous question because we are  horrified, quite frankly, by the impact that President Trump's  executive orders on immigration have had on a lot of good, decent  people, many of whom have already been vetted. We have students who  have been held up who have student visas, we have dual citizens who  have been caught up in this mess, and we have people coming to get  human rights prizes. I could go on and on and on, but we need to  correct this. We are better than this.   I would suggest to my Republican friends, rather than circling the  wagons to try to defend the indefensible, they ought to join with us  and defeat the previous question so that we can actually do the right  thing and overturn this narrowminded, misguided, and discriminatory  policy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask the gentleman from Colorado if he  has additional speakers or is that the speaker we were waiting for?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I am not sure where to begin, because I have  heard so many fascinating things here today.   The distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee said we are here  today to enunciate the rules. I don't know what there is to enunciate.  The only thing to enunciate is this is a closed rule. It is yet another  closed rule. There is no opportunity to have any real deliberation, no  real discussion. On top of that, there were no hearings on any of this  stuff.   No matter what your position is, I have to be honest with you,  listening to the gentleman, Mr. Massie, just speak, I think it would  have been nice if the Judiciary Committee could have actually had a  hearing on this and maybe delved into some of the issues that the  gentleman raised.   When people say that there is no due process, I would remind them  that, under the rule, impacted beneficiaries are notified that this  determination is being considered and they are provided a process to  challenge that determination. Should the Social Security Administration  determine that that recipient is able to safely use or possess guns,  rights are restored and the person's name is removed from NICS. That is  what it says.   Now, if there is a way to improve this, I am all for improving it;  but by passing this measure here today, you prevent the agencies that  are impacted here from ever being able to revisit the issue unless  Congress deemed it appropriate.   So we are not trying to fix anything here. Basically, what we are  doing is the bidding of the National Rifle Association to eliminate  anything aimed at protecting people from gun violence in this country.   The gentleman from Colorado talked about the fact that his  constituents want the right to protect their rights for life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness. Well, my constituents want that, too, but  they have a right to not have to be victims of gun violence. They have  a right to protect their loved ones who may use a weapon against  themselves or their family members.   But again, we can have this argument on whether or not we should do  more--and I believe we should--to protect people in this country from  gun violence, but that discussion ought to have happened first in the  Judiciary Committee, at a minimum, not in the Rules Committee. I am on  the Rules Committee. I admire the intellect of everybody on the Rules  Committee, but our expertise is not on judiciary matters.   Similarly, on the other rule that is being repealed, the Financial  Services Committee should have deliberated on that. I think there are  some serious issues raised by repealing that rule, issues that I think  go to the heart of corruption not only here in the United States, but  around the world.   When the chairman of the Rules Committee got up and gave his  description that somehow the U.S. oil companies are only being singled  out, it makes my case why we should have had a hearing. What he just  said, in my opinion, does not reflect reality.   The fact of the matter is, I looked at section 1504 of Dodd-Frank. It  doesn't just require all extractive companies in the U.S. It says that  all extractive companies, U.S. and foreign, listed on the U.S.  exchanges are to publicly disclose the payments they make to  governments for oil, gas, and mining resources.                                time  1315    And then, on top of that--and I said this earlier--is that other  countries have followed suit. Canada and the European Union and Norway  have all passed similar laws. It is not just the United States being  singled out. That is just wrong. Maybe, if we had a hearing in the  committee of jurisdiction, that would have been clear, and this  wouldn't be a point of contention.   The fact of the matter is, it is a simple reporting requirement. It  places no limits or restrictions on who companies can pay money to or  how much or for what. It has absolutely no regulatory effect on any  aspect of their business operations. There is absolutely no benefit to  nullifying this commonsense law unless your objective is to make it  easier for corrupt elites to steal money. The rule has no regulatory  impact on business operation and does not define illegal or improper  payments. It is a simple reporting requirement.   There is a problem with corruption, especially in places like Russia.  Now, I know with the new administration, Russia is now in, and we are  all supposed to say nice things about Russia. But Russia has a terrible  record on human rights, and Russia has a terrible record when it comes  to corruption, and we know that. We ought to not just cave to  everything that Russia wants, and Russia and Big Oil want this  repealed.   So I would say to my colleagues that we can argue about the merits of  all of this, and that is fine, but I go back to my original point. This  is the rule, and the Speaker of the House talked about the importance  of regular order. I have heard my colleagues talk about the importance  of regular order. We don't have regular order. You are all out of  order. We end up coming to the floor with legislation that is always  under restrictive processes, and most of the time now, in this new  Congress, completely closed rules. That doesn't just disadvantage  Democratic lawmakers who may have some ideas or may want to raise some  issues, it disadvantages Republicans who may want to come to the floor  with thoughtful ideas.   I urge my colleagues to absolutely vote ``no'' on this rule because,  again, we are getting into this habit where it is closed, closed,  closed, closed, closed, and it undermines the integrity of this House  of Representatives. It really is shameful.   Finally, I will urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question so that we can have a debate and a vote on overturning  President Trump's awful, discriminatory executive orders on  immigration. It jeopardizes our national security. It was carelessly  implemented, carelessly put together. It is shameful. It is  unconscionable that we are confronted with the mess that we are  confronted with now.   I know it is uncomfortable to talk about issues that impact the new  President who is of your party, but this  [[Page H837]]  is absolutely the right thing to do. And if you want to vote no on  these things, vote no on them, but allow us to have the debate and  allow us to have the vote. I urge ``no'' on the previous question and  ``no'' on the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
