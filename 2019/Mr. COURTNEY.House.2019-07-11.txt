 Mr. Chair, again, I just want to join my colleague from  Virginia (Mr. Wittman), and I look forward to working with him in the  conference committee to make sure that that question is resolved.   Both of us understand the issue and, again, I look forward to a  satisfactory result, which would make the real gist of the amendment  move forward, which is to make sure we have cable ship capacity to  protect our Nation.
