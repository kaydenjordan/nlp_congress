 Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight because a violent mob,  incited by the President of the United States based on a lie, laid  siege to Congress to overturn a Presidential election.   We have to ask ourselves, what would have happened if that mob  succeeded? Why stop at one election? Why not two? Why not make Donald  Trump President for life?   Thank God that did not happen and they did not succeed.   However, even after that terrible day of January 6, 2021, Donald  Trump is still using the lie of a stolen election to turn American  against American for his own selfish ends.   I believe even with only a few days left in office that Donald Trump  is still a danger to our Republic and must be removed immediately.    Mr. Speaker, as an example, today, the Joint Chiefs of  Staff issued a statement reaffirming their devotion to the rule of law  and affirming that Joe Biden will be the 46th President of the United  States.
