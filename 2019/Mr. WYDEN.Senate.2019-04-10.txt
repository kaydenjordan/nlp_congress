 Madam President, the Senate is just hours away from voting  on whether to confirm David Bernhardt to head the Interior Department.  He would replace Ryan Zinke, who was forced from office in the eye of  an ethical hurricane. I am here tonight to put the Senate on notice  that I believe, if David Bernhardt is confirmed as Interior Secretary,  another ethical storm will be on us in the very near future. The Zinke  ethics hurricane was bad enough. America should not be harmed again if  it is followed by a Bernhardt ethical typhoon.   I believe the Bernhardt nomination ought to be stopped in its tracks  right here, right now. At a minimum, the Senate ought to put on hold  this whole matter until we can gather more information so an informed  decision can be based on all the facts.   At this moment, with the debate hurtling possibly toward an end,  there are four pending requests by a dozen Senators, including myself,  for inspector general investigations of the issues involving Mr.  Bernhardt. In the other body, there are a host of requests for  investigations as well. There has been a lot of speculation about how  all of these issues have been aired.   This is old news, say some. The fact is, that is not right. This  doesn't go back months. My concerns aren't information that has been  sitting out in public view for years. The prospect of an investigation  is developing in real time right now. I am going to run through some of  the basic facts before getting into deeper details.   First, according to the Office of Government Ethics, Mr. Bernhardt  has 27 different former clients who are posing a potential of unlimited  numbers of conflicts of interests--oil clients, coal clients, water  clients, major ag and resources clients. All of them have business  before the Department that the Interior Secretary is supposed to be  running for the benefit of the public, not for special interests.   My sense is, with all of these conflicts, Mr. Bernhardt would have  basically two choices; one, he could comply with the ethics pledge and  pretty much recuse himself from everything. Lord knows what he would be  doing all day because he would have to recuse himself; or two, he would  basically do business and just violate the ethical principles.   Lately, he seems to have been on what seems like a victory parade on  Capitol Hill, touting what he says is a record of being a champion of  ethics, but if you take a look at that record and take a look at what  was said during his confirmation hearing, as my son William Peter  Wyden, age 11--pictures available on my iPhone after my presentation-- would say, that Bernhardt statement was one big whopper.   Mr. Bernhardt served as Deputy Secretary to Ryan Zinke. All through  this parade of environmental horrors that were visited upon us, Mr.  Bernhardt was the key man in that office. There is not one shred of  evidence that Mr. Bernhardt objected to Ryan Zinke's corruption. There  is no evidence of it. Just think about it. He is always described as  the guy who made the Interior Department run and that he was the key to  all of these pieces. Ryan Zinke is out there with flagrant conflicts of  interest and the like. Yet there is no evidence that Mr. Bernhardt--the  self-styled expert on ethics--ever objected to anything.   Second, not even 2 weeks ago, Mr. Bernhardt came before the Energy  and Natural Resources Committee for his nomination. He admitted that he  had a role in blocking a landmark scientific report on toxic  pesticides--the kind of report that career, nonpartisan scientists and  staff spend years developing in close consultation with Department  lawyers. Mr. Bernhardt's excuse for blocking the report was that it  needed to be ``read by the lawyers,'' and he gave the impression to the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the country--people were  following it on C-SPAN--he gave the impression, when he said it needed  to be read by the lawyers, as though that was not already the routine.  His claim doesn't pass the smell test. I believe he lied to the Energy  and Natural Resources Committee.   Third, let's talk about his lobbying. Mr. Bernhardt deregistered as a  lobbyist to join the Trump transition team before the President's  inauguration. There is evidence he kept right on lobbying, nonetheless,  in violation of the law. There is a whole lot of talk about mislabeled  invoices and simple errors that attempted to explain it all the way.  The fact is, there were multiple cases in which Mr. Bernhardt was  engaged in activities that made him the de facto lobbyist, carrying on  with the same job he had been doing all along.   So you have a pattern of unethical behavior right in front of our  eyes. He said he had to do this lawyering. There hadn't been any  lawyering. Then we go back and look at the rules, and they say that in  these situations, there is lawyering all the way through the process.  That is why I am very troubled about his trustworthiness.   After Ryan Zinke's departure, every Senator ought to be interested in  restoring integrity and honor to the Interior Department. Yet the Trump  administration has double downed on its commitment to graft by  nominating David Bernhardt for this job. As I mentioned, there are  pending requests for inspector general investigations. I have also  called for an investigation by the U.S. attorney. Neither of those has  had adequate time to respond, but the majority leader has rushed this  nomination to the floor.   To indicate how fast the nomination is moving, the President  obviously nominated Mr. Bernhardt to lead the Interior Department less  than a month ago. Less than 2 weeks ago, the Senate Energy and Natural  Resources Committee held the confirmation hearing on his nomination.  Exactly a week later, the committee voted to approve it. One week after  that, the Senate may choose to vote on his final confirmation. I just  think it is a grave mistake to be moving forward with so many serious  unanswered questions, and let me go through the history about why.    The Interior Department is still reeling from Ryan Zinke and what I  call this self-generated ethical hurricane. In addition to overseeing  the largest rollback of Federal land protections in American history,  Ryan Zinke triggered so many Federal inquiries and investigations  before he resigned in  [[Page S2369]]  shame that you can't even easily track them. By most public reporting,  he triggered at least 17 different Federal inquiries before he  officially left office at the start of the year: the inappropriate  censorship of scientific reports, the wasting of tens of thousands--if  not hundreds of thousands--of dollars on office doors and chartered  flights, and of cutting potentially illegal land deals with oil  industry executives. His rap sheet basically goes on and on. It is as  long as the Columbia River. In his brief tenure, Ryan Zinke  demonstrated that he was better at corrupt self-dealing than he was at  protecting our treasured public lands.   I mentioned David Bernhardt was Mr. Zinke's Deputy, and he was the  Solicitor for the Interior Department during the Bush administration.  He knows a lot about how the Department works.   I want to say this to my colleagues: If this is a guy who is hands on  and if he really understands the Department of the Interior, I think  you have to wonder why Mr. Bernhardt never seems to have objected to  any of Mr. Zinke's corrupt activities.   The Interior Department, unfortunately, isn't new to scandal, and I  am going to take a brief moment to look back at one particular scandal  that relates to these matters--Julie MacDonald, a notoriously corrupt  Interior official during the George W. Bush administration who was  forced to resign.   In December of 2006, after an anonymous complaint sparked an  investigation, the inspector general released a report showing that Ms.  MacDonald had given internal Department documents to industry lobbyists  and that she had run roughshod over career Department staff who tried  to stand in her way.   I had serious concerns about the report and what was happening at the  Department. So, literally, more than a decade ago, I placed a hold on a  nominee to the Interior Department, pending some accountability for  these flagrant abuses by Ms. MacDonald. The next day, which was months  after the original report became public, she finally resigned. Later  that year, I requested an expanded probe into Interior decisions  related to the Endangered Species Act that Ms. MacDonald had been  involved in.   There was evidence of her meddling having directly affected species  in the Pacific Northwest. The Interior's inspector general released a  report. According to the New York Times, it found ``Ms. MacDonald's  zeal to advance her agenda has caused considerable harm to the  integrity of the Endangered Species Act program and to the morale and  reputation of the Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as potential harm  to individual species.''   I bring this up because here is where David Bernhardt figures into  the story.   A few weeks ago, I was surprised that Mr. Bernhardt requested to meet  with me in my office. I said I would be glad to do it. When nominees  come by, I usually just start with the questions: Why should I vote for  you? Why should I be supportive? It is kind of an easy way for the  nominee to get into it. That is why I do it.   What Mr. Bernhardt said was that he was a big ethics champion.   He said: Hey, do you remember Julie MacDonald? I am captain ethics. I  advised Julie MacDonald to clean up her act.   I didn't ask Mr. Bernhardt about Julie MacDonald. He brought it up.   I have met with a lot of nominees, and I have heard a lot of reasons  as to why they deserve my vote, but this meeting was certainly a head- scratcher. A nominee who had been present for Ryan Zinke's reign of  corruption and conflict and who had seemed not to do anything about it  had shown up, at his request, to tout his own ethics.   A few hours after the meeting in my office with Mr. Bernhardt, I  decided I would look at his record for myself. Interior Department  documents that had been obtained through a Freedom of Information Act  request showed he had recently blocked the release of a Fish and  Wildlife report about the effects of dangerous, toxic pesticides.   Career staff at the Fish and Wildlife Service, an Interior Department  Agency, were on the brink of completing a comprehensive report on the  impact of three pesticides on, potentially, hundreds of endangered  species. This was a report by career staff. It was not put together by  people who were political appointees. It defined pesticides that were  so dangerous and so toxic that they jeopardized the continued existence  of more than 1,000 species. This report, had it been made public, would  have had profound consequences for pesticide manufacturers in the  businesses that had used them.   The dedicated team of career staff at the Fish and Wildlife Service  that had worked so long on this in order to make sure they really dug  into the science--and they took years to be fastidious about it--wanted  to make it public. The team was working rapidly to submit its findings  to the Environmental Protection Agency for its review.   The documents show that before this landmark report could make it  into public view, Mr. Bernhardt came along and pushed himself into the  middle of the process. The documents show his emails on the pesticide  report. He demanded briefings from these career scientists. They show  meetings with White House officials and others about the specific  section of the law that governs the role of Fish and Wildlife in these  types of assessments. There is even included an email in which Mr.  Bernhardt edited the letter that Interior officials used to block the  release of the pesticide report. There were digital fingerprints  everywhere.   I have to say that I looked at this, and I said: This sure sounds  like Julie MacDonald all over again. The guy who said: ``Hey, I was the  one who pushed Julie MacDonald to clean up her act,'' looked like he  was meddling with the science just the way Julie MacDonald was. Ms.  MacDonald was found by the inspector general to have meddled with the  scientific conclusions, and now there is David Bernhardt, who has been  alleged to have manipulated the process and blocked the release of an  Endangered Species Act report.   So Mr. Bernhardt came to say that his ethics were unimpeachable and  that he was above reproach. Yet I will tell you, for my colleagues who  are thinking about this, if you read the documents I read from the  Freedom of Information Act, they make him sound like another Julie  MacDonald. I worked through all of these documents, and they left me  with the impression that Mr. Bernhardt had lied to me about his ethics  during our one-on-one meeting as well. It left me wondering why he  would go out of his way to talk up his ethics when he must have known  the truth was going to come out eventually.   During his confirmation hearing, he claimed he would strive to bring  a culture of ethical compliance. He said he hoped to overhaul the  ethics of the Ryan Zinke period and the Julie MacDonald experience.  Senators called his qualifications unparalleled and claimed that the  allegations of ethical misconduct against him were false. I respect  those colleagues who have their opinions. I have my own, and my  opinions are going to be based on the documents.   The document I entered into the record at his confirmation hearing  showed that the pesticide industry repeatedly asked political  appointees at the Interior Department and at the Environmental  Protection Agency to intervene in the scientific analysis. It showed  that Mr. Bernhardt eventually did so.   According to documents that had been made public by the Freedom of  Information Act, a pesticide industry attorney wrote to then-Secretary  Zinke and then-Administrator Scott Pruitt on April 13 of 2017. The  pesticide industry was asking for changes to the Endangered Species  Act. The industry followed it up very shortly with a request to meet  with the Environmental Protection Agency's staff. At that time, a  pesticide industry executive called an attorney of the Interior  Department for a meeting as well. Another official from a pesticide  trade association reached out to the same Interior Department attorney  to discuss the Endangered Species Act.   Other supporting documentation consisted of an email that was dated  October 5, 2017, from Mr. Bernhardt to Gary Frazer, the Fish and  Wildlife Service's Assistant Director, who handles these endangered  species. He ``was the top official overseeing the assessment of the  impact,'' according to the press, while looking at the implications of  these pesticides. In this email, Mr. Bernhardt asked Mr. Frazer for a  briefing the following week. Additional documents  [[Page S2370]]  show that Mr. Bernhardt held a series of meetings with Mr. Frazer over  the next 3 weeks.   On October 30, according to the calendar released by the Freedom of  Information Act, Mr. Bernhardt met with White House officials to  discuss Endangered Species Act provisions. It is called section 7. That  is the section that pertains to the role that the Fish and Wildlife  plays in ensuring other Agencies aren't jeopardizing species.   An email from November of 2017 shows Mr. Bernhardt edited the draft  of a letter from career Fish and Wildlife Service staff to the EPA. It  announced the Interior Department wouldn't be delivering the Fish and  Wildlife's assessment to the Agency as planned. This, colleagues, is  where Mr. Bernhardt put the brakes on this important Fish and Wildlife  report about the pesticides.   According to a New York Times report, the pesticide analysis was  blocked in conjunction with a ``radical shift'' in how the Fish and  Wildlife analyzes the effects of these pesticides. The change greatly  increased the burden of proof the Agency is required to meet to  demonstrate pesticide effects on species. According to that article in  the Times, it would likely result in fewer new restrictions on  pesticide use. CropLife and RISE--two trade associations that represent  the pesticide companies--were very much in favor of this. They were  praising it.   Based on the documents, at the hearing, I asked Mr. Bernhardt why he  would come to my office and sell me on ethics when the reports and the  documents I just read showed otherwise. He had no response.   At the hearing, I asked Mr. Bernhardt specifically why he would come  to the office and make these claims. He had no response at the hearing  but took a long sip of water as though he had meant to go on awhile.  Mr. Bernhardt made the claim that career Fish and Wildlife staff  ``clearly'' didn't complete any legal review on the pesticide report,  which is why he stepped in.   During the hearing and while under oath, I believe Mr. Bernhardt  confirmed allegations that he interfered with the release of an  Endangered Species Act report. He didn't, however, acknowledge that his  involvement was inappropriate political meddling.   Following the hearing and with serious questions remaining about  whether he had lied under oath to the committee, I wrote the Interior  Department's inspector general for her help in getting to the bottom of  the matter. Here are the facts I included:   On March 28, 2019, Mr. Bernhardt appeared before the U.S. Senate  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for his confirmation hearing  to become Secretary of the Department of the Interior. I questioned him  about these documents and his role in blocking the Fish and Wildlife's  analyses. He confirmed to me that he had reviewed the analyses. He  claimed he believed the analyses had not been subject to legal review  and made the determination to delay the report.   Second, Mr. Bernhardt's response:         You're dealing with some of the most difficult       consultations on the planet, and when I read the document, my       reaction to it was this is really an interesting draft. But       it clearly didn't have any legal review, and in our world you       can't ignore the law and come up with a scheme.    He continued:         And so what we decided is that the approach needed to be       readdressed.    Mr. Bernhardt's answer is totally off base with respect to the way  legal analyses work.   Under standard procedure, there would be legal analysis through the  development of this kind of fish and wildlife report. It would involve  lawyers at Fish and Wildlife, Interior Department, or both.   So I am especially troubled by what appears to be a political  appointee meddling in the scientific process with respect to a report  that revealed the extraordinary danger of toxic pesticides.   I am the senior member on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee,  a former chairman of the committee. I cannot recall ever having this  kind of exchange with a nominee.   That is why I had to request that the Office of Inspector General  investigate the following: What role did Mr. Bernhardt and other  political appointees at the Interior Department play in delaying or  obstructing the Fish and Wildlife Service pesticide report? What role  did he play in changing Fish and Wildlife policy with regard to this  key section in the Endangered Species Act? What role did other  political appointees--Agriculture Senior Advisor, former CropLife  lobbyist, Ms. Adcock--play in the Interior Department and Fish and  Wildlife Service's decision making? Whether, as Mr. Bernhardt alleged  to me under oath on March 28, 2019, the Fish and Wildlife draft  analysis ``clearly didn't have any legal review'' and whether, as Mr.  Bernhardt alleged to me, career lawyers at the Interior Department  agreed with his analysis--these are all questions that haven't been  answered.   I would just say to the Senate, if you need more evidence that there  are too many questions to allow this nomination to move forward, the  story just gets more complicated.   After Mr. Bernhardt demonstrated that he simply was going to dance  around the truth, the Senate has to question his basic understanding of  the law.   So on Monday, I asked the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia  to thoroughly investigate potential civil and criminal violations of  the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 by Mr. Bernhardt, as well as his  former lobbying firm.   By the way, again, a newspaper reports--this time the Washington  Post--that Mr. Bernhardt's ex-firm has quadrupled its business, earning  nearly $5 million to lobby the Interior Department since he has taken  his most recent spin through the Interior Department revolving door.   So here is what I said to the U.S. attorney: Lobbying Disclosure Act  filings show Mr. Bernhardt registered to lobby for his law firm on  behalf of the Westlands Water District on March 30, 2011. Westlands is  the largest agricultural water district in the United States, in  central California. Public reporting indicates Mr. Bernhardt ran his  former lobby firm's natural resources department.   That lobby firm filed its 2016 fourth quarter report on November 18,  2016--1 week after the 2016 Presidential election--terminating Mr.  Bernhardt's lobbying status as of that day.   Public reporting at the time indicates Mr. Bernhardt ``delisted  himself as a lobbyist in November after Trump won the election to avoid  running afoul of the new President's ban on lobbyists joining his  administration.''   Public reporting and documents obtained via public records show that  Mr. Bernhardt maintained his relationship with Westlands after his  lobbyist deregistration on November 18, 2016. Furthermore, he may have  repeatedly engaged in activity that would require him to continue  registering as a Federal lobbyist. So he claimed he was no longer a  lobbyist, but it sure looks as though he went right on lobbying.   The Lobbying Disclosure Act is pretty clear. I will read from public  guidance provided by the U.S. House of Representatives. A lobbyist can  terminate their registration ``only when the individual's lobbying  activities on behalf of that client did not constitute at the end of  the quarter . . . 20 percent of the time that such employee is engaged  in total activities for that client; or that individual doesn't  reasonably expect to make further lobbying contacts.''   What does the law mean by ``lobbying contacts?'' That is pretty clear  too. The same guidance says it is ``any oral, written, or electronic  communication to a covered Federal official that is made on behalf of a  client'' with regard to Federal legislation, rulemaking, executive  orders and the like. ``Covered Federal officials'' include all Members  of Congress and their staff.   The evidence I included in my request to the U.S. Attorney for the  District of Columbia included several emails showing Mr. Bernhardt may  have engaged in repeated, regulated lobbying contacts with covered  Federal legislative branch officials.   The first time, according to the information that is already public,  appears to be on November 22, 2016, just a few days after he  deregistered as a lobbyist. Mr. Bernhardt agreed to join a conference  call with Westlands and the offices of Representative Devin Nunes and  former Representative Valadao to discuss upcoming legislation.   The second and third times are covered in a complaint filed with the  U.S.  [[Page S2371]]  attorney's office in 2017. That complaint included copies of emails  documenting Mr. Bernhardt's role in 2016 and 2017 as an intermediary  for congressional staff and Westlands. It also appeared to include a  trip to California for Mr. Bernhardt, paid for by Westlands.   So here is what it appears happened: Mr. Bernhardt provided his  client, Westlands, with information about legislative efforts in 2016  and 2017. His old lobbying firm also disclosed lobbying on behalf of  Westlands on those same legislative efforts over the same timeframe.   Another new report shows that Mr. Bernhardt was also in contact in  December 2016 with a Senate employee covered by lobbying regulations.   On March 8, 2017, his old lobby firm sent Westlands an invoice for  more than $27,000 for ``Federal lobbying.'' It included an itemized  list of expenses related to Mr. Bernhardt's January 2017 travel to  California for a ``Westlands'' trip.   On April 20, 2017, the lobbying firm filed its 2017 first quarter  disclosure that is required by the Lobbying Disclosure Act. It showed  Westlands paid the firm $70,000 for lobbying services related to H.R.  1769, a bill involving the San Luis unit drainage district, among other  measures. It was a longstanding priority for Westlands--a moneymaking  opportunity. It was sponsored by then-Representative Valadao, one of  the Congressmen Mr. Bernhardt appears to have been in contact with on  November 22, 2016, and January 2, 2017.   The lobby firm's 2017 first quarter disclosure was filed shortly  after the firm sent Westlands the March invoice for Mr. Bernhardt's  February 2017 ``Federal lobbying'' activity.   According to a media report in July of 2017, a Westlands  representative claimed Bernhardt ceased all lobbying activity ``the  moment he deregistered as a lobbyist.'' In May of 2017, during his  confirmation process to be Deputy Secretary, Mr. Bernhardt also claimed  in writing to the committee he had ``not engaged in regulated lobbying  on behalf of Westlands Water District after November 18, 2016.''   These Bernhardt claims simply do not line up with the documents.  Perhaps that is why he refused when one of my colleagues requested he  provide complete records relating to any communications he had with  covered legislative branch officials after the date of his  deregistration.   Let me repeat that.   When one of the Senators on the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee asked Mr. Bernhardt to provide documents that would help the  committee get to the bottom of this issue, he just stonewalled. He just  refused.   The Lobbying Disclosure Act isn't that burdensome. The firm and Mr.  Bernhardt could have chosen to disclose his lobbying activity on behalf  of Westlands. They chose not to do so, so everybody is going to ask  why.   The U.S. attorney's office is responsible for enforcement of the  Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. So this week I wrote to the U.S.  attorney, requesting a thorough investigation.   I have spent this time highlighting some of the major reasons that  make me feel strongly that Mr. Bernhardt's nomination should not move  forward at this time. Chief among them are that I have two pending  requests for investigations at this time, neither of which have been  responded to because it has been a short time and the majority leader  is interested in steamrolling this flawed nominee by the American  people.   I am just going to conclude my remarks by summarizing a couple of Mr.  Bernhardt's greatest hits with respect to why he is thoroughly  unqualified to be Secretary of the Department of Interior.   The first is the matter of the conflicts. He is a former oil  lobbyist. In fact, at one point, I was going to say that he was the oil  industry's guy, but the oil industry lobbyists beat me to it. A secret  tape came out, and they were quoted as saying: We are glad he is our  guy. Dozens of his ex-clients have business before Interior. According  to his ethics pledge, he should be conflicted out of working on those  issues. If he remains involved, he will be flagrantly violating his  ethics pledge. So if he follows the rules and stays out of all of these  issues his clients have before the Department, I will tell you, for the  life of me, I can't figure out what he is going to do all day because  he is going to be conflicted out of all of these matters that are going  to be before the Department.   Just last week, Mr. Bernhardt's previously unrevealed calendars were  partially made public. To nobody's surprise, many of those secret  meetings have been with industry. This is yet another item that  Congress, including the other body, has asked for more information  about.   So the damage has been done. The conflicts are clear. He has already  taken actions that benefit his former clients and former employers.   He has taken steps specifically to weaken the Endangered Species  Act--worked to weaken wildlife protections for a California fish  species, according to another investigation. This weakening of  protections for the California fish species is a policy change that one  of Mr. Bernhardt's former clients--Westlands Water District--had been  pushing for for years.   Mr. Bernhardt's Interior announced that the Agency is basically going  to stop holding oil companies accountable for oilspills by ending  enforcement of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. This move has been long  supported by yet another energy lobby, another one of Mr. Bernhardt's  former clients.   Mr. Bernhardt's Interior Department increased drilling and mining  access on millions of acres of sage-grouse habitat across five Western  States. That drilling will be conducted by companies, again, linked to  Mr. Bernhardt. It could make the sage-grouse an endangered species, and  it could endanger the livelihoods of ranching families on the rural  frontier who are just hoping to preserve their traditional way of life.   Mr. Bernhardt continues delivering for the oil and gas industry. A  CNN report found the Agency has advanced at least 15 policies supported  by his former clients during his time at Interior Department-- everything from the elimination of BLM's methane reduction rules and  gutting safety rules for natural gas drilling on public lands, to  risking the lives of workers by reducing safety standards for offshore  drilling. I don't think it is any big surprise why those oil executives  were cheering about Mr. Bernhardt's nomination and calling him,  literally, their guy.   During the longest government shutdown on record, when national parks  were unstaffed and overflowing with human waste, Mr. Bernhardt even  recalled Interior employees to specifically approve hundreds of  drilling permits. Certainly, the oil and gas giants are getting their  money's worth.   To cap off my list, Mr. Bernhardt's Interior Department even proposed  opening up the entire U.S. coastline for offshore oil drilling.   I am heading home. I am sure my colleague from North Dakota and other  Senators are also. I am having town meetings and listening to people.  There isn't going to be anybody who comes to my town meetings starting  in the next couple of days who wants to see the Oregon coastline up for  offshore drilling or who wants to see the oil derricks at Haystack  Rock, and they don't want to be standing on our beaches holding oil- soaked sponges.   The entire time Mr. Bernhardt has been at the Interior Department,  his former lobbying firm has just been raking in the cash. So the  question really becomes: Has he already broken the law? My bottom line  is that the Senate ought to take the time to actually look into that  issue. It isn't some trivial matter after the self-generated Zinke  ethical hurricane.   Shouldn't we say, after that ethics horror show, that it is the job  of every Member in the Senate--every Democrat and every Republican--to  work for policies that bring honor and credibility back to the Interior  Department? I just don't think that is going to be the case if this  body confirms David Bernhardt.   We will be voting, at least tonight, on the procedure, and depending  on how that goes, we may be voting on final passage.   I will just tell you that I don't want to be back on this floor in a  matter of months talking about yet another Interior leader, like Ryan  Zinke, forced from office as the result of a grotesque scandal. The  Senate doesn't have to leave the door of the Interior Department wide  open for more conflicted individuals to waltz into positions of  [[Page S2372]]  power where they can work against the interests of the American people.  I believe that is exactly what America will get from David Bernhardt.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, 30 years ago today, the Whistleblower  Protection Act was signed into law. To call it a triumph doesn't do  justice to the sheer number of years and people it took on both sides  of the aisle to overcome numerous obstacles and enact Federal  protections for Federal Government employees who step forward and do  what we all should do: expose wrongdoings in order to hold government  officials and agencies accountable.   Congressional efforts to protect whistleblowers date back to at least  1912 with the enactment of the Lloyd-La Follette Act. This act  guaranteed the right of Federal employees to communicate with Members  of Congress without the oversight of their employer and prohibited  compensation to managers who retaliated against employees attempting to  disclose whistleblower matters.   However, empowering Federal employees to speak up and speak the truth  was and continues to be an ongoing struggle, one that has often pitted  Congress against the executive branch. When President George H.W. Bush  signed the Whistleblower Protection Act into law that April morning in  1989, it came after his predecessor President Ronald Reagan had vetoed  a similar bill despite the fact that it had been unanimously adopted by  both the Senate and the House.   The Whistleblower Protection Act, itself, was first introduced by  Representative Pat Schroeder of Colorado as an amendment to the Civil  Service Reform Act of 1978 and then as a stand-alone bill in 1982. The  principal purpose of the bill was to block retaliation against  employees who came forward, a never-ending problem. The bill would have  allowed ``a person claiming to be aggrieved by a prohibited personnel  practice to: (1) bring a civil action in a U.S. district court against  the employee or agency involved (respondent); or (2) seek corrective  action through the (Merit Systems Protection) Board.''   While that particular bill ultimately died after receiving  unfavorable comments from the U.S. Government Accountability Office-- GAO--and the Merit Systems Protection Board, which adjudicates  whistleblower complaints, its failure didn't deter our colleagues.   By the time 1989 rolled around, Members of both the House and the  Senate, including Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, who spearheaded  efforts in the Senate, had worked together for years to find a  compromise and pass legislation that protected those employees whose  disclosures revealed waste, fraud, or abuse. Between May of 1982 and  September of 1989, 28 bills and resolutions with whistleblower  protections built into them were introduced, many of them with dozens  and dozens of cosponsors.   Since the passage of the Whistleblower Protection Act 30 years ago,  Congress has continued to improve protections for whistleblowers,  notably with the passage of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower  Protection Act of 1998; the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of  2012; the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and  Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017; and more recently the Dr. Chris  Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017.   Unfortunately, despite all of these efforts, becoming a whistleblower  is still a perilous path. In its latest budget justification, the  Office of Special Counsel, the agency that investigates retaliation  against Federal whistleblowers, reported that, in fiscal year 2018,  that agency received over 4,100 complaints of retaliation, otherwise  known as prohibited personnel practices. This, according to OSC, is a  new agency record. That is not a record that anyone should be proud of.   As much as today is a celebration of the Whistleblower Protection Act  and the work of the many people it took to make those protections law,  it is a greater celebration of the courage whistleblowers embody when  they step forward to shine a light on waste, fraud, abuse, and  mismanagement in the government. Their bravery and sacrifice is  invaluable, and for that, we thank them. Unfortunately, coming forward  to do what is right still requires too much of both.   Consequently, Congress still has more work to do to protect  whistleblowers, and I call on my colleagues to remember the value of  citizens being able to blow the whistle. As Representative Schroeder  said early on in her efforts to help whistleblowers: ``If we in  Congress are going to act as effective checks on excesses in the  executive branch, we have to hear about such matters.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague Senator  Booker of New Jersey, are introducing the Algorithmic Accountability  Act. This bill is a critical first step to address the use of biased or  discriminatory algorithmic decisions impacting American consumers. It  is a bicameral effort, led in the House of Representatives by  Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, vice chair of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   Today's biggest companies are increasingly using algorithms to make  decisions about consumers. The use by companies of algorithms can often  benefit consumers, and these technologies have been critical in the  creation of thousands of American companies. Alongside this beneficial  proliferation, algorithms have become entrenched in the most life- changing of decisions. Algorithms can now determine whether Americans  are hired for a dream job, are approved for a home mortgage, or even  sent to jail.   But, as history has shown, a win for the corporation is not always a  win for the consumer. And, in this case, when consumers lose, all too  often they are a woman or an American of color. Though an innovation  critical for future growth, algorithms can be as discriminatory as the  humans they have begun to replace.   The issue is a simple one: While algorithms come to conclusions based  on calculations, these calculations are created by humans or use data  collected and supplied by humans. And, unfortunately, we humans can be  biased, whether we know it or not, or we can created algorithms that,  in time, create biases of their own.   Thanks to a flood of news reports and investigations detailing  algorithms-gone-wrong, these issues are coming to light. Yet, American  companies and the U.S. government are doing far too little to assess  whether their own algorithms depend on biased assumptions, have created  biases assumptions, and have the effect of increasing discrimination in  the U.S.   Senator Booker and I intend to change that by ensuring that today's  racial, social, and gender biases do not become entrenched in the  automation of tomorrow.   Our bill has four main components.   First, it authorizes the Federal Trade Commission to create  regulations requiring companies under its jurisdiction to conduct  impact assessments of highly sensitive algorithms. This requirement  would apply not only to new algorithmic systems, but also those that  are both new and already in existence.   Second, it requires companies to assess their use of algorithms-- including any relevant training data--for impacts on accuracy,  fairness, bias, discrimination, privacy, and security.   Third, it requires companies to evaluate how their information  systems protect the privacy and security of consumers' personal  information.   And, finally, it requires companies to correct any issues they  discover during the impact assessments.   This legislation is in no way intended to hinder the adoption by  American companies of advanced technologies like algorithms. Automated  decision systems are out there, and they are being adopted into  commercial decision-making processes.   What we are seeking to do with this bill is to ensure that companies  take a hard look at their own technologies to ensure that they address  any unintended side effects.   Mr. President, it is time for Congress to get involved by requiring  companies to address biases and unintended discriminatory effects in  their automated decision systems.   I thank my colleague Senator Booker for his efforts on this bill, and  I hope the Senate will promptly consider and pass this critical  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Ms. Smith, Mrs. Gilibrand, and Mr.          Merkley):   S. 1132.
