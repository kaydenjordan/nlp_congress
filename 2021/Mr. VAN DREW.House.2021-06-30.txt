 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3684.   Our country's infrastructure is crumbling. Prices are surging  everywhere. Yet before us is an infrastructure plan that fails to  address America's needs, and, in fact, will make our lives even more  expensive. This bill neglects to fix the bureaucracy that makes the  United States one of the most difficult places in the world to build  infrastructure.   The bill diminishes American energy prosperity and grows our  dependence on the Chinese Communist Party's slave labor. The bill makes  goods and services more expensive by overregulating American workers  and American businesses.   To put it simply, this bill makes it more expensive to be an  American.   We need truly bipartisan legislation to address the American  infrastructure crisis. We should focus on traditional infrastructure by  investing in roads and bridges and dams, as well as modern  infrastructure of broadband internet. We should strengthen American  supply chains so that the American infrastructure boom is fueled by  American materials, American workers, and American businesses.   Mr. Speaker, these are the steps we must take to build a stronger  America. I and all of us will never stop fighting for this vision of  American greatness.
