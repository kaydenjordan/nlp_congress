 Mr. President, one of North Dakota's most  distinguished citizens and respected jurists is retiring this week.  Justice Gerald W. ``Jerry'' VandeWalle is leaving the North Dakota  Supreme Court as the longest serving justice in the history of the  court.   A native of the small northwestern North Dakota community of Noonan,  Justice VandeWalle earned his law degree from the University of North  Dakota in 1958. He devoted more than 60 years of his legal career  working for the citizens of our State. The first 20 years were as an  assistant attorney general, prior to his appointment to the supreme  court in 1978. In his nearly 45 years on the supreme court, he served  27 of those as chief justice. At the time he relinquished his  responsiblities as chief justice in 2020, he was the longest serving  chief justice in the entire Nation.   As impressive as these statistics are, the real legacy of Justice  VandeWalle is not found in numbers. Instead, it is in the profound  impact he made year after year, case after case, as he sought to uphold  the law with impartiality in every judicial decision. His warmth and  kindness, his engaging optimism, and his humble nature were his  everyday demeanor. He was accessible to other state officials, a fierce  advocate for the judicial branch before the State legislature, and a  revered mentor to lawyers aross the State and country.   In the 27 years between 1993 and 2020 when Justice VandeWalle was  chief justice, North Dakota experienced notable changes in its  population, demographics, economy, and culture. All the while, he kept  a steady focus on how North Dakota courts could deliver access to  justice for all. He was integral in unifying the court system,  redefining state judicial districts and bringing more judges to  accommodate each district's needs. He addressed emerging technology  innovations in courtrooms and expanded court services for population  groups like veterans, juveniles, and the elderly.   The judicial impact of Justice Jerry VandeWalle will resonate across  our State and Nation for decades to come. Visitors to our State capitol  will read about his legendary career next to his portrait in the North  Dakota Rough Rider Hall of Fame, the highest honor given to our  citizens. Kris and I will miss seeing him at official events and will  treasure even more the friendship we shared over the years. On behalf  of all North Dakotans, I thank him for his exemplary service and  congratulate him on his well-earned retirement. I wish him many years  of health and happiness in the future.                            ____________________
