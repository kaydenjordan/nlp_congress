 Mr. Chairman, let me first commend the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) for his leadership on this issue and  so many others on behalf of our veteran population.   As a veteran myself of the war in Afghanistan, I have a deep  commitment to ensuring that my fellow veterans receive the proper care  and treatment that they have earned by serving our country. That is why  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the VA Accountability First  Act.   This bipartisan legislation will give Secretary Shulkin the tools  that he needs to change the dysfunctional culture of the VA. It has  been 3 years since the wait list at VA facilities became public, yet  too many of our veterans deal with VA employees who engage in  misconduct that could endanger their lives.   Too often, it takes months or even years to remove those employees.  Worse still, sometimes these employees are not removed at all. Most VA  employees, though, are hardworking and dedicated people, which makes it  that much more unfair when the VA can't or won't hold bad employees  accountable.   We can and must do better, and this bill is a first step in that  process.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    The bill would shorten the time it takes to  fire a VA employee for misconduct, give the Secretary the discretion to  both revoke bonuses previously paid to employees engaging in misconduct  and reduce pensions of employees found guilty of felonies while on the  job, and provide improved protections for whistleblowers.   These are commonsense proposals supported by many veterans' groups.  This bill is also supported by Secretary Shulkin. It is a no-brainer,  and that is why I support it.
