 Mr. Speaker, with last week's threat of  Hurricane Dorian to South Carolina, I am grateful to the State  officials who worked to prepare the people of South Carolina. I  appreciate Governor Henry McMaster, Adjutant General Van McCarty,  Secretary of Transportation Christy Hall, Attorney General Alan Wilson,  as well as Kim Stenson, the director of the Emergency Management  Division.   As the hurricane approached, I went by to thank all of the State and  Federal personnel in the South Carolina Emergency Management Division  at Pine Ridge. The work this division achieves is vital to the safety  of thousands of South Carolinians, and I commend them on their  vigilance and around-the-clock attention.   I am grateful that Governor McMaster closely coordinated with  President Trump and continuously kept the people of South Carolina up- to-date on the ever-changing hurricane.   I would also like to thank President Donald Trump for helping South  Carolina to prepare in this time of uncertainty.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
