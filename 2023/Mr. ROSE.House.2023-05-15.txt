 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the 75th  anniversary of the founding of Israel.   On Sunday, May 14, not only did we celebrate 75 years since the birth  of Israel, but we also celebrated 75 years since the birth of a special  friendship between the United States and Israel.   For 75 years, there has been no better ally to the United States than  Israel and no better ally to Israel than the United States.   There is no issue more bipartisan than that of continuing to  strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship. Because of this, I believe our  relationship will continue to grow stronger over the next 75 years.   Madam Speaker, I hope all Members of this body join me in wishing a  very happy birthday to Israel. May the next 75 years be a time of hope  and prosperity.                            ____________________
