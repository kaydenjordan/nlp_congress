 Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to  recognize a truly exceptional member of the U.S. Senate--not one who  has a vote on this floor but certainly one who has wielded great  influence and who has generated great appreciation from many of us who  have had the privilege and the honor to serve on the Appropriations  Committee, as you have.   Today I am here to speak about an individual who has been serving the  U.S. Senate on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee now for two  decades, and this gentleman is a friend by the name of Leif Fonnesbeck.   Leif started with the Interior Appropriations Committee under the  helm of Chairman Slade Gorton from the State of Washington and then  also, of course, the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee at  that time, my friend and mentor Ted Stevens.   So it is actually a little bit bittersweet for me to be speaking  about Leif and recognizing his contributions because after two  decades--21 years--Leif is retiring from public service, and I  understand, certainly, his desire. Twenty years is a good run. It is a  significant amount of effort and truly an admirable career.   Both Leif and I are born and raised Alaskans, and you can never take  the home out of your heart. It is something that is a continual tug,  and so I can certainly understand his desire to spend more time at home  with the incredible Alaskans whom we call friends  [[Page S2102]]  and family and to be in our amazing and extraordinary spaces.   As I mentioned, Leif is an Alaskan. He grew up there in Anchorage.  Leif's mom was a librarian, and his father was a principal. He and his  sisters grew up exploring and experiencing everything that is Alaska-- all things great.   He attended East High School. He left to get his undergraduate degree  in finance from here in Washington, DC, at Georgetown University, my  alma mater. He then went on to law school and went out to the  University of Arizona. Then, shortly after he got his law degree, he  returned home to Anchorage, thinking that he was going to practice law  there.   So he wasn't there for too very long when then-Appropriations  Committee Chairman Ted Stevens tapped Leif and said: Look, I would like  to have you come back to Washington, DC, and work for me on the Senate  Appropriations Interior Subcommittee. So it was at that time that Leif  made the big move, leaving from Anchorage and coming back here to  Washington, DC, to work with his mentor and my mentor, Ted Stevens.   There are a lot of stories that go on around here. I have enjoyed  getting to know the great Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, who had a  great tenure working with Chairman Stevens on the Appropriations  Committee, but you learn a lot from leaders like that, and I know that  Leif certainly learned a great deal from the leadership of Senator  Stevens.   He learned the art of the appropriations process, the art of trying  to work with people on oftentimes contentious issues and places, but he  really, truly learned the art of looking out for the needs of Alaska  and Alaskans while meeting the needs of the Interior bill. He truly,  truly served with distinction throughout his tenure on the  subcommittee.   In addition to being an expert--and he really was an expert at his  job--he is just a rock-solid guy. He gave solid advice, was willing to  be helpful, and had a nature and a generosity that were really key to  all those who knew him and who really had the pleasure to work with  him.   Oftentimes, you can't say that it is really a pleasure to work with  you. Well, it was a pleasure--it is a pleasure--to work with Leif  Fonnesbeck.   Since becoming chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee,  I have had the benefit of Leif's experience and knowledge of Alaska and  of the appropriations process. I will tell you, when I moved over to  Interior to take that on as chair of that subcommittee, it was a little  bit daunting at first. It is an expansive portfolio--everything from  the EPA to management of our public lands, to the Indian Health  Service, to the BIA. It is all over the board, and it is a challenging  one, including how we are dealing with wildfires and fire borrowing. We  have some significant, significant challenges, but Leif was just that  font of knowledge, not only from his experience on the committee but  just from his experience in working with so many of these issues and  working with so many of the people over the years.   He has been an absolutely excellent partner in navigating the really  very difficult, complicated, and complex process that is required to  produce funding bills in a manner that is viewed as fair and open and  just true to the process. I am just so very, very grateful to his  service to me, to the State of Alaska, and, truly, to the U.S. Senate.   For 21 years now, Leif's work on the Interior Subcommittee has  impacted the lives of more Alaskans than he will possibly ever realize.  His efforts, particularly on behalf of Alaska's Native communities, as  well as our vast natural resources, have had and will continue to have  a tremendous impact on our State and our people. Because of his work,  more communities have access to clean water through new drinking  systems. This was something that Leif really concentrated on. He would  go out to the villages. He would see firsthand what it meant to the  health conditions of families when they don't have access to clean and  safe drinking water and when they don't have sanitation facilities, and  he worked to address that.   More Alaskans are empowered to build their economy and create healthy  communities through investments for new infrastructure and support for  programs to address domestic violence, substance abuse, and suicide.   Every year we have been able to help those accounts move forward  because the needs were so desperate and the needs were so urgent, and  Leif helped to advance those priorities.   Support for rural healthcare clinics enabled more Alaskans to have  access to care. There were the efforts that he went through to help  facilitate Native hospitals, whether in Barrow or in Nome, and now down  in the Bethel region with the joint venture projects, making sure that  we have adequate, strong staffing packages. Investments in our public  lands have helped to protect Alaska's tourism industry and our outdoor  recreation opportunities.   He and I would go back and forth and forth and back as to whether or  not the pedestrian walkway to allow visitors in Brooks Camp to view the  bears was too Taj Mahal of a bridge or whether it was a bridge that was  going to be necessary to protect the tourists from the bears when the  bears got disinterested in the salmon that they were munching on.   Leif got down in the weeds. He got into the issues. He knew what was  going on.   His efforts for local governments to construct roads and public  schools are investments that will make a lasting impact on the State of  Alaska and the people who live there. Knowing that this is a lasting  impact that this individual, Leif, has made, is just so huge.   So as Leif is preparing to leave this place where he has been for two  decades to go back home to spend more time there--whether it is fishing  or just enjoying or going back to work--I know that he leaves many,  many friends here. He leaves many that have such appreciation for his  work, his character, his honesty, and just his professionalism.   I want to thank him for all of his years of dedication, his  commitment, his service. I wish him and his dog Leo the best as they go  back to Alaska. They will be hiking around, wandering around the shadow  of the Chugach Mountains. I know, wherever it is that he goes, though,  he will be involved in helping the people of Alaska.   I look forward to continuing to work with Lee in the next chapter of  his life. It is indeed an honor to be able to speak about him and his  good work today.   I know we are set to wrap up here. It is my colleague from Alaska who  usually has the last word on a Thursday evening, and he speaks about  the Alaskan of the Week. Senator Sullivan is not here today and will  not be giving those comments, but I feel I have kind of filled in with  giving him an Alaska of the Week with Leif Fonnesbeck, a gentleman who  has served our State honorably over such period of time.   With that, I yield the floor.   (Ms. MURKOWSKI assumed the chair.)
