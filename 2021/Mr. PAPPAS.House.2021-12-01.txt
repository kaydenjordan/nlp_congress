 Madam Speaker, this morning oral arguments began at the  Supreme Court for a case that many expect could overturn Roe v. Wade.   Despite nearly 50 years of Court precedent and overwhelming public  support for abortion rights, Roe and  [[Page H6724]]  access to reproductive healthcare hangs in the balance.   This issue is deeply personal to the women I represent in New  Hampshire, and the last thing they want to see is a politician or a  judge taking away their bodily autonomy. We are better off as a country  with Roe as the law of the land. It supports the health and economic  well-being of women and families. Still, we know that legislatures and  Governors from Mississippi to Texas to New Hampshire are enacting  extreme laws that punish doctors and take away women's rights. This  must be stopped.   That is why, regardless of what happens in this case, it is essential  that the Senate joins the House in passing the Women's Health  Protection Act. My constituents and the American people want abortion  to be safe, legal, and accessible. This legislation will uphold that  concept for the country even if the Court abandons it.                            ____________________
