Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today in support of  Kirstjen Nielsen in her nomination to be the sixth Secretary of the  Department of Homeland Security.   The challenges facing the next Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security are daunting. Our national debt exceeds $20 trillion,  and there is, unfortunately, no serious effort to reduce the 30-year  projected deficits, which exceed more than $100 trillion.   In the last few months, we have experienced unprecedented destruction  from natural disasters, stressing the budgets of both HHS and FEMA. Our  borders are not secure, allowing illegal immigration to persist,  illicit drugs to flow unabated, and making us vulnerable to external  forces. Meanwhile, our enemies are emboldened.   The threat of Islamist terrorism has evolved, metastasized, and  spread throughout the world, even reaching our homeland. We see  increased stress from cyber attacks, hacking, and social media-inspired  acts of terrorism. We face perhaps the greatest danger from enemies  within. In the past 5 years, 262 Americans have been killed and over  1,000 injured from acts of evil committed here at home. These are some  of the challenges awaiting the next Secretary of Homeland Security.   The Secretary oversees a department that is composed of 22 separate  agencies, each with a diverse mission. It employs 240,000 people, with  a budget of $66 billion. It faces challenges with unity of effort and  habitually low morale.   President Trump nominated Ms. Nielsen to lead DHS, and she is ready  to answer this call of duty. She has been working in and around the  Department since its creation. Ms. Nielsen brings valuable, practical  experience to DHS. She is an expert in risk management, with a focus on  cyber security, emergency management, and critical infrastructure.   In the aftermath of 9/11, Ms. Nielsen served as the Director of the  Office of Legislative Policy at TSA. She then moved to the White House  Homeland Security Council as Special Assistant to the President for  Homeland Security and Senior Director for Prevention, Preparedness, and  Response.   Before rejoining DHS earlier this year, Ms. Nielsen founded a risk  and security management consulting firm.   Ms. Nielsen served as DHS Chief of Staff under then-Secretary Kelly,  witnessing firsthand how the right leadership and support can quickly  and dramatically improve agency morale.   General Kelly calls Ms. Nielsen a superstar. In a letter supporting  her swift confirmation, he wrote: ``What truly sets Kirstjen apart is  her integrity, sense of service to our nation, and dedication to the  men and women who risk their lives serving our great country every  day.''   Former Secretaries Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff have also voiced  their support, as have more than 40 former senior homeland security and  intelligence officials from both parties. Secretaries Ridge and  Chertoff wrote of Ms. Nielsen:         Ms. Nielsen is a homeland security leader for our times.       More than any previous Secretary, she understands the 21st       Century challenges of the borderless cyber domain and has       worked in both the public and private sectors to address this       deeply interconnected and consequential risk to America's       national security and economic stability.        Kirstjen Nielsen offers our nation the credentials required       of the Secretary of Homeland Security in today's environment:       expertise in homeland security policy and operations;       national and international perspective; and public and       private sector experience.    I do want to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs for their support and cooperation in  moving this nomination quickly through committee and to the floor vote  that we are about to undertake.   To my colleagues, I just want to say that we are fortunate to have a  nominee with such experience and dedication to the mission of the  Department of Homeland Security, and I urge all of you to support her  confirmation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
