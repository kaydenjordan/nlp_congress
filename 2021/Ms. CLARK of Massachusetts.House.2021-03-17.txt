 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   As the rates of COVID-19 spiked across the country, so did the rates  of domestic violence. This pandemic within the pandemic must be  stopped, and before us are the tools to save lives and end the cycle of  violence.   The VAWA reauthorization makes crucial improvements to the law. It  closes legal loopholes to stop violent partners from accessing  firearms. It tackles the growing threat of online harassment by  training law enforcement on cybercrimes. It provides services for  survivors of dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. And it  improves protections for Native women.   Today, we stand up for everyone by providing safety everywhere, at  home, at work, on campus, and online.   Let us vote together to end domestic violence.
