 Madam President, as the majority leader just pointed out,  the Senate has been and will be focused on responding to the  coronavirus crisis in this country in a way that hopefully will enable  the American people to recover and that will restore our economy--that  will get things back to normal. As he pointed out, that requires  dealing with the health emergency as well as with the economic  emergency crisis that has been created by this.   With respect to the health emergency, the leader pointed out that  there are literally tens of billions of dollars being spent now on  vaccine research, on anti-viral therapeutics, and on testing. We  believe that, in order for us to get our economy fully back, we have to  deal with the health emergency in front of us, so dollars have been  made available--hundreds of billions of dollars--to healthcare  providers, hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, and providers who are on  the frontlines of this crisis and trying to deal with the challenges it  presents every single day. That is what we have focused on. In  addition, we have focused on the economic crisis and the impact it has  had on our small businesses and on our workers.   Everything that has been included in the bills that have already been  passed here in the U.S. Senate--now we have No. 4--and have been signed  into law by the President have been singularly  [[Page S2433]]  focused on trying to assist people and get them through this time as a  bridge to hopefully get the worst of this behind us and get us to a  time at which the economy begins to open up again.   Clearly, the focus was on helping families directly, making sure  those families who particularly needed the help the most got some  additional financial assistance. So checks went out--$1,200 per  individual, $2,400 per married couple, and $500 for each additional  child--as direct assistance. It went into the pockets of families  across this country   Then, with respect to workers and small businesses, there was the  Paycheck Protection Program, which by all accounts has been very, very  successful. I think the reason for that is that businesses across this  country recognize that they, too, want to keep their employees  employed. They do want to keep those jobs, hopefully, until that time  when the economy starts to open up again, so they heavily subscribe to  this program.   Interestingly enough, there has been a lot of talk on the other side,  as there usually is--a demagoging of how this helps rich people and all  of that. Yet the average loan in the most recent round of PPP funding  is about $80,000 on a payroll of about $28,000. Businesses can use that  principally for payroll. Seventy-five percent has to be used to be able  to keep their employees employed, to keep their workers employed, to  keep those jobs there, while 25 percent has to be used for some fixed  cost, which might be utilities, which might be rent, which might be  debt service, those types of things. The whole purpose of the program  is to keep workers employed. It is a pro-worker program, and it has  been from the very beginning.   Then also, for those who through no fault of their own have lost jobs  and have been laid off, there has been a significant plus-up in the  unemployment insurance accounts--to the tune of $600 per person per  week for individuals in this country--on top of what their States might  already pay. There is a significant number of dollars being put out  there for people who have lost jobs through no fault of their own.   These are pro-worker pieces of legislation, pro-unemployed people  legislation. These are pro-small business--keeping those small  businesses working out there. Obviously, they are very much pro-health  emergency--trying to drive dollars toward the solutions, the cures, the  vaccines, the anti-viral therapeutics, and the testing that are  necessary to help us get through this. That is what Republicans here in  the Senate have been focused on for the past several months and will  continue to be focused on in the future.   As the leader pointed out, the House Democrats, who are not here but  who, remarkably, from afar have evidently put together this fantasy  wish list of things they would like to see accomplished--if you can  imagine an 1,815-page bill, they mention ``cannabis'' way more times  than they mention ``jobs.'' The amazing thing about this--and they will  come here and argue that the Republicans' proposals benefit the  wealthy, benefit the rich. As I just pointed out very clearly, it is  the opposite that is true, for it has been directed directly at  families and workers. Everything we have done has been designed to keep  jobs, to be very pro-worker.   Yet, in part of the 1,815-page proposal that the Democrats have out  there, they have a couple of tax proposals, one of which would deliver  56 percent of that tax cut to the top 1 percent of the wage earners in  the country. This is 56 percent of the benefit of a proposal under the  House Democrats' fantasy wish list that would go to the top 1 percent  of the earners in this country. Now, that doesn't sound to me like  something that is very pro-worker or that is trying to help people who  are in the lower income categories, who are suffering the most  economically as a result of the coronavirus crisis. It seems, to me at  least, like something that is sort of a payoff to some of their big  donors and to the big blue States.   Nonetheless, that is a feature of the 1,815-page bill that the leader  just described and talked about. It is one of many features--part of  the permanent agenda--that has nothing to do with solving the crisis in  front of the American people right now but has entirely to do with an  ideological wish list. They are all of the things that have been on  their agenda for a really long time, none of which should ever be  considered seriously in terms of dealing with the crisis that is in  front of us right now.   As I said, responding to this coronavirus crisis has been and will  continue to be at the top of our agenda for the foreseeable future.                                  H.R. 6172    Madam President, in addition to our pandemic response, the Senate is  also focused on the other priorities on which the American people are  relying on us to take care of--from funding the government to  protecting our Nation.   This week, the Senate is taking up legislation to reauthorize three  expired provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,  including the provision that allows the FBI to wiretap lone wolf  terrorists--terrorists not affiliated with a specific terrorist  organization--and the roving wiretap provision that prevents the FBI  from having to seek a new wiretap warrant each time a terrorist suspect  changes his phone number.   These provisions lapsed in March, after the House blocked a temporary  extension that was passed unanimously in the Senate, leaving law  enforcement and intelligence officials without key tools in their anti- terrorism fight. I expect the Senate will pass this bill today, and I  hope the House will move quickly to send it to the President's desk.   Every day, our law enforcement and intelligence personnel are engaged  in the difficult and, at times, dangerous work of tracking terrorist  threats. We need to make sure they have the tools they need to do their  jobs and to keep Americans safe. The bill before us combines extensions  of these key anti-terrorism tools with new accountability measures that  will ensure that law enforcement is held to the highest standards when  pursuing surveillance of suspected terrorists and foreign agents.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation when we vote on it  later today.                            Remembering Tom Coburn    Madam President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to my  friend and a former Member of this body, Senator Tom Coburn, who died  in March.   Tom and I first met in the House of Representatives, where we both  served, and then came to the Senate at the same time as part of the  class of 2005.   I have been privileged to meet many principled men and women in my  time in public service, but Tom, literally, was one in a million. He  was fiercely principled and uncompromising, often to the chagrin of  fellow Senators. He didn't care if he were 1 against 99 if he believed  he was in the right. He stuck to his guns come hell or high water. He  voted against politically popular legislation and bills that no other  Senator would oppose. Yet he held the enduring respect of his  constituents and, indeed, of his colleagues, proving that sometimes  principle can win you more lasting friendship than compromise. He was  here for a purpose--in particular, to protect our children and  grandchildren from the burden of an ever-increasing national debt by  exposing government waste and Washington's spending habits.    He got into fierce fights on the floor in service to that mission,  but he knew how to keep fights to the office. Prickly on the floor,  outside of it, he was warm and personable, and he didn't let politics  get in the way of friendships. As he once said himself, he disagreed  with President Obama on 95 percent of the issues, but that didn't stop  him from developing a lasting friendship with the President or from  working with him on legislation when he was in the Senate.   No discussion of Tom would be complete without mentioning his deep  faith. He was an outspoken witness for Christ. If you were his friend,  as I was privileged to be, he was interested not just in your present  good but in your eternal good as well.   As I said earlier, Tom Coburn was one in a million, and it will be a  long time before we see his like again. That is a particularly great  loss because the Senate should always have a Tom Coburn--a man or woman  of uncompromising principle, of fierce dedication to the national good,  someone willing to stand alone in defense of the right, who provides a  constant reminder that principle is more important than politics  [[Page S2434]]  and that what is important is not winning elections but doing the right  thing.   My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Carolyn, and his  daughters, Callie, Katie, and Sarah, and his nine grandchildren.   Your husband, your father, and your grandfather is sorely missed.   I yield the floor.
