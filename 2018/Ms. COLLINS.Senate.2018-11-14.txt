 Mr. President, for Americans struggling with high health  care expenses, the tax deduction for certain medical expenses continues  to be of significant assistance for many taxpayers. But unless it is  extended, the income threshold for this vital deduction will increase  at the end of this year.   That is why I rise to introduce with my colleague, Senator Cantwell,  a bill that would provide for a permanent extension of the medical  expense deduction for unreimbursed health care costs that exceed 7.5  percent of a taxpayer's income.   For those who suffer from pre-existing medical conditions, have  chronic medical conditions, experience unexpected illnesses or  injuries, or find that long-term care services are a necessity but are  not covered by insurance, health care expenses can quickly become an  unbearable burden. Too many Americans are forced to choose between  purchasing medical services and making other equally necessary  expenditures.   The Affordable Care Act (ACA) increased the income threshold for  taxpayers to deduct their medical expenses from 7.5 percent to 10  percent. For individuals under 65, the increase went into effect in  2013. Those over 65 would have been exposed to this higher threshold  for the first time in 2017.   When the ACA increase was phased in, individuals under 65 struggling  with serious health conditions saw their financial health worsen. For  example, a 2016 study estimates that parents, including many with  limited means, already provide nearly $36 billion annually in  uncompensated medical care at home to children who have special health  care needs, such as muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis. A 2016  survey of cancer survivors showed that one-third go into debt and of  those more than half incurred more than $10,000 in expenses.   Medical debt is a serious challenge facing millions of families in  our country, and as we endeavor to moderate rising health costs, we  should also make every effort to ensure that we lower their tax burden  as well.   Some erroneously believe that this deduction only benefits the  wealthy, when in fact, lower and middle-income Americans felt the  impact of the increase. According to AARP, nearly 70 percent of  taxpayers taking the deduction in 2014 reported income of $75,000 or  less, and nearly half reported incomes of $50,000 or less. In my home  state of Maine, according to AARP, 35,764 Maine residents claimed this  deduction in 2014, while 18,788 of these individuals reported an income  of $50,000 or less.   This is why during tax reform last year, I introduced an amendment  that rolled back the income threshold to 7.5 percent for all taxpayers  to deduct their medical expenses for 2017 and 2018. My amendment  expanded upon the efforts of Senators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown,  who had worked to prevent this increase from going into effect for  individuals over 65.   The AARP and 44 other consumer groups strongly endorsed the effort,  stating: ``. . . it provides important tax relief which helps offset  the costs of acute and chronic medical conditions for older Americans,  children, pregnant women, disabled individuals, and other adults as  well as the costs associated with long term care and assisted living.''   While I am proud my amendment was included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act, it is set to expire at the end of the calendar year. I urge my  colleagues to join Senator Cantwell and me in supporting this  legislation as we take one more step toward addressing the impact of  health care costs.   Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for Americans struggling with high health  care expenses, the tax deduction for certain medical expenses continues  to be of significant assistance for many taxpayers.
