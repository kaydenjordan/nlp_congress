 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this fiscal year 2018 DOD  Appropriations bill. Although I am proud to support this critical  legislation, I will say that I am disappointed to be here, yet again,  speaking in support of the DOD Appropriations bill as we, again, seek  its passage in the House.   Despite Chairman Frelinghuysen's Herculean efforts to complete all 12  bills on time and passing several packages that included the Defense  bill, the Senate refuses to act. We recently saw the effects of this  when the government shutdown put great stress on the backs of our  servicemembers and their families.   Mr. Speaker, it is time that we push aside partisanship and do what  is right for the country and for our national security by passing this  bill. While it certainly represents the outcome of many hard choices,  it prioritizes funding where our troops need it most. It wisely invests  in readiness, training, maintenance, and procurement of new equipment  and technology to ensure that our troops are prepared for the tasks  before them.   I am pleased that this bill takes care of our troops and their  families at home by granting them a long-awaited 2.4 percent pay raise.  Our Nation has been at war for nearly two decades, and our  servicemembers have put their lives on the line to ensure that we can  live our way of life. This raise represents just one small way for us  to honor their service.   Mr. Speaker, they say that the third time is the charm, and I hope  this holds true here. After the House passes the bill, I urge the  Senate to do so as well so that the President can sign this bill into  law. According to the Constitution, it is the Congress' responsibility  to provide for our common defense. This bill does just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
