 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, first, let me commend Chairman Ryan for his  cooperation on this bill. He has worked in good faith with me and my  staff to include requests in this bill every step of the way, and I  really appreciate it. I think it is a good model for the rest of how  Congress should work, and I would work with him anytime. I want to say  thank you to his staff and to the staff under Chairwoman DeLauro, Steve  Marchese. I want to thank my staff, Michelle Reinshuttle for getting us  to this point, although, I don't believe we are quite there yet. I am  going to explain why.   Madam Speaker, I have to rise in opposition to H.R. 4346, the fiscal  year 2022 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act. This bill does include  some provisions that I support, including critically needed funding to  address the requirements of the Capitol complex.   It provides funding that allows Members and our staff to better serve  our constituents by providing better software to improve the  accessibility of casework forms that our offices use to help  constituents resolve problems and issues with Federal agencies. It  implements measures to increase staff retention, and it allows offices  to acquire new technologies to strengthen the protection and  productivity of our IT infrastructure.   This bill also supports the critical mission of the Capitol Police by  providing funding for additional personnel to replenish their really  depleted ranks, new leadership training initiatives, and additional  resources so they can continue to protect Members, staff, and visitors  who come and occupy the Halls of Congress on a daily basis.   In the aftermath of an incredibly difficult and challenging year for  the men and women of the Capitol Police, these measures are really an  important step toward improving the police force.   However, Madam Speaker, while there are many parts of this bill that  I do support, this bill, like the others that the majority has put  forward, is based on what I believe is a flawed fiscal foundation. The  majority is forging ahead with massive increases to nondefense  spending. The bill we are considering today includes a nearly 13  percent increase over current levels. I am going to explain why that in  context creates some problems. At a time of record high deficits and  debt, we need, I believe, a more measured fiscal response.   In addition, the majority has also included controversial policy  riders that our side of the aisle opposes. With the approach that the  majority is taking with this bill--and really all of them in the  appropriations packages we are considering here today--we are on the  path to yet another continuing resolution. If we are to break this  cycle, our majority counterparts need to be more willing to work with  the minority on all the bills to create a more bipartisan support that  garners more of a bipartisan thumbs up.   Furthermore, the majority has not put forward any of the Capitol  Police reforms to the board that governs the Capitol Police or its  leadership structure, and that is a real sticking point, Madam Speaker.  Including funding to hire more officers and to get more equipment is a  necessary step. I would go to bat for that any day of the week. We will  never see lasting improvement to the operation of the force or officer  morale without these necessary reforms. We are going to continue to see  the erosion of the force until those changes are made.   As we grapple with the trillions in new spending that the majority  has passed and is proposing already 6  [[Page H4160]]  months into this year, I want to emphasize this point, we must course  correct now rather than wait until our Nation has passed the point of  no return. The Democrat majority got out of the gates by pushing  through a $1.9 trillion package that includes bailouts for States like  California that were already raking in billions more in State revenue  than was previously forecast.   My colleagues across the aisle and this administration are insisting  on using reconciliation to force through $4 trillion more on a gigantic  wish list.   For perspective, the spending I outlined is above and beyond the  normal congressional appropriations. Specifically, it is nearly four  times what the Democrats are proposing to spend on this and these  appropriations bills that we are considering.   Last year when the entire Nation was grappling with COVID-related  shutdowns, when hospitals were down to their last box of surgical  gloves, and Congress had to step in to make sure that our health system  and our communities didn't collapse, those were needed dollars. But we  should not make the mistake that national emergencies like the COVID  pandemic should green-light and invite further spending that is going  to usher in record inflation, trillions more in debt, and, honestly, a  reckless increase in spending.   I fear that some here are simply not aware of how spiking the prices  are of food, of gas, and of other everyday items impacting families.  Unbridled spending brings on the kind of inflation that increases  prices exponentially. When we talk about saddling the next generation  with crushing debt, we are talking about your kids, Madam Speaker, my  kids, and their grandkids, and they are going to have to pay for these  decisions.   I believe that we can do better. The funding increases in this bill I  think are going to fuel that fire. I think we need to recalibrate.   Madam Speaker, for all these reasons I urge my colleagues to join me  in opposing this bill at this time, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), who is the distinguished ranking  member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Womack).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I wanted to speak on the motion to recommit that the  gentleman from Arkansas offered. I know it sounds like, with the  majority, we are just going to have to agree to disagree on this.   I think that there are a lot of good things in this bill that I  support. But the biggest challenge for me, having spent this year, like  the rest of us, trying to help our families, our constituents move on  through COVID, help our small businesses survive, and then starting off  this year in the manner that we did and recognizing the impact on not  just the Capitol campus, but the men and women who protect us, the  Capitol Police, I really feel like in this bill, the Legislative Branch  appropriations, there needed to be some significant reforms to some of  the failures in response that we experienced.   Now, I know that there are other efforts, not related to this bill,  that are looking at other actors, other players. I am setting all of  that aside because I don't have control over that. But I do have a say  here, with my voting card, on the Legislative Branch appropriations  bill.   What is frustrating to me--and I heard, you know, my good friend from  [[Page H4163]]  Ohio and the Speaker mention: Well, we did this supplemental and put  all of this other stuff in here for the Capitol Police. Well, there are  things that were left out of that supplemental that are so crucially  significant to reforms that will help prevent another January 6, and  they are in the motion to recommit.   Let me explain a couple of those. One of those that we have in the  Republican motion to recommit is a reform to the Capitol Police Board.  We know that there was a major failure and breakdown in communication  on the Capitol Police Board, which inhibited the response, the  coordinated, collective response of the law enforcement here.   Talk to any police officer who bravely defended us, and they will  tell you that they weren't getting clear directives in their  headpieces. They will tell you that the coordination effort from the  leadership broke down, and they were doing everything they could on the  front lines themselves. So a rational response to that would be: Why  did that break down and what can we do to fix it?   One of those things is to provide oversight, congressional oversight,  over that Capitol Police Board by requiring that board, who made those  decisions, who left a lot of our police officers on their own, to meet  together in front of congressional committees, the committees of  oversight.    As it stands now, we can't get the entire police board together in  one room for a hearing. The gentleman and I--on Legislative Branch  appropriations--we got to meet with different members of the police  board in different hearings at different times. It was helpful. But to  really correct the problem--and when you ask each of them: Where was  your failing on January 6? They all do this--or they did this. There  are now new actors in there.   But I look at the function of that board, and I think, okay, common  sense would be to put the Architect of the Capitol, the two Sergeants  at Arms, and the Capitol Police chief all on a witness panel in front  of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee or the House  Administration Committee or the Senate Rules Committee.   That wasn't in your supplemental, that is not in this Legislative  Branch appropriations bill, or in any of President Biden's rescue  plans. We do throw a lot of money at it, but we are not fixing a  structural, fundamental problem that helped complicate our response.   Our motion to recommit fixes that. It simply changes the language,  and it requires them to come before the committees of jurisdiction  together and answer questions of oversight capacity from Members of  Congress. That is a simple fix. It shouldn't be partisan. It is not in  the underlying bill, and it should be. Our motion to recommit does  that.   Another thing that we do in our motion to recommit to improve the  underlying bill is, we require an improved and streamlined response,  and we give that authority to the Capitol Police chief to call in the  National Guard on a quick, developing emergency.   One of the things that we heard in the aftermath of January 6 was he  said, she said. I called them in, they said they couldn't come. This  person said they couldn't come. I mean, we just got very convoluted  responses into why the National Guard wasn't here quickly.   Again, I recognize there are other efforts looking into other actors  on that front. I am not getting into that. What I am talking about is  what we have control over right here.   The underlying Legislative Branch bill does not improve that  streamline process. In fact, it leaves in place the process whereby the  chief of police has to go through this bureaucratic, arcane process to  get permission from every member of that board before they can respond  to an immediate emergency and request the National Guard. Well, that  was part of the problem on January 6.   Our motion to recommit fixes that. It says that the Capitol Police  chief, in an emergency, a quick, developing emergency, can call in the  National Guard and have the authority to request them to come. It also  has a failsafe in there that says, if the Capitol Police Board gets  their act together and meets quickly and sees the issue differently,  they can rescind that authority. But what it does, it is an opt-in.  Automatically, the police chief has authority to call in the reserves  when there is an emergency.   Just like you see where a chief in a major metropolitan area has the  authority to call in things, and then they are accountable to the mayor  or to the city council, but they have that authority. Right now the  Capitol Police chief doesn't have that authority, that was a problem on  January 6. Unfortunately, if this bill passes as it is, it will still  be a problem today, 7 months later.   Again, there are things in the underlying bill that I like and  support, but it is like having the salt for your steak, but you don't  actually have the beef. You have got to have that sizzling steak and  you add the salt to it and it is a wonderful meal. That is how I look  at this.   We do want to put the money forward to make sure that we are adding  to the force and we are putting in training programs and that is in  this underlying bill. Those are good things. But we have to change the  fundamental flaws with how the Capitol Police Board operates.   This is the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. This is the  appropriate place. I would have yielded if the House Administration  Committee wanted to do that. Had they done it, you wouldn't hear me  piping up about it, but they haven't. It needs to be done so that we  are taking responsibility for failures here on our campus that we can  correct. So I urge adoption of the motion to recommit.   One more thing that I think is really significant, and this is where  I differ from the gentleman from Maryland, who I also have great  respect for, is the underlying bill talks about pay and making sure  that we are adding more police officers to the force. I am there every  day of the week and twice on Sunday. The problem is, they are going to  hit a cap.    So when a police officer, which we saw in January, February, March,  they would work their regular hours, and then because they were short- staffed and there weren't enough officers on the force, they would be  called to work overtime. They are accruing that overtime, and at some  point, they will have earned too much money to get paid all of it  because there is a cap in law that says they can only make so much.   The underlying bill does not fix that cap. However, our motion to  recommit does. Our motion to recommit removes that cap so that those  officers who are owed that overtime, because they worked their tails  off weeks on end, will be able to get that pay and not risk being  furloughed as we get to the end of the year.   Again, there are good things in the underlying bill, but it is not  quite good enough. We can make it better. We can make it better by  adopting the motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Again, I just want to say it has been a privilege to be in this  process.   You know, it is ironic to me, because the Legislative Branch  appropriations bill is generally one that significantly only impacts  the Capitol community. I serve an amazing district in southwest  Washington, 2,500-plus miles away from this campus. Generally, the  Legislative Branch appropriations bill isn't high on their radar, until  this year, until we saw that there are events and there are actors who  we are going to have to protect against.   We are going to have to protect the guests and the visitors. This is  the people's House, and I want the people from my district to have the  right and the trust to come here and feel safe, to be able to have  their voices heard. That is why this bill went from kind of being one  that most people didn't pay attention to, to a lot more attention, a  lot more front and center.                                time  1630    It is such an honor and privilege to get to work on this because I  believe, in a very strong spirit of bipartisanship, we can make sure  that we are lifting up and girding up the Capitol Police force, making  sure that the Sergeant at Arms is working together  [[Page H4164]]  with the Architect of the Capitol to ensure the safety and continuity  of the work of the people's House.   This is the Constitution in action. It is a privilege to get to work  on this. I think that we can improve this underlying bill. I think that  we need to adopt the motion to recommit. I think we need to introduce  some of these ideas so that we can stave off a continuing resolution in  the eleventh hour.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the motion to recommit, and in its  absence, I do believe we need to send this bill back in order to get it  completely right. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McCarthy), the minority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise to speak to the  amendments.   Madam Speaker, I specifically call out the gentleman from Rhode  Island's amendment. It increases funding by $3.5 million for the  Capitol Grounds account, and it is offset within the bill. The intent  of these funds is to be used to prioritize the removal of accessibility  barriers on the Capitol complex.   I am thrilled about this amendment. Parts of this building and the  surrounding complex were built over 100 years ago, so, obviously, there  are accessibility issues that today we are saying we are going to  remove those barriers.   I commend both of the bipartisan amendments in the amendments en  bloc. I urge Members to please support it. I think this does good work.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
