 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a superb Air Force  defense fellow for her tireless commitment to the U.S. Air Force,  Congress, and to the constituents of Nevada's Fourth District.   Wendy Lewis' relentless commitment to the Air Force proved invaluable  in providing support to the House of Representatives and our  constituents. This Nation is grateful for her commitment and the  personal sacrifices that she has made during her time in the Defense  Fellowship program and the United States Air Force.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives and the  United States of America, I commend Wendy and her family for their  dedicated support to our Air Force and to this Nation.   Nevada's official State motto is ``all for our country,''  representing the patriotic spirit of the people of Nevada.   Wendy, who has served at Creech and Nellis Air Force Bases in Nevada,  embodies this motto and is dedicated to public service. She has proven  this through her service as an officer and now as a public servant.   Wendy is the personification of giving back and has given her all to  honor my State's motto. She is an example of the true spirit of Nevada,  and her commitment to service inspires others.   I congratulate her on an extremely successful career, her dedication  to service, and wish her the best in her future endeavors.   May God bless her, our troops, and may God bless the United States of  America.                            ____________________
