 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the  150th anniversary of Hickory, North Carolina.   In 1870, Adolphus Shuford founded Hickory Tavern, which would later  become the city of Hickory. Originally, it  [[Page H642]]  featured seven businesses, seven manufacturing plants, and had a  population of 330 people.   In the 1800s, Hickory was a primary trading center along the Western  North Carolina Railroad, and it grew into one of the largest hubs for  business manufacturing and textiles in the Southeast United States.   Today, Hickory is home to more than 40,000 people. It holds data  centers operated by the world's largest technology companies, and over  40 percent of the world's fiber optic cable is manufactured there.   Hickory's history goes even beyond its industrial roots. Some other  noteworthy features are: the Hickory Motor Speedway, one of the most  legendary short tracks in the history of American stock car racing; the  local community college, Catawba Valley Community College, which is  providing some of the most excellent education offered anywhere in the  country to the citizens of the area; Lenoir-Rhyne University, one of  North Carolina's premier schools, which was founded in 1891; a  wonderful art center; and a Minor League Baseball team, the Hickory  Crawdads, which was founded 25 years ago.   While the city continues to grow, its historical landmarks still  stand as a testament to its rich history. From the Propst House to  Maple Grove, Union Square to the Henry River Mill Village, Hickory's  legacy as a leader in textiles manufacturing and trading is ever- present.   Hickory has played a pivotal role in North Carolina's history, and it  continues to make a sizeable impact on North Carolina's economy.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent Hickory, North Carolina, and I  am certain it will continue to prosper and celebrate many more  significant milestones in the future.                            ____________________
