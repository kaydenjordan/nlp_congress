 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for  his leadership on bringing this important legislation to the floor.   Let's say what this bill really does. It provides Americans who work  hard access to retirement with dignity and respect. It allows workers  who don't have  [[Page H4144]]  access to retirement accounts--including home healthcare workers, part- time workers, as well as multiple employers--to have access to  retirement accounts.   The SECURE Act fixes this. This is an important step forward in  providing much-needed retirement security for so many Americans. It  encourages small employers to develop 401(k) plans. It helps build our  workforce by allowing apprentices access to college savings accounts to  cover the cost of purchasing equipment necessary for their training for  their chosen trade. This is a big step forward for those workers.   Finally, Madam Speaker, I appreciate the fact that this bill also  addresses some of the many oversights of the 2017 Republican tax bill,  including addressing how children are taxed, especially Tribal  children.   This is a good bill, and I support it.
