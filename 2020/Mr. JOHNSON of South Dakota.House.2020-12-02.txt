 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Conaway. The gentleman has been a champion. I thank Chairman Peterson.  The gentleman has been a champion.   We are here on the floor this afternoon debating the United States  Grain Standards Reauthorization Act, and I rise in support of that act.   Agriculture is a business where almost nothing is certain. From poor  weather to trade disruptions to transport delays, these all create an  incredible environment of unpredictability. In that environment of  unpredictability, producers should not have to face unpredictability in  agricultural policy. That means that when Congress can come together in  a bipartisan way and offer a bit of certainty, we absolutely should do  so.   That brings us to the Grain Standards Reauthorization Act. I am glad  that we are passing a 5-year reauthorization so that the user-funded  USGSA will allow buyers and sellers to quickly and effectively  determine those quality specs that are outlined in contracts.   In this world of uncertainty, Mr. Speaker, I am glad and I am proud  that we are going to send this to the President's desk, and, of course,  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.
