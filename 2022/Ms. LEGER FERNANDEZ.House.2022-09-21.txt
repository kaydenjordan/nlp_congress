 Madam Speaker, I thank Chair Lofgren for the  hard work that she and her cosponsor, Representative Cheney, have done  on this bill.   I rise today to safeguard a simple yet sacred pillar of our  democracy: The candidate who wins the election takes office. Only the  voters' votes count. It will not be overturned by our Vice President or  any State officer or any threats of political violence, threats,  intimidation, and lies. We cannot let violence undermine over 200 years  of a peaceful transfer of power in this country.   I rise today to safeguard the rights of every American to have their  will reflected in those public servants lucky enough to serve them.   We must not forget January 6. Our Republican colleagues fighting this  bill seem to forget that January 6 was a violent day of action. We must  pass this bill so that we do not have a repetition of that.   Today, I will vote for the Presidential Election Reform Act to  fulfill a hopeful future for our country. American democracy is the  best answer to fulfilling our Constitution's promise of inclusion for  everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, creed, or economic  circumstance.   A truly inclusive democracy that helps everyone thrive is a  constitutional promise we can and must make a reality.
