 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my  amendment to H.R. 7666 which would add the text of the Military Suicide  Prevention in the 21st Century Act to the underlying bill.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        June 22, 2022, on page H5788, in the first column, the following  appeared:  Madam Speaker, I rise today  in support of my    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The men and the women of America's Armed Forces dedicate their lives  in service to this Nation. Unfortunately, countless servicemembers are  left with scars that linger long after they return home.   Rates of serious mental illness experienced by those in the Armed  Forces are on the rise, and tragically, so too is the number of  soldiers who ultimately take their lives.   According to DOD's most recent report, suicide in the military  community is at its highest rate since 1938. An estimated 7,000  servicemembers have died in combat or training exercises since 9/11.   During that same time, over 30,000 Active-Duty personnel and veterans  who recently served died by suicide. Those numbers should bring pause  to every Member in this Chamber. More importantly, they should spur us  into action.   That is why I introduced the Military Suicide Prevention in the 21st  Century Act. This commonsense bill would direct the DOD to utilize  modern technology to prevent suicides in our military community.    In addition to requiring the National Suicide Hotline and the  Veterans Crisis Hotline to be preprogrammed into government-issued  smart devices such as phones, tablets, and laptops, the bill would  require the DOD to proactively download the Virtual Hope Box app onto  these devices.   This app can be set up with the photos of friends and family, sound  bites of loved ones, videos of special moments, music, relaxation  exercises, games, and reminders of reasons for living.   Nothing we do here in Washington will ever truly repay the sacrifices  made by our Nation's servicemembers, but by passing this legislation,  we can help make a meaningful difference in the lives of countless  American heroes and their families.   We owe an incredible debt to the men and women of our Armed Forces  who risk their lives fighting for our freedoms and our security. It is  past time Congress do more to fight for them here at home.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment so we can make real  progress toward providing improved support for America's servicemembers  struggling with their mental health.
