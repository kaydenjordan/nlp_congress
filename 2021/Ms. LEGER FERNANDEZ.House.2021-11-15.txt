 Madam Speaker, today we join with President  Biden, Vice President Harris, Senators, Congressmen, mayors, and  Governors to witness the signing of the Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act.   And do you know what? It was summed up as a BFD today, and indeed, it  was. And it was summed up in a four-letter word, which is J-O-B-S,  jobs. It will create so many jobs in our communities.   And once we finish with this bill, we are going to move on to do the  Build Back Better bill because that is the bill for the people, para la  gente.   I can't wait, Madam Speaker.                            ____________________
