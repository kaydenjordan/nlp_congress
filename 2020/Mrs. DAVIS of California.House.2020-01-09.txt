 Mr. Speaker, I voted against the 2002 AUMF.  In coming to that very difficult decision, I learned an important  lesson: that we must ask every administration that seeks to use  military force how it will manage the consequences of its actions, even  if those actions can be justified.   Has this administration done that? Unfortunately, I think the answer  is no.   I will vote for this resolution today for the same reasons I had  then: no overall strategy, no justification, and nobody in this  administration can answer how it will respond to the aftermath.   By virtue of the power and the responsibility granted to us by the  Constitution, we must ask those questions.   Let's take this opportunity to make diplomacy work. Let's stand  together as a Congress to establish our authority. Let's stand together  and vote against a new war without an end game.
