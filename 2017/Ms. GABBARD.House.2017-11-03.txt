 Madam Speaker, this year marks the 75th anniversary of  Executive Order 9066, which authorized the internment of over 110,000  Japanese Americans on U.S. soil during World War II.   Our country will never be able to undo this grave miscarriage of  justice or relieve the pain and suffering that was inflicted upon our  fellow Americans. So we must remember this dark period in our Nation's  history and ensure that this dark shadow of prejudice, bigotry, and  hate never occurs again.   However, sadly, as we look around us, today we see that this  divisiveness and bigotry persists far too much. We cannot give into  hate and intolerance. We must confront it and defeat it with the light  and love of the Aloha Spirit.   We must learn from this dark stain on our past and vow to never  repeat it again.                            ____________________
