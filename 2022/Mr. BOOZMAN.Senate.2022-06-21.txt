 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Etana  Morse from West Fork, AR, for earning the Congressional Award Gold  Medal.   Created by Congress in 1979, the Congressional Award recognizes  initiative, service, and achievement in young people. Participants earn  bronze, silver, and gold certificates and medals by setting specific  goals in different program areas. Gold medal awardees must complete at  least 400 hours of voluntary public service, 200 hours of personal  development activities, 200 hours of physical fitness activities, and  one 5-day/4-night expedition to a destination to experience a new  environment or culture.   This program brings together some of our Nation's most dedicated and  ambitious youth leaders, like Etana, who show a commitment to public  service. An outstanding student at Haas Hall Academy, Etana excels both  in and out of the classroom.   She serves as member of the Washington County 4-H Youth Development  Club and vice president of the teen advisory board. Etana is also the  founder of the Washington County Youth Advocates for a Drug-Free  Tomorrow Club. She volunteers in her community with multiple  organizations including the M&N Augustine Foundation, NWA Food Bank,  and the Salvation Army. Along with her sister, she launched the ``Taste  to Serve'' fundraiser campaign to raise money for a nonprofit  organization for human development and is eager to continue her  academic pursuits by studying statistics and data science when she  starts college.   Etana has accomplished a lot to earn this award. I congratulate her  for her determination, dedication, and service and applaud her growth  as a leader. I am confident her exemplary work ethic and desire to make  her community a better place will serve her well in her future  endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Pulp  and Paperworkers' Resource Council--PPRC--for more than three decades  of advocacy for forest products.   The PPRC is a grassroots organization made up of hourly employees of  the U.S. forest products industry. PPRC members work in mills and  converting plants where they manufacture sustainable paper and wood  products that are among the most used, necessary and recycled items  Americans rely on every day.   The U.S. forest products industry is vitally important to our  Nation's economy, employing approximately 950,000 people. The industry  is among the top 10 manufacturing sector employers in 45 States,  supporting family-wage jobs and manufacturing nearly $300 billion in  products annually. In my home State of Arkansas, we have more than  24,000 people directly employed in the industry.   Founded in 1991, the PPRC works to ensure that real-world  perspectives are considered in all policy and regulatory decisions that  impact their jobs and communities. As cochair of the Senate Paper and  Packaging Caucus, I work to inform members of Congress about the value  of the paper and packaging industry in their States and districts. This  bipartisan, bicameral caucus highlights the importance and economic  significance of the paper and packaging industry and focuses on the  policy solutions needed to sustain and promote this important sector. I  am honored to meet with PPRC representatives every year when they come  to Washington to advocate for their priorities.   I am pleased to congratulate the PPRC today for more than 30 years of  hard work on behalf of such an essential U.S. industry.                            ____________________
