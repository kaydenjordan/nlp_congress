 Mr. President, I think all of us here watching Senator  Heitkamp today give her farewell address were tremendously moved. I  come away, first of all, with, this is a person of character, a person  we have served with who cares about doing the right thing, a person who  cares deeply about the issues that are before this august body and  someone we will miss very much.   By the evidence of the Republicans who turned out to listen here on  the floor--and I am sure many others were listening in their offices--I  think they may miss her more than Democrats because she worked with  them so much. She cared about reaching across the aisle. She wasn't  worried that it was going to hurt her back home because she was going  to be solving problems.   One of the things I think of when I think of Heidi Heitkamp is that I  have known Heidi--she is my friend. She reminds me: Don't call me your  oldest friend in the Senate. But she is my longest standing friend. I  go back to the early 1990s with Heidi, when we were attorneys general  together from two small States--New Mexico and North Dakota--and we  have been very, very good friends since then.   Heidi is a leader of principle. She wants to do the right thing, no  matter what. That is pretty special in this institution we are in. She  wants to do what is right by North Dakota and do what is right by our  country. She always follows her conscience, and she gives the citizens  of her State and this great country her very best judgment. That is  really the spirit of a true public servant--to do what is right and let  the chips fall where they may. A couple issues we have had recently are  good examples, and I will talk about one back when we were attorneys  general together.   The Kavanaugh vote was a big vote for the Senate. I think it was  probably a tough vote for Heidi, but I think she came to it with the  idea that she was going to do the right thing. She had the courage to  stand up for victims--victims of sexual assault, victims of sexual  harassment, all of the permutations of that. I know that for the better  part of her career--whether she was an attorney general, whether she  was a U.S. Senator, or whether she was working in other capacities both  in and out of government--she was always working for victims. I think  one of the things that helped Heidi understand that so well was that  her mother was sexually assaulted as a teenager. Knowing that--Heidi  learned from that. She learned about the prevalence of it, that it was  out there and it was deep and it was hidden in a lot of ways. So I saw  early on, as a State attorney general, that she was a champion--a real  champion--for victims.   Shifting from the example I just gave with the vote on the Supreme  Court, another example of her persistence to do what is right--nobody  had ever taken on the tobacco industry, this huge industry. People  talked a little bit and would say: It is so bad that people are  addicted to smoking. But the attorneys general of our country in the  1990s filed a lawsuit against the tobacco companies because they were  targeting our children. We found research that showed tobacco companies  knew that if you get young people addicted at a very young age, they  are going to smoke for life. For them, it was all a profit motive. If  you get a young person addicted, you know you are going to have a  smoker for life; you know you will have somebody who is going to buy  cigarettes for life. We knew that.   She was one of the leaders in the attorneys general's effort to bring  this horrible, horrible scourge under control. We filed our lawsuit.  The tobacco companies saw what was coming. We did our discovery. They  didn't want this case in court--there was no way. They were going to  lose big. So we had what was the biggest civil settlement in the  history of the country. After we knew we were going to have a  settlement, the smaller States knew we had to have a tough negotiator  to represent us because we were afraid that larger States--California,  New York, and others--would get more of the money than we would. We all  felt we had participated equally. So whom did we select? We selected  Heidi Heitkamp to be our negotiator, and, boy, did she do a good job  for the smaller States.   Just to remind everybody, this year, $34 million from that settlement  flows to the State of North Dakota. It was settled several decades ago,  but the money is still coming in to do prevention, to help out with  tobacco addiction, and to do what is really important there.   The other quality I want to mention--and I know we are going over in  terms of where we are supposed to be in our caucuses--there is a  remarkable trait--and we saw this today, with everyone who turned out,  and our staff knows this--Heidi Heitkamp is one of the most well-liked  U.S. Senators by both sides of the aisle. She was so well-liked that  President Trump--convinced he needed somebody in his Cabinet who was  well-liked and respected--recruited Heidi Heitkamp to be his Secretary  of Agriculture. I really think what the President was doing cozying up  to her was trying to make friends in the Senate. He figured that if he  got her, she was going to make a real difference, and he was hoping  that her popularity would rub off on him.   I will never forget when President Trump invited her up on the stage  at one of his political rallies in September of 2017. He invited her up  to the stage and said:         Everybody's saying, ``What's she doing up here?'' But I'll       tell you what: Good woman.    ``Good woman.'' Do you know what I say? No, Mr. President. She is a  great woman. She is a great woman.   I could go on forever, but I just want to comment--and Heidi  commented about her commitment to Native communities, to Native women  and to Native children. She worked as a State attorney general, she  worked in the Senate, and she worked in other elected offices on this.  She didn't give up. She is working in the Senate until the very end to  make sure we get Savanna's Act passed, which is going to protect  missing and indigenous women.   We have already passed it through the Senate Indian Affairs  Committee,  [[Page S7404]]  and she is intent on making sure it gets passed this session, and I am  going to work with her on that. She has worked on VAWA reauthorization.  Heidi has always broadcast the core principles in our relations with  Native communities--Tribal sovereignty, Tribal consultation, strong  government-to-government relations--and she has always tried to make  sure Senators who don't have Native communities understand the  situation we are facing.   My friendship with Heidi has made me a better public servant and a  better person. Before we came here to serve, we had already known each  other for many years--since the 1990's when we both served as State  attorneys general. At that time, there was only a handful of women  serving as their State's attorney general. Heidi herself was a  trailblazer, serving as North Dakota's first female Attorney General.   It was then I saw the first of the innumerable examples of her  commitment to serving the people of North Dakota and the public  interest.   A number of attorneys general, including Heidi and I, initiated  groundbreaking lawsuits against big tobacco. Those lawsuits were met  with skepticism. The disease and terrible health impacts caused by  tobacco products had cost States precious resources. The tobacco  companies were working to lure underage youth to buy their harmful  products through targeted advertising. Like so many other times in her  life, Heidi's work helped us beat some long odds.   Our lawsuits proved highly successful. North Dakota is still reaping  the benefits, having received a $34 million tobacco settlement from  those efforts just this year.   In the years since, I have seen Heidi continue her dedication to  public service and achieve great things, not least of which was 6 years  ago when she became North Dakota's first woman elected to the U.S.  Senate.   Although she has come far from her humble beginnings, she has never  forgotten her roots. She fights for the working people of North Dakota  and across the Nation.   While Heidi is highly accomplished, she remains plain spoken,  straight shooting, and down to earth.   I have been privileged to serve with Heidi on the Senate Committee on  Indian Affairs--a committee she knew from the get-go that she wanted to  be on. She came to Washington ready to fight for Native communities in  North Dakota, to make sure they weren't being left behind.   She is a fierce defender of tribal sovereignty and demands that the  federal government meet its treaty and trust responsibilities and  engage in meaningful consultation with tribes when Federal action  impacts tribal interests.   Heidi has worked tirelessly on behalf of North Dakota's five tribes  and all of Indian country.   Just like when she was attorney general, I have seen her laser- focused on protecting and empowering those most in need of a champion-- like children and domestic violence survivors.   The very first bill Heidi introduced was to tackle the systemic  problems facing Native children by establishing a National Commission.   With more than one in three Native American children living in  poverty, suicide rates 2.5 times higher than the national average, and  one of the lowest high school graduation rates in the country, she knew  we must do more--much more--for our Native youth. It was no surprise to  me that she got that bill passed in short order before the end of her  first Congress.   For decades, Heidi has been on the frontlines of protecting victims  of domestic violence. As attorneys general, we worked to implement the  Violence Against Women Act after it first got passed in 1994.   We continued the fight together here in the Senate. In fact, one of  the first things we worked on was to help pass the 2013 VAWA  reauthorization. That reauthorization was hard fought. We wanted to  protect key provisions that restored tribal jurisdiction to domestic  violence crimes committed by non-Indians on reservations. Those cases  were falling through the cracks.   At the time, opponents claimed that tribes didn't have the resources  or expertise to enforce the Act. Thanks to the tireless work of Heidi  and many of my colleagues on the Indian Affairs Committee, the  provisions remained in the bill, and President Obama signed it into law  in March 2013.   Five years later, we know for a fact that those opponents were wrong.  According to a report this year from the National Congress of American  Indians, since VAWA of 2013 was enacted, 18 tribes have once again  begun exercising jurisdiction over domestic violence crimes. NCAI is  collaborating with 50 other tribes to develop best practices. There  have been 143 arrests of 128 non-Indian abusers, with 74 convictions.   Heidi has always prided herself on working across the aisle to get  things done--whether she is tackling domestic violence or working to  improve public safety.   She partnered with my good friend John McCain to make sure that  Indian Country is part of the AMBER Alert child abduction warning  system. That bill was signed into law last April.   Just last week, the full Senate unanimously passed one of Heidi's  bills--Savanna's Act. Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind--a member of the  Spirit Lake tribe, 22 years old, and 8 months pregnant--was brutally  murdered in Fargo last year. The sad truth is, reportedly more than 80  percent of Native women will experience violence in their lifetime.  Heidi is determined to do something about that.   Her bill would improve law enforcement tracking of and response to  the growing crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women. Heidi has  been an incredible voice combatting this crisis--working to make sure  these women are not invisible. I have been touched by her commitment to  this fight.   I am inspired by Heidi's work for Indian Country and am committed to  carrying on her work so that tribes in North Dakota and across Indian  Country know that. Even if one of their strongest defenders is moving  on to the next chapter, her mission will not be lost.   The list of all Heidi's accomplishments is as long as her heart is  big. She has worked for the people of North Dakota for decades. She has  been an independent voice in the Senate, not tied to party or ideology  but committed to doing what is right for the people of her State. She  will always roll up her sleeves and work with all sides to solve  problems. She will always fight for the little guy.   On a personal note, she is one of the most loyal friends anyone could  ask for.   She never shied away from the hard votes--approaching every single  one with conscience and courage. I admire Heidi for her conviction.   All of us here will miss Heidi tremendously. I know that her work is  not done--not even close. Like so many here, I look forward to her next  challenge and to seeing what more she accomplishes for her State and  the Nation and the countless lives she is sure to touch.   I yield the floor.
