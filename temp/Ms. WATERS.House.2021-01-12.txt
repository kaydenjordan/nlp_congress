 Mr. Speaker, on January 6, 2021, domestic terrorists the  President has empowered for years stormed the Capitol, desecrated the  people's House, and threatened the lives of the Speaker, Vice  President, and countless other Members and staff. None of us will ever  forget that day.   The invasion of the Capitol was not only foreseeable, it was  inevitable because of the many years the President has spent fanning  the flames of hatred and racism in our country.   The facts are clear: The President rallied his supporters at the  White House and then sent them to the Capitol to disrupt our democracy  and overturn an election.   I won't spend another second explaining why Donald Trump should have  long ago been removed from office. Donald Trump showed us who he was  from the very beginning. Too many people turned a blind eye, and, last  Wednesday, our country paid the price.
