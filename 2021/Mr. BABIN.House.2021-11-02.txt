 Madam Speaker, I thank General Bergman for having this  very worthy Special Order tonight on veterans. On the eleventh hour of  the eleventh day of the eleventh month, patriots will come together to  celebrate America's brave protectors, past and present.   As a son of a World War II veteran, a veteran myself, and the father  of a decorated Navy SEAL, it is sometimes very difficult for me to  adequately express the deep-rooted gratitude that I hold for our  military; the same gratitude historically held by a majority of our  great country.   This year, however, something is different. The people of this Nation  still honor our servicemen and -women, but unfortunately, some in the  White House don't seem to do that. This administration would rather  focus on our military being woke rather than being prepared and ready  for a potential war with our enemies.   My heart especially goes out to our veterans of Afghanistan. The  Biden administration and our military leadership failed you and the  Afghan allies that you worked so closely with for decades. To the men  and women of our Armed Forces who sacrificed so much over the last 20  years, I say this: Hold your head up high. Your service protected  countless freedom-loving people and prevented terrorism from thriving  in the United States and in our post-9/11 world.   Ronald Reagan once said: ``Freedom is never more than one generation  away from extinction. We didn't pass it onto our children in the  bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them  to do the same.''   No one understands this truth more than our vets. I promise to  continue using my position in Congress to serve those who have served  us and to all of our current and former soldiers, sailors, airmen,  marines, guardians, and coasties, I gratefully and humbly say thank  you.
