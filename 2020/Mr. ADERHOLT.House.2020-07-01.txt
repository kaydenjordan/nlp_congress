 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to honor and to  recognize Mr. Jack Thompson from Montgomery, Alabama. He passed away on  Sunday, June 21, 2020, after a full life of 88 years.   He was born in Colbert County, which is now the Fourth Congressional  District, in 1932 and remained a resident of the State of Alabama for  his entire life.   After graduating from Colbert County High School, Jack married his  sweetheart, Ruth Hester, at the age of 20, and Jack and Ruth were  married for 67 years and raised four wonderful children.   For 31 years, Jack worked for Auburn University Extension Service.  After retiring, he went on to own a farm in Athens, Alabama, and served  as assistant commissioner of agriculture alongside my father-in-law,  who was commissioner at the time, Albert McDonald, from the State of  Alabama. Then Jack, himself, thereafter was elected commissioner of  agriculture and industries for 4 years for the State of Alabama.   Jack is now survived by his four children, David Thompson, Keith  Thompson, Susan Woodham, and Janice Thompson, and his sister, Ann  Thomas. He has 11 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.   Jack will be greatly missed by all his family and friends and all of  us that knew him. Jack's legacy will live well into the future.                            ____________________
