 Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Mr. John  Oscar ``Johnny'' Jones, who is retiring from U.S. Department of  Agriculture Rural Development after 37 consecutive years of service to  the Nation.   Raised in Coffeeville, MS, Johnny joined USDA in 1980 as a student  trainee in the Coffeeville Farmers Home Administration Office. In  pursuing a career with USDA, Johnny followed in the footsteps of his  father, William Woodrow Jones, and brother, William Woodrow ``Woody''  Jones, Jr., who both made significant contributions to American  agriculture and rural economies throughout Mississippi as lifelong USDA  employees.   Following his graduation from Mississippi State University in 1982,  Johnny was promoted to the position of assistant county supervisor,  ACS, for Webster County in Eupora, MS, with responsibility for Webster  and Choctaw Counties. In 1985, he was promoted to county supervisor for  Attala County. In 1990, Johnny was selected to serve as a rural housing  specialist in the State Farmers Home Administration Office in Jackson.  Seven years later, Johnny became the State program director for Single  Family Housing for Rural Development in Mississippi, a position he has  ably held for 21 years.   Working his way up from the Farmers Home Administration Office in his  hometown to the State office in Jackson, Johnny not only gained  exceptional knowledge and expertise, but he also contributed unique  perspective to his work. Johnny understood the needs  [[Page S7429]]  of rural Americans, as well as the challenges rural communities must  overcome to gain accessibility to the quality of life standards  afforded to urban America. Applying his knowledge, expertise, and  competence, Johnny devoted himself to making a positive difference in  the lives of Mississippians.   Johnny's contributions to the people of Mississippi have been notably  remarkable. Throughout his tenure as program director of the Single  Family Housing program in Mississippi, he assisted nearly 50,000  families in achieving the American dream of home ownership. Whether a  family needed a home or an impoverished elder required emergency home  repairs, Johnny effectively managed USDA home loan and repair programs  to assure the well-being of people he served, and in the process, he  helped them improve themselves and their families.   Johnny Jones made the mission of his profession to selflessly and  honorably serve others. He has directly contributed to improving the  quality of life of literally tens of thousands of Mississippians. Few  individuals have the opportunity through their careers to hold such  distinction. On the occasion of his retirement, it is an honor to  recognize Johnny Jones for his dedicated service to his State and to  the country.                            ____________________
