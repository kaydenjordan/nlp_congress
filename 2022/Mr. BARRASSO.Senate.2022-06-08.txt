 Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk  about another Biden crisis. We just had my friend and colleague from  Oklahoma talk about the crisis, as he saw it, at the southern border  while he was on his trip there very recently. We hear from other  colleagues about the crisis of crime in our cities across the country  as another failure of this administration's. I come today to talk about  the Biden economic crisis, which is hitting families in all of our  States, in all of our communities, and it is the thing that I heard the  very most about when I was home in Wyoming last week.   Across the country, summer is almost here. It is time for barbecues,  visiting friends, and family vacations for many. This year, there will  be many fewer who will be able to afford what has been a natural part  of their family lives.   The American people have just been through the most expensive  Memorial Day ever, and it has been painfully expensive for families  across this country. This is just a preview of the summer of stress  that families are going to be facing all across America. Hamburger meat  today is at its highest price ever; chicken, its highest price ever; a  gallon of gasoline, its highest price ever.   They say inflation is up by a certain percentage, but gas prices have  doubled since Joe Biden became President. There has been a 100-percent  increase in gas prices since the Democrats became the majority in the  Senate and Joe Biden was sworn into office. Gas prices in America,  under the Democrats, have gone up 15 out of 16 months since Joe Biden  came to the White House and Chuck Schumer came to be majority leader.  Gas now costs more than $4 a gallon on average in every State of the  Union, and we are approaching $5 on average across the country. In the  liberal paradise of California, the gas price today is over $6 a gallon  if you can find it at that price. Financial analysts who have looked at  [[Page S2856]]  this thing recently predicted that the average price of a gallon of  gasoline nationwide could be $6.20 all across the country this summer.   So what do the President of the United States and the Democrats in  this body have to do about that? What is the solution? Because people  are looking for solutions.   The Democrats say: We run the place. We are the House. We are the  Senate. We are the White House. We run the place.   Well, where are your solutions? I would say to those Democrats.   Oh, Joe Biden has a solution: I think I will go and beg for oil from  Saudi Arabia. I think I will go and beg for oil from Saudi Arabia.   The Democratic policy on energy seems to be ``anything but American  energy.'' The Biden administration has already been begging Venezuela,  Iran, the OPEC cartel, and even Vladimir Putin to sell us more oil. We  have seen that all in the last year. If North Korea had oil, I am sure  the Democrats would go and try to beg them as well. This President  would rather beg the Saudis to sell us energy than to let hard-working  American energy workers get it out of the ground here at home.   Now, we don't need to go to Saudi Arabia. We don't need to go to  Iran. We don't need to go to Venezuela. We don't need to go to OPEC. We  don't need to go to Russia. We have it here at home in America, and we  have an abundance of energy. Joe Biden is transferring the wealth of  our Nation to the Middle East. Why? Because that is a decision by Joe  Biden and the Democrats--to send our wealth to the Middle East rather  than to use the wealth that we have here in America.   Joe Biden has blocked off the vast majority of Federal lands from  energy exploration and production. Even on the remaining Federal land,  Joe Biden continues to cancel major oil and gas lease sales. Just last  week, while Members were home, the Biden administration, with none of  us in Washington but all of us at home, said they are going to redo the  environmental reviews of leases made by the previous administration.  Now, this includes 2,000 leases in my home State of Wyoming. For every  existing energy lease, Joe Biden has done what he can to stop  production there. He has put 4,300 drilling permits in limbo.   What does he say about this? He said it in Japan. He said: We are  going through an incredible transition.   This is Joe Biden, the President of the United States.   He said: God willing, when this is over, this incredible transition  we are going through, we will be stronger and less reliant on fossil  fuels.   What Joe Biden is saying to every American is, tough luck. Take your  medicine. Take your medicine, and pay the price because we are going  through an incredible transition, and God willing, when it is over, we  are going to be stronger.   The real transition that is happening today is that we are going from  being a nation of energy dominance to being an energy-dependent nation.  We are going from prosperity to poverty and from wealth to weakness.  That is what we are getting from the Democrats in Congress, the  Democrats in the Senate, the Democrats in the House, and Joe Biden.   Today, we are still producing 1 million barrels of oil fewer than we  were before the pandemic. So what do Democrats want to do? Once again,  the Secretary of the Treasury was with us yesterday. They want to raise  taxes on the American public and on American energy. Well, what do you  think higher taxes on energy production are going to do when oil is  already at a point at which people are paying $5 a gallon for gasoline?   For Democrats who choose to go home and listen to the people at home,  I would imagine they are getting an earful from the people at home.   One Democratic Member of the Senate was on TV yesterday, bragging in  a hearing. I saw it played a number of times. She didn't care how high  energy prices went. She didn't care at all because she had an electric  car and drove it here, from her home to Washington, DC, so it didn't  matter. Oh, if you can't afford to have $55,000 to buy an electric  vehicle, too bad for you. That is the Democrats' response. That is what  we are seeing in this country which Joe Biden has led into crisis after  crisis after crisis.    High energy prices, of course, mean higher prices for almost  everything else. Higher energy prices are already driving up food  costs. For any Senator who went to a grocery store--and I am not sure  how many Democrats do the shopping for themselves or how many Democrats  saw how high food prices are, but I certainly saw it in Wyoming this  past weekend--food prices are rising at the fastest rate in 40 years.  Does a single Democratic Senator make reference to that? talk about it?  come up with or try to find solutions for it? Will we have a solution?  Joe Biden can't blame Vladimir Putin for high food prices. The price of  food has gone up every single month--every single month--since Joe  Biden came into office. High energy prices. High food prices.   There is a 40-year high of inflation in this country today, so  inflation has driven the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. What  does that mean? Well, for the seniors and retirees who are watching  their savings and their retirements melt away, it means a lot. Interest  rates have gone up, and mortgage applications have dropped. Many  Americans are giving up on their dreams of even owning their own homes.   Young mothers can't buy or find infant baby formula to buy. Joe Biden  didn't see it coming. People saw it coming, and mothers saw it coming,  but it was ignored by the administration. Once again, they dropped the  ball, and the President was caught by surprise. Seven out of every ten  stores in America have run out of baby formula. There have already been  cases of children being hospitalized because they can't get the right  kind of formula. What did the Biden administration finally say? They  admitted they knew about the crisis last year; yet they did nothing.   Month after month after month, this administration did nothing. That  is kind of what we have gotten with this President. The President is  too slow--too slow to react, to slow to act, and too slow to respond to  the needs of the American people. No wonder they are nicknaming him  ``Too Slow Joe.'' That is what we have in the White House today. It is  a disgrace. The country deserves better. Americans of every background  and in every stage of life are being punished by the bad policies of  Joe Biden's and the Democrats' in Congress.   For most Americans, this is the worst economy they have ever seen.  More and more Americans are having to borrow money just to pay the  bills to try to keep up. Household debt is near an alltime high, and  credit card day is near an alltime high. The average car in the United  States is now 12 years old. This is a record high.   I would have to say to my colleague who bragged about having an  electric car and driving it here and not caring about the fact that gas  prices have gone up and was actually laughing about it, it seemed to  me, well, you are different than most Americans, I would have to say,  because most Americans can't do what you do. They don't have that  opportunity. The average car in the United States is 12 years old  because that is what people can afford, but they can hardly afford the  gas to go in it. They can't afford to buy a new car or a used car, let  alone an electric car.   Since Joe Biden became President, prices have gone up faster than  wages. That is the complaint I continue to hear about at home. Month  after month after month, the buying power of the average American  family keeps going lower and lower and lower. Now two-thirds of the  American people are talking about living paycheck to paycheck with  nothing left over--nothing. As a result, the American people are  feeling stuck and stressed and squeezed.   The pessimism of the economists is only exceeded by the pessimism of  the American people about the Joe Biden economy. All told, Joe Biden's  economic crisis has become a perfect storm of bad economic news.   Jamie Dimon is the CEO of JPMorgan Chase. He warned of an upcoming  economic hurricane. The economic hurricane is a perfect storm of record  inflation, record debt, a shortage of necessities, higher interest  rates, vanishing savings, and a shrinking economy. The Biden inflation  crisis  [[Page S2857]]  is quickly spiraling into an all-around economic crisis. If the  Democrats continue on this path, it is going to get a lot worse soon.   Inflation for producers is even higher than inflation for consumers.  In fact, inflation for producers has been the highest on record.  Wholesale prices for producers went up 11 percent in the last year.  That means higher prices for the people who grow our food, who build  our buildings, and who keep the lights on. Inflation for producers  today means inflation for consumers tomorrow.   After 13 months of this inflation crisis--a crisis that the  administration kept ignoring, kept denying, kept refusing to admit was  here, kept saying wasn't coming--the Secretary of the Treasury said:  Well, if it comes, and there is a small chance it comes, it will be  manageable.   There is no light at the end of the tunnel. If there is any light at  the end of the tunnel, it is because the freight train marked  ``recession'' is about to hit America. Inflation is so bad that the  Democrats can't even deny it anymore. So they create it; they ignore  it; they deny it; they blame inflation on everybody else.   Yesterday, in the Finance Committee, the Secretary of the Treasury  said: No, no. It wasn't them.   The Democrats denied it. They said: No, no. It was Putin. It was the  pandemic.   But now the Democrats want to make it worse.   Well, it took about 14 months, but Janet Yellen admitted earlier this  week in a CNN interview that she had been wrong about inflation. When  she said there was a slight risk, she was mistaken. When she said it  was manageable, she was mistaken.   She said: Now, I was wrong about the path inflation would take. This  is the Secretary of the Treasury for Joe Biden, his handpicked person  to run the economy. She also admitted that inflation was a matter of  supply and demand and that the spending in the American Rescue Plan did  feed the demand. I think she is talking about the $2 trillion that  every Democrat voted for and that every Republican voted against; the  $2 trillion to which even the Democratic economists said: Don't do  that. It is going to make us have bad inflation. And we had bad  inflation. But Joe Biden and the Secretary of the Treasury and every  Democrat in the House and Senate voted in favor of pouring fuel on the  fire that turned into the inflation we are facing today.    This was an enormous mistake on the part of the Democrats and the  President--Chuck Schumer and every Democrat in this Senate, all the  Democrats in the House and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It is costing the  average American family today $5,000 more this year than last year just  to stay even--not to get ahead, just to stay even.   Democrats were warned. They were warned by Republicans. They were  warned by their own experts, and they ignored it; simply, flatly  ignored the warnings, passed the largest spending bill in American  history. And ever since that day, inflation has spiraled out of  control. More than a year later, Democrats still don't have anything to  offer beyond blame and excuses.   Last week, the Secretary of Commerce was asked:         Is there one specific category [of high prices] where you       think you can actually make a difference?    This is her answer. She said:         I wish.    That is what Democrats are left with: wishes, wishes--no plan to fix  the crisis that they have created.   Joe Biden's so-called energy inflation plan made so many false  promises. And he talked about this. He wrote an editorial in the Wall  Street Journal. You would think that maybe somebody at the White House  who wrote it would have been vetted before they gave it to the  President, before he put his name on it. It got Four Pinocchios from  the Washington Post which talked about what the President had to say  about energy as just being a lie.   We know what we need to do. We need to stop the reckless spending. We  need to unleash American energy. Instead of canceling lease sales, Joe  Biden needs to open up Federal lands to American energy production  instead. Instead of canceling pipelines, Joe Biden should speed up the  pipeline permitting process. Instead of begging other countries to sell  us oil, we should get it out of the ground right here in America.   Oh, we have the American energy skills and skilled workers to see us  through this crisis. The President just needs to let them go to work.   Working families have already been pushed to the breaking point.  People are spending their savings, seeing it melting away. They have  run up credit cards just to get by, and now recession is heading toward  us. We need to change course. The administration needs to change course  because the Joe Biden economic hurricane is about to hit America.   I yield the floor.
