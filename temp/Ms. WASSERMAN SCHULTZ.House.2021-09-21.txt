 Mr. Speaker, if we don't pass this CR and  disaster relief supplemental, we will have a cascade of nightmare  occurrences.   The Federal Government and so many programs that help our  constituents will simply shut down. The United States will default on  its debt, causing widespread economic catastrophe, and leave us a  ``permanently weaker Nation,'' as Secretary Yellen said.   Millions of Americans will not receive emergency assistance to help  rebuild from recent hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, and blizzards.   Afghan evacuees will not receive urgent humanitarian assistance.   The National Institute of Standards and Technology will not receive  the $22 million in this bill to investigate the Surfside building  collapse that happened in my district.   We cannot abandon all these must-pass priorities for the American  people. Republicans voted for a debt ceiling three times under Trump,  and this proposed increase would pay for debts that his administration  incurred.   Americans have been through enough in the last 18 months. Now is not  the time to hold our economy hostage and tear vital strands from our  safety net. Too many children, seniors, and working families are  counting on the stability we have begun to secure in recent months.   Republicans must not play politics with our Nation's fiscal  stability. Too many Americans would get hurt. We must pass this CR. The  alternative is catastrophic.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman DeLauro, Speaker Pelosi, and Mr.  Hoyer for committing to bring the Iron Dome stand-alone suspension bill  to make sure that we can stand by our ally Israel and replenish the  vital Iron Dome missile defense system funding that Israel must have in  order to be able make sure that she can defend herself by herself.
