 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the  subject of my Special Order hour.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands?   There was no objection.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the  subject of my Special Order hour.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), who is the chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair of the Congressional  Black Caucus, my friend and colleague, the Honorable Cedric Richmond,  for his leadership in our caucus as well as his continued fight on the  issues impacting Black Americans and other minority communities in  underserved American communities in this great Nation.   I would also like to thank my colleague, the Honorable Marc Veasey of  Texas, for joining me and sharing this evening's Special Order hour and  my many colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus who are here to  speak on this most important issue. Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight as  Representatives of America's minority communities to respond directly  to President Trump's inaugural address, and specifically to his new  deal for African Americans.   During President Trump's campaign, he promised to address issues  confronting African Americans, and he gave a 10-point plan outlining  that. We have studiously reviewed the issues outlined in the plan and  have concrete suggestions for him in accomplishing those goals.   While I acknowledge President Trump's willingness to confront these  issues, I find the points in his new deal do not go far enough in  substance to adequately address the needs of African American  communities and rely heavily on assumptions that African American  communities are primarily in the inner cities. Just as the chairman  spoke of earlier this evening, let's not continue with this fallacy and  stereotyping of the dynamic diversity of African Americans in this  country. African Americans live in the Rust Belt. They live in rural  areas across this country, in suburbs, and they live in territories.   My home district of the U.S. Virgin Islands has a population of  100,000 American citizens and permanent residents. It is a majority  minority, and it, too, has experienced the same slow recovery as many  of the economically dispossessed communities across America. The issues  of African Americans cannot be solved in just 10 bullet points directed  to a small portion of the African American community.   Mr. Speaker, we are here this evening, in large part, to send a  message, suggestions, thoughts, ideas, and support to President Trump  that, if he is serious about addressing the issues in disadvantaged  communities, it would be wise to tap into the decades of experience  held by the members of this caucus. The answers to those 10 points are  very nuanced, and we have been working on them for decades, and we are  happy to support positive improvements in our underserved communities.   For almost a half century, this caucus has advocated to improve the  lives of millions of Americans in both rural and urban communities-- African Americans and all Americans. The 49 members of this caucus who  sit in both Houses of Congress and the members before us tonight have  offered policy solutions for decades that would help not only those  African American communities, but underserved areas nationwide.                                time  2030    We will continue to lead by offering solutions to improve the lives  of all Americans in search of a better opportunity. We are hopeful to  give you an idea of some of those this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), my  able colleague, for his remarks on this matter.    I appreciate the remarks that the gentleman has given,  particularly about the grim view that was given of African Americans  during the inauguration that didn't really expound on the great  diversity that is here.   We have someone from another part of our country who is now going to  speak. I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), one of our  senior great leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, former  chairwoman of the Caucus from California, who is going to give us her  remarks and her thoughts on this topic this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I was really very interested in the  discussion the gentlewoman had and about the work that you have done to  alleviate poverty both in the Democratic Caucus as well as the  Congressional Black Caucus, particularly her words about not allowing  immigration to be divisive and used as a means to separate Americans  and not being able to realize the American Dream. America is big enough  to have immigrants under a comprehensive immigration plan that will  allow all of us to be able to lift it up.   I want to thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on that and  particularly the fight that she has been fighting for so many years  when it comes to alleviating poverty in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence), but more specifically from the great city of Detroit, where  she has been a strong voice for the people of Detroit, a strong voice  for surrounding areas, and her work on Flint, Michigan, and its water  crisis, and other areas of people who are in the inner city that need  support in so many areas, to speak on the issues that are the topic for  today.    I thank the gentlewoman for those words and thoughts on  these issues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee),  who has been a stalwart for social justice, a stalwart on the Judiciary  Committee, and is going to speak on the issue that is here before us  this evening, the CBC Special Order hour, ``A Response to President  Trump's Inaugural Address and New Deal for African Americans.''  [[Page H602]]        Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands and  the gentleman from Texas for their service to the Nation and for  leading the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order. It is always  important for the voices of the Congressional Black Caucus and the  chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Richmond of Louisiana,  to be heard. Both Ms. Plaskett and Mr. Veasey have accepted the  challenge and the call. I want to express to them my greatest  appreciation for the leadership that they are showing.                                time  2045    I want to start my remarks again by saying that it may be hometown  pride, but I like the headline of the Houston Chronicle that says  ``Powerful Together.'' The numbers have not yet been fully calculated,  but we know upwards of a million and maybe over a million persons  around the Nation, and then they added individuals from foreign  countries far and wide. I would take by this title that represents, Mr.  Speaker, the peaceful protests--I want to say that again; in fact, I  might want to say it two times: peaceful, peaceful protests, nonviolent  protests--that occurred on Saturday, expressing the view of what  America is really about.   I say that to my colleagues, they are about what the Congressional  Black Caucus is about, and I believe our chairman made the point that  we come from very diverse districts, representing people of many racial  backgrounds, religious backgrounds, as well as economic backgrounds,  that we are the voice of reason and the conscience of this Congress. We  fight against poverty, but we have Ph.D.'s, lawyers, judges, and we  have businesspersons. They, by and large, Mr. Speaker, are charitable  individuals who believe in social justice.   That is why we come with a sense of privilege, if you will, to be  able to speak about what America truly is. Yesterday at the Community  of Faith, under the leadership of Bishop James Dixon, I gathered for a  prayer for the Nation. Mr. Speaker, I did not dissect it. I did not  eliminate the White House. I did not point out Members of Congress,  call them by name. I said a prayer for the Nation, and that included  the White House and individuals in the Congress and the Senate. We had  international representation. We had the Consulate General of Pakistan.  We had imams. We had individuals who worship on Saturday Sabbath. We  had people who spoke Spanish, people who spoke, obviously, English. And  we gathered to pray for the nation. That is what I think is represented  in the message or the title of the ``New Deal for Black America,'' it  needs prayer because it is not reflective. Although well-intentioned, I  am not sure who may have advised the administration, but it does not  speak to the wideness of diversity of the African American population,  African American communities in this Nation.   So I want to speak very briefly on questions of health care and  justice. I would like to say that in the safe communities of which the  administration or the President has offered his new deal, he says: ``We  will make our communities safe again. Every poor African-American child  must be able to walk down the street in peace. Safety is a civil right.  We will invest in training and funding both local and federal law  enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and  criminal cartels from our neighborhoods. The reduction of crime is not  merely a goal--but a necessity.''   In that there is no mention of ending gun violence or looking at  sensible gun safety regulations or laws, of which we have asked. I  introduced Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act, which really answered  Republicans' cry for enforcing the law, to add to the ATF, to enforce  the penalties against those who use guns wrong. In particular, the  perpetrator in Mother Emanuel should not have been able to get the gun,  but he was because the gun dealer was so easy and quick to sell it,  even though he had not gotten an affirmation by ATF, that is the one. I  would argue it was because they did not have enough personnel.   He also seems to categorize that every poor child has to walk down  the streets. We want every child to walk down--as I said, our community  is very diverse. He then says: ``Equal Justice Under the Law. We will  apply the law fairly, equally and without prejudice. There will be only  one set of rules--not a two-tiered system of justice. Equal justice  also means the same rules for Wall Street.''   So I quickly want to offer these points before I yield the floor.  Number one, we are not all impoverished, but I join my colleagues in  ending poverty. African Americans want the same thing as Barbara Jordan  said when asked, ``What do your people want?''   ``It is the same thing that all America wants.''   Yes, we do want opportunities, but we do have to be more forceful for  issues that are relevant.   We have seen nothing in Mr. Trump's statement of a new deal for Black  America to deal with sentencing reduction and ending mandatory  minimums. We see nothing about working with police departments that  have found themselves falling upon bad times and having a plague of bad  actors, even though we respect and honor police. And so the Law  Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act that John Conyers and myself  introduced has to do with correcting the issue of training and the  improper inaction of police and community.   I would offer to say that the nominee for the Attorney General is  completely opposed to addressing any questions of bad behavior on  behalf of bad actors and bad officers. In fact, he opposed consent  decrees like the one in Ferguson and Baltimore that were only positive,  welcomed by the police departments to help them do a better job at  policing the community.   Prison reform to change the matrix of prison, gun violence prevention  that I have already mentioned, and healthcare access that are truly  crucial to all of us.   Let me also indicate a changing of the matrix of juvenile justice. We  want to reauthorize the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Program  Reauthorization Act, but, more importantly, we want to change how we  are dealing with juveniles. We want to change from the idea of them  being, if you will, punished versus incentivized.   Finally, let me offer to say that two Senators in the other body have  offered a new matrix on health care. I understand there are some  proposals here. I would say that we see that we can't have unity. We  don't have any replacement. What is being offered by the Senators is  health savings accounts, which we know are not realistic. So I would  offer to the President that there are many ways of looking at serving  all of America, including African Americans. It is not listening to  your own voice. It is helping us change the matrix for  juveniles, changing the matrix for those who are incarcerated,  mandatory minimums, the way police and community work, at the same time  respecting them, but, more importantly, it is listening and working  with Members who have real life experiences in some of the issues that  will make this country continue to be the greatest country in the  world.    I thank the gentlewoman for her courtesies.    I thank the Congresswoman from Texas. I want to thank  her for all the work she has been doing not just in terms of  incarceration reform, but pointing out to us that the safety of  children also includes gun violence in their communities. That is so  very important. And, of course, the real tireless work that she has  done in terms of juvenile justice.   Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee has been at the  forefront of changing the dynamic in how we see juveniles and the  things that lead them into incarceration or lead them into problems  with the law, and the solutions that are on the table. This is what we  are speaking about this evening, giving real solutions and concrete  legislation that has already been drafted and worked on by members of  the Congressional Black Caucus that President Trump can use in carrying  out the 10-point plan that he has.   I yield to the Congresswoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), who also  would like to speak on this topic and who has been doing tireless work  in her district of Wisconsin and throughout the United States for  communities, for children, for working mothers, for women who are  attempting to move ahead, to receive a part of the economic justice,  who has really been concerned about so many of the things that we are  talking about this evening.  [[Page H603]]    I yield to her to speak to us this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans) and ask if he has additional thoughts on this after having  that colloquy with Ms. Moore.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans) and ask if he has additional thoughts on this after having  that colloquy with Ms. Moore.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania,  Dwight Evans. I know that he is new to this Congress, but he has worked  for so many years on the issues that we are talking about today. I look  forward to our continued collaboration in supporting so many  communities throughout our country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), who  has been a stalwart voice on so many of the issues that the  Congressional Black Caucus has brought here this evening and is here,  Mr. Speaker, to share some of her thoughts on the things that have been  spoken about earlier today.    I thank the gentlewoman.  [[Page H605]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I was struck by some information that I just received.  This is a summary of the new deal for Black America. Nowhere in the new  deal for Black America is a commitment to protecting voting rights. One  of the Achilles heels of the nominee for the Attorney General is he  does not have a history of protecting voting rights.   Particularly, I want to acknowledge President George W. Bush because  the Congress--both the House and the Senate--worked extensively with  him in the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, including  section 5, which is preclearance. Lo and behold, the Shelby case  imploded section 5. We no longer have it in a potpourri--a flourishing,  a garden of weeds--of voter ID laws, one by which my colleague Mr.  Veasey, who was a plaintiff, was promoted.   The last point that I want to make is, in addition to not having  anything on voting rights, we just had breaking news that the White  House has indicated that the President would have had the popular vote  if he had not had happen to him 3 to 5 million illegal votes cast. This  is being reported. Likewise, what is being reported is there is  absolutely no evidence that there were 3 to 5 million illegal votes  cast in the 2016 election. I think we need to have focus on voting  rights and on the protection of those who vote.    I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey).    I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey).    And education and workforce development.    And education and workforce development.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 22 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, January 24, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
