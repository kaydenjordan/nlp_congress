 Mr. President, I request unanimous consent to enter into a  colloquy with the Senator from Oklahoma.   As the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services  Committee, we rise to commemorate and celebrate the distinguished  career of Chief Warrant Officer Donald R. Crutchfield of the U.S. Army.    Mr. President, a native of Ohio, Don joined the Army in  1998 and has worked at every echelon since, from the 516th Personnel  Services Battalion; multiple brigades; III Corps; Office of the Vice  Director of the Army Staff; Headquarters of the Department of the Army;  and the Army General Officer Management Office. In every assignment, he  was known to his colleagues as a dedicated leader and an expert of his  craft.    Mr. President, Don did not serve alone, however. Throughout  his career, he was supported by his family, friends, and colleagues. We  owe a special debt of gratitude to Don's wife, Christine, and his  daughters, Amber and Lydia, who supported him with strength and love.  His contributions to the Nation were possible because of their support.
