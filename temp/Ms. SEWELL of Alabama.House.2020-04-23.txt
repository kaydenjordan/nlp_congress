 Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of this  bill to provide additional resources for small, local, and minority- owned businesses and nonprofits under the Paycheck Protection Program,  as well as to provide resources for our hospitals and for testing.   Madam Speaker, the Paycheck Protection Program has not been without  its controversy. I have heard too many stories of frustrated business  owners who have not been able to access the program due to a lack of  existing relationships with a lender or difficulty navigating the  complex application process. And these are issues that are  disproportionately harming local, rural, and minority-owned businesses  that make up the heart of my district.   Madam Speaker, I am glad that we are taking steps today to address  the inequities and indirectly and directly allow funding for lenders  that service the truly local barber shops, beauty shops, restaurants on  Main Street across this country. These are the businesses that are the  lifeline of so many  [[Page H1927]]  of our local economies, and it is important that we make sure that this  lending gets to these vitally important businesses.   I hope that this bill will offer some relief to these businesses, and  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   I also ask our leaders and the lenders to know that we are watching  them. We want the truly small, local businesses to get their fair  share.
