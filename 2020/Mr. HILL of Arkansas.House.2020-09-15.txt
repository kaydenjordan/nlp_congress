 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in final salute to  the service of a man who loved the United States and devoted his life  to her service, Lieutenant General Brent Scowcroft.   General Scowcroft died August 6, 2020, and leaves behind his loving  daughter, Karen, and her family. His devoted friends, colleagues, and  loyal longtime staff members are left with terrific memories of a man  who served two Presidents and had delivered his wise counsel to them.   General Scowcroft was the only American to serve two Presidents,  President Gerald Ford and President George H.W. Bush, as their National  Security Advisor.   In September 1991, President Bush asked me to leave the Treasury  Department and join the White House staff, directing his Economic  Policy Council. General Scowcroft was a member of that group and always  made significant, substantive, and humorous contributions to our  meetings when he was awake.   Brent was renowned among his colleagues for his long hours, dedicated  work, and daily care for his long-ailing, beloved wife, Jackie. That  made late afternoon meetings a bit of a struggle.   President Bush initiated the Scowcroft Award to that Cabinet  Secretary or senior staffer that nodded off in a meeting, as former  staffer and now President of the Council on Foreign Relations Richard  Haass described, in the most ostentatious manner. One of those nod-offs  occurred in the Roosevelt Room, with his head resting on my shoulder.   During those White House years, my wife, Martha, served General  Scowcroft as his deputy legal adviser. Our family extends our heartfelt  condolences to Brent's family and his scores of friends around the  world.               Honoring the Life of Richard Colburn Butler, III     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of one of Arkansas's great historic preservationists, and my  lifelong friend, Richard Butler, III, who recently passed away at the  age of 82.   Richard was born in 1937 in Little Rock, where his father, Dick, was  a philanthropist for whom the Butler Center for Arkansas Studies is  named.   After receiving his law degree from the University of Arkansas,  Richard practiced law for a few years before becoming a trust officer  at the Commercial National Bank of Little Rock.   His attention to detail and historic architecture led to wonderful  projects in Old Washington, Arkansas. For his devoted work, Richard was  known in our State as Mr. Preservationist.   Richard had a passion for teaching people about the history of  Arkansas and was a steadfast supporter of churches and the arts.   He was an inspiration and friend to many across our State, and I  extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends, family, and  loved ones.                      Honoring the Life of Dickson Flake     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life  and legacy of one of Arkansas's great businesspeople and civic leaders,  Dickson Flake, who passed away peacefully on Tuesday, June 30, at the  age of 81.   Throughout his life, Dickson's accomplishments knew no bounds, as he  played major roles in crucial Little Rock developments, including the  Arkansas BlueCross BlueShield headquarters and the Arkansas Department  of Human Services.    Dickson started his career in 1965 after finishing at the University  of Michigan with a master's degree in business with high distinction.  Because of his dedication, he was awarded the Arkansas Real Estate  Association Realtor of the Year in 1971 and was inducted into the  Arkansas Real Estate Hall of Fame in 2011. He was named the 2020  Business and Professional Leader of the Year by the Rotary Club of  Little Rock.   With the passing of Dickson Flake, Martha and I lost a good friend.  Like many in central Arkansas, I lost a wise counselor.   In this time of thanks and reflection, Martha and I extend our  condolences and prayers to his family.                            ____________________
