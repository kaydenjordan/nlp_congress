 Mr. President, I rise to recognize the life and  advocacy of child nutrition champion Dorothy Caldwell who passed away  on August 13, 2023.   From a young age, it was clear to her teachers and others around her  that Dorothy would make a difference in Arkansas. She was a  trailblazer.   Dorothy was active in 4-H and graduated high school at the age of 16.  With help from her community, she was the first person in her family to  attend college. At the University of Arkansas, she was involved in a  number of activities. She served as vice president and chaplain of Phi  Upsilon Omicron, the university's home economics sorority. As a senior,  she traveled all over the State for her duties as president of the  Arkansas Future Teachers of America.   She fostered a passion for helping students and went to work  improving nutrition programs, first as director of food and nutrition  for the Lee County School District and, from 1988-1997, as director of  child nutrition for the Arkansas Department of Education. Her skills,  experience and commitment to public service took her to Washington, DC,  where she worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture for 4 years.  Dorothy continued her leadership advancing child nutrition policy in  numerous roles including as president of the School Nutrition  Association. In this capacity she helped develop nationwide child  nutrition standards. Her tireless advocacy on behalf of school-age  children resulted in standardized lunch times, education initiatives  about healthy eating and the launch of student breakfast programs. She  earned the honor of ``School Nutrition Hero'' from the School Nutrition  Foundation at its 50th anniversary celebration.   Dorothy dedicated her career to improving the lives of children and  ensuring they receive the nutrition necessary to succeed. As we  continue building on the groundwork she established and improve access  to USDA school meal programs, we remember and honor her tireless  efforts and admirable example.   I offer my deepest condolences to her family, friends and those who  had the privilege to work alongside such a wonderful person. I am  hopeful they can find comfort knowing Dorothy's legacy will live  on.                            ____________________
