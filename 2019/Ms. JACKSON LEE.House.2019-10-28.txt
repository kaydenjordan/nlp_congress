 Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in the  Congressional Black Caucus and the many Members of the United States  Congress in honoring John Conyers.   I look forward, over the next couple of weeks, to paying tribute to  him on this floor, for he is deserving of the  [[Page H8529]]  honor and recognition of the service of 53 years in the United States  Congress.   John Conyers, throughout newspapers across America, is called a civil  rights icon, a man who won reelection time after time with 80 percent  of the vote.   I offer my deepest sympathy to his beautiful wife, Monica, and his  sons, John and Carl, but most of all, I say to America: Those who are  voiceless, John Conyers was there; but those who were silenced, who  tried to be heard, John Conyers was there.   In every important piece of legislation for the last half century,  John Conyers was there: voting rights, fair housing, the Clean Air Act,  and the Clean Water Act.   Yes, he is an icon, but he is a person of this Nation. An honored  servant and former military, he is to be honored, and I look forward to  saluting him in days to come.   May he rest in peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressional Black Caucus  for convening anchoring this Special Order in remembrance of Chairman  John Conyers, Jr., the tireless fighter for justice and equality,  Chairman of House Committees on Oversight and on the Judiciary,  founding member of Congressional Black Caucus, Member of Congress,  Member of Congress from Michigan for 53 years, my mentor, a beloved  colleague, and dear friend who died on Sunday, October 27, 2019, at his  home in Detroit, Michigan at the age of 90.   Mr. Speaker, John Conyers, Jr. was a statesman and strong and  supporter of equality, economic and social justice, civil rights, and  human dignity for all.   John Conyers, Jr. was born May 16, 1929 in Highland Park, Michigan to  Lucille Janice and John Conyers, Sr., a union organizer in the  automotive industry and an international representative with the United  Auto Workers.   After graduation from Northwestern High School, John Conyers  dutifully served his country in the Michigan National Guard from 1948  to 1950, the U.S. Army from 1950 to 1954, and the U.S. Army Reserves  from 1954 to 1957, serving during the Korean War and as an officer in  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers where he was awarded combat and merit  citations.   Following his military service, John Conyers earned his Bachelor of  Arts and Juris Doctor from Wayne State University and was admitted to  the Michigan State Bar.   Chairman Conyers began his legislative career on the staff of the  late Congressman John Dingell and during this time he also served as  counsel to several Detroit-area labor unions and was referee for  Michigan's workmen's compensation department.   In 1964, John Conyers was first elected to represent the First  Congressional District of Michigan and was reelected to the succeeding  90th Congress and the following 15 Congresses until he retired on  December 5, 2017.   On the retirement of Congressman John Dingell at the end of the 113th  Congress in December 2015, John Conyers became the longest-serving  Member of the United States Congress, serving as Dean of the House from  January 3, 2015 until December 2017.   Mr. Speaker, John Conyers was also the third longest-serving Member  of the House in history and the sixth longest-serving Member of  Congress in history; the second-longest serving Member of either the  House or Senate in Michigan history, trailing only his former boss,  Congressman Dingell; and was the last member of the large Democratic  freshman class of 1964 to serve in the House of Representatives.   In the more than half century he served in Congress, John Conyers was  at the forefront of most of the seminal moments in American political  history, such as working to enact into law this partial list of  landmark legislation:   Voting Rights of 1965, Title XVIII of the Social Security Act  (Medicare), Fair Housing Act of 1968, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act,  Help America Vote Act, Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank Act, Americans  With Disabilities Act, Assault Weapons Ban, Immigration Reform and  Control Act of 1982, Drug Kingpins Act, Fair Chance Act.   Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Social Security Amendments of  1965 (including Medicaid and Medicare), Voting Rights Act of 1965,  Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, National Foundation on the  Arts and the Humanities Act, Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965,  Heart Disease, Cancer, and Stroke Amendments, Freedom of Information  Act, Child Nutrition Act, National Historic Preservation Act, National  Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, Foreign Gifts and  Decorations Act, Cuban Adjustment Act, Public Broad casting Act of  1967.

The proposal to expand Medicare to all, a political idea gaining  increasing popularity daily, was first introduced by John Conyers in  2003 as the United States National Health Insurance Act.   John Conyers served on the Judiciary Committee that investigated  Watergate and voted articles of impeachment against President Richard  Nixon in August 1974.   John Conyers marched in the historic March from Selma to Montgomery,  Alabama, with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and later employed civil  rights legend Rosa Parks in his congressional office until her  retirement in 1988.   John Conyers was loved by his constituents, regularly winning  reelection with 80 percent of the vote or more.   John Conyers is one of the 13 founding members of the Congressional  Black Caucus in 1971, which has worked diligently to strengthen  African-American lawmakers' ability to address the legislative concerns  of African American and minority citizens and has now increased to 55  members in the House and Senate, including myself.   While in Congress, John Conyers chaired the prestigious House  Judiciary Committee from 1989-1995 and Oversight from 2007-2011, the  first African American to hold these coveted positions.   Throughout his career, John Conyers used his influence to push civil  rights; in 1968, only days after the assassination of the Rev. Dr.  [[Page H8536]]  Martin Luther King Jr., Chairman Conyers began a long and ultimately  successful effort to make Dr. King's birthday a national holiday, which  was enacted in 1983.   John Conyers also cosponsored and worked tirelessly to pass the Anti- Apartheid Act of 1986, which help topple South Africa's system of  apartheid and free Nelson Mandela from prison.   In the 101st Congress, John Conyers introduced legislation to study  the issue of reparations for slavery and was the original sponsor of  H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for  African-Americans Act.   I am proud to have assumed principal sponsorship of this piece of  landmark legislative proposal and continuing the fight for justice.   John Conyers was dedicated to justice for all, he supported  legislation to generate the Justice Department's national study on  police brutality.   John Conyers was opposed to the imposition of the death penalty and  began a series of hearings on police brutality.   As Judiciary Committee Chairman, John Conyers also worked to create  and enlarge federal death benefits for police officers and firefighters  who died in the line of duty.   Mr. Speaker, John Conyers dedicated his life to serving his  constituents and the citizens of the United States; his persistence for  justice and his fight for equal rights is a testament to his character.   Chairman John Conyers will live forever in the hearts of the people  of Detroit, his State of Michigan, and the United States.   John Conyers was a legislative lion whose presence will forever be  missed, and we all mourn his loss and extend our deepest sympathies to  his wife Monica, his children, and family and friends who loved him so  dearly, my deepest sympathies go out to and I hope you find consolation  in the certain knowledge that John is now resting peacefully.                            ____________________
