 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the retirement of a  pillar of the Third District of Arkansas, lifelong Arkansan, and  exemplary public servant, Mayor Jackie Crabtree of Pea Ridge.   As a former mayor myself, I have high standards for those in this  position. I can say with certainty, Jackie has been a very  distinguished leader. Few can remember a time in Pea Ridge when Jackie  wasn't the mayor.   To love, to serve, and to promote Pea Ridge have been the pillars of  his service. There is no growth project or improvement of consequence  that has happened in the last quarter century that doesn't have the  fingerprints of Jackie Crabtree all of over them.   From new sidewalks, parks, sewer infrastructure, to city buildings,  walking trails, water lines, his vision has transformed the city.   He also led many firsts. He was the first full-time mayor, he brought  in the first full-time fire and paramedic departments. He even started  the Christmas tree lighting and decorations in downtown, to name a few.  Those examples only scratch the surface of Jackie's accomplishments.   To me, there is no greater illustration of his success than the  thousands of new residents who have flocked to Pea Ridge. It is a  vibrant destination, one where people want to live, work, and raise  their families.   I congratulate Jackie on a terrific career and life of service to his  community. His hard work has been instrumental in building a better  future.   While I know his high school sweetheart and wife, Freida, son, Eric,  and granddaughters will enjoy the extra time he will have for them,  know that his leadership will be sorely missed.   Mr. Speaker, I welcome my friend to the former mayor's club.  Congratulations, Jackie.                Honoring Sheriff Tim Helder on his Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a trusted  protector of the people of Arkansas, and a man I am blessed to know as  a friend, Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder.   For nearly four decades, he has nobly worn the badge. His heart for  service is core to his character; it could even be argued it is in his  blood. That point is only further reiterated by the fact that both his  father and grandfather also wore the uniform, and I know they would be  proud.   It is poignant that his law enforcement career is beginning and  ending at the Washington County Sheriff's Office. After starting as a  dispatcher, he attended the police academy, went on to work for the  Fayetteville Police Department where he climbed the ranks.   After 21 years in Fayetteville, he returned to the sheriff's office  and holds the honor of being the longest serving sheriff in its  history.   On a personal note, I will miss the sheriff breakfasts that he would  host for the community as a time to catch up and build trust. I hope  that tradition will be carried on.   When reflecting on his career, I could list his many accomplishments  or accolades or the names of the men and women he has helped lead, but  I want to read the creed on his challenge coin, it sums it up:         I pledge before God and my community to faithfully perform       my duties with integrity, professionalism, respect and       fairness. I will bring a good attitude to work and take       responsibility for all of my actions. I will have the courage       to do the right thing for the right reasons without       exception.    More than just words. That is how Sheriff Helder has lived his life.  The Third District is safer and stronger because of his service.   Mr. Speaker, I thank him for his principled integrity, and I wish him  a blessed retirement.                            ____________________
