 Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I  appreciate my friend--I do consider him my friend--and colleague and  his concern, which we mutually share on this issue. But this  legislation was introduced 7 days ago--7 days ago. Most of our  colleagues have not even had a chance to read it.   The Foreign Relations Committee, which I have the privilege of  chairing, has not reviewed or marked up this bill since it just got  referred to us. And to my knowledge, my colleague has not made any  effort to engage the committee.   Especially in light of its sweeping and mandatory nature and the lack  of any waiver--even if a waiver were in our national interest--members  with expertise in foreign affairs need to have the opportunity to  scrutinize the bill.   Regular order allows us to refine legislation. It ensures we avoid  unintended consequences, and that is needed here.   As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I take the threat of  Mexican drug trafficking organizations seriously. During my 30 years in  Congress, I have made significant efforts to combat drug trafficking in  Mexico, Latin America, the Caribbean, and around the world.   Given the potential impact of this legislation, I would just ask my  colleague the following questions for his consideration--these are the  questions I ask myself as I am looking at his request: The U.S.  Congress has developed a framework of sanctions specifically to target  drug traffickers. It is called the Kingpin Act. There is substantial  overlap between the Kingpin Act and what is being proposed today. Is  this redundancy helpful, or is it hurtful? Why is it needed?   S. 4914 provides no new funding for the management of our sanctions  program targeting foreign terrorist organizations, and we are deeply  engaged in our whole-sanctions operation as it relates to Russia and  Ukraine. This would be additional, but it has no additional resources.  Do we want to stretch the U.S. Government's personnel and resources  that target foreign terrorist organizations? That is what the  legislation would do.   Does my colleague want to explain to the American people why we  should have less personnel and funding dedicated to countering  Hezbollah, ISIS, al-Qaida, because, as it is, that is what the  legislation would do.   The members of the Foreign Relations Committee take the threat posed  by Mexican cartels very seriously. We know that the cartels are deeply  involved in the production and trafficking of fentanyl. We know that  this is a substance so lethal it kills tens of thousands of American  citizens every year.  [[Page S5126]]    That is why in June, the committee approved the FENTANYL Results Act,  legislation designed to strengthen the United States response to  fentanyl trafficking--legislation that received unanimous, bipartisan  backing of all members of the Foreign Relations Committee, legislation  that we hope can be enacted into law before the end of this Congress.  That is a serious legislative effort conducted through normal order of  the Senate.   I would just say to my friend, if you really want to address the  impact that Mexican cartels and drug trafficking have on the American  people, I urge you, respectfully, to work through the Foreign Relations  Committee and join us in a meaningful legislative effort.   Finally, before I object, I would just say, I know that my colleague  keeps talking about the Biden open borders. Well, it is a little  incongruous when you self-designate and made in your comments that it  is the U.S. Customs and Border large catches of fentanyl and other  drugs under the direction of this administration that is making those  catches. It is either that we have an open border and anything comes  in, or it is that the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol that is actively  engaged is stopping the flow of significant amounts of drugs.   For all of those reasons, at this point in time, I will have to  object.    Mr. President, I can't let the question rhetorically  hang there.   I would say to my colleague, first of all, for all of us who have  been fighting this issue on a bipartisan basis--I think his bill has  only got Republican sponsors on it, a few--that we have been fighting  this, and this is a continuous fight. And, yes, every life that is lost  is a life that we mourn. But what would I say to them?   I would say, well, if we get the Fentanyl Results Act legislation  passed, which passed the committee on a bipartisan basis, we would have  a bipartisan approach toward dealing with this.   I appreciate that my colleague has declared war on fentanyl, but just  because he has declared war doesn't mean that his view as to how you  meet the challenge is the ultimate result, is the ultimate solution.   So in good faith, I offer our colleague to work with us. But you  can't end up making the Senate the Committee of the Whole. If we want  to do that, good, let's abolish all of our committees, and let's all  sit here and we can bring up legislation after legislation that was  just introduced, where nobody has a chance to read it and nobody has a  chance to understand the unintended consequences, as noble as the  intent might be. But that is what my colleague has done on more than  one occasion now. He introduces a piece of legislation and, days after,  comes to the floor to seek its approval. Well, that bypasses the entire  system that is meant as a check and balance to get the best legislation  to accomplish a common goal.   So that is what I would say. We need to work on this together. We are  committed to it. That is why we passed legislation in the past. That is  why we just passed legislation recently. I hope my colleague will join  us, and maybe we can get it in the NDAA together.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
