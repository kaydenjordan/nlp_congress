 Mr. Speaker, America's southern border  is in crisis, and this issue has been solely facilitated by the  destructive policies of President Joe Biden.   Illegal aliens attack the border, while dangerous drug cartels take  advantage of weak policies, putting children at risk. This is truly a  disaster, and it is time that the border czar, Vice President Kamala  Harris, take action to protect American families.   The numbers speak for themselves. Encounters at the border reached a  21-year high in May of 180,034 persons. The U.S. Customs and Border  Protection agency seized 934 pounds of fentanyl at the border in May,  which is a 300 percent increase in a year capable of killing every  American citizen. Criminal crossings have almost tripled since the  previous fiscal year to 6,918 convicted criminals. Drug trafficking and  human smuggling have also increased, putting children's lives in  danger.   Biden named the Vice President with overseeing the crisis. It has  been 84 days, and she still has not visited to see the children at  risk.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we should never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Congratulations to Julianne and Hunter Wilson on the upcoming  December blessed event.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman   Mike  Johnson for his leadership for promoting the truth tonight. It has been  so refreshing to hear our colleagues bring  [[Page H2884]]  facts to the American people that they need to know.   And thanks to the leadership of Vice President Mike Pence through  Operation Warp Speed to develop the Wuhan virus vaccine, America has  been able to get back to work with jobs being available.   In May of this year, the Centers for Disease Control released updated  guidance saying that fully vaccinated people no longer needed to wear a  mask or social distance in most cases. America should be completely  open for business to create jobs.   We saw President Trump created jobs. Under his leadership, we had  record low unemployment for African Americans, for Asian Americans, for  Hispanics. We had record employment. The most number of jobs ever for  youth and women in the United States by cutting taxes, not raising the  taxes either directly or by inflation, as Mr. Biden is doing.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration does not agree with science.  Even with this huge win to the American people, the administration and  Democrats want to continue to have unemployed Americans be dependent on  the government by incentivizing them to remain unemployed with  increased benefits that pay more than a small business can provide,  destroying jobs.   I commend Governor Henry McMaster for ending these increased benefits  and getting South Carolina back to work. Congress should follow suit  creating jobs.   I am grateful to be a cosponsor of H.R. 3104, the Get Americans Back  to Work Act, sponsored by Congressman Dusty Johnson. This bill will  remove the supplemental Federal self-destructive benefits by June 30 of  this year.   I encourage my colleagues to pass this legislation. We must not  continue to indebt future generations with reckless spending or create  inflation, which destroys the retirement savings of our senior citizens  and equally is crippling to small businesses that are the backbone of  this country.   Jobs are uplifting, fulfilling, and meaningful for a productive life.
