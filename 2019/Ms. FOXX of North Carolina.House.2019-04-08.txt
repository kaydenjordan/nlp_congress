 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 35th  anniversary of the founding of the National Center for Missing and  Exploited Children, NCMEC.   Every child deserves a safe childhood, but each year, hundreds of  thousands of children are abducted, abused, and exploited. NCMEC serves  as the national clearinghouse and coordinated response center to locate  missing children, combat sexual exploitation, and prevent  victimization.   NCMEC's impact cannot be overstated. Since its founding in 1984,  NCMEC has assisted law enforcement and families with more than 25,000  cases of missing children and helped to identify more than 16,700  children who were victims of sexual abuse. Thanks to NCMEC's efforts,  law enforcement has successfully recovered more than 290,000 missing  children.   NCMEC's dedication to serving vulnerable children and their families  is remarkable, and I am proud to honor NCMEC as it continues its  tireless efforts to bring children home.
