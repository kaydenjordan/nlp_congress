 Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, Michiganders went to the  polls and elected a new Democratic majority.   Because of this, I have the privilege of welcoming four new Michigan  Democratic Members of Congress, folks who are committed to passing  meaningful policies that will help everyday Americans. This means  reducing the cost of healthcare. Prescription drug prices are too high.  No one should have to choose between filling a prescription and feeding  their family.   These new Members are ready to work to protect Social Security and  Medicare from cuts that Republicans have been proposing. We are pleased  that we are going to be able to have these new allies in this fight.   My own hometown of Flint knows firsthand the price of failing to  invest in infrastructure. It is important that this Democratic majority  advance a broad and meaningful infrastructure bill to fix our broken  roads and bridges, and to repair our damaged water systems.   It is past time that we took on these issues. I am anxious to welcome  these new Members of Congress who are committed to moving this bold  agenda forward.                            ____________________
