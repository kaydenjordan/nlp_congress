 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a hero, a  trailblazer, and an inspiration to all, astronaut Virgil ``Gus''  Grissom.   Growing up in Indiana, I am honored to pay tribute to this remarkable  man as he is inducted into the Indiana Military Veterans Hall of Fame.   Gus Grissom's contributions to space exploration are tremendous. He  was one of America's original astronauts.   In 1961, he made history when he became the second American to travel  to space. He later commanded the Gemini 3 mission, paving the way for  the Moon landing.   Gus was a man of courage, unwavering dedication, and profound  commitment to his country. Gus was a native son of Indiana. Born and  raised in Mitchell, he embodied the spirit of the heartland and carried  those values into space.   Though his life was tragically cut short during a prelaunch test for  the Apollo 1 mission, his legacy continues.   He exemplified the qualities that define our military veterans:  bravery, sacrifice, and service to a cause greater than oneself.   Today, we remember Gus Grissom not just for his achievements in space  exploration and service to his country, but for the inspiration he  continues to provide to countless Americans young and old. His name  will forever be etched in the archives of American history.   As we honored him with this induction into the Indiana Military  Veterans Hall of Fame this month, let us be reminded of the courageous  spirit of exploration and of the bravery of all of our veterans who  have made the ultimate sacrifices.   Gus Grissom's legacy lives on, and we are privileged to celebrate his  life and achievements. May his memory continue to inspire generations  to come.                            ____________________
