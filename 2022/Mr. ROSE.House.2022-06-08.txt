 Madam Speaker, in late April and early May when parents and  Republicans in Congress began to sound the alarm about the unacceptable  scarcity of baby formula, I thought to myself, Well, this is just  another example of the compounding effect of the bad policies of the  Biden administration.   But at the time, the facts had not come to light that the crisis is  yet another direct result of the mismanagement and misguided Biden  Presidency; a President focused on a woke, progressive agenda, while  the basic functions of government are neglected or mismanaged.   The most critical fact that has come to light is that Abbott  Nutrition's Sturgis plant supplied about one-fifth, 20 percent, of all  infant formula in the United States before it closed. Furthermore, the  company makes the majority of the formula for infants in the  [[Page H5345]]  Women, Infants, and Children program. That is more than 43 percent of  babies in the United States. It is unfathomable that a facility this  critical to the lives of our Nation's newborns can somehow slip through  the cracks.   As of this past weekend, I am glad to see that the Sturgis plant is  making formula again, but it could take a couple of months for supply  to hit store shelves. Currently, the Nation's current out-of-stock rate  is 74 percent. In Tennessee, it is 92 percent. This is indeed a worst- case scenario for parents and their vulnerable infant children.   How did we get here? Let's go through the timeline.   In September of 2019, inspectors found a handful of sanitary issues  with the plant in Sturgis but allowed managers to continue operating  while they implemented necessary changes.   Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA conducted its first routine  inspection of the Abbott Sturgis plant in 2 years in September of 2021.  They found that the issues uncovered in the 2019 surveillance  inspection had been resolved. At about the same time, in September  2021, the FDA receives the first complaint that a child was  hospitalized with Cronobacter. Meanwhile, the Nation's out-of-stock  rate for infant formula rose to 11 percent in November of 2021, when  Dr. Robert Califf was nominated to serve as commissioner of the FDA.   December 1, the FDA received a second complaint related to the death  of a child. The Centers for Disease Control determined that Cronobacter  could have been a contributing factor.   In January of this year, the FDA receives their third complaint of a  child hospitalized with Cronobacter, while at the same time The New  York Times reports that baby formula shortages are, ``worsening  throughout the United States.''   On January 31, the FDA begins a delayed follow-up inspection of the  Abbott Sturgis plant. Thirteen days later, the nationwide out-of-stock  rate of infant formula rises to 26 percent. Two days later, on February  15, Dr. Robert Califf is confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the new  commissioner of the FDA.   Two days after that, on the commissioner's second day on the job,  Abbott announces a voluntary recall and hold of certain powdered infant  formulas produced at the Sturgis plant. The same day, the FDA receives  a fourth Cronobacter complaint.   Why does this timeline matter? Because President Biden said he wasn't  made aware of the issues with the stock of baby formula until late  April.   Now just imagine, on your second day on the job, a fire breaks out in  your office, and you don't call the President to let him know? I don't  understand. I truly don't.   Again, this plant produces one-fifth of the Nation's supply of baby  formula. The crisis was foreseeable and extraordinary steps should have  been taken to avoid it. There is no doubt in my mind that the February  formula recall followed by the Sturgis plant closure is the primary  factor that turned an already increasing problem into a crisis.   There should have been more urgency. It should have been clear to the  Biden administration in February that we were going to have a problem.  Maybe it was and they just didn't want to tell the President, or maybe  he was busy that day. Who knows. I am sure we will find out when  Republicans take back the majority and conduct proper oversight of this  administration.   Put simply, the FDA and President Biden fumbled the ball for months,  and families across this country are paying the price. We cannot afford  for this administration to take its eye off the ball again. The  President must do better.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the heartbreak  Americans continue to reel from, the horrible killing of 19 students  and two teachers by a demented teenager in Uvalde, Texas.   As an elected Representative, as well as a parent, I am eager to find  solutions that make our kids safer. Those solutions must include  strengthening mental health services and school security across this  country.   Democrats in Congress have a choice to make. Do they want to focus  yet again on more gun control, which won't work and won't pass the  Senate, or do they want to focus on mental health and school security  improvements which will help, and on which we might be able to reach  consensus and pass into law?   Madam Speaker, I believe we can enhance protection for our children  without throwing away any of our hard-won freedoms. The ball is in the  Democrats' court.                            ____________________
