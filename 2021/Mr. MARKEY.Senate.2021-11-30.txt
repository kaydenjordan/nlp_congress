 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 60 years ago, President Dwight David  Eisenhower warned Americans about the unwarranted influence of the  military-industrial complex. He told us of the relentless defense  interests that would use their lobbying muscle to keep money flowing  into the coffers of the Pentagon. While our adversaries and competitors  have changed in the past six decades, the military-industrial complex's  revolving door is as well greased as Ike warned our country.   Today, Congress is set to vote to increase the already-bloated  defense budget in the same year that we ended our longest war--the  latest proof that the military-industrial complex is alive and well and  banking on a pay raise, all while Americans struggle to afford  groceries and gasoline.   Here is the simple truth about the defense budget we are debating  this week: We plan to spend $768 billion to fuel the military- industrial complex even in our moment of relative peace. Yet many in  this Chamber are relentlessly attacking the Build Back Better act  despite this spending bill being four times its size in new spending.   What we are hearing in this Chamber this week are Cold War echoes-- words that sound like talk of the bomber and the missile gap with the  former Soviet Union that drove an arms race that brought us to the  brink of annihilation.   Our top military general recently called China's most recent  hypersonic test a ``Sputnik moment.'' That is our top military general.  But how in the world can it be a ``Sputnik moment'' if we are set to  spend more on defense than the next 11 countries combined, many of  which are U.S. allies and partners? There is no technological or  military gap that we need to close. We have the strongest military in  the world.   Our rivals, our adversaries are not 10 feet tall. We are the country  that is 10  [[Page S8814]]  feet tall, and they are looking up at us militarily. We should just  understand this, as people bad-mouth our military. It is not accurate.  They are afraid of us. We are technologically superior to them, whoever  they may be.   But wait. As if we weren't spending enough, Congress has tossed in an  additional $25 billion that was not even requested by the Pentagon in  this year's budget. You heard that right--an additional $25 billion.  How many kids could go to pre-K for that? How many seniors could get  dental or vision coverage? How many public housing units could we build  with that, with the money that has not even been requested by the  Pentagon?   We should not accept the logic that says we can afford to build a  $100 billion intercontinental ballistic missile that will never be used  but we cannot possibly afford paid family leave that Americans  desperately need.   Universal prekindergarten is too expensive, but padding the wallets  of defense firm executives with taxpayer dollars is money well spent.  That is insane. That is immoral.   We should not have to fight tooth and nail to meet our commitment to  replenish the Green Climate Fund to help save the planet while being  told to accept the need for new weapons systems that could lead to  global annihilation.   It is time we stop thinking of national security solely in terms of  our inventory of bombers and missiles and submarines. Trillions in  defense spending did nothing to spare Americans from the greatest  security threat in generations: COVID-19. We have to stop pretending  that there are military solutions to the national security challenges  that we face. The defense a family needs right now is protection from  eviction, hunger, electricity shut off, and pollution.   Being strong on defense means learning critical lessons from the two- decade-long war in Afghanistan. Being strong on defense means that we  do not shy away from telling the military-industrial complex and its  army of lobbyists that we do not need to outspend our adversaries into  oblivion.   Nowhere has the gold-plated defense industry been harder at work than  in gilding the whopping $1.5 trillion we are projected to spend through  2046 on upgrading our nuclear weapons enterprise. Say that again--$1.5  trillion on more nuclear weapons. There is one thing this country and  this world does not need, and that is more nuclear weapons.   We know that fear and distrust of an adversary's intentions empower  voices in the defense bureaucracy to sell new capabilities that spur  the other side to justify weapon systems of their own. But we must  avoid a rerun of the Cold War, where worst-case military planning leads  to thousands of missiles pointed at Washington, Moscow, and Beijing,  once again casting a terrible shadow over humanity.   That is why I introduced amendments to the NDAA that would trim $75  billion off the nuclear weapons enterprise, commit to robust diplomacy  with Russia and China, and prevent the President--any President,  Democratic or Republican--from firing the first shot, the first nuclear  weapon in a nuclear war. The United States should never be first to  launch a nuclear weapon against another country--ever. That should just  be our policy. We will not be the first to use nuclear weapons when we  have not been attacked with nuclear weapons. That is immoral. That is  wrong. It must be the policy of our country that we will not do that.    If it is true what Ronald Reagan said--that a ``nuclear war cannot be  won and must never be fought''--then surely we should agree to shelve  Donald Trump's new sea-based warfighting nuclear weapons.   We could play Russian roulette with our future or we can adopt a  saner nuclear policy, one that says we do not need the rubble to bounce  over and over and over again to deter our adversaries and reassure our  allies; one, through the President's Nuclear Posture Review, that  rejects the military-industrial complex efforts to make the world safe  for nuclear weapons rather than from nuclear weapons.   In 2020, the amount of money that one of the five biggest defense  contractors received from the Pentagon--$75 billion--was nearly double  the entire development and diplomacy accounts at the State Department  and the U.S. Agency for Development.   As President Biden noted in Glasgow at the international climate  summit earlier this month, we have an obligation to help the developing  world leapfrog the fossil fuel economy to reach a green economy. Lower  and middle-income countries deserve to develop and seek a higher  standard of living, but we know that they can't use the dirty fuels  that powered our growth if we hope to keep global warming at 1.5  degrees Celsius. My climate amendment will help those countries least  to blame for the climate crisis to adapt to the impacts that they are  already overwhelmingly and disproportionately experiencing.   The first of its kind National Intelligence Estimate, released in  October, warned us that the intensity of wildfires and the force of  hurricane winds and unrelenting droughts are a mere preview of the  extreme weather events to come. The Pentagon's own report warns us of  the cascading security impacts if we fail to answer the national  security challenge of our generation: Governments that are unable to  meet the basic needs of their people risk collapse. Driven by the  climate crisis, water, food, and resource scarcity will lead millions  to flood across borders as stateless climate refugees. That will lead  to destabilization of countries. That will lead to national security  crises in country after country as a result of the climate crisis.   We have to just deal with the reality that the CO2 is  still red, white, and blue that is up there. We are the leader  historically, and the rest of the world wants us to be the leader  historically right now in dealing with that crisis.   My climate amendment says that we can avoid that grim future. We can  redirect a mere 1 percent from the Pentagon topline towards global  climate accounts to fight the climate crisis. We can come to grips with  the fact that the greatest adversary we face is not a foreign army,  navy, or air force; it is the transnational threats of the climate  crisis, of pandemics, and of nuclear weapons.   We are not in a new Cold War. We are in a war for our common  survival.   Yesterday, in an act of political gamesmanship, Senate Republicans  joined me to vote against moving forward with this abominable $768  billion Defense bill. While I wish we could stop here and reassess the  waste of three-quarters of a trillion dollars spent on defense, this  was, sadly, just a Republican ploy to add even more pork onto this  already fatty legislation.   Now, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Sanders' and my  amendment to return the defense budget to the level requested by the  President--a level of spending which is greater than we spent during  the Korean war, the Vietnam war, and at the height of the Cold War.   Additionally, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment--co- sponsored by Senators Warren, Padilla, Booker, Merkley, and Sanders--to  make a 1-percent cut to the Defense authorization to increase our  support for global climate accounts.   If we do not adopt these changes, I cannot, in good conscience,  support that budget. It is time we stop funding the military industrial  complex, whose profit is based in conflict and annihilation. That is  not an investment in our future; it is an invitation to destruction.   The bottom line is we are either going to live together or we are  going to die together; we are either going to know each other or we are  going to exterminate each other.   This is a period where we should be talking to our rivals. We should  be negotiating with our rivals. We should be trying to reduce the  nuclear arsenals. We should be trying to reduce the tension; reduce the  paranoia; reduce the threat that, by accident, we can actually fight a  nuclear war.   That is what we should be debating here and not just putting all of  the additional new weapons systems that have been on the blueprints of  the defense industry for a generation into this budget. That takes us  in the wrong direction, towards less safety, more risk.   The correct vote here is to deal with the reality that we have too  many nuclear weapons already and we haven't sufficiently dealt with the  threat which the climate crisis is going to  [[Page S8815]]  pose as a national security risk to our country and the rest of the  planet.
