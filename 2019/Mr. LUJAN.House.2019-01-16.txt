 Madam Speaker, New Mexicans are working tirelessly to  provide for their families. They do not have the luxury of ignoring  their bills until the President figures out what it takes to run a  government.   President Trump clearly does not understand the anxiety that comes  from choosing between a mortgage payment and gas in the tank or not  being able to pay your bills at the end of the month.   I have heard from many in my district who are hurting because of the  Trump shutdown, constituents like Andrea. Her family became a one- income household after her 4-year-old son was diagnosed with autism  spectrum disorder and epilepsy.   Her husband is a furloughed USDA employee. Because of her son's  medical needs, their family has already been living paycheck to  paycheck, and the shutdown immediately put them into survival mode.   The shutdown must end. Democrats have put multiple bipartisan plans  on the table to open the government. Madam Speaker, I implore Mitch  McConnell to let the Senate vote to end this shutdown for the hundreds  of thousands of families being hurt, families just like Andrea's.                            ____________________
