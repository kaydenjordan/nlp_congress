 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2115,  the ``Public Disclosure of Drug Discounts Act'' introduced from my  friend and colleague, Ms. Spanberger.   While I believe something must be done to bring down the cost of  drugs, I also know that unless we have a better view into the process  of how a patient's cost is calculated, we will continue to struggle to  address the problem. That's why I support this important piece of  legislation that requires PBMs to report on all the price concessions  and factors that contribute to determining the net cost of a drug.   PBMs play an important role in our healthcare system as the  intermediary negotiating drug prices in the current marketplace. But  only if we understand the actual cost of the drug can we ensure that  consumers are getting a fair shake. The bill before you today is  comprehensive, as it requires PBMs to report the amount of rebates,  discounts, direct and indirect remuneration fees, administrative fees,  and any other price concessions. The Secretary will make this  information available publicly in a way that aggregates the information  by class of a drug to protect the negotiation process but also provide  insight into any discrepancy between the negotiated drug's net cost and  the price a patient pays for that drug.   Addressing any healthcare problem requires a comprehensive approach.  There is no one entity that is solely responsible for the high cost of  drugs. We need transparency in our healthcare system. This bill had  bipartisan support throughout the Committee process and similar  measures have had support in the Senate. I am proud that we continue to  work on measures that will help address one of the most concerning  issues of our time, the exorbitant price of prescription drugs, and I  thank leadership for bringing this measure to the floor today.
