 Madam Speaker, my colleague from Virginia, on the other  side of the aisle, just gave my speech.   The USMCA is a very important document, a very important measure,  that we need to pass without delay. Our trade with Mexico and Canada,  our two most important trade partners in the world, needs to be secure  so that we can start doing more business with them.   It will be great for much in agriculture, our dairies, forestry, auto  parts, and California wine to have the stability of this. It will also  show the rest of the world that we are ready to do business and  negotiate better deals with Japan, China, and others.   Let's get this done. Let's not have the USMCA vote held up any longer  or have it become leverage for other things.   I ask Speaker Pelosi to please bring this to the floor because I  think we can get many votes on both sides of the aisle and pass this  right away.                            ____________________
