 Madam President, today I wish to honor the  distinguished life and career of Anthony J. May, who passed away on  January 20, 2020.   Tony worked for more than 30 years as a political strategist and  journalist, leaving his mark on Pennsylvania politics. He used his deep  knowledge of Pennsylvania history to assist many in trying to find the  best way forward, including during his time as executive director of  the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. He served as the communications  director and press secretary for my father, Governor Robert P. Casey,  as well as press secretary for Governor Milton J, Shapp and as  communications director under House Speakers K. Leroy Irvis and James  J. Manderino. Most recently, he worked at Triad Strategies, a  communications and public relations firm in Harrisburg, as Partner  Emeritus.   Tony also served the public as a journalist and political analyst for  various newspapers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New Jersey, and as an  editor for the Associated Press. In these roles, in addition to being  past chair of the Pennsylvania Public Television Network, he worked  tirelessly to keep the public informed and to support journalists and  journalism wherever and whenever he could.   Tony was a legend in Pennsylvania for decades, and his legacy will be  felt for years to come. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife,  Betsy; his children, Crispin, Amy, and Cybele; his five grandchildren  and two great-grandchildren; and all of Tony's family and friends as  they mourn his loss.                            ____________________
