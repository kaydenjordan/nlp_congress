 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   At this time, I would like to include in the Record a number of  exhibits:   Exhibit A, in which under oath we had testimony that said the  Department of Justice did not want to be in the business of picking or  choosing organizations that may or may not receive any funding under an  agreement.   Yet, exhibit B, in which the number three at Department of Justice  under President Obama said, ``Can you explain to Tony the best way to  allocate money toward organizations of our choosing,'' in a $9 billion  settlement.   And in exhibit C, in which they specifically said they had concerns,  including not allowing Citibank to pick a statewide intermediary like  Pacific Legal Foundation that does conservative causes.                                 exhibit a         Chairman GOODLATTE. Well, let me just add that this       committee will not stand silent, nor will, I am sure, the       Financial Service Committee, and you can expect that this       will escalate if you do not provide the documentation that we       requested over 2 months ago.        Secondly, did anyone at the Department of Justice ever       consider the serious appearance of impropriety in requiring       banks to make available to activist organizations the lion's       share of funding that Congress has previously cut off to       them? That is one of the reasons why we want to see the       communications. We want to know what considerations went into       making this decision to take this action.         Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Poe).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If the minority has not gone through the discovery that we have, that  we placed in the Record, I will be glad to give Mr. Cicilline or anyone  else a copy.   I am just going to repeat, though, after receiving testimony that  they didn't pick winners and losers, what we are marking as exhibit B  and exhibit C make it clear they were, and specifically choosing, to  exclude a ``conservative group.''   I think the important things here, though, Mr. Chairman, are if they  want to have money in a settlement, such as the Deepwater Horizon  tragedy, they certainly could, as long as it directly provides aid to  the victims; which, of course, cleanup did. But when we look at these  others, one of the great things is if they want to put it into a  victim's fund as part of it, a government-controlled fund, they can if  they want.   If the Department of Justice wants specific authority the way they  do, for example, in water settlements, particularly related to Native  American Tribes, they offer a deal, they put one together, and, Mr.  Chairman, they come to Congress. This Congress, in the last Congress,  settled multiple longstanding disputes with Tribes. What is interesting  is they made sure the money went to those who had been harmed when they  came to Congress and said: Please codify this agreement.   But in the many agreements that seems to go on in the Obama  administration--and we now have the smoking gun of that--they made  political decisions. Making political decisions is why you have to put  this back in the light of day and with real congressional oversight.   What is amazing is, during the markup of this bill, there were a  number of Members of the other party who specifically talked about not  trusting the current occupant of the White House and the current  Attorney General. It baffles me that they would not want to take back  this authority knowing that the Department of Justice could bring to us  a request for a bill that would authorize a specific settlement that  could have outside groups or grant authority on a case-by-case basis.                                time  1530    The reality is the slush fund system has to stop. That is why  Chairman Goodlatte's bringing this bill today was so critical.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    It is majority. Yes, you have copies of it.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman asks for a colloquy.   Although I don't have them, I am sure they prove the same point: that  the light of day, the cleanliness of sunlight, and congressional  oversight and appropriation would have protected against the abuses the  gentleman is probably describing.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's points are good. I am afraid his  conclusion may be the part I have to differ slightly with, Mr.  Chairman.   The gentleman from Tennessee is right to note past and other  indiscretions. That is why we have this bill before you today. In fact,  it is why passage is so important.   We don't want to have anybody of either party--the current occupant  of the White House is from my party, a Republican. The current Attorney  General is from my party, a Republican and former Republican Senator.  The fact is that now is the time not to necessarily disparage any past  activity but to stop it.   We are not a body that is supposed to trust as much as we are a body  to have some trust and to verify. When we find wrongdoing, it is our  job to make sure it doesn't happen again. This bill, including the  comments of the gentleman from Tennessee, seeks to do that. I am  convinced that it is good for that reason, and it is even good for the  example that Mr. Cohen suggests.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to make sure I provide a little clarity.  We are not talking about leftwing, rightwing, or other groups who get  it. What we are talking about is a basic question of fungibility of  money.   If something has been done wrong and a judge or the Department of  Justice has X amount of determination of wrongdoing, the first question  is: How much of that money can get to the victims? In a perfect world,  the victims are made 100 percent whole. In a perfect world, 100 percent  of the money passes from the perpetrator to the victim.   The Department of Justice making a decision not to a left- or  rightwing group, but a political decision to give $1 million to the  Coast Guard, to their charitable foundation, was a decision that  clearly was not part of the mitigation but, rather, a general  charitable decision. That was $1 million that did not go to the victim,  did not go to the general Treasury, but it went to the whims of a  bureaucrat.   We seek to make sure that, if that is an appropriate action, they  come to Congress with that and not decide that charity begins with some  unelected individual in the Department of Justice.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute in short response.   Mr. Chairman, sometimes the obvious is missed in the debate. The  gentleman from Georgia talks about locking down power. Quite frankly,  Republicans do have a majority in the House and a slim majority in the  Senate, and the current occupant of the White House is from my party.  So when we are trying to reduce potential misconduct by the executive  branch, we are not doing it to take any money away.   As a matter of fact, this law would clearly cause more money to flow  from the same amount of initial payment, more money to flow to the  victims. So we are trying to flow more money to the victims. We are in  no way reducing any aspect of settlements other than, if the current  occupant of the White House, the President, and the Attorney General  want to give to the charity of their choice, they can either do it with  their own money or they can come to Congress for authority.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I want to take a moment to agree with the gentleman  from New Jersey. The idea that you can pay a fine to get out from  underneath criminal prosecution is one that I would like to see either  eclipsed to where it is almost invisible and rarely used or done away  with altogether. I would certainly agree to join with the gentleman in  finding further prohibitions to that practice.   It has been too often that a corporation able to pay large amounts of  money not only escapes its actions, but, of course, it escapes the  prosecution of key individuals who may, in some cases, be responsible  for the loss of life and/or health.   So I want to join with the gentleman from New Jersey. That is not  what this bill is about. It doesn't deal with it, nor does it fail to  deal with it. It is not the subject of the bill.   I urge the gentleman, who does agree with a portion of what we have  to say, to work with me. I will be happy to be his cosponsor on a piece  of legislation to try to curtail that practice.   Today, we are trying to curtail a practice in which we have examples  of both Republicans and Democrats in the Office of the Attorney  General, their justice departments, from making settlements that seem  to have political bias. And that is what we are here to stop.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentlewoman spoke quickly, and I know she had a lot of important  information there. Some of it simply was wrong.   One of them is that she touched on environmental cleanup. Very  clearly, nothing in this legislation would limit the cleanup related to  the wrongdoing or the damage. Not so. A third party could be hired to  do the cleanup.   Additionally, nothing stops a settlement from requiring a company to  have counseling or other mitigation. It simply stops the Department of  Justice from picking a charity of its choosing to go do it.   Now what I would really like the gentlewoman--who may not be on the  floor any longer--to understand is that the Department of Justice has  grant authority and does multiple grants every single month of the year  to some of the very same groups under its authority that these  settlements are going toward. Congress has allowed it a certain amount  of money to provide grants for general harm.   Additionally, every year, Congress allocates hundreds of millions of  dollars to some of the very same groups and efforts the gentlewoman  knows that we are talking about.   So, although her speech was quick, the thing that she said that may  have misled some people here in the Chamber I think needs to be  corrected. Direct harm will be mitigated. It can be done by anyone. A  company can agree and be forced under supervision to mitigate and to  hire people to help in that effort.   Very clearly, many of the groups being talked about here today  already receive money through the grant process or through direct  appropriation by Congress. That is the right way to do it. It is the  reason this is a bipartisan bill and this is an effort by our Congress  to make sure that we hold the reins of authority where they should be  under the Constitution.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, I am putting this sign up not for the people in the  Chamber, because people in the Chamber on the other side have continued  to read the same talking points from their leadership that says there  is no evidence.   This is in the record. This is a bigger part of it. So for the people  in their offices who will come down to vote, if there is not a motion  to recommit, they are not going to get an opportunity to see this.   So I hope that they will look just now and realize this is one of  those things you don't normally get. As Chairman Goodlatte said, this  is a smoking gun. This is a clear statement that an ideological bent  against a nonprofit was very specifically there, while other emails in  the same chain of emails shows that they were picking who they wanted.  [[Page H8118]]                                     time  1600    That is the politics that was going on. It is the politics we are  trying to prevent. As I said in my previous statement, the Department  of Justice is given a number of dollars for grant programs, and we may  not always agree with how those grant programs are run, but we give  them that.   Additionally, the Congress appropriates a tremendous amount of money,  much of it going to the same groups. A little over 1\1/2\ years ago, 2  years ago, this body came together on the reauthorization on Violence  Against Women, which has and will continue to do very good work in  exactly the area that people are talking about.   This is the reason we have legislation before us today. We have had  political activity that has been going on, according to the Democrats,  by Republican Attorneys General; according to this document, by the  last Attorneys General. The fact is, we need the legislation. We have  to have it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, in closing, I don't believe there is any question at  all but that the minority has missed the point. In no way, shape, or  form are we changing. We intend to make sure the Department of Justice  prosecutes wrongdoing, both criminal and civil.   The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) rightfully said we  shouldn't have money paid in lieu of criminal prosecution; it should be  both. I agree with him.   What we are dealing with here is a recognition that, under Republican  and Democratic administrations, we have had mandatory donations that,  in fact, went to charities, if you will, or organizations of the choice  of those political entities. The fact is what we are doing is reining  in--reining in--wrongdoing that is actual and has been observed,  nothing more.   One of the challenges we face every day and one of the reasons I am  imploring both sides to come together on this vote, one of the  challenges we face is how much of our obligation we have ceded to the  executive branch, often then only to be horrified when, behind closed  doors, unelected, unaccountable people make decisions that would never  be made on the House floor or the Senate floor, and this is one of  them.   We are scrutinized when we pick nonprofits to provide funding to on  the left, on the right, or, if there is such a thing left in America,  in the middle. We are scrutinized. But when we scrutinize the  Department of Justice's action, according to my colleagues, under  Republicans, there has been clear wrongdoing. According to the  documents that we put in the Record today and showed on the floor, in  the last administration, there was clear partisan politics.   We are simply saying, if they want to make that kind of a settlement,  bring it to Congress; otherwise, it is very clear that they must--and I  repeat, must--stop the action of taking money that would otherwise go  to the victims and moving it to nondescript third parties of their  choosing, no matter how benevolent they might be, including the Coast  Guard Foundation. It can't continue to happen. We have to have the  money that is in settlements flow to the victims or flow to the  Treasury.   Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
