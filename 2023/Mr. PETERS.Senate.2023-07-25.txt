 Madam President, I rise today to recognize the  100th anniversary of St. Clair County Community College, located in  Port Huron, MI, along the banks of the St. Clair River. St. Clair  County Community College serves Michigan's Blue Water Area as its  primary center for affordable higher education.   St. Clair County Community College was first established in 1923 by  the Michigan Board of Education. Originally named the Port Huron Junior  College, its purpose was to provide accessible higher education options  that met local community needs and contributed to Michigan's greater  success and vitality. The college officially changed its name to St.  Clair County Community College in 1967 but is more often know by the  moniker ``SC4.''   In the 100 years since its founding, St. Clair County Community  College has grown to offer over more than 25 on-campus and online  programs, as well as University Center partnerships that allow SC4  students to earn bachelor's and master's degrees on campus. While SC4's  inaugural class numbered just 34 students, today, the college supports  more than 5,000 students each year. With its main campus located in  Port Huron and additional learning centers located in Harbor Beach,  Algonac, Yale, Peck, and Croswell, St. Clair County Community College  serves a large portion of Michigan's Thumb region.   The St. Clair County Community College occupies 29-acres in downtown  Port Huron, placing students within the heart of the St. Clair  Community. Through the provision of accessible and life-changing  education, SC4 has added more than $137,700,000 to the economy of St.  Clair County and employs 2,041 local community members. This number  represents 1 of every 10 jobs within St. Clair County that are  supported by the operations of St. Clair County Community College's  faculty, staff, and students. In addition to providing  [[Page S3520]]  high quality student care, SC4 strives to support the taxpayers, local  businesses, and community of St. Clair County by hosting athletic  conferences, concerts, exhibits, and engaging St. Clair residents.  Alumni of St. Clair County Community College work as leaders in  education, healthcare, engineering, manufacturing, government, public  safety, hospitality, design retail, and more and through their presence  that enriches the St. Clair Community.   St. Clair County Community College has been an integral part of the  St. Clair and Blue Water community for more than 100 years. As a  Michigander and a proud representative of the Blue Water Area, I am  honored to ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this significant  milestone for St. Clair County Community College, its staff, faculty,  and students, as well as the entire St. Clair community. I wish St.  Clair County Community College continued growth and prosperity in the  years ahead.                            ____________________
