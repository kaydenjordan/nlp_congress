 Mr. Speaker, next week Americans across the country are  going to gather around their dinner tables and share what they are  thankful for.   I hope my Republican colleagues will use that moment to reflect on  how lucky they are to work with House Democrats.   I hope they are thankful for that time last June when the Republicans  were on the verge of driving us into an economic default and Democrats  stepped up, helped them out, and provided the votes needed to make sure  we didn't default.   I hope they are thankful for the time, 45 days ago, when they were  driving us to the edge of an economic shutdown and, once again,  Democrats stepped up, helped them out, and made sure we kept the  government open for the American people.   I hope they are thankful for that time this week when Democrats, once  again, had to be the adults in the room. We didn't throw any punches,  but made sure, even though the Republican majority couldn't pass the  new Speaker's stop-gap measure, we did, and we kept the government open  for a few more weeks.    This Thanksgiving, be thankful. Whatever you do, don't be that crazy  uncle who won't stop yapping about Hunter Biden.                            ____________________
