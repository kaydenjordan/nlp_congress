 Mr. Chair, I stand in support of my amendment to  increase funding for suicide prevention coordinators at the VA, and I  thank the chairwoman for her advocacy and good work on the larger bill.   Last Saturday, the new 988 national suicide prevention lifeline  launched. Now veterans in crisis can reach the veterans crisis line by  calling 988 and pressing 1.                                time  1215    This new number will allow more individuals to access help when they  need it the most, and it will save lives.   Due to this transition, the VA anticipates an increase in call  volume, as much as 2\1/2\ times higher than last year. We need to make  sure that there are enough professionals in place at the VA to handle  the uptick in caseloads--starting with suicide prevention coordinators.   Suicide prevention coordinators receive referrals from Veterans  Crisis Line callers, and remain in contact with high-risk veterans,  providing follow-up care and connecting them with resources within  their communities.   The 988 number is an important step in providing mental health care  to veterans in crisis. But it is our duty to ensure that there are  suicide prevention coordinators in place to care for those who have  borne the battle.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  Americans who represent the very best of our country and ensuring the  success of the new 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline for all  those who may need it.
