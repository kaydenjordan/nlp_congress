 Mr. Speaker, the Postal Service is a mess. Today, we are  about to take up a reform proposal that is long overdue.   Mail delivery in rural Vermont is critical for all our rural  communities. For our seniors who rely on getting their checks and  getting their prescriptions, and for Vermont businesses, from local  papers that provide news in our country stores, it is crucial.   Mismanagement, underfunding, labor shortages have really created a  crisis. Last January, my office received eight complaints. This  January, it was 69 complaints. And some Vermonters are going over a  week without getting any mail delivery. Our folks are going paycheck to  paycheck and not getting their paycheck.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will finally get the United States Postal  Service on track for our rural communities and all Americans. It is  overdue, and that is why I hope all of us will support passage today.                            ____________________
