 Reserving the right to object, first, let me thank the  Senator from Florida for doing such great work, along with Senator  Merkley and others, on this incredibly important piece of legislation.  We are going to be able in a few moments to speak together, Republicans  and Democrats, on our commitment to ending genocide in China.   I want to thank the Senator for working with me to make sure that, as  part of his unanimous consent request, we are going to be able to make  sure we have personnel in place to properly implement this policy. We  have dozens of State Department and Department of Defense nominees  pending on this floor--more so than we have ever had at the end of a  first-term, first-year Presidency--and we will, hopefully before we  leave--we have to, before we leave, make substantial progress on this  list in order to adequately protect our country.   At the very least, as we put forward this important new policy, it  does make sense to accompany it and its passage with three key  personnel who will be in charge of implementing it.   I believe we are going to be able to modify this request in the  following manner. I would formally ask Senator Rubio to modify this  request that he has made to include the following request.                         Unanimous Consent Agreement     I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII,  if applicable, at 4:30 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to the following  nominations: Executive Calendar No. 525, R. Nicholas Burns, of  Massachusetts, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of  the United States of America to the People's Republic of China;  Calendar No. 626, Ramin Toloui, of Iowa, to be an Assistant Secretary  of State (Economic and Business Affairs); and Calendar No. 619, Rashad  Hussain, of Virginia, to be Ambassador at Large for International  Religious Freedom; that there be 10 minutes for debate equally divided  in the usual form on the nominations en bloc; that upon the use or  yielding back of that time, the Senate vote without intervening action  or debate on the nominations in the order listed; that if the  nominations are confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; and that  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
