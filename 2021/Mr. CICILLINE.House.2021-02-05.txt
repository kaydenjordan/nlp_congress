 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation to ensure that America's workers  have every opportunity to get ahead. Apprenticeships are a great way  for hardworking folks to hone their trade or learn new skills and earn  a higher wage because of it.   In fact, graduates of registered apprenticeship programs enjoy an  average starting wage of $70,000. And 94 percent of graduates are  employed upon completion. Yet, less than 1 percent of the American  workforce have completed an apprenticeship. This disconnect  disadvantages our workers and puts us behind other industrialized  nations.   The National Apprenticeship Act will address this gap in our  workforce development system by providing for almost 1 million new  apprenticeship positions over 5 years. And here is the really important  part, it will generate $10.6 billion net benefit to taxpayers.   So it is great for workers, great for our economy, and great for  taxpayers. These investments will give our economy the booster shot it  needs to recover from COVID-19 while giving a new generation of workers  the skills they need to achieve their American Dream.   I know about this experience firsthand. In my State, the Laborers'  International Union of North America has created really a national  model for apprenticeship programs. It has improved the lives of  thousands and thousands of Rhode Islanders.   I include in the Record a letter of support from the Laborers'  International Union of North America.                                                           LiUNA,                                                   February 2, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: I write on behalf of the 500,000       hardworking men and women of the Laborers' International       Union of North America (LIUNA), to ask you to vote for H.R.       447, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021, when it comes       to the House floor for a vote this week. LIUNA is proud to       support this important Bill to keep our union apprenticeship       programs strong.        Registered Apprenticeship Programs, like the apprenticeship       programs which LIUNA has implemented for decades, help       workers earn while they learn. H.R. 447 invests more than       $3.5 billion over five        (5) years in expanding opportunities and access to       Registered Apprenticeship Programs and Pre-Apprenticeships       Programs, among others. The Bill creates nearly a million new       apprenticeship opportunities on top of the current expected       growth of the apprenticeship system. It would also yield       $10.6 billion in net benefits to U.S. taxpayers in the form       of increased worker productivity and decreased spending on       public-assistance programs and unemployment insurance. The       rigorous standards in the Bill ensure top-quality       apprenticeship programs for workers.        At a time when our Nation's infrastructure needs are so       great, H.R. 447 will ensure that we continue to train the       best workforce in the world.        Again, I ask that you vote in favor of this important Bill       on the House floor. If any additional information is needed,       please contact Danielle LeClair, Assistant Director,       Legislative Department.        With kind regards, I am            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terry O'Sullivan,                                                 General President.    Again, I just want to say in closing, Mr. Speaker,  that this is an opportunity to respond to the economic crisis that has  been created by the COVID pandemic. Give people the skills that they  need to become more successful and to earn greater wages. That is our  job, after all, to make life better for those who we represent. This is  an investment in the American worker. I urge all of my colleagues to  join us in supporting this excellent piece of legislation.
