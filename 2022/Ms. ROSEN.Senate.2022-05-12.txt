 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I am honored and humbled to congratulate  former Nevada Governor and U.S. Senator Richard Bryan on his retirement  last month from Fennemore Craig. A dedicated public servant and  champion for Nevada, Senator Bryan spent over half a century advocating  for others, serving in just about every position in government, from  the Nevada Senate to the Governor's mansion to the U.S. Senate.  Throughout his extensive and storied career, Senator Bryan always put  Nevadans first. As the person with the privilege to serve in his Senate  seat today, I think frequently about Senator Bryan's steady, unwavering  leadership, and his pragmatic approach to addressing issues that  mattered most to the people of Nevada.   To note only a few of Senator Bryan's incredible accomplishments  would be a disservice to his long history of achievements for the  public good, but I will do my best. As a young man, Senator Bryan  served his country in the U.S. Army, the Las Vegas community as a  prosecutor, and later Clark County as its first--and youngest--public  defender. Young Richard Bryan showed Nevada's youth that anything is  possible when you are dedicated and determined. Later, he served as  Nevada's 27th attorney general, and as Governor of Nevada, Senator  Bryan helped shape our State during a pivotal time in its history,  helping Nevada attract the best and brightest, inviting businesses of  all different sectors and sizes, to call Nevada home.   As a U.S. Senator for two terms, Senator Bryan never stopped fighting  to protect Nevada's natural beauty. He stood up for policies that  safeguarded our public lands, leading the charge for passage of the  Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act of 1998, which to this day  makes land and resources available for various public purposes to  better the communities in our State. I also want to recognize Senator  Bryan and the late Senator Harry Reid for being the leading voices in  the fight against Yucca Mountain, standing up for Nevadans and against  our State becoming the Nation's nuclear dumping ground. During his time  in the Senate, Senator Bryan also worked tirelessly to advance civil  rights, empower women in government, make our roads safer, and protect  consumers from fraud. As a senior member of the Senate Commerce  Committee, Senator Bryan was the lead sponsor of seven consumer  protection and highway safety bills that passed the Senate. And as  chair of the Senate Ethics Committee, Senator Bryan demonstrated his  commitment to the notion that public servants should fight for the  interests of their constituents, not their own interests.   Senator Bryan has been beloved his entire career--by his staff, by  his constituents, and by his late wife Bonnie, who was the light of his  life and stood by his side throughout Senator Bryan's public life,  serving Nevada with poise and grace. Those who worked for Senator Bryan  remember him as the kind of boss who made everyone feel like an  integral part of the team, from the chief of staff, down to new  interns. That is why they have stayed close with one another and with  him ever since Senator Bryan left the Senate in 2000.   Nevadans will forever be indebted to Senator Richard Bryan for his  many selfless years of public service. I, personally, will always be  grateful to Senator Bryan for his care, his compassion, and his  kindness, particularly when I first joined the Senate to restore the  Richard Bryan seat to a Democrat for the first time since he held it. I  will never forget Senator Bryan walking me down the center aisle of the  Senate Chamber, arm-in-arm, as I was sworn in to represent the people  of Nevada, just as he had done decades earlier. I know I am a better  Senator because of Senator Richard Bryan, I know we as a State and a  nation are better off for his tremendous efforts, and I wish him all  the best as he enters a well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
