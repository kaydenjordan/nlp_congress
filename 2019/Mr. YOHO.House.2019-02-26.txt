 Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr.  Biggs from Arizona, for yielding. This is such an important topic that  we are talking about, national debt.   I remember when I came to Congress in 2013, Admiral Mullen said that  the biggest threat to America is our national debt. Hillary Clinton,  Secretary of State at the time, said she agreed with that. One of the  few times I have agreed with Mrs. Clinton.   But national debt today is $22 trillion. When I came into Congress,  it was $14.5 trillion. When President Reagan left office, it was about  $2.5 trillion. It doesn't matter who is in the White House. Our debt is  going up until this body, Congress, addresses our debt.   If you do a pie chart of our debt, 71 percent of our debt is  mandatory spending, 29 percent is discretionary. Discretionary was  described to me as the money we have left over at the end of the month  after we pay all of our bills. That is discretionary.   The interesting thing is, in 1964, those numbers were reversed.  Mandatory spending was 29 percent, discretionary was 71 percent. So we  were a cash-rich Nation. We could do things. We could do a space  program. We could do the infrastructure bills that we did that this  Nation needed.   Today, that is flipped around to where 71 percent of every dollar  this government takes in is already spent. We don't vote on that in  Congress. Those are things that happen without us. The only things we  vote and we shut the government down on is that 29 percent.   If we do not address our mandatory spending, mandatory spending will  address us as a Nation.   I was on an interview, and they said, well, President Obama doesn't  want to mess with mandatory spending, which is Social Security,  Medicare, Medicaid, interest on our debt, retirement programs for our  Federal employees. And I reminded the interviewer, and they said this  about President Trump: He doesn't want to deal with mandatory spending.   I said: I understand that. But either this President or the next  President deals with mandatory spending or mandatory spending will  dictate to this Nation what we have to cut, and those are called  austerity measures.   All you have to do is look at Puerto Rico, Spain, Portugal, Greece,  where they had mandatory austerity measures where programs were cut,  and they were cut by other governments that controlled their debt.   Today, about 30 percent of our debt is controlled by foreign nations,  the other 70 percent, the American taxpayer owns, but it would be  tragic to allow us in this body to allow another nation to say: You  have got to get rid of that program.   That is unconscionable. It is irresponsible of us. And if we do not  deal with that debt, that debt will deal with us.   Madam Speaker, this is something I appreciate Mr. Biggs standing up  and having this Special Order on. This is something we talk about  repeatedly in our district. We have town halls on this.   When you look at the discretionary spending, that is the stuff that  runs all of government outside of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,  the retirement programs. That means the Department of Defense. That  means the Department of Education, Justice, the Department of Homeland  Security. All the research money that goes into our research  universities comes out of the discretionary funding of government.   I am telling you, as a Nation, if we do not address this, this Nation  will not survive, and history will repeat itself from great countries  that have lasted for a period of time. They have always come to a  demise, and it was because they haven't paid attention to the things  that are the very basic.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague for bringing this up. This  is something that repeatedly--if you look at this Congress, the  Democrats have been in charge of the House since January 2 or 3. We  don't have a budget. We haven't addressed anything dealing with debt.  But they have spent a lot of time dealing with President Trump and  trying to remove him from office and finding out reasons why he  shouldn't be the President. Madam Speaker, we as Americans need to come  together and deal with the debt, and I appreciate the gentleman's  efforts.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, because  I came here and they said: Well, don't worry about this, because this  will balance in 5 years or this will balance in 10 years.   And I laugh, but I shouldn't be laughing. We should be crying,  because here I am, 7 years, and guess what: It will balance in 10  years.   It will not balance. And, again, it is up to us, the Members of the  House and the Senate, because we control the purse strings. But we have  done a terrible job at it, and it goes back to leadership on both  sides.   This is something that should not be a partisan issue. This is  something that should be an American issue, because America is at stake  here. It is not a Republican Party or a Democratic Party. We don't  serve a party is what I tell people in my district, and I am sure you  do the same thing. I serve a Nation, and that Nation is the greatest  Nation on Earth. If we don't get our  [[Page H2226]]  fiscal house in order, this Nation will not be the Nation it is.   So, again, I don't think it will balance in 10 years. It won't  balance in 20 years unless we change the dynamics, and they need to  change now.    Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I rise today in opposition  of H.R. 1. This bill is nothing more than a thinly veiled attack on the  American voting system designed to allow Democrats to keep the majority  in the House of Representatives, and I will explain and illustrate.   As a Member of Congress, we have a responsibility to ensure that  every American vote is counted and protected, especially because our  democratic society relies on participation in the democratic process  through free and fair elections. While I support efforts to involve all  Americans in our electoral process, I cannot support this  unconstitutional legislation.   Madam Speaker, let me lay out for you some of the most absurd  provisions in this legislation.   H.R. 1 creates Federal Government subsidized elections. For the  people watching on C-SPAN, if they don't have insomnia, I want them to  hear that again. H.R. 1 creates Federal Government subsidized elections  through a 6-1 ratio for government matches to small donor contributions  for congressional or Presidential campaigns.   For the government to give matches--subsidized elections--that means  they are taking money from you to go to candidates, hopefully of your  choice, but not necessarily. So the donor contributions for  congressional or Presidential campaigns, which means for every $200 an  individual donates, the Federal Government will take $1,200 of the  American taxpayers' money and distribute it.   Additionally, H.R. 1 removes the checks our current voting system has  in place to ensure eligible voters are casting ballots by forcing  States to accept online and same-day voter registration. I don't think  that has ever happened before, where H.R. 1 removes the checks our  current voting system has in place to ensure only eligible voters are  casting vote ballots by forcing States to accept online and same-day  voter registration with no penalties for ineligible voters.   That means somebody could show up, an individual, and cast multiple  ballots or votes, or vote without meeting the current requirements, and  they will not be reprimanded. There is no recourse. Who is going to go  after somebody after they have already cast their vote and they weren't  an eligible  [[Page H2227]]  voter? Nobody will go after these people, so it can sway elections.  That is what H.R. 1 does.   By removing the consequences of illegal voting, this bill is, in  turn, encouraging it. It should be doing the opposite. The right and  privilege of us as American citizens to vote is something we should all  garner and protect as American citizens. And, again, this is not a  partisan issue, it is not Democrats or Republicans, this is an American  issue, and I think people would be incensed on all parties.   Additionally, this bill allows Federal employees to take 6 days of  paid leave to be poll workers. So the American taxpayers are going to  pay Federal workers to be poll watchers. This is something that has  always been done voluntarily by our precinct captains, both Republican  and Democrat, in our districts, where politics is always best locally.   But the Federal Government wants to intervene here and say: No, we  are going to give you guys 6 days off. How many people do you think,  that are Federal employees, will take 6 days off of paid leave?  Probably a lot, wouldn't you expect?   Madam Speaker, we pay our Federal employees to do the job they were  hired to do, not to be poll workers for our districts. That is  something that the American voting process has done for over 200 years  by volunteers that are passionate and care about this country.   In fact, Federal employees already receive paid leave that they can  take for any purpose they choose, including being poll workers. Why  should the Federal Government pay? And I want to reword that, because  it is not the Federal Government paying them. It is the American  taxpayers paying money out of their paycheck that goes to the Federal  Government that the Federal Government thinks they know better how to  spend that money than they do. So why should the Federal Government pay  to give them additional leave that can only be used for this purpose?   Madam Speaker, there are just three provisions outlined in this  almost 600-page bill, and I would venture most people will not read  this when it comes up for a vote. And while I can further elaborate, I  will let my colleagues share their thoughts with you.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Biggs. I appreciate his help.   I have got a top 10 list here--actually, it has turned into a top 11  list--of the 10 most egregious provisions of H.R. 1.   Again, I want to remind you that the Democrats took over at the  beginning of the year. We are $22 trillion in debt. And they will say:  Well, it is President Trump's fault. Well, we can say: It is President  Obama's fault. And they will say: Well, it is President Bush's fault.  And it can go all the way back to George Washington, I expect.   But the fact is it is a bipartisan issue that needs to be dealt with.  So the top 11 most egregious provisions of H.R. 1: It creates, again, a  6-1 government match to any small donor contribution of $200 or less in  a congressional or Presidential campaign, meaning for every $200 the  government will match $1,200.   So let's look at the facts. Where does that $1,200 come from? You go  to work, you get a paycheck at the end of the week, at the end of the  week you notice that you don't get paid your gross pay, you get paid  your net pay. The rest of the money comes to the government and the  government is going to use that money, when we are $22 trillion in  debt, and give out subsidies to support, hopefully, your candidate.  This has never happened before in our government, and we are at $22  trillion in debt. It does nothing to solve our national debt.                                time  2000    Number two on the list: Creates a new voucher pilot program--a pilot  program.   And I have to hand it to the Dems. They love programs that give out  moneys and grants, this voucher pilot program that grants eligible  voters a $25 voucher of hard-earned taxpayer dollars to donate to any  campaign of their choosing.   The Federal Government has no need to do this. Again, they are taking  money from people and using it for that which the government is not  mandated by our Constitution to do.   Number three: Authorizes an inappropriate use of Federal workers and  taxpayer dollars by granting Federal employees 6 days of paid vacation  to serve as poll watchers.   I would venture that come election day, the largest majority of  Federal employees for 6 days will be poll watchers and not running the  government. This is just bad policy.   Number four: Weakens the voting system of the American people by  increasing the election system's vulnerability and failing to implement  the necessary checks and balances regarding who is registering to vote.  H.R. 1 will force States to allow online voter registration, automatic  voter registration, and, I think the most dangerous and egregious,  same-day voter registration.   So that means I can show up in Florida, my home State, and I can  register to vote that day. I can drive to Georgia  [[Page H2228]]  and register to vote that day. I can go to Alabama, Louisiana, North  Carolina, South Carolina, and I can possibly vote in every one of those  States, because the driving distance, I could make that.   So I could vote in possibly seven or eight States as a single person  on the day of voting. Nobody could validate that. Yet the election gets  calculated and determined on those kinds of voting, and I don't think  that is what anybody wants.   I would hope, regardless of your political affiliation, you would  stand up to say this is wrong. We need to make sure these safeguards  are in place to protect that one very, I think, sacred, precious right  of all voters, of all American citizens, the right to vote.   Number five: Diminishes the process of election day voting by  expanding ``no excuse'' absentee voting and allowing for eligible  voters to be able to cast their ballot by mail with no additional  safeguards to this process.   That means provisional ballots that get sent in, their signature  can't be questioned. It doesn't need to be questioned. It doesn't have  to be the correct signature, but it will be counted as a vote.   I would think a party that put that in place would be afraid of that,  because it really weakens the democratic process we go through as a  constitutional republic.   Number six: Disregards State voter identification laws by allowing  sworn statements to be used in place of identification and allowing for  signature verification, which can be submitted through a photo if the  voter registers online.   Let me read that again.   Disregards State voter identification laws by allowing sworn  statements to be used in place of identification and allowing for  signature verification, which can be submitted through a photo if the  voter registers online.   Now, think about that. I can't get on an airplane without a picture  ID. I can't purchase medication, over-the-counter cold medication with  phenylephrine in it, without a picture ID, but we are going to allow  people to vote without a picture ID just by signing an affidavit saying  I am who I say I am. And, again, that won't be verified until after the  election.   It has fraud written all over it, and I think it is unconscionable  that the Democrats would even consider such a thing on something that  we hold so sacred in this Nation, that we brag about and we boast about  in the world as being the longest serving democracy in the world using  a democratic process in a constitutional republic, that we are going to  allow such shoddy type of verification.   Again, it is unconscionable that they would even consider bringing  this up.   Number seven: Fails to criminalize fraudulent registrations.   Fails to criminalize fraudulent registrations. We have people going  to jail because they have lied to the FBI. We have George Papadopoulos  who lied to the FBI, and he went to prison for 14 days. But I can lie  and not be who I say I am, and I can vote on this Democratic bill, H.R.  1, and I have no recourse against me. There is no consequence for me  being a liar.   And I just think a party that wants to have those kinds of policies  in place as a whole needs to look in the mirror and say: What are we  trying to do?   Number eight: Impedes States' ability to determine their registration  and voting practices as protected under Article I, Section 4 of the  Constitution and violates separation of powers by Congress mandating  ethics standards for the Supreme Court. H.R. 1 is a constitutional  overreach.   Number eight: Impedes States' ability to determine their registration  voting practices as protected, as I said, under Article I, Section 4.   Number nine: Violates constitutional rights under the First Amendment  by prohibiting any false statements relating to Federal elections,  including time, manner, place, qualifications of candidates, or  endorsements of candidates enforced by a partisan FEC, which is the  Federal Elections Committee.   Number 10: Empowers trial attorneys by establishing private rights of  action by allowing candidates to litigate their way to victory.   We saw this in the last Presidential election. We saw this in the  last gubernatorial election in my State of Florida. We saw this in the  senatorial race in Florida, where people were going to sue, and they  didn't have the legality of doing that, but this bill would allow that.    And I think one of the largest grievances for H.R. 1 that all people  ought to be upset with is that it mandates voter registration--mandates  voter registration. What that means is the Federal Government says you  must register to vote.   I agree, we should all register to vote, but can the government  mandate you?   We tried this with the Affordable Care Act that the Democrats ran  through in a partisan manner in this Chamber, no Republican support,  mandated that people had to buy a product even if they didn't want  that.   Madam Speaker, that is wrong, and that is why that part got struck  down, the individual mandate got struck down, as it should have,  because the Federal Government was saying: If you don't do what we say,  we are going to fine you.   You know, that sounds like China. China does that. They have their  good citizen score, the Orwellian good citizen score that they monitor  what you do, and if you don't do it, you don't get the prizes of the  Chinese Government. Are we turning into that, mandating voters to  register?   Last Congress, I chaired the Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation  Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs. And it was amazing because I got to  travel to countries around the world that have just started free and  open elections in a Western, democratic style. It pains me to see these  countries with a new democracy where 95 percent to 98 percent of the  people show up.   If you look at Iraq or Afghanistan, they are walking around with the  purple finger at risk of their lives, because for once in their life  they had an opportunity to vote, to vote for somebody that they wanted  in power--a foreign concept to them. Yet in this country, we want to  take that away from people.   As we continue on, there are some myths on H.R. 1.   It has been designed to fund, elect, and maintain Democratic  majority, and I want the American people to know that. The Democrats  introduced this 571-page package of Democratic priorities without  allowing for input from Republican Members or going through the  standard House Committee.   This is something that they railed against us. All the 6 years I have  been in Congress, they have railed against us about no open process,  yet they come out with a 571-page package of Democratic priorities  without allowing for input from one Republican
