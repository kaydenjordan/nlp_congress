 Mr. President, last fall I had the honor to stand in this  Chamber and deliver remarks on the subject of a great and growing  concern to me--the stewardship of our democracy at the hands of the  most powerful figure in our government. I stand again today to sound  the same alarm.   Words matter. Have we arrived at such a place of numb acceptance that  we have nothing to say when the President of the United States casually  suggests that those who choose not to stand or applaud his speech are  guilty of treason? I certainly hope not.   The one who levels such a charge knows neither the meaning of  ``treason'' nor the power that the words of a President carry. If we  are numb to such words, then we will surely regret that we failed to  defend our colleagues in Congress against such a vile remark, but our  silence will also mark the day we failed to recognize that this conduct  in an American President simply is not normal.   I wish I could stand here today and say my words of last October have  been proven wrong; that I had been unfair to inveigh against the daily  sundering of our country; that I had been mistaken about the personal  attacks; that I had exaggerated the threats against principles,  freedoms, and institutions, the flagrant disregard for truth and  decency, and the reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and  most personal reasons, reasons that have nothing whatsoever to do with  the fortunes of the people we have all been elected to serve--I wish I  could say I had been wrong, but I cannot.   I have seen the President's most ardent defenders use the now-weary  argument that the President's comments were meant as a joke, just  sarcasm, only tongue in cheek, but treason is not a punch line.   The President said the State of the Union Address was meant to  promote and encourage unity in government. Then why, less than a week  later, follow up with this divisive and harmful rhetoric? Unity is not  secured in a speech. It must be pursued constantly through appropriate  behavior, mutual respect, and gained by effective leadership. Respect  is earned, not commanded. Applause signals approval of an idea, not  loyalty to one's country.   Our Democratic colleagues love this country as much as we do. To  suggest otherwise is simply unconscionable. None of us in Congress  pledge loyalty or service to the President. This is not a royal court.  Our oath is to the Constitution and to the people. As Members of  Congress, we must never accept undignified discourse as normal because  of the requirements of tribal party politics.   None of this behavior should ever be regarded as normal. We must  never allow ourselves to lapse into thinking this is just the way  things are now.   We will get through this period, and when we do, we will look back at  the destruction of our discourse and the attacks on our democratic  values as nothing but a tragedy. May we also be able to say they were  an aberration. That, my colleagues, is up to us. We must recognize this  is aberrant, destructive behavior, whatever rationale its defenders may  offer, and we must never shrink from opposing it, for it is in opposing  this behavior that we defend our norms, our ideals, and our values. It  is in opposing this behavior that we stand for decency.   Thank you.  [[Page S630]]    I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven).
