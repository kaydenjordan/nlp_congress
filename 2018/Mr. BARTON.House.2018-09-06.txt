 Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4606.   I want to compliment Congressman Johnson for his leadership and,  also, on the Democratic side, Congressman Cuellar. I don't know if he  is in the room. I compliment him for being an original cosponsor. I am  kicking myself that I am not an original sponsor. I don't know how that  happened, but I am proud of them.   This is a straightforward bill, Madam Chair. It simply says, as long  as you are below a certain threshold, 0.14 BCF a day, you still have to  file an application with the Department of Energy to export natural  gas, but it shall be in order to be approved. So you still have to  apply, but it is specific in the law that the answer will be ``yes'' as  long as it is below this threshold.   You might think: Well, that is not very much. Why even bother?   Well, we still want to make sure that we know where it is going, so  that is a good reason to do it. And the good news is that there is a  market for small-scale LNG, certainly our partners in the Caribbean and  South America. And who knows, if this works, maybe we can increase the  number later on if we make sure that we don't do any environmental  damage.   This is a good piece of legislation. I am proud that it is  bipartisan. I hope that, when we pass it, it will be taken up very  quickly in the other body and the President will sign it. I am strongly  supportive, and I urge a ``yea'' vote.
