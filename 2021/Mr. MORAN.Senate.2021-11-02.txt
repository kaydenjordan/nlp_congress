 Mr. President, thank you for recognizing me. I rise this  afternoon based upon an announcement earlier today. I rise in the  memory of former Kansas Congressman Dennis Moore, a man who lived a  life of service to our Nation. He was a friend, and I am sad to hear of  his passing today.   Dennis, above all, was a kind man. He was a loving husband to his  wife Stephene and a doting father and grandfather.   He was born in Anthony, KS, and went on to earn degrees from the  University of Kansas and then Washburn University School of Law. He  served our country with the U.S. Army Reserve and then Kansas for 12  years as the Johnson County district attorney. He was known for  integrity and for a strong moral compass, which he carried with him to  the Halls of Congress when elected in 1998.   Dennis's approach to politics was one-on-one, person-to-person, and  oftentimes with his iconic guitar not too far out of his reach. It was  this personal approach that paved the way for him to be the first  Democratic Member of Congress from Kansas elected in that district in  37 years. As the Kansas City Star headlined today in their memorial to  him, ``Strumming a guitar instead of flinging mud''--doesn't that sound  good?--``Strumming a guitar instead of flinging mud, Dennis Moore  changed Kansas voters' minds.''   He was a six-term Member, and in many ways, we spent those 6 years  working together. He and I shared that period of time, and I have great  respect for him and the way he served the people of the Third District  of Kansas.   That respect for him only grew when I witnessed the way he and his  wife Stephene faced his battle with Alzheimer's with a determination to  use their experience to help others. They made a choice to make this  private and devastating diagnosis public because they knew it would  bring awareness to the realities of the disease.   Especially after his diagnosis and for as long as he was able, Dennis  was a tireless advocate for the Alzheimer's Association. In 2018, I was  humbled to receive an inaugural award in his name, the Dennis Moore  Alzheimer Champion Award, from the Alzheimer's Association of Central  and Western Kansas.   He was vocal about what he went through and sincere in his urging for  others having memory problems to see their doctor. In his free time, he  still kept himself busy strumming his guitar at senior centers.   One area where we always agreed was the need to invest in finding a  cure for Alzheimer's, and in 2014, Dennis shared his experience with  this harrowing disease in front of my Senate Health Appropriations  Subcommittee colleagues.   The executive director of the Kansas Alzheimer's Association, Fe  Vorderlandwehr, had this to say about Dennis:         After Congressman Moore was diagnosed with Alzheimer's       disease, he became a fierce advocate for the Alzheimer's       Association, championing the need for an increase in       Alzheimer's research with the NIH. He became the face of the       disease amongst his former colleagues in Congress as he       testified about his battle with Alzheimer's and the need for       research to keep other families from going through what he       was going through. Through it all, he kept a wonderful sense       of humor and his passion for music.    I leave you with the Congressman's own words, and he said this:         Alzheimer's is a bipartisan issue, and I urge my former       colleagues to unite behind it, allotting the necessary       resources to fight a public health crisis that millions of       families just like mine are facing.    Dennis was a genuine, warm, decent man who lived an inspiring life  that we can all learn from. His legacy will be the way in which he gave  others battling Alzheimer's both courage and hope.   Robba and I extend our heartfelt condolences to his children and  grandchildren and to Stephanie, his wife, and to all of those who knew  him.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to  3 minutes.    Mr. President, last week, I was on the floor expressing my  concern about things that I heard while home, and the odd thing seemed  to be that they were things that I would never expect to be true. And  [[Page S7591]]  often that has been the case over the years. You hear something from a  constituent or read in the paper or see on the internet, and it is  like, this can't be true.   And the one that stands out to me this week is this intention by the  Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human  Services to pay up to $450,000 per person of families who illegally  crossed our border and were detained separately.   This is an absurd policy decision. It gives greater incentives for  people to come to the United States and make that dangerous trek to our  border. How can it be fair to our law-abiding American citizens?   This is a situation that makes no sense to me. And it is something  that the Biden administration ought to immediately reject as out of  bounds for commonsense and good judgment and, certainly, something that  is damaging to the ability for us to have a lawful, sovereign border,  and something that is very damaging to the citizens of this country but  also to those who make the humanitarian challenge of traveling through  Central America and Mexico to our sponsor border.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
