 Mr. Speaker, as we approach  Thanksgiving 2017, I am thankful for the change since election 2016 and  the positive success of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike  Pence to cut taxes to create jobs.   In the House, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, there have been records set  on productivity. As of this week, there have been 458 bills passed out  of committee, more than the last five administrations; 407 bills passed  out of the House, more than the last five administrations; and 82 bills  signed by the President. There is progress for limited government and  expanded freedom.   President Trump has also restored trust in America as a beacon for  freedom with his strong friendship with Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu of Israel, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, and President  Emmanuel Macron of France. He has championed liberty with 50 Muslim  nations in Saudi Arabia, with stunning tributes in Warsaw and with the  National Assembly in Seoul this week.   President Trump's success in creating jobs is clear with the Dow  Jones, achieving 50 new highs and soaring. Consumer confidence is at a  record high, establishing 261,000 new jobs in October alone.   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never  forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
