 Mr. Speaker, our justice system has been biased:  slavery; the Trail of Tears; blankets laced with smallpox; Jim Crow  laws; and, recently, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. Justice has never  been just for everyone, but only for some people.   The barriers that have long blocked many people from achieving the  American Dream have been revealed most recently under the knees of  police. The racism in our system is long-lasting, and change is long  overdue. That is why I support the Justice in Policing Act.   This bill is a beacon of hope to victims of the systemic racism that  plagues our criminal justice system. This bill envisions a new model of  public safety that works to end racial bias; promotes de-escalation  training instead of militarization; and is built on community trust,  transparency, and accountability.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this historic bill.
