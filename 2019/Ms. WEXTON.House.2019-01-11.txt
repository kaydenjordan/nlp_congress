 Madam Speaker, today is payday for Federal workers, but  instead of receiving a paycheck, many, including thousands of my  constituents, will be going without.   I had a visit from a constituent yesterday who is an air traffic  controller at Washington Center in Leesburg, Virginia, one of the  busiest air traffic control centers in the Nation. She worked 80 hours  over the past 2 weeks and received a paycheck for zero dollars. You  can't pay your mortgage with zero dollars. You can't buy groceries with  zero dollars. You can't pay your medical bills or fill up your gas tank  with zero dollars.   Madam Speaker, Federal employees want to go back to work. They  believe in their mission and want to provide quality services for the  American people. They shouldn't have to sell off their belongings or  return their children's Christmas presents just to make ends meet. They  shouldn't have to wonder how they are going to survive.   Our national parks are filling up with trash. Many TSA security  screeners can't afford to commute to work. The FDA is not inspecting  our food supply.   Our hardworking Federal employees are doing their jobs. It is time  for President Trump and Senator McConnell to do theirs.                            ____________________
