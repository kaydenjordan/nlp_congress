 Madam Speaker, thus far, I have released five  transcripts from the Committee on the Judiciary's investigation into  apparent wrongdoing at the FBI and the Justice Department. Today, I am  releasing the sixth.   The American people deserve transparency. They deserve to know what  transpired at the highest levels of the FBI and at the origin of the  probe into President Trump's campaign.   Madam Speaker, I include the link www.dougcollins.house.gov/priestap  in the Record so the American people can review the transcripts of Bill  Priestap's interview.   Out of an abundance of caution, this transcript has a limited number  of narrowly tailored redactions related only to confidential sources  and methods, nonpublic information about ongoing investigations, and  nonmaterial personal information.   I will continue to work to release as many transcripts as possible.  The American people deserve the truth.                            ____________________
