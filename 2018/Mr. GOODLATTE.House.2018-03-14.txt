Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4909, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 4909, the STOP  School Violence Act of 2018. Violence at our schools makes students  feel vulnerable in a place where they should feel comfortable to learn,  grow, and be happy.   To curb violence at our Nation's schools, the STOP School Violence  Act provides a multilayered approach to identify threats and prevent  violence from taking place on school grounds.   It provides much-needed resources to train students, teachers, and  law enforcement officers on how to recognize and quickly respond to  warning signs, and provides funding for technology to keep schools  safe.   Eighty percent of school shooters told someone of their violent plans  or exhibited warning signs. The bill before us today will ensure that  students,  [[Page H1560]]  teachers, and law enforcement will learn how to identify at-risk  behaviors, properly assess threats, and intervene appropriately before  a tragedy strikes.   The STOP School Violence Act provides funding for training to prevent  student violence against others and self, including training for local  law enforcement officers, school personnel, and students.   Prevention training gives students and school personnel the ability  to recognize and respond quickly to warning signs of school violence  and includes active shooter training.   The bill provides funding for technology and equipment to improve  school security and prevent attacks. This includes the development and  operation of anonymous reporting systems, such as mobile apps, a  hotline, and a website. Funding may also be used for metal detectors,  locks, lighting, and other technologies to keep schools safe.   The bill also supports the acquisition and installation of technology  for expedited notification of local law enforcement during an  emergency.   The legislation also contains funding for school threat assessment  and crisis intervention teams so that school personnel can respond to  threats before they materialize.   Finally, the STOP School Violence Act provides funding to support law  enforcement coordination efforts and, in particular, those officers who  already staff schools.   The version of the bill before us today is the result of a  collaborative effort of many of my colleagues who worked with Mr.  Rutherford to incorporate many of their ideas.   I would like to point out the important contributions of  Representatives Susan Brooks, Coffman, Chabot, Granger, Rodney Davis,  Messer, and Bost, including many key elements of legislation that they  have introduced into this bill that have made the bill stronger.   Finally, I want to thank Mr. Rutherford and the bipartisan group of  cosponsors for their work on this important bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 4909.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford), a member of the Judiciary Committee and the  chief sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), who is a cosponsor of this legislation and  former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is a member of the Judiciary Committee and  chairman of the Small Business Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Comer).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I have one speaker remaining, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
