 Mr. Chairman, it is frustrating and egregious that this  amendment is actually necessary, but it is. The FDA has, thus far,  blatantly ignored congressional direction to respect the statutory  difference between distributing and dispensing of compound medications.   As a dentist and healthcare provider for more than 25 years, I can  tell you from my professional experience how harmful this overreaching  guidance from the FDA would be to patients. As a dentist, I often use  specialty compounded medications to deliver the customized care my  patients deserved. I relied on the expertise of my pharmacist  colleagues to ensure that medications were available to patients as  appropriate.   As a Congressman, I support this amendment to ensure FDA follows  congressional intent. As a doctor, I support this amendment because it  means better care for patients.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Georgia, and I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment--and that is doctor's orders.
