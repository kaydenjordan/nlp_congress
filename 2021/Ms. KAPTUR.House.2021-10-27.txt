 Madam Speaker, I thought I would like to place on the  record this afternoon the fact that very important negotiations are  going on on both sides of the Capitol relative to the infrastructure  bill and the Build Back Better bill, and I just wanted to point out to  all those who hear my voice that there is no one from the Great Lakes a  party to those dialogues with a major position in either Chamber.   I think it is really important to sensitize those who are in the room  that whatever they do, don't forget the industrial heartland of  America.   Our fine leaders in both parties come from both coasts and they come  from other regions of the country, but the industrial heartland is  notable by its absence in those in the rooms who are doing the  negotiation.   I know if we alert them to the fact that we exist and that we have  huge needs ranging from rail freight to seaborne commerce to industrial  revitalization--the list is very long--but I just wanted to point that  fact out. I know if my voice is heard by the administration and by  those in the respective committees they will respond accordingly.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to place these words  on the record.                            ____________________
