 Mr. President, yesterday's attack in Manhattan was  sickening, twisted, and heartbreaking. The suspect appears to have been  inspired by ISIL. We know that in the days ahead, our intelligence  community will make every effort to learn more about him and whether he  had any connection to this terror group and its hateful ideology. But  today we are thinking of everyone affected by this tragedy. We are  praying for the victims and their families. We are thinking of our  fellow Americans in New York. We are expressing our gratitude for the  critical work of our first responders. To them we say: Thank you for  your courage. Thank you for all you do, especially in the face of such  a terrible tragedy like we witnessed yesterday.                            ____________________     Mr. President, after 8 years of sluggish growth and  missed opportunities for the middle class under 8 years of the Obama  administration, the American people elected a new President and  Congress dedicated to getting our country moving again after so many  years of failed leftwing policies. We are working hard on joint  legislative initiatives on tax reform.   We have also undertaken what has been described as ``the most  ambitious regulatory rollback since Reagan.'' The administration has  the ability to take serious action on its own, and it has. The Congress  has taken important action many times as well. We have used the tools  contained in the Congressional Review Act, which allows us to overturn  certain regulations with a majority vote in Congress and the  President's signature. The President signed all of the many CRA  resolutions we passed already, which overturned regulations that  threatened everything from job creation to economic growth.   The President will sign another CRA resolution today, one that will  overturn a regulation that threatened to drive up costs for millions of  Americans who carry a credit card. It is a regulation dreamed up by a  government agency, the CFPB, that claims to protect consumers but seems  to have found a way to actually harm them. The Treasury Department  released a study showing how this regulation has little to do with  consumer protection and everything to do with lining the pockets of  trial lawyers. This unaccountable agency ignored that study and issued  its regulation anyway.   We passed this Congressional Review Act resolution to protect  consumers from wrongdoing while avoiding frivolous lawsuits that will  only drive up costs for the millions of Americans who have a credit  card. The CFPB continues to be one of the most unaccountable  bureaucracies in Washington, and this Congress will continue to stand  up for consumers even when the CFPB will not.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday, when the Senate confirmed  the nomination of Professor Amy Barrett to the Seventh Circuit Court of  Appeals, we took another important step to ensure that the Federal  judiciary fulfills its role in our constitutional system. Now we have  an opportunity to confirm another well-qualified woman to the bench,  Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen. President Trump nominated  her to serve on the Sixth Circuit, and she will be a strong addition to  that court and a benefit to our Nation.   After graduating first in her class from Northwestern's law school,  Justice Larsen served as a law clerk for Judge David Sentelle of the DC  Circuit Court and then for Justice Antonin Scalia. These clerkships  honed Justice Larsen's legal abilities and respect for  [[Page S6938]]  the rule of law, preparing her for a distinguished career.   Joan Larsen also served as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in  the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. Former government  officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations wrote in  strong support of her nomination, each of them holding her in the  highest regard.   Joan Larsen later joined the law faculty at the University of  Michigan, teaching there for many years. She excelled in academia,  earning the praise of her students and the esteem of her colleagues. In  fact, more than 30 of Michigan's deans and law professors wrote to  support her nomination. They wrote that Justice Larsen's ``commitment  to the rule of law and her capacity for top-flight legal analysis are  both of the first order, and her personal integrity and decency are  exceptional.'' Even when they disagreed, her colleagues praised Justice  Larsen's generous manner, her personal integrity, as well as her legal  acumen.   In 2015, Larsen was appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court. The next  year, she won election to a full term, winning every single county in  the State. Her fellow justices--even those with different ideologies-- praised her intellect and her commitment to apply the law as it is  written to every case before them.   Joan Larsen's time on the Michigan high court has shown a record of  independence and of fairness. Here is how one practitioner put it in a  letter to the Judiciary Committee: ``I am not a Republican,'' he wrote.  ``Justice Larsen approaches cases with an open mind and an independence  from party affiliation. . . . I believe that . . . Justice Larsen has  had a very positive influence on the Michigan Supreme Court. In my  view, she would be a deserving addition to the Sixth Circuit Court of  Appeals.''   Another lawyer wrote the committee, advising that he ``has practiced  law in Michigan for 39 years'' and is ``a past president of the  Michigan Association for Justice (formerly the Michigan Trial Lawyers  Association).'' He goes on to say that Justice Larsen ``has  demonstrated on the bench that she is precisely who she is in person, a  genuine, thoughtful individual who respects precedent, the common law  and the role that lawyers and judges play in society. . . . I have no  hesitation in telling you that Justice Larsen will make an excellent  judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.''   In conclusion, President Trump continues to nominate smart, well- qualified, and impartial individuals to our Nation's Federal courts.  Justice Larsen, like each of the other nominees before her, was  nominated on the basis of her belief in the rule of law and her  commitment to apply the law fairly to everyone who enters her  courtroom.   Once again, I would also like to thank Chairman Chuck Grassley for  his leadership on the Judiciary Committee, tirelessly working to bring  the President's nominees to the floor.   I look forward to voting to confirm Joan Larsen today, and I urge all  of my colleagues to join me.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, that at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, November 2,  there be 30 minutes of postcloture time remaining on the Eid  nomination, equally divided between the leaders or their designees;  that following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote  on the confirmation of the Eid nomination; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Brig. Gen.  Steven P. Bullard of the Kentucky Air National Guard as he begins his  retirement after more than three decades of achievement, service, and  sacrifice. This Nation and the Commonwealth of Kentucky thank him for  his diligence in defending our safety and security.   Brigadier General Bullard has served as the chief of staff,  Headquarters, for the Kentucky Air National Guard and the deputy chief  of the Joint Staff, Joint Force Headquarters-Kentucky National Guard  since 2012. In these roles, he has been responsible for the guidance  and direction of more than 8,500 Army and Air Guardsman in my home  State. Brigadier General Bullard has skillfully carried out his  responsibilities in these positions, as well as the duties of his  civilian role as director of the division of administrative services  within the Kentucky Department of Military Affairs.   On numerous projects, he was the critical link between my office and  the Kentucky Guard. I know that many on my staff who have had the  privilege of interacting with him have appreciated Brigadier General  Bullard's dependability and talent, which I am told also extends to the  golf course.   Entering officer training school at Lackland Air Force Base in 1985,  Brigadier General Bullard took the first steps of his decorated  military career. He later achieved the rating of master navigator,  having completed more than 5,500 flight hours on various aircraft. Over  the years, Brigadier General Bullard flew missions in 75 countries,  including a deployment to Afghanistan during Operation Enduring  Freedom. One might think that, with such aviation skill, he would have  more luck traveling as a passenger on commercial air, but his  colleagues report that throughout his career, a number of commercial  flights he has traveled on have experienced weather or maintenance  delays resulting in numerous nights in the airport for the trained  airman.   Brigadier General Bullard has earned and been awarded numerous  military awards and decorations for his selfless service to the  Commonwealth and his Nation. These honors include the Bronze Star  Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal with two bronze oakleaf clusters,  the Air Medal with one bronze oakleaf cluster, and the Kentucky  Distinguished Service Medal. These awards are recognition of Brigadier  General Bullard's distinguished actions on behalf of our Nation and  Kentucky.   The men and women of Kentucky's National Guard serve a unique mission  in our Armed Forces. Their efforts to help fight our Nation's wars,  defend our homeland, provide relief from natural disasters, and  maintain critical State, Federal, and international partnerships in  support of our Nation's safety and security have demonstrated the vital  nature of the National Guard's service. I am proud to represent them in  the U.S. Senate, and I am grateful for their sacrifice on behalf of our  Commonwealth and our Nation.   As we celebrate Brigadier General Bullard's retirement, we are also  saddened to lose such a capable and dedicated public servant. In  addition to his responsibilities at headquarters, Brigadier General  Bullard has also worked as the chairman of the Louisville Armed Forces  Committee, two terms as the president of the National Guard Association  of Kentucky, and as the volunteer executive director of the Kentucky  Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. On behalf of  the people of Kentucky, I would like to thank him for his 32 years of  achievement and service. He has earned a relaxing retirement, spending  time with his family and friends. Finally, I would ask my colleagues in  the Senate to join me in paying tribute to Brigadier General Bullard, a  brave American, a selfless public servant, and a proud Kentuckian.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 320, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, November 2; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the Eid nomination under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:37 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, November 2, 2017, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
