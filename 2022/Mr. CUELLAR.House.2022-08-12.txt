 Madam Speaker, I would like to clarify for any of my  colleagues who might be concerned that these three offshore  [[Page H7702]]  lease sales provided through the Inflation Reduction Act are somehow  being rushed through or will be conducted with insufficient  administrative process. That is simply not the case.   These sales were scheduled under the Obama Administration under the  2017-2022 five-year plan. That Interior department subjected the plan  to a large programmatic environmental impact statement. They then  underwent a multi-sale EIS. These sales then also went through a  supplemental EIS. Thus, the idea that any further process should be  required is just not credible and that is why the bill requires them to  occur by a date certain.   It is in our national interest to do so as quickly as possible so  that the energy crisis does not become even worse and so that the fuel  and revenue these sales will generate can find their way into our  economy sooner than later.
