 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 79 and  stand shoulder to shoulder with women to demand gender equality and  justice.   When I think about the future of our country and what I want it to  look like for young women and girls like my granddaughter, Anna, I  envision a just and equitable society with fair play, diverse  leadership, and equal access to basic healthcare rights. That is why  the equal rights amendment is necessary.   For too long our country's structural barriers have cast a shadow  over women's rights. With 38 States having affirmed their support for  the ERA, we are one step closer to shattering those barriers.   This resolution negates misguided arguments that because it is an  arbitrary deadline, the equal rights amendment is effectively dead. It  is clear from the recent actions of Nevada, Illinois, and Virginia, and  our collective voices, it is still very much alive, and we will not  rest until it is ingrained in the most sacred document of our Nation's  history.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with our country's women  and support our right to constitutional equality.
