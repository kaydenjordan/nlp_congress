 Madam Speaker, this is a time of unprecedented  opportunity to rebuild our highways and roads as well as harden our  utilities and infrastructure.   I was delighted to welcome Chairmen Peterson and DeFazio, along with  members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and  the Agriculture Committee to the U.S. Virgin Islands.   Members were able to meet with FEMA officials to discuss the  territory's disaster recovery progress and objectives regarding  housing, power, education, and project obligations and formulation.   The delegations toured the hospital, the Arthur Richards School,  Alexander Henderson School, as well as the STEP home.   Members of the Agriculture Committee, with local farmers, officials,  and USDA representatives, discussed challenges and opportunities for  agriculture in the Virgin Islands. They also visited the U.S. Virgin  Islands Agriculture Fair, which is the largest in the Caribbean. They  saw firsthand the diversity of agriculture in the Virgin Islands and  the resourcefulness of farmers to supply the growing demand for local  and regional products.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful to the committee members for coming. I  am looking forward to working with them. My staff and I are committed  to continuing to work with Chairmen DeFazio and Peterson to ensure that  the future of local farmers, highways, and infrastructure are  guaranteed all the resources needed.                            ____________________
