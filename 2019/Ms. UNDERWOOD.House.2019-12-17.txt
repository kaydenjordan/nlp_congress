 Mr. Speaker, our country's Founders created  impeachment so that no President could place themselves above the law,  a crucial constitutional check of power that ensures our country's  security and values are protected against corruption and foreign  influence in our elections.   As I have weighed this solemn decision, I have listened to our  community, examined important testimony and evidence, and studied the  drafted articles.   The President has demonstrated a pattern of corrupt behavior and  abused his power for his own personal political gain when he pressured  foreign leaders to conduct investigations against political rivals,  jeopardizing our country's national security and the integrity of our  elections.   The testimony and evidence put forth led me to a clear conclusion: In  order to uphold my sworn oath, I must vote to protect the Constitution  and will vote in support of the Articles of Impeachment.
