 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to reopen the  Federal Government and end this destructive Trump shutdown. For 25 days  now, the Trump shutdown has inflicted financial pain and anxiety on  families, businesses, and entire communities across the United States.   This week, I spoke with a room full of these victims. Aviation safety  experts detailed for me how the Trump shutdown has eroded an air travel  system that, for now, is safe, but they are growing worried and  concerned.   I heard from Federal workers who told me that the changes to tax laws  ushered in during the Republican tax scam have left citizens scrambling  for answers, yet workers are not there who can shepherd them through  those changes.                                time  1230    A local leader who represents domestic violence shelters warned me,  if the Trump shutdown drags on, as many as a third of the Florida  facilities that women count on for refuge when they are victims of  domestic violence could find themselves cutting services.   Democrats in the House have done our job. We have passed half a dozen  bills to reopen the government, yet Senate Republicans have decided to  hide behind President Trump and his border boondoggle refusing to take  ``yes'' for an answer that could end this irresponsible shutdown.   While they are busy bowing to the President, Senate Republicans  recklessly ignore that public safety is at stake. They downplay, and  even dismiss, that 800,000 families are now living without a paycheck  today.   Businesses, farmers, veterans, restaurant workers, domestic violence  victims, and many more are all feeling real pain from this unnecessary  shutdown. We need to do our jobs. We need to work together and actually  be the coequal branch of government that the Constitution describes.   So today, House Democrats will do just that and give Senate  Republicans another option to get us out of this latest Trump trap and  offer this bill that would reopen all closed Federal agencies through  February 1. This bill would allow time for us to negotiate border  security and immigration reform, but without inflicting further  economic harm on our families and our businesses. It is the smart,  reasonable, and compassionate thing to do.   I ask my colleagues to pass this bill into law without delay.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge Congress to pass the Inspector  General Access Act of 2019. This act, I am pleased to underscore,  enjoys broad bipartisan support from this body now and has in the past,  but its approval is more urgent now.   The actions, for example, of former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta have  drawn intense scrutiny since new revelations surrounding a plea deal he  offered to a serial pedophile came to light.   Based on newly reported documents and a group of brave women who came  forward to share their stories, it appears that Acosta gave a  sweetheart deal to a wealthy and well-connected sex offender and hid it  from his victims, some of whom were still in the midst of coming  forward.   Acosta is now the U.S. Secretary of Labor, a position that handles  workplace harassment and sex trafficking policies, yet he has refused  to discuss the new allegations. This IG Access Act would explicitly  allow the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General to  investigate allegations of such alleged misconduct.   It is a power that the IG office--as has been pointed out by both the  chair and ranking member here, it is a power that the IG office already  has when it comes to investigating allegations made against any of the  DOJ's many law enforcement agents, from the Federal Bureau of  Investigation to the U.S. Marshals Service.   This act has received broad bipartisan support, both in successive  Congresses and from the Government Accountability Office, but because  of an unusual carve-out, the DOJ's inspector general is believed to be,  as the ranking member said, the only Federal agency that has no  explicit power to review the conduct of its own attorneys.   If professional misconduct was involved in Acosta's handling of  Jeffrey Epstein's plea deal, potentially dozens of victims of this  connected multimillionaire have a right to know. Acosta's seemingly  unethical decision to drastically reduce the criminal penalties against  this vile sexual predator and to shield his other coconspirators is  simply unacceptable.   The American people and the victims of these horrific crimes deserve  to know why justice was not served in this disturbing case, and the  lack of transparency still cloaking it is deeply disturbing.   Giving the DOJ's inspector general more explicit and independent  power to pull back the cloak of secrecy on Acosta's sweetheart deal  goes to the heart of transparency and accountability that this office  stands for and that this bill would insist upon.
