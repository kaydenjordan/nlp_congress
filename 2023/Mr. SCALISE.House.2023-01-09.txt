(h) The Speaker may recognize a Member for the reading of       the Constitution on any legislative day through February 28,       2023.     (During the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that the resolution be considered as read and printed in the  Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the chairman of the Committee on  Rules, and ask unanimous consent that he be permitted to control the  time.    Mr. Speaker, again, thank my friend from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we are here to discuss the rules of the House, actually  to debate the rules package. Why this is so important is because this  lays out the ability for the House to conduct business, for the House  to not only conduct business, but for the House to address the problems  that the American people across this country face.   Let's just be very clear up front. We saw a lot of debate about this  last week. At the heart of all of the discussions last week was very  clear, surely from our side, that Washington is broken. Not just is  Washington broken, but the way that this House has been running for the  last few years has not been designed to address the problems of the  people across this country.   In fact, we have seen many of the problems that families are facing  across America created by the things that have come out of this  Congress signed by President Biden. Why is inflation running away?  Because spending is out of control, because bills appear by dark of  night, bills that nobody has read that are thousands of pages long,  where Members aren't even allowed to give input in committee or on the  floor to address problems they know their constituents will face if  these bills pass. Yet, the bills are passed because they are written in  rooms behind closed doors by a small number of people, not concerned  about the consequences that will affect so many millions of people  across this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, for a long time, we have been saying this needs to  change. In fact, we ran on an agenda to change the way that Washington  works, to fix this broken system, to get our country back on track, and  we were awarded the majority by the people across this country. Today  starts that process of fixing what is broken in Washington so that  Washington can finally start working for the people of this country who  are struggling.   Let's start with one basic thing: reopening the people's House. For  years, the American people were shut out of coming and seeing their  government work. In fact, with proxy voting, which, by the way, ends in  this rules package, Members of Congress have to show up and work again.   Just look at the bill that passed a few weeks ago, the omnibus  spending bill, $1.7 trillion, mostly borrowed from countries like  China. You look at all the things that had absolutely nothing to do  with the general operations of government that were thrown in that.   Now, you can start looking at it today, but you surely couldn't look  it the day of the vote because very few people had an opportunity to  read it, over 4,000 pages dumped by dark of night, right before the  vote. Yes, a majority of this Congress voted by proxy on that bill.  They weren't even here showing up to vote.   You know what? Americans all across the country have to show up to  vote. They have to go to their worksite. They can't work remotely. In  fact, Congress doesn't work virtually. It is just not set up that way.  Yet, that is what we have seen the last 2 years; committees that don't  even meet in person. There are some committees that haven't had an in- person hearing for 2 years.   We end that practice in this rules package, where committees actually  have to get to work again, not only meeting in person but in some cases  going out into the field, going into the real world, places like the  border between United States and Mexico, where, yes, despite the  President's  [[Page H61]]  claim, there is a crisis at the border. We have been talking about it  for a long time. We have been trying to bring legislation, but that  legislation has been rejected by a top-down structure.   This rules package changes that so we can finally start bringing  bills to the floor to address things like the border crisis, to finally  start addressing inflation and runaway spending. If a Member of  Congress has an idea and they want to bring an amendment to the floor,  for so long they were shut out of that ability. We had a bill that was  over $4 trillion in spending and taxes that was brought through  multiple committees in Congress, and not one amendment was allowed to  be brought forward and passed. In fact, even the majority was told in  the committees: Don't allow a single amendment to pass on a bill  dealing with trillions of dollars in taxes and spending that is  crushing families across America.   Let's make Congress work for families again. Let's empower Members of  Congress to be able to represent their constituents. We were all  elected by, on average, about 750,000 people. For too long, each of the  Members of Congress, Republican or Democrat, were denied the ability in  so many different ways because the rules were structured to shut their  ability down from representing their districts unless they were in a  leadership position. That has to change, and under this rules package,  that finally does change.   Let's make this Congress work for the people who sent us here. We  are, after all, the people's House. It is about time we start acting  like it. Let's pass this rules package, get to work addressing the  needs of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this important piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during the  118th Congress, the Speaker, majority leader, and minority leader be  authorized to accept resignations and to make appointments authorized  by law or by the House.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during the  118th Congress, all Members be permitted to extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material within the permitted limit in that section  of the Record entitled ``Extensions of Remarks.''    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during the  first session of the 118th Congress:   (1) on legislative days of Monday or Tuesday when the House convenes  pursuant to House Resolution 6, the House shall convene 2 hours earlier  than the time otherwise established by the resolution for the purpose  of conducting morning-hour debate;   (2) on legislative days of Wednesday or Thursday when the House  convenes pursuant to House Resolution 6, the House shall convene 2  hours earlier than the time otherwise established by the resolution for  the purpose of conducting morning-hour debate;   (3) when the House convenes pursuant to an order other than House  Resolution 6, the House shall convene for the purpose of conducting  morning-hour debate only as prescribed by such order;   (4) the time for morning-hour debate shall be allocated equally  between the parties and may not continue beyond 10 minutes before the  hour appointed for the resumption of the session of the House; and   (5) the form of proceeding for morning-hour debate shall be as  follows:   (a) the prayer by the Chaplain, the approval of the Journal, and the  Pledge of Allegiance to the flag shall be postponed until resumption of  the session of the House;   (b) initial and subsequent recognitions for debate shall alternate  between the parties;   (c) recognition shall be conferred by the Speaker only pursuant to  lists submitted by the majority leader and by the minority leader;   (d) no Member may address the House for longer than 5 minutes, except  the majority leader, the minority leader, or the minority whip;   (e) no legislative business shall be in order except the filing of  privileged reports; and   (f) following morning-hour debate, the Chair shall declare a recess  pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I until the time appointed for the  resumption of the session of the House; and   (6) the Speaker may dispense with morning-hour debate upon receipt of  a notification described in clause 12(c) of rule I, or upon a change in  reconvening pursuant to clause 12(e) of rule I, and notify Members  accordingly.
