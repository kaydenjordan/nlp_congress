 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Crystal Gaddo of Gallatin County for her excellence in  public service.   Crystal serves as a registered nurse at the Bozeman VA Community  Based Outpatient Clinic. A veteran herself, Crystal spent 8 years as a  Medic in the U.S. Army.   She is an exemplary employee at the VA. In her role as a registered  nurse, Crystal was nominated for the Daisy Awards for excellent  performance twice. Crystal has also recruited and mentored other nurses  to help fill critical positions in the VA system. In addition, Crystal  participated in multiple committees to better serve our veterans and  support nursing practices.   In October of 2019, Crystal was flying to Atlanta for a training,  when one of the passengers began to choke. She quickly stepped into  action and saved his life. Because of her swift actions, the passenger  was able to walk off the plane harm-free.   I thank Crystal for her service to our country and her service to the  veterans of Bozeman. It is my distinct honor to recognize her character  and life of service as a shining example of the best Montana has to  offer.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today the Senate passed disastrous  legislation that I opposed, which increases spending by $322 billion  with few offsets and suspends the debt limit for 2 years with  absolutely no reforms to bring fiscal sanity to Washington. According  to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2029, the net interest on our  debt will near $1 trillion. The cost of our debt is a pending crisis  but current rules for scoring the cost of legislative proposals do not  tell the full story, like how much the bills will increase the debt and  the subsequent cost of interest on that debt. This bill would require  that information be included, which in turn would increase transparency  for taxpayers, who will eventually foot the bill for this reckless  spending. I urge my colleagues to join me in this commonsense proposal.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today the Senate passed disastrous  legislation that I opposed, which increases spending by $322 billion  with few offsets and suspends the debt limit for 2 years with  absolutely no reforms to bring fiscal sanity to Washington.
