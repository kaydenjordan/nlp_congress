 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution  because I want every single person in my district to know that not only  are they part of the squad, but they are--we are all here to stay. I  want them to know that they belong; that we see and hear them loud and  clear.   Mr. Speaker, I am more proud today than ever to be the daughter of  Palestinian immigrants; to be the first in my family to graduate high  school and, later, college; to have grown up in the city that birthed  movements that fought and won against racism and inequality in our  country. It is a city that taught me to never back down; to speak up  when I see injustice, and one that elected the first of two Muslim  women serving in the United States Congress.   This resolution chooses all of us. It chooses you. It chooses those  who are marginalized and, more importantly, it chooses the values that  we all must live up to.   We cannot allow anyone, especially the President of the United  States, to erode our core American values. I urge my colleagues to  please choose our country, choose the American people, and to support  this resolution.
