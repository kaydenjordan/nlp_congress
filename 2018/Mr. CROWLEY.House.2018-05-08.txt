 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges  of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   Whereas, the tradition of the House Chaplain dates to the earliest  days of the House of Representatives, beginning in 1789;   Whereas, the role of House Chaplain has been filled by 60 individuals  of various religious denominations, serving Members of Congress of all  faiths;   Whereas, Father Patrick Conroy has served honorably as House Chaplain  since May 25, 2011, when he was appointed by then-Speaker John A.  Boehner in consultation with Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi;   Whereas, Father Conroy had been re-appointed and elected by the House  of Representatives on three separate occasions, most recently January  3, 2017;   Whereas, on April 16, 2018, the Nation's first Jesuit--and only the  second Catholic--Chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives  submitted his resignation before the full House;   Whereas, the Chaplain had only eight months remaining in his term of  service to the House;   Whereas, this resignation was requested by the office of Paul D.  Ryan, Speaker of the House of Representatives;   Whereas, the Speaker's office said ``. . . the decision (to remove  the Chaplain) was his (Speaker Ryan's);''   Whereas, on May 3, 2018, Father Conroy submitted a letter retracting  and rescinding his resignation, which was accepted by Speaker Ryan;   Whereas, despite the Speaker's statement accepting this retraction  letter, a number of Members of Congress remain concerned about what  motivated the original request for Father Conroy to resign and the lack  of adequate notification or explanation given to Members;   Whereas, the rights of Members of the House of Representatives were  undermined when the leader of one party made a unilateral decision to  ask for the resignation of the Chaplain;   Whereas, this resignation and the circumstances behind it has  compromised the integrity and the dignity of the House of  Representatives by politicizing the office of the House Chaplain;   Resolved, that there is hereby established a select committee to  investigate the circumstances around the resignation of the House  Chaplain;   The select committee shall be comprised of six members, of which  three shall be appointed by the chair of the Committee on Ethics and  three by the ranking member of the Committee on Ethics;   The select committee shall investigate the motivations and actions  that led to the resignation of the Chaplain, including the decisions to  remove the Chaplain and the process by which Members of Congress were  notified of the resignation;   The select committee shall provide a report to the House by July 13,  2018.    Mr. Speaker, I do.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, is this motion privileged?    Mr. Speaker, I am asking on the underlying resolution  before you, is it a privileged resolution?    Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, could the House consider this motion  immediately? The gentleman from New York requests: Can the House  consider this motion immediately?    Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.    Will the Chair rule as to whether or not the House could  consider this motion immediately?    Mr. Speaker, one more further parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, the vote to table that you are speaking of  will prevent this measure from coming to the floor today immediately.  Is that not true?    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 223,  nays 182, not voting 23, as follows:                               [Roll No. 172]                                 YEAS--223       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Curtis      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
