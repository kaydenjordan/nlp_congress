 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning, the hot Sun rose on a tent  city 20 miles outside El Paso, TX. That tent city stands as a makeshift  detention facility to house children who have crossed our border and  have been separated from their parents. This tent city, I would  suggest, is hopefully a temporary monument to modern-day American  cruelty.   Across South Texas, so-called tender age shelters have sprung up to  house very young children, even infants, who have been taken from their  parents in an act that pediatricians, psychologists, and frankly anyone  who has raised a child themselves know is the most traumatizing and  upsetting thing you can do to a young child, which is to take them away  from their parents by force, with no understanding of what is happening  or expectation of when they will be reunited.   This morning, thousands of children woke up to the voices of  strangers in strange places and started another day in  institutionalized, fenced-in confinement. This is happening in our  Nation.   I have heard from dozens--hundreds of Delawareans by every means they  could communicate with me, and I am sure my colleagues have also heard  from hundreds or thousands of their constituents, as we, as a nation,  have been haunted by the sounds and images of vulnerable children  crying out for help.   On one hand, I think this is a simple issue of right and wrong, but  on the other, this issue, like so many others that affect us in the  Senate, has been complicated by politics and by rhetoric and by  statements, frankly, meant to mislead.   The American people, though, I think deserve clarity about what has  been happening along our southern border in recent weeks and what its  impacts have been and may be to families, to children, and to parents  who have crossed our border. So let's be clear about what is happening.   President Trump and his administration created--created--a  humanitarian crisis by adopting a so-called zero tolerance policy to  compel prosecution of all who cross our southern border, many of whom  are people fleeing unspeakable violence in their home countries in  Central America. Then the President and leaders in his administration  excused or even misled people about this policy--this cruel policy--in  a variety of different, conflicting, and, frankly, at times, even  absurd ways in the past week.   Administration officials claim they didn't actually have this policy  or claimed they were compelled to do this by a nonexistent law or  claimed their policy was a deterrent to prevent people from seeking  asylum in the United States.   Regardless of the explanations given, the American people spoke  clearly and forcefully over the past week and said the President's  policy was unacceptable. They said this treatment of children was an  un-American tragedy that should not continue.  [[Page S4326]]    Under that sustained pressure from the American people, our President  relented and yesterday signed an Executive order, but even then he has  only created new problems with the Executive order he just issued.   As a Senator and as a person of faith, my own public service is  closely tied to the values taught to me by my Christian faith and by my  parents. I know many of my colleagues with whom I have spoken, on both  sides of the aisle, feel the same way. We have to ask ourselves as  parents, as people of faith: How can we stomach the human suffering of  a child being ripped from his mother's arms and that intentional,  willful child abuse being imposed to make that child a hostage or a  bargaining chip in our long-running and unresolved conflicts here about  immigration policy? How can we tolerate even one father being left in  torment, searching for his baby or child, not knowing where they are or  even if he will ever see them again, and having that torment imposed as  a tool of policy, and how can we stomach multiplying those individual  tragedies by 2,342?   By my count, since May, 2,342 children have been forcibly separated  from their parents after crossing our border. In just 6 weeks, 2,342  lives have been changed in ways that will have lasting consequences.   Now, the President has issued the Executive order that he claims will  end this separation of families, but that Executive order is seriously  flawed and will create as many problems and questions as it seeks to  address. Of course, it doesn't change the fact that this policy, this  zero tolerance policy, has already inflicted trauma and suffering for  thousands of families and children. I think it creates a new  humanitarian challenge, a new humanitarian crisis, because the  consequences of this new Executive order will be to detain entire  families in what may well prove to be ill-equipped tent cities.   This policy does nothing to clarify what will become of the more than  2,300 children already separated from their families, some of whom have  been lost track of by the agencies responsible for them.   We live in the world's most powerful and prosperous Nation, but I am  afraid we are watching, day after day, the way in which the  administration has chosen to treat children, through their indefinite  detention or separation from their parents, in a way that will have  lasting and negative consequences for our human rights record.    As a nation, we were founded as an idea, a place to which people came  fleeing persecution, fleeing countries in collapse or authoritarian  regimes, and seeking a brighter, newer future in this country. I think  we are being dishonest or shortsighted about our own family's history  if any one of us stands and says that none of our ancestors came here-- none of our ancestors came here seeking relief from oppression or  outside the legal mechanisms of the time. I think we are forgetting our  family's history if we say: Today we must close our border absolutely  and prevent anyone seeking asylum from coming to our country.   Frankly, I have struggled as leaders in this administration have  chosen to cite Scripture and to use their faith as an explanation or  justification for why this zero tolerance policy was required.   Our Attorney General, a former colleague of mine, someone whose  knowledge of Scripture I know to be thorough, cited Paul's Epistle to  the Romans to justify this policy. In fact, I think it is specifically  Romans 13:1 through 5.   He said Romans 13 requires us ``to obey the laws of the government  because God has ordained the government for His purposes.''   I, too, am somewhat familiar--in a passing way--with Scripture. I try  to read my Bible daily, and, with all due respect, I disagree with  Attorney General Sessions's reading.   In Paul's letter to the Romans, he says, just before Romans 13--in  Romans 12, and then just a little later in Romans 13--so if you just  read a few verses on either side, I think the message is clear: We are  urged to share with the Lord's people in need; we are urged to live in  harmony with one another, and we are reminded most pointedly later on  in Romans 13 that love is the fulfillment of the law and that ``love  thy neighbor'' is the greatest Commandment of all.   If there is one common theme, not just in this epistle but in the  Gospel, it is that Jesus radically opened His heart and His preaching  to those considered outcasts and ordinary and marginalized in His  society in His time. With whom did He spend His time? Outstanding  citizens? Respected leaders? No, with prostitutes, with tax collectors,  with lepers, with Samaritans, with the others, and with the outcasts.   I just ask those who heard what Attorney General Sessions had to say  and who thought it was the right answer to rethink whether this  strained and cramped reading of Paul's letter is truly a faithful  reading.   Romans 13 does, indeed, instruct us to follow the law and to respect  those in authority, but I will say this particular passage--and it is  being misquoted in order to support oppression--has a long and storied  history.   It was cited by Tories in this country who opposed those who stood up  for freedom in the American Revolution. It was cited by slaveholders  who opposed abolition in the runup to the Civil War. I heard it cited  by those who defended the Apartheid regime in South Africa.   Yes, it does teach us to obey the law and respect the law. It does  teach us that God ordains those in authority, but it does not mean we  should simply accept unjust and inhumane laws and the abuses that flow  from them. As a person of faith, I simply cannot accept the current  policies for the treatment of those who cross our borders seeking  asylum and refuge in our Nation.    In the last few days, as I have heard on my television and social  media, the sounds of crying children and the images of children being  kept in what certainly looked to me to be little more than cages, I  have been thinking about something written by one of America's most  famous former slaves, Frederick Douglass--a man who spent much of his  life in this very city and who wrote about the consequences on the  oppressor of cruelty.   In his book, ``My Bondage and My Freedom,'' he recounted his life as  a slave, and he wrote about the brutalizing impact of slavery on the  people of faith who tolerated it. I think his words bear briefly  repeating today. He said at one point in that book:         The mistress of the house was a model of affection and       tenderness. Her fervent piety and watchful uprightness made       it impossible to see her without thinking and feeling--``that       woman is a Christian.'' There was no sorrow nor suffering for       which she had not a tear, and there was no innocent joy for       which she had not a smile. She had bread for the hungry,       clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner that       came within her reach.    Frederick Douglass goes on to say:         Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these       excellent qualities, and [slavery soon proved its ability to       divest] her home of its early happiness. Conscience cannot       stand much violence. Once thoroughly broken down, who is he       that can repair the damage?    I think we should reflect, as people of conscience motivated to  public service, in many cases by a shared faith, about our  responsibility to speak up for the values upon which our Republic was  founded and through which it has been improved.   When we promote humanity, kindness, love, tolerance, and openness, we  advance our Nation. I have been heartened by the calls I have heard  from across my State and country by people of many different  backgrounds, many different faith traditions, many different political  views. I am reminded of that passage of Frederick Douglass of the harm  it causes us to be a part of a nation that imposes such a cruel and  thoughtless policy and turns away and fails to look at it and fails to  step forward and fails to change it. I am encouraged by what change  there has been so far, but I will remind those listening that we must  redouble our efforts.   Let me quote just a few. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops  called forceful family separation ``immoral'' and ``contrary to our  Catholic values.'' The Holy Father, Pope Francis himself, expressed his  agreement with that opinion, saying he is on the side of the bishops  conference in this debate.   Rev. Franklin Graham, one of President Trump's most ardent defenders,  called this policy ``disgraceful'' and said: ``It's terrible to see  families ripped apart and I don't support that one bit.''  [[Page S4327]]    A personal friend of mine, Rev. Jim Wallis, of Sojourners, has worked  with a broad group from across faith leadership, from the evangelical  community to the Protestant community, to put together a group that  goes by reclaiming Jesus and to post online an important statement that  speaks to how across so many different faith traditions this practice,  this policy of forcibly separating children--and now a subsequent  policy of family detention--speaks ill of all of us.   Christians, Jews, Muslims, humanists, people of all traditions have  been calling on our President to end this treatment of fellow human  beings. I have heard from colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, from  all over this country, their voices of concern. So it is my hope that  we will refuse to tolerate this; that we as a body will take a stand;  and that we as a nation will urge our President and this administration  to adopt new, more humane policies for people crossing our border and  seeking refuge in this country; and that we will support bipartisan  legislation to fix our broken immigration laws. It is only by the  action and leadership of this administration that we have gotten into  this space; it is only by their action and leadership that we can get  out of it.   I pray it is not too late for us to restore this Nation's reputation  as a country that welcomes those seeking refuge from around the world.  I will continue to pray every day for our President, for our Senators,  for our Nation, for its values, and for our ability to stand up for the  treatment of children in distress.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
