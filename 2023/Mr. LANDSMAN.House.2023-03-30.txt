 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of my  favorite people and a Cincinnati radio icon, Lincoln Ware.   For 50 years now, across southwest Ohio, folks have listened to  Lincoln Ware. From deejaying aboard the USS Midway as a marine to WCIN,  one of the oldest, Black radio stations in the country, to helping  ``The Buzz'' get off the ground with the very famous ``Lincoln Ware  Show'' to his talk show ``Cincinnati Issues'' on Star 64, Lincoln has  made an enormous impact on our city and region.   Off the airwaves, Lincoln is always out in the community. From  celebrations to protests, he is there. You can even join him as part of  his walking club at Winton Woods on Saturdays during the spring,  summer, and most of the fall.   He brings humor, wisdom, and clarity to thousands of Cincinnatians  every day. I thank Lincoln, and I congratulate him.                            ____________________
