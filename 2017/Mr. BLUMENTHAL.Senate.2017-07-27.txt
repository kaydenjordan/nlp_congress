 Mr. President, I had previously submitted to the  Record my intention to submit a motion to H.R. 1628 regarding the  Prevention and Public Health Fund. That motion was also supported by  Senator Nelson.    Mr. President, I had previously submitted to the  Record my intention to submit a motion to H.R. 1628 regarding the  Prevention and Public Health Fund. That motion was also supported by  Senator Nelson.    Mr. President, we are here at a historic moment, and  we listened to a historic speech just within the last 48 hours from our  colleague, Senator John McCain. All of us welcomed him back and were  inspired and overjoyed by his return and then by his speech asking that  we go back to the regular order, that we have committee consideration  of a bill, with hearings and markup and the democratic process really  working.   What threatens us tonight is the democratic process being brought to  new lows.   If this bill is passed with the assurance that it won't go to  conference--and there are conservatives, and I could quote them.   Senator Lindsey Graham said earlier today:         There's increasing concern on my part and others that what       the House will do is take whatever we pass--the so called       ``skinny bill''--not take it to conference, go directly to       the House floor, vote on it, and that goes to the President's       desk with the argument, ``This is better than doing       nothing.'' Here's my response. The ``skinny bill'' as policy       is a disaster. The ``skinny bill'' as a replacement for       Obamacare is a fraud. The ``skinny bill'' is a vehicle to get       in conference to find a replacement. It is not a replacement       in and of itself. The policy is terrible because you       eliminate the individual and employer mandate which we all       want eliminated but we actually want to have an overall       solution to the problem of Obamacare, so you're going to have       increased premiums and most of Obamacare stays in place if       the ``skinny bill'' becomes law. Not only do we not replace       Obamacare, we politically own the collapse of healthcare. I'd       rather get out of the way and let it collapse than have a       half-assed approach where it is now our problem.    Senator John McCain said earlier today:         I'm not supportive of the legislation as it stands today. I       am in close consultation with Arizona governor over the so-      called ``skinny repeal.''    Senator Ron Johnson said earlier today:         Virtually nothing we're doing in these bills and the       proposal are addressing the problems and challenges and the       damage done to people.    We will see, in effect, a betrayal of our trust, and I say that very  seriously.   I hope this body will keep faith with our democracy and make sure  that a bill that is regarded as a bad bill--and rightly so because it  will eliminate insurance for 16 million people, it will raise premiums  by 20 percent in less than a year, it will drive up costs, and it will  bring down the number of people who are insured by catastrophic  numbers. We owe it to the American people to vote against this so- called skinny bill, which is really a sham repeal. It is a skeletal  version of TrumpCare 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0. We can do that.    With that, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from the  State of Delaware.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.
