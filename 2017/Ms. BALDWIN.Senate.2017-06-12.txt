 Madam President, I rise to recognize the first  anniversary of a horrific tragedy that shook this Nation. One year ago,  in the early morning hours of June 12, 2016, we all witnessed an  unthinkable act of hatred and terror at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando,  FL. It was Pride Month and Latin night, and dozens of gay, lesbian,  bisexual, and transgender people, along with friends and family, were  gathered simply to have fun in what should have been a place of  acceptance, affirmation, and safety. In a matter of moments, what  should have been a celebration turned into one of the worst mass  shootings in American history--a targeted act of terror and hate, an  attack on the freedoms we all hold dear. These 49 innocent people lost  their lives in this attack, and 53 others were wounded. Many, many  others bear the emotional scars.   This was not only a deadly act of domestic terrorism; it was a hate  crime--a crime that targeted victims because of who they were and was  designed not just to harm its victims but to terrorize everyone in the  community.   Last year, I came to the floor to read the names and tell the stories  of the victims of this massacre in Orlando, because we cannot and we  must not forget these men and women. Their stories need a voice. Today,  I rise again to remember the victims.   As I did 1 year ago, I come to the floor to ask my colleagues to find  the courage to stand up, speak out, and act to confront the rising tide  of hate crimes and discrimination in America. We must never forget the  victims of this hate crime, and we must honor them with action.   While the Pulse shooting was an unimaginable horror, it is, sadly,  far from the only act of violence that has been perpetrated out of  hatred. Even before June 12 of last year, we had seen an alarming  increase in reports of hate crimes against LGBTQ people but also  against racial and religious minorities and immigrants. In the  aftermath of a divisive election, we saw hundreds of documented  instances of discrimination, harassment, and even violence against  members of minority communities as well as increased hostility within  our Nation's schools. In this year alone, at least 11 transgender  people have been murdered, most of them women of color.   The fact is that many members of racial, ethnic, disability, and  religious minority communities, as well as LGBT people, live in very  real fear for their safety. They are scared, and it is  [[Page S3385]]  incumbent upon President Trump as our Nation's leader to demonstrate to  them and to all Americans that discrimination and violence against any  individual because of who he is, whom he loves, and how he worships  will not be tolerated in this country.   When I stood here last year, I called for a greater investment in the  Federal Government's effort to both try to prevent hate crimes and  fully investigate and prosecute them whenever they happen. After  President Trump took office, I was joined by a number of my Senate  colleagues in urging him and the Attorney General to support robust  funding for the Department of Justice's programs that combat bias- motivated crimes. I believe a documented increase in hate crimes  demands an increase in the resources that are committed to fighting  this problem. Yet the budget put forward by President Trump and  Attorney General Sessions seeks no increases. In fact, it proposes  cutting more than 100 staff from the Department of Justice's Civil  Rights Division.   This administration has failed to step up and speak out against this  disturbing trend across our country or to commit the resources  necessary to fight it.   Instead of showing the moral leadership our Nation needs in the face  of increasing hatred and division, President Trump and his  administration have taken steps to roll back our Nation's progress in  many areas, including progress for the LGBT community.   Rather than issue a proclamation recognizing Pride Month and  committing to address the many challenges still facing LGBT Americans,  President Trump recently issued an Executive order that could open the  door to discrimination with Federal taxpayer dollars.   Rather than stand up for transgender students facing bullying,  harassment, and discrimination, this administration rescinded guidance  to schools about the rights of those vulnerable young people under  Federal law.   Rather than building on the steps taken to better understand the  needs of LGBT people by simply counting us, the Trump administration  has walked back efforts to ask about LGBT Americans in Federal surveys  at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Census Bureau.   Simply put, President Trump has not lived up to his vow to be a  President for all Americans.   But where I come from, in Wisconsin, our State motto consists of one  word: ``Forward.'' I believe that no matter who is in the Oval Office,  our country must move in only one direction--forward.   Remember, while Pride Month is, of course, about celebration--of who  we are and of how far we have come--it is just as much about bravely  standing up and speaking out so that others will not feel compelled to  live in silence.   To the survivors of the Pulse shooting and the families and friends  of those who were murdered and who feel the wounds of this tragedy most  deeply, we hear your voices and we are inspired by your strength.   As a community, we have never been deterred by tragedy and will not  be now. One of the early leaders in our fight for equality was Harvey  Milk, and he was also struck down by violent hatred. Harvey Milk  famously said: ``Hope will never be silent.''   So today I rise to remind us of the power of hope in the face of  tragedy. We must continue to work to pass on to the next generation a  country that is more equal, not less. We must remain strong in fighting  any rollback of progress, large or small.   There is more work to be done to ensure that all Americans are  protected from hatred and discrimination, and the work toward full  equality for LGBTQ people and their families remains far from complete.   For myself and those who stand united this Pride Month, we are guided  by our uniquely American values. It is about freedom--the freedom to  realize our founding belief that all Americans are created equal under  the law. It is about fairness--whether gay, lesbian, bisexual, and  transgender Americans deserve to be treated just like their family  members, their friends, their neighbors, their fellow workers. It is  about opportunity--about whether every American gets to dream the same  dreams, chase the same ambitions, and have the same shot at success.   This is the promise of America, and we must fight to make sure we  keep it.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
