 Mr. President, yesterday I had the chance to come to the  floor and talk about the changes I have seen in the streams and rivers  in my home State of Oregon as we worked to clean them up, restore them  for wildlife, restore them for swimming, restore them for boating, and  restore them for drinking water, and how terrific it was to see this  occur.   We are now considering a parallel provision--a provision designed  really to protect the streams near intense mining zones. I had a chance  yesterday to go through the details of the regulation and how it made,  for example, the coal slurry ponds more secure so they wouldn't  rupture. As I pointed out, one ruptured and killed over 100 people and  injured more than 1,000 people, not to mention the damage it did to the  ecosystem for an extended length downstream. I talked about the toxic  chemicals that are leaching out of improperly developed piles, as they  are called. Today I want to share a few more of the stories of folks  who live in the area and how important it is for them.   Sam Needham, who lives near Appalachia, VA, talks about the changes  he has seen in rivers near his home since he moved there in 1978. Sam  said that when they first moved there, ``Callahan Creek that runs near  our house . . . was full of different kinds of fish. Now I don't see  any fish in the water. I wish it could be like it was in the 70's and  80's, but with all the runoff from sediment ponds and mines, I don't  think it will ever be like that again.'' Sam supports the stream  protection rule. He said: ``I would like to see regulations to protect  our waters and maybe one day be able to fish in Callahan Creek again.''  He is not asking for a tremendous amount.   Chad Cordell of Charleston, WV, said that he has ``been concerned  about the impacts of mountaintop removal since learning the beautiful  valleys and streams of my home state were being buried under hundreds  of feet of rubble.'' He said he wants ``strong, science-based  protections for the creeks, streams, and rivers that are the lifeblood  of our state,'' and he noted that ``attacking the Stream Protection  Rule isn't the way to build strong, healthy, resilient communities or a  strong, stable economy.''   John Kinney of Birmingham, AL, said:         I have lived most of my life in Jefferson County, Alabama,       enjoying the outdoors, particularly canoeing and fishing on       the Black Warrior and Cahaba River.        While it seems that many folks in regulatory agencies don't       consider Alabama to be part of Appalachia, and don't       understand the extent of coal mining in our state, I have       seen the devastating impact of coal mining in our state . . .       first hand.    He goes on:         I have seen lakes turned gray downstream of mines. I have       seen streams turned bright orange downstream of coal       preparation plants. I have seen sloughs that once formed deep       channels (perfect spots for largemouth bass) filled in with       sediment.    John wants to see Federal protections ``that help protect water  quality for all uses downstream of coal mines and associated  industries'' and wants to see the stream protection rule stay where it  is.   Here is a final story. It is from Chuck Nelson, a fourth-generation  coal miner from West Virginia who dug coal underground for 30 years. He  became an advocate for environmental rules like the stream protection  rule after a coal processing plant was built near his home. Thick,  black coal dust was always coating his home inside and out. His wife  developed very bad asthma problems, and his kids couldn't use the  swimming pool because of a thick black skin always on the top of the  water. He decided to make his voice heard, and he came to DC from West  Virginia 25 times to talk to lawmakers and regulators. He was a regular  citizen. He saw a problem impacting his wife, and he wanted us to work  to fix it. He finally succeeded when the stream protection rule was  finalized in December.   It amounts to this: The way that one conducts mountaintop coal mining  has a huge impact, just as it does with other industries. Having basic  rules about how that work is done ensures sustainability of the nearby  streams. This was done with a tremendous amount of involvement of  stakeholders, tremendous number of meetings, 6 years of coordination,  trying to find a way that doesn't paralyze coal mining but does protect  the streams. That is the balance which was being searched for,  discovered, and implemented with this rule, and we should leave it in  place. We shouldn't destroy these years of work to protect our  beautiful streams with just a few hours of debate, with no public  notice or awareness of what is going on. If we want to review this  thoughtfully and seriously, let's have it done in committee, where the  public can participate and Senators can take a deliberate stand and not  destroy this work to protect these thousands of miles of streams in a  blink of an eye.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.    Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Hawaii,  both on the substance of the issue and on the Congressional Review Act  and how it is an unsuitable tool in a situation like this because of  how it bars the door for a simple way to replace or modify a  regulation.   I am coming to the floor tonight to share my concerns about a basic  challenge we have in the world. This basic challenge is that when you  get a ruler of a country who is corrupt, they forge contractual  relationships, particularly if they are rich in minerals or oil, and  they pocket the money and they spread the corruption. It makes it  virtually impossible for the interests of the people of that country to  be represented by their government because whatever governing body they  have keeps making decisions based on those corrupt payments.   Now, we are a nation that values government by the people--of, by,  and for the people. That is the vision of our Nation, but that vision  would not be fulfilled if the Members of this body were being paid by  foreign companies to serve the interests of the foreign companies  instead of the interests of the people. We can understand from our own  perspective our own desire to have a government that serves our  citizens and that other nations want to have a government that serves  their citizens. That is what this particular bill and the regulation  that flows from it were all about. It was section 504 of Dodd-Frank,  the resource extraction rule, that was passed now 7 years ago.   It took quite a while to get the regulation into place. The first  version came out in 2012, after a tremendous amount of consultation was  struck down in court because it was challenged by one of the companies  that did not want to have transparency in international payments. Then  folks went to work again and produced a rule that went into effect this  last year. Unfortunately, we are about to strike that down.   I was thinking about how one of the champions for this was Senator  Dick Lugar of Indiana. I was so impressed by his thoughtfulness when I  came to the Senate. He had been here quite a while, and he worked to  really understand issues, and he worked to solve problems. He didn't  work to obstruct an administration because it was of a different party.  He didn't work to sabotage the work of this body because one party or  the other was in the majority. He worked to solve problems. He had  really a deep understanding of the challenges in the world.   He could see this from his considerable experience. He was on foreign  relations for a very long time, and he served as its chair. He knew  from his own work in that committee, from his own studies, from his own  travels, and his own conversations--overseas conversations with foreign  governments and conversations with our State Department and our Defense  Department--that we had a significant issue in which contracts with  large companies are used to defeat government of, by, and for the  people in nations around the world. He wanted to do something about it.  He had partnerships, and Members of our own body who are still serving  here today were deeply involved in this.  [[Page S647]]    It was a tremendous provision, but the American Petroleum Institute  wasn't happy about it because it has worked really well for oil  companies to not disclose and to make deals with ruling dictators and  ruling families or ruling governing groups, whether they be in a so- called elected form or unelected form.   Well, finally, last year the rule was completed in June. They crafted  a rule that, for the most part, made various stakeholders happy and it  won broad international support. Dozens of other countries--including  Canada, Norway, and countries of the European Union--followed American  leadership. They adopted similar laws. So our particular law made it  clear that if a company was listed on our stock exchange--on any of our  exchanges--and it made a significant payment--$100,000 or more--it had  to disclose that payment. That wasn't just U.S. companies. It wouldn't  just have been U.S. companies. It was any company listed on our  exchange, no matter where it was based. Other companies followed suit.  So companies based in other countries were affected. So, basically, it  was a vision that in short order took over the entire world, with  developed countries coming together and saying that we are going to  stop this process that destroys governments for the people in so much  of the world.   It isn't just kind of a theoretical question of some liberal vision  of how governments work. We are talking about the difference between  the decisions of dictators to stash billions of dollars overseas or  build health care clinics. We are talking about the difference between  dictators buying hundreds of the world's most expensive sports cars or  developing an education system in their countries. We are talking about  the fundamental quality of life for millions and millions of people  around the world. This provision, this resource extraction rule, went  in an enormous direction in terms of making the world a better place.  Shouldn't that be what we are about?   This challenge of foreign contracts with money diverted into the  pockets of the dictators and the ruling class--the money that should go  to the development of the country--is particularly a problem in  resource rich countries with weak institutions. They have weak courts.  They have weak investigative branches to find corruption. They have  courts that essentially exorcise the ability to try people for which  there is evidence, who should be charged and should be convicted. So  the same corruption that affects the decisions that are made protects  those who make those decisions. This means that if you have someone who  grows up in this country and says: We have hundreds of billions of  dollars of resources and nothing to show for it; so let's change that  system; let's change that system and enable the people of this country  to benefit from schools and health care and transportation; let's  develop our nation, they are stymied by this complex web of undisclosed  corruption. So that is what this bill is all about, and that is what  this rule stemming from the section of the bill is all about.    Let's take, for example, a poster child for this resource curse. In  many countries, it is known as the oil curse. Oil is a particularly  prominent case. But the Democratic Republic of the Congo has not just  some oil but a lot of minerals. It is a significant producer of the  world's cobalt, diamonds, tin, gold, and other minerals. This problem  of a corrupt dictator goes way back to decades ago. His name was well  known around the world: Mobutu Sese Seko. He ruled from 1965 to 1997,  so 32 years, three decades. It is estimated that he diverted from the  country $4 billion to $15 billion. That is a lot of roads being built  in a poor country. That is a lot of food for people who are near  starvation. That is a lot of public school education. That is a lot of  health care clinics. So one very rich man was stashing money in Swiss  bank accounts rather than that money going to the government to do  fundamental responsibilities for the people. The country has an  estimated $24 trillion in mineral deposits. When we think about that,  the $4 billion to $15 billion doesn't sound like very much.   Often, the way it works is these corrupt payments enable companies to  get contracts far below cost, which is not a good thing, obviously, for  these impoverished nations, to be essentially giving away their money  because they are being bribed to do so.   So that is extremely disturbing to me, this particular issue being  done here late in the evening, with very few of my colleagues here-- mostly colleagues who are trying to fight this rule. Those who are  supporting the multilateral corporations, the multinational  corporations that don't like to have disclosure, they are not here to  talk about how this is damaging the lives of millions of people in the  poorest countries around the world. Maybe we need to have a rule in the  Senate that if you are going to damage the lives of millions of people,  you have to actually be here to hear the debate.   This debate is limited to just 10 hours, 5 hours on either side. If  one side gives back their time, it is just 5 hours. There are not a  whole lot of conversations. Maybe we could limit the conversation to 20  minutes a person or 10 minutes a person so we get a lot of voices in.   Before we go about the process of destroying the lives of millions of  people all around the world, maybe, instead of just listening to the  lobbyists for a multinational bank in your office, you should be here  on the floor to have a conversation about the damage you are  contemplating doing. Maybe then we would have an actual debate here in  the U.S. Senate--a place that used to be a place where people did come  and listen to each other debate issues. Perhaps there are good  arguments to the contrary that I haven't heard because my colleagues  aren't here presenting them. And maybe out of that mutual exchange, we  would find a path to do something other than using this crude and  destructive tool to strike down this very important provision.   There are three groups who benefit from this disclosure rule. The  first group who benefits is the investors in a company who want to  invest in companies that have responsible practices. The disclosure  gives them the ability to have that information.   The second group who benefits is consumers who want to buy products  from companies that engage in responsible practices, and disclosure  enables them to do that.   The third group, though, really is the most important group, and that  is a group of citizens in the country who are being corrupted by these  payments because when they hear that a company has a contract and has  paid X amount of billion dollars for that contract, then the newspapers  of that country and the citizens of that country can try to get  additional information: Did you take the percentage of that that was  supposed to go to the regional government and actually get it disbursed  to the regional government? Did you take the percentage of that that  was supposed to go to the local city or province and did it get there?  They can start to see that there is this lump of money that is supposed  to be serving the citizens, and they can ask questions about how it  serves the citizens. What bank account did it go into--so they can  follow the money and track the money. But they have no ability to do  that if these payments are hidden. That is what this is about.   So it is about investors who want to do the right thing, consumers  who want to use their marketing and purchasing power to do the right  thing, but it is really about the citizens of that country not having  their resources diverted when they desperately need the fundamental  things, such as transportation and education and health care.   Well, Senator Lugar said recently that if we allow this rule to be  repealed, it would be ``a real tragedy for democracy and human  rights.''   I agreed with Senator Lugar when he said, ``It is hard to believe  that this would be such a high priority right now.'' We have a lot of  issues in the world that we are challenged by, including security  issues. We have a lot of nominations to address and debate. Why is it  such a high priority at this moment to tear down a provision that  improves the quality of life for millions of people in some of the  poorest countries in the world? Why is it so important at this moment  to tear down a law that reduces corruption in governments around the  world? Why is it so important right now to destroy this provision that  helps create an opportunity for ``we the people,'' a government that we  profess to believe in?  [[Page S648]]    It is well known that the CEO of ExxonMobil traveled to Washington to  personally lobby Senator Lugar on this section. He wanted this  provision scrapped, and that individual is now our Secretary of State.  That certainly disturbs me, that the day after he became Secretary of  State, the provision he lobbied for as an oil executive is being  accomplished here on the floor.    Because of his testimony in committee, there was some hope that he  would stand up and fight for the fundamental visions of our country,  the fundamental values and principles of our country, and if so, he  would be sending out information right now saying: Stop what you are  doing because I know how this works around the world and how it  destroys ``we the people'' governments, and we shouldn't be doing it;  that is, we should keep the provision we have right now.   Nigeria is another nation that has had a resource curse or oil curse.  Last year, a deal was struck between ExxonMobil and the Nigerian  Government--or it came under investigation last year by that country's  anti-corruption and law enforcement agency, the Economic and Financial  Crimes Commission. The investigation surrounds a 2009 agreement where  an Exxon subsidiary and the Nigerian Government agreed to renew a 40- percent share in three new oil licenses. Exxon reached a deal to pay  $600 million for those licenses, and it built a powerplant at a cost of  $900 million, so it made a $1.5 billion investment. So a $1.5 billion  investment--that sounds like a pretty high sum for a contract.   However, an outside group who was investigating corruption found that  the Nigerian Government had valued those contracts at $2.15 billion--in  other words, $1 billion more than what Exxon was paying. Furthermore,  they found that wasn't just in theory because another bidder offered  $3.75 billion, and that is more than twice what Exxon paid. But the  Exxon deal was chosen.   Isn't there some sense that something is wrong when a government  rejects a payment that is $2.25 billion more than the offer that was  accepted? That is what happens with corrupt payments between powerful  companies and dictators. That is what destroys government of, by, and  for the people around the world.   It is estimated that over time--that is, since 1960, so after the  last 57 years--$400 billion of Nigerian oil revenues have disappeared  due to corruption--$400 billion disappeared. What would $400 billion do  to improve the lives of Nigerians?   That is why transparency in these payments is so important. It  affects impoverished people all over the world. We can have all of our  aid programs, we can have our Food for Peace Program, we can have our  Millennium Corporation, but this type of deal does so much more damage  than all the good we do through our programs that we budget for and put  money into.   If we enable, if we promote corruption around the world, we do  enormous damage. That is why a bipartisan group of Senators, including  Dick Lugar leading it, took this on.   How about Equatorial Guinea. It is one of Sub-Saharan Africa's  largest oil producers, and it, like many other oil countries, has the  oil curse. President Obiang has been in power since he ousted his uncle  in a military coup in 1979 and declared himself President for life.  Let's just say what he is: He is a dictator. His government has been  known to detain arbitrarily and torture critics, to disregard  elections. It has been prosecuted for using oil profits for financial  gain of the President's family. The result is, although this country is  one of the wealthiest African nations per capita, the majority of the  Nation's citizens survive on less than $2 a day. Let me clarify that.  It is one of the richest African nations per capita, but a large  percent of the citizens survive on less than $2 a day because President  Obiang and his extended network--his extended corrupt network--are  stealing the resources of the country, and they are doing it often  through contracts with oil companies like Exxon, which happens to be a  major partner in exploiting the resources of Equatorial Guinea.   Less than half of Equatorial Guinea has access to clean drinking  water, a fundamental need and a fundamental factor in health. Twenty  percent--that is one out of every five children--die before reaching  the age of 5. This is because of the corruption that is facilitated by  undisclosed sums, reinforcing a dictator--a dictator whose family owns  fleets of fancy sports cars, luxury yachts, private jets, massive  properties in Europe, massive properties in Brazil, and properties  right here in the United States. But one-fifth of the children die  before age 5. That is why this is so important.   Let me conclude by saying that what we are doing here tonight in  putting this forward with no real debate because my colleagues are not  here--a few colleagues are here to give speeches like I am giving to  say ``Stop, this is wrong,'' but our colleagues are not here to hear  us. What is happening tonight is an enormous travesty. It is an  enormous blight on the United States, which led the world in taking on  this problem and now is abandoning not just that leadership but is  abandoning the principle. The world is worse off for it.   I hope that my colleagues will somehow come to an inspiration or a  revelation, that those who are not here listening to this will come to  an understanding that something is wrong with this and will oppose this  effort to repeal this very important provision. But I know that the  heavy hand of corporate lobbying is behind the fact that this is on the  floor tonight, and I am not optimistic. That saddens me a great deal.   Let us strive to have a process that honors the importance of the  issues before us. This short debate, with virtually no one present,  does not honor it and does enormous damage, and it is just wrong.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my team  member, Patrick Drupp, be granted privileges of the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
