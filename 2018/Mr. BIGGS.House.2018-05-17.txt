 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It merely eliminates  the bioenergy subsidy programs that were established way back in title  IX of the 2002 farm bill some 16 years ago. Those programs are the  Biobased Markets Program; the Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical, and  Biobased Product Manufacturing Assistance Program; the Repowering  Assistance Program; the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program; the Rural  Energy for America Program; the Biomass Research and Development  Initiative; the Feedstock Flexibility Program for Bioenergy Producers;  the Biomass Crop Assistance Program; and the Community Wood Energy  Program.   President Reagan said that there is nothing quite as everlasting as a  Federal program, and I am hoping that we can end some of these programs  today.   Needless to say, subsidies have no place in a free market. If  biofuels are to succeed, it should be based on their benefit to the  Nation's overall energy economy, not because they receive taxpayer  funds.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all my colleagues to end this Washington  giveaway, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I respect my colleague's reasoned  opposition, although I disagree with him.   I appreciate his passion on the issue, and I have no doubt that he  and I will work together on many future projects. But with this, Mr.  Chairman, I continue to hold my position and would urge the passage of  my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's position, and I  regrettably must disagree with that position and continue to urge  passage of the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
