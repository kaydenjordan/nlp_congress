 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 480 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 480         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (S. 114) to amend       title 38, United States Code, to require the Secretary of       Veterans Affairs to submit an annual report regarding       performance awards and bonuses awarded to certain high-level       employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the report       of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution shall       be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs; and (2) one       motion to recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 480, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule  forward on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for  consideration of S. 114, the Department of Veterans Affairs Bonus  Transparency Act.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the  chairman and ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. The  rule also provides for a motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, we can all agree that our Nation's veterans are heroes.  They deserve our support, gratitude, and recognition, and they deserve  to have the promises we as a nation have made to them fulfilled.  Unfortunately, far too often, we fall short of keeping those promises.  [[Page H6526]]    Everyone remembers the scandals that shook the Department of Veterans  Affairs a few years ago, highlighting critical problems around the  country and the need for greater accountability. In the wake of these  crises of mismanagement and wrongdoing, Congress created the Veterans  Choice Program in 2014 to provide veterans with better options to seek  out timely, appropriate care from providers in their communities rather  than wade through the outrageous lines, excessive wait times, and  subpar medical care at Veterans Health Administration facilities.   The Choice Program isn't perfect, and my colleagues and I are working  to fix that, but it has been a meaningful start and a path to quicker,  more convenient care for our Nation's veterans. Without congressional  action today, we risk leaving our heroes without Choice. That is not a  risk I am willing to take.   VA Secretary Shulkin has estimated that more than 1 million veterans  in the VA system use some Choice care, and that number is expected to  increase this year. In fact, today, more than 30 percent of the VA  appointments are made with private sector providers that have the  capacity to relieve some of the burden on our servicemembers and the VA  clinics. This year alone, more than 18 million appointments with  private doctors have been authorized by the Department of Veterans  Affairs.   If we fail to take action, these veterans will lose their ability to  receive prompt care from Choice providers. We would be flooding the VA  medical facilities with more patients, even as we know that many  facilities are still overburdened and, in some cases, underperforming.   Let me be clear: This is not a doomsday prediction. This is not a  Henny Penny moment or Hail Mary effort to pass an obscure bill. If  Congress refuses to act today, the Choice Program will expire on August  15.   Chairman Roe has worked diligently to ensure that this does not  happen. In the Senate, my friend and fellow Georgian, Senator Johnny  Isakson, serves as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. He,  too, has worked tirelessly to ensure our veterans continue to receive  care by safeguarding the viability of the Choice Program.   I have to say, the two chairmen, Chairman Roe and Chairman Isakson,  the body is really at a favor having those two men working, and the  ranking members working alongside of them, in this process. So we are  continuing to look forward to this bill passing, and many more things  to come.   When we understand this, Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that Chairman  Roe and Chairman Isakson, along with their respective ranking member  counterparts, Mr. Walz and Mr. Tester, are committed to making the  existing system work better for veterans.   I also know that the Choice Program needs reform. However, we can't  improve a program that doesn't exist. We must first protect what is  good in hopes of making it better.   Today's underlying bill provides additional funds to extend the  Choice Program for 6 months and provide a critical $2.1 billion  infusion of funds while we move forward with thoughtful, sustainable  reforms.   I have proposed ideas to make those reforms, including the Expanding  Access to Choice Act, which prevents bureaucracy at the VA from  derailing a functioning Choice program. I authored that bill as a  direct response to concerns that were raised by my constituents in  northeast Georgia.   I am sure that many Members here today have similar experiences and  have heard similar stories from their neighbors, and I am confident  many Members want to fix this program. By supporting the rule and the  underlying bill today, we are taking a step towards making that happen.   Secretary Shulkin told the Veterans' Affairs Committee that, without  additional funding, veterans would wait longer to receive the  healthcare that they deserve. That statement should elicit one thing  from this body, Mr. Speaker, and that is action.   Yet there are those who would rather we shuffle down the road of  inaction than stand for our veterans today, Mr. Speaker. There are some  who claim Choice represents a move towards privatization and who have  opposed the Choice Program from the beginning.   Let me set the record straight: We are not talking about privatizing  the VA today. We are talking about sustaining a program that currently  serves hundreds of thousands--if not millions--of veterans across  the country. This bill is not about privatization. It is about  breathing 6 months' more life into a program that enables veterans to  access care more efficiently and effectively.    This is not the time for partisan maneuvers. Our veterans--their very  lives--are on the line, and we owe it to them to vote to move forward  so that they receive the care we have promised them.   Mr. Speaker, I am currently in the Air Force Reserve, and I have  completed a tour earlier in Iraq. I have witnessed our Armed Forces'  display of heroism, and I believe their actions deserve recognition.  This bill doesn't repay the debt or gratitude we owe our veterans, but  it brings us closer to fulfilling our promises by meeting their needs.   The underlying bill authorizes multiple major medical facility  leases, including a lease for a facility in Pike County, Georgia. In  addition, S. 114 enhances the recruitment, retention, and training of  the VA workforce through a number of measures, including encouraging  servicemembers with health-related occupational specialties to seek  employment at the Veterans Health Administration and expanding hiring  authority in the case of severe shortages of qualified healthcare  personnel candidates.   Mr. Speaker, preserving the Choice Program and the access to  community care options that it provides is critical. I agree that we  can make this program better, but we have to provide a path to do that.   Already, I have heard from veterans in my district who say clinics  are raising concerns about the availability of funds for Choice. We  must address this issue today, and we must uphold our promises to  America's veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I would just again reiterate the point of the discussion that this is  something we need to take up today. This is not about the peripheral  discussions going on concerning Choice, privatization, and other things  that have derailed this discussion. I want to see this move forward so  we can continue to have viable discussions on Choice, but I would also  be remiss, Mr. Speaker, if I did not at least address the discussion.  The gentlewoman from New York, who I have the greatest respect for, has  her opinion; I have mine as well.   I do not believe what happened last night in the Senate was, in her  words, heroic. I believe it was basically a failure. It was a failure  of process. What happened last night was not anything except the  stopping of a process that could have included Democrats and  Republicans in a conference committee, and it was chosen not to move  forward. That is the reason we come to this place, is to move forward.   I think when we look at this, the disaster that is ObamaCare, and the  reasons that we are now keeping it, and that the healthcare measure has  failed, it brings the question to my mind, for the ones who have been  helped, and I have never, from this podium or anywhere else, denied  that there were many with preexisting conditions and other issues who  found help, but, if we remember the promise, the promise was to cover  all uninsured. It came nowhere close. The promise was, you can keep  your doctor if you liked him, you can keep your plan if you liked it.  The promise was that your premiums would go down, and the premiums have  gone up.   So for all the supporters, then come to maybe my district or other  districts and address those people who have lost their insurance,  address those people whose premiums have gone up, address the people  like the young lady in Chicago who did get on the ObamaCare exchanges,  had a premium that was subsidized, but when she realized that she  couldn't afford the deductible, she said: I might as well have not had  it.   It is one thing to discuss this in grand terms, it is another to see  the result in our system. To talk about the nominal positives against  the crushing negatives is not a victory.   So I think we move forward. Today, we have a chance to move forward  on Choice, today we have a chance to move forward and look ahead, but I  at least say, from this Member's perspective, I don't forget. I  understand what I have heard for 7 years.   It has been said many times that the current bill is actually gaining  in popularity. Well, I just simply point you to the only polls that  have really mattered over the last 7 years, and those are elections,  and every time there was an election and this issue was up, ObamaCare  lost. I am not sure how you can continue to support, with any kind of a  straight face, that kind of abject failure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.   The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.  [[Page H6528]]                                ____________________
