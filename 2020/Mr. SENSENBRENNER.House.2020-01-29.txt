 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3201.  [[Page H652]]  Without this 15-month extension, dangerous fentanyl analogues will fall  through a legal loophole in just 8 days. If there ever was a must-pass  bill, this it is.   Importantly though, the scourge of fentanyl analogues needs to be  addressed permanently. Drug traffickers are increasingly savvy and  sophisticated; they can alter the chemical composition of these drugs,  creating analogues that don't fall under the drug-scheduling protocol.   DEA has taken emergency steps to combat these analogues which we will  temporarily extend today, but we owe it to our constituents to  permanently schedule these drugs. This is about saving lives.   I have legislation, the Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act,  or SOFA, to place these drugs on schedule I and to give the DEA the  authority to combat new analogues that arise.   We need to pass SOFA to protect our communities, and we need to pass  SOFA to save lives.   I want to highlight how dangerous these substances are. One teaspoon  of fentanyl is enough to kill 2,000 people. This lethality puts  fentanyl and its analogues in a class with chemical warfare agents like  VX nerve gas and ricin.   Scheduling fentanyl analogues is a matter of life or death. We must  choose life. The attorneys general of all 50 States and the Attorney  General of the United States have all called for the passage of SOFA  and the permanent scheduling of fentanyl analogues.   I urge my colleagues to do our part to protect the American people to  save lives. Pass this bill, and then let's pass SOFA.
