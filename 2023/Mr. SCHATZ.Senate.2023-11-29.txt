Madam President, before I begin my prepared remarks, I  just want to acknowledge Leader Schumer for his extraordinary,  personal, compelling, and essential remarks on the rise of anti- Semitism across the country and across the planet. It was needed; it  was accurate; and it touched me. So thank you, Mr. Leader.
