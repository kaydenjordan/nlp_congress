 Mr. Speaker, this Congress, with a unanimous  voice vote, passed a resolution that mandates antisexual harassment  training for Members and staff.   Of course, it is about time. But here is the thing, Mr. Speaker: it  is pitiful and embarrassing that a Member of Congress would need an  instruction manual that tells them that they must keep their pants on  in their office.   What we need is to create an environment of a safe and respectful  workplace and policies and procedures that will allow victims to come  forward to be fully compensated, for Members to be held accountable,  and to have fair due process.
