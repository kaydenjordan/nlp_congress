 Madam Chair, I thank the chairman of the Health  Subcommittee for his leadership and for yielding me time.   Madam Chair, I rise today in support of the HALT Fentanyl Act. The  American people are in the midst of a staggering illicit fentanyl  crisis. Our kids are dying, Madam Chair. We need to do everything we  possibly can to help these kids.   Sadly, we read daily headlines, Madam Chair, of adults, teens, and  even toddlers who have died from fentanyl poisoning.   My colleagues across the aisle, they kicked the can down the road.  They have kicked it down the road too long, Madam Chair, and look at  the consequences as fentanyl-related substances still remain only  temporarily scheduled. The time is now to make it permanent.   Today, we take an overdue step in the right direction, and as a proud  advocate for individuals suffering with substance use disorder, I know  this is just one step. Much more needs to be done, and I am thankful  the gentleman has brought this bill to the floor.   Sadly, we continue to see a huge influx of fentanyl-related  substances into the country from across the Mexican border, from  cartels using chemicals imported from China and India.                                time  1800    I am disheartened to see communities across my State of Florida and  across the Nation bearing the ramifications of these criminal actors  and our open-border policies. We must secure the border.   This is a nonpartisan issue, in my opinion, and we must come together  to address the opioid crisis. We are at war with these cartels, Madam  Chair.   I would like to see my Democratic colleagues heed the Biden  administration's public support of these critical measures. Just this  Monday, they issued their support for the policies in this bill, urging  Congress to pass these measures to address public safety and save  lives.   I say to my colleagues across the aisle: Work with us on this and on  other meaningful policy solutions to combat fentanyl in our Nation.
