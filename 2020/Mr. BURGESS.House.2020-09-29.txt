 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I thank John for his service to the Congress, his service to the  country. And John's life has been all about service from West Point, to  the U.S. Army, U.S. Army Reserves.   For 15 years, it has been my high privilege to serve with John on the  Energy and Commerce Committee. You can tell by the number of members of  the Energy and Commerce Committee who are here tonight just the impact  he has had on that committee.   I will tell you, John, one of my fondest memories is in March 2011  after Harry Reid had shut down the project that was to be long-term  nuclear storage out at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. I still have a piece of  rock that the Yucca mucker kicked up and the tailings when we walked  into that enormous man-made cavern out there.   But your passion for that issue has not dimmed over the years, and I  will just promise you that we will take it up and carry on in the  Congresses to come.   I thank you very much for the privilege of having known you.
