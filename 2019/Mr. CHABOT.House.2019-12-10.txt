 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to congratulate my alma  mater, La Salle High School, for winning their fourth Ohio Division II  football championship in the last 6 years. They defeated a tough  Masillon Washington High School team 34-17.   I was particularly pleased to see La Salle bring home another  championship since I played defensive line for the Lancers back in the  day, and my brother, Dave, 10 years later, played defensive back.   Congratulations to Coach Pat McLaughlin, his coaching staff, the  players, parents, students, and fans. You made the school and all of  Cincinnati proud. Lancers roll deep.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to congratulate the Cincinnati Elder  Panthers, who had a great season as well but came up just short of  winning the Ohio Division I championship.   My nephews, Joey and Mikey Del Prince, played for Elder a few years  back.  [[Page H10007]]    Don't get too down, guys. You will get them next year. Go Panthers.                            ____________________
