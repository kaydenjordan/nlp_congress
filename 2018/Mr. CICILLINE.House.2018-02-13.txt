 Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking the gentleman  for yielding and for his many years of extraordinary leadership on not  only Make It In America, but on the urgency of rebuilding the  infrastructure of our country.   Tonight, I think the American people can see these two things really  intersect, because what Democrats have proposed is for the Federal  Government to be a real partner again in rebuilding our country,  something that cities and States just can't do on their own.   The Federal Government has to play a real role, and we have put  together a framework for a $1 trillion investment in rebuilding our  roads, our bridges, our ports, our transit systems, our schools, and  making the investments that will create 16 million good-paying jobs and  will create a platform to grow our economy, address urgent needs.   You know, America used to lead the world, was the envy of the world  in our infrastructure. That is no longer the case. We are now behind  countries like the United Arab Emirates and Singapore, according to the  World Economic Forum.   As Mr. Garamendi put up there, the American Society of Civil  Engineers gives us a failing grade on America's infrastructure. An  estimated 56,000 of America's bridges are structurally deficient. One  out of every 5 miles of highway pavement in our country is in poor  condition.   But, of course, we don't need those report cards. We don't need these  reports to tell us. The American people experience it every day: being  stuck in traffic, having disruptions in their rail service, having  repairs to their cars. Our constituents feel it every day; and that is  why it is so disappointing that the President has been unwilling to  work with Democrats in a bipartisan way to craft an infrastructure plan  that will actually rebuild the country, create good-paying jobs, make  us the envy of the world again.   Instead, he puts forth this sort of bait-and-switch. First of all, it  is a $200 billion investment. Our plan is five times that. And then he  says: Oh, it is really $1.7 million. Why? Because his friends are going  to privatize public infrastructure and create tolls and higher costs  for users.   That is not what infrastructure is. Infrastructure is a public  investment. The Federal Government plays a role.   And then he proposes a budget that makes deep cuts in  transportation--actually, almost as much as he proposed spending. So it  is like, I am willing to invest zero in infrastructure is basically  what the President is saying.   We need a real infrastructure plan. As Mr. Garamendi said, we put  forth a better deal to rebuild America, a real investment of  infrastructure that will also protect environmental standards, worker  rights, create good-paying jobs.   Instead, what the President proposed, after all this fanfare, is a  proposal one-fifth the size, while, at the same time, he is making deep  cuts in infrastructure programs and shreds environmental protections,  shreds worker rights.   We, of course, put in our plan ways to accelerate so these things can  move forward, but it has got to be done in a way that respects labor  and environmental standards.   Mr. Garamendi has been here longer than I have. That is sort of sad.  This was always a bipartisan issue. We could agree on the urgency, the  necessity of rebuilding our country.                                time  2015    It should be about national priority.   We should all be committed to doing this. This is another flimflam.  This proposal is basically to privatize public infrastructure, make big  corporations and wealth investors rich and let working class and middle  class folks pay for it.   It is the same thing we saw in the tax bill, the same thing we saw in  the  [[Page H1112]]  budget. It is very disappointing, and I am hoping the President will  study the Democratic framework and work with us to actually invest in  and rebuild our country in a way that we can all be proud of.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out that the  President proposed and the Republicans passed a tax scam that rewarded  the wealthiest people in this country and the biggest corporations.  Eighty-three percent of that tax cut went to the top 1 percent.   It created a debt of $1.5 trillion plus interest--over $2 trillion-- for the next generation. Can you imagine if, instead of a giveaway to  people who didn't need it, that money were invested in rebuilding our  country? You could create 16 million good-paying jobs. You could create  an incredible power for our economy so we can move goods and services  and information to rebuild the economy.   But then you think about the willingness to give away that amount of  money to the top 1 percent, 83 percent of the tax cut, if, instead, you  had invested it in this urgent priority that impacts the daily lives of  every single American, what a difference it would have made.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi)  for the many, many years that he has worked on this issue and  underscoring every week the importance of investing in products made in  America, and now making sure that, as we rebuild America, that we focus  on products and innovative materials that are made here in the USA.
