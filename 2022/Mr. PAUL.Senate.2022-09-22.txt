 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an  [[Page S4966]]  outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Mylke Coffee Company of Island, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   Shane Case had a vision for his home in Western Kentucky. Seeing that  there was no source of freshly roasted coffee beans anywhere near his  region of the State, he decided to fulfill this need, and thus in 2017,  Mylke opened its doors. Shane's innovative vision led Mylke to become  the first and only craft commercial coffee-roaster located within 100  miles of his hometown, and their popularity has continued to grow since  its founding. Many people ask about the unique nature of the company's  name. The name boils down to a sort of fusion between old and new: old  in the way of Old English, a nod to Shane's Scottish heritage, and new,  in the newfound rise and popularity of mylk, which typically refers to  milk derived from beans, nuts, or plants rather than from an animal.  Mylk has undoubtedly been on the rise in recent years as consumers have  increasingly turned to dairy-free options as they search for quality  coffee. Shane understood this shift in consumer demand and has  responded accordingly with his forward-thinking business.   When Shane first opened his business, his intention was to provide  the western half of the Bluegrass State with high-quality coffee beans  and other coffee products from a source more local than the distant  Louisville or Nashville, TN. However, as his company and customer base  grew, he set his sights on entering into new markets beyond those of  his native Western Kentucky. Since its founding in 2017, Mylke has  consistently managed to break into new markets as far away as Atlanta  and Indianapolis. Mylke now provides freshly roasted coffee to more  than 20 independently owned coffee shops and restaurants. Not only has  Shane kept an eye on the potential of emerging markets, he readily  adapted to a newfound customer landscape when the COVID-19 pandemic  wreaked havoc on the coffee shop and restaurant industries. Faced with  government mandates forcing him to close his doors, Shane pivoted and  started offering alternative products to the typical coffee that is  brewed onsite, instead providing ready-to-drink options, including the  very popular Sweet Mylke Cold Brew or Mylke Kups that customers can use  at home in their Keurig Coffee Machine.   Throughout his venture into founding his own enterprise, Shane has  maintained a keen eye for business and an awareness of the needs of his  larger community. As the company has grown, Mylke has partnered with  several community organizations and charities that give back to the  community. The company has helped facilitate numerous fundraisers for  the McLean County High School Moot Court, an organization that exposes  students to constitutional law and the work of advocates in the U.S.  Supreme Court. Shane understands the importance of investing in the  young minds of his community and that such investments, especially when  pared with a focus on civic duty, are to the wide benefit not only for  the youth involved but for the community at large. Moreover, Mylke has  assisted in fundraising efforts for the Green River Area Down Syndrome  Association--GRADSA--and continues to partner with them whenever  possible.   Shane's charitable nature extends far beyond than what Mylke is able  to do at a local level. He also pays mind to source his coffee beans  from suppliers that share in his desire to give back to the community.  Mylke has partnered with Legacy Farms Coffee since its founding, a  coffee bean supplier working out of Honduras. Using proceeds earned  through their coffee crops, Legacy Farms Coffee provides numerous  services to the surrounding community, including livestock donations to  hungry families, donations of books and supplies to local schools, and  providing microloans to growing small businesses. This partnership, as  well as those in his native Kentucky, have ensured that every pound of  Mylke coffee sold benefits both the local and global community.   Mylke has seen unprecedented growth in 2022, with the christening of  the Mylke Coffee Shop food truck, an asset that allows the company to  grow their customer base and reach newfound customers. Moreover, the  company has acquired a new commercial coffee roaster which will  increase production capacity by 2,000 percent, to satisfy all those  craving the high-quality coffee Mylke is known for. Given his track  record for entrepreneurial wisdom it is not hard to believe that Mr.  Shane Case will continue to grow Mylke at the rate he has already seen.  I want to wish congratulations to Mr. Case and the entire team at Mylke  Coffee Company. I look forward to watching their continued growth and  success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
