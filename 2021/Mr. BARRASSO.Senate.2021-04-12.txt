 Madam President, first, I would like to associate  myself with the refined remarks of the Senator from Alabama because I,  too, have come to talk about the crisis on our southern border.   The Senator from Alabama and I traveled together, along with Senator  Cruz and Senator Cornyn, just a few weeks ago. I think we had a total  of 19 Senators who went to see the crisis firsthand.   And, in fact, it is not just one crisis, as the Senator from Alabama  and I have both spoken about. It is a double crisis. It is a national  security crisis as well as a humanitarian crisis.   We went on a midnight patrol. And what did we see at midnight? Well,  we saw, and we heard. Not just did we see the lights on, on the other  side of the Rio Grande; we heard the catcalls from traffickers who were  taunting our U.S. Border Patrol agents, saying in Spanish: You cannot  stop us now. That is what we are hearing from the criminals and the  traffickers across the Rio Grande.   We saw signs on the ground directing migrants to the facilities where  they will then turn themselves in, and we spoke to the Border Patrol  agents. They told us that their jobs got an awful lot harder on January  20, which is the day Joe Biden became President of the United States.   President Biden flipped over the sign and sent a clear message around  the world that said the U.S. border is now wide open. Because of that  clear message, Border Patrol arrests and detentions have doubled since  January.   In March, Border Patrol took 171,000 migrants into custody. Nearly  19,000 of those were unaccompanied minors. That is an alltime record in  the United States. And the pace that we are on now is to get to 2  million illegal immigrants crossing our border this very year.   According to the Secretary of Homeland Security, nominated by  President Biden, this is the most in 20 years--the most in 20 years,  right now, this year, under President Biden. The Biden White House has  essentially told the world anyone under 18 can cross our border, and we  will let you in. So it is no surprise that today we are seeing a  historic influx of children, of teenagers crossing our border.   The Border Patrol agents tell us two-thirds of them can't do their  regular jobs because they are too busy babysitting these children or  escorting adults to the areas where they will turn themselves in. More  children today are in Border Patrol custody than ever before. And in a  day of a global pandemic, I will tell you, as I was there with the  Senators in a location designed for 250 during coronavirus, there were  7,000 crammed in like sardines, with foil blankets to huddle under, and  no social distancing--none at all.   This is a Biden-created humanitarian crisis. Under the law, children  can only be in Border Patrol custody for 72 hours. We wouldn't want our  own children there for 72 minutes. Yet there are thousands and  thousands in custody for over 10 days   And 10 percent of the young people being tested are testing positive  for coronavirus. We watched the testing in the courtyard where I was.  They were all together, and then they tested some, and they said: OK.  You test negative. You go that way. You test positive. You go that way.   But absolutely every one of them was exposed to each other. So with  the fact that 10 percent are testing positive, it is highly likely that  the remainder will test positive as well. And what is the Biden  administration doing about that? They are sending those young people-- either those people just exposed to coronavirus, just standing right  next to somebody with coronavirus, sending them all across the country,  exposed to whoever knows what strain of coronavirus it was.   So this is a humanitarian crisis, but, I will tell you, it is also a  national security crisis. The Department of Homeland Security has now  arrested two men from the country of Yemen who are on the terrorist  watchlist. The Border Patrol says they were apprehending people not  just from Central America and Mexico, they have apprehended people from  56 different countries there at the border since President Biden has  taken the oath of office.   Last week, Border Patrol agents outside San Diego arrested a member  of MS-13, one of the most vicious criminal gangs in the world.   Now, these are just a couple of examples that we know about. Imagine  things we don't know about, the people who haven't been caught, people  who are roaming among us today in the United States.   That is what I hear about in Wyoming. I have just been home for 2  weeks talking to people. This is the No. 1 topic that I heard about  traveling the State of Wyoming.   So we have two crises at the southern border: the humanitarian crisis  and the national security crisis. President Biden has caused them both,  and President Biden can stop them. Yet the Biden administration is  still in denial. It refuses to even admit that there is a crisis.  President Biden still hasn't been to the border. Neither has the Vice  President, and she is supposed to be in charge of finding a solution to  the problem.   So, once again, today I call on President Biden and Vice President  Harris to go to the border and face the truth. Today is the day. Go to  the border. Face the truth. The President and Vice President should  talk to the Border Patrol agents. They should hear the stories that we  have heard from them. It is the stories that they want to tell. They  need to hear these stories. They need to face the reality.   Border Patrol agents told me directly: Finish the wall and bring back  the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy because those are things that will make  a difference. Until we do those two things, the jobs of the Border  Patrol agents will continue to get tougher and tougher every day.   Vast numbers, vast majorities of American people support the Border  Patrol agents. I know there are people on the other side of the aisle  who want to eliminate Immigration and Customs Enforcement, want to get  rid of the border line and having people who are patrolling the  borders, want to get rid of it all and have open borders fully and  without the kind of national security that we need at our borders.   But according to the Associated Press, only one in four Americans  approves of how President Biden is handling the border situation.  President Biden should listen to the American people. We need change at  the border. We need it today. We cannot wait. Our national security  cannot wait. The humanitarian crisis must be met and dealt with.   Republicans are going to continue to offer commonsense solutions that  will make a real difference at the border. We want to finish the wall.  We want to bring back the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy. We want to stem  this crisis--the humanitarian crisis and the national security crisis-- that is facing our Nation today. We stand for enforcing the law, for  closing loopholes that encourage illegal immigration. We want to secure  the border.   So I would urge President Biden and all of my Democratic colleagues  to please face the facts. Join us in our effort. It is time to bring  this crisis to an end.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service and  bravery of Officer Jacob Carlson and Officer Randi Garrett of the  Casper Police Department.   On May 6, 2018, Jake and Randi responded to a call of children  driving a car around a dirt lot in Casper near Fairdale Avenue. When  Officer Garrett arrived on scene, she found a 3-year-old driving the  vehicle with an adult and another child in the vehicle. The adult was  uncooperative in providing identification and attempted to flee after  Officer Carlson arrived on the scene. While Jake attempted to stop the  assailant from fleeing, he was shot multiple times with a concealed  weapon. Despite being shot with heavy blood loss, Officer Carlson  returned fire, and both officers found cover behind the car. Officer  Carlson's firearm was hit by gunfire. His actions allowed Officer  Garrett to find cover and eventually expose herself to fire a single  shot, rendering the assailant no longer a threat. Jake and Randi's  actions were selfless and ultimately saved the lives of two young  children.   When officers in our community put on their uniforms, they know that  at any time during their shift, they could walk into harm's way.  Without hesitation, they still put on their uniform every day. This  speaks louder than words can describe. It speaks to their bravery,  professionalism, and commitment to the people of Wyoming.   In 2008, Congress passed the Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of  Bravery Act, CBOB, establishing an honor for exceptional acts of  bravery in the line of duty by Federal, State, local, and Tribal law  enforcement officers.   On April 24, 2021, the Wyoming congressional delegation will present  Officers Carlson and Garrett the Congressional Badge of Bravery for  their heroic actions. It will be a high honor to participate in this  ceremony.   I want to thank Officers Carlson and Garrett for their exceptional  valor on this tragic day. The example and professionalism they have set  will shape future generations of police officers throughout Wyoming and  across our great country.   All of Wyoming and the law enforcement community are so thankful for  Officer Carlson's recovery and Officer's Garrett's resolve.                            ____________________
