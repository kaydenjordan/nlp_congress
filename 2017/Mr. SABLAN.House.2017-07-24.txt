 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Harry W. Colmery  Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, a bipartisan measure of  which I am an original cosponsor.   Among the bill's many benefits that preceding speakers have stated,  there are three that address issues specifically brought to me by  veterans in my district, the Northern Mariana Islands.   The first affects veterans who were enrolled in colleges that closed  and who, as a result, lost their educational benefit. The bill today  restores that benefit so those veterans can continue their education.   The second problem my veterans brought to me has to do with post-9/11  reservists, like those in Company E, 100th Battalion, 442nd Infantry  Regiment, part of the Go for Broke Unit; and the 302nd Quartermaster  Company in the Marianas; and national guardsmen, like the 368th  Military Police Company, who were under Active Duty and who did not  accrue education benefits. Those veterans will now have their Active  Duty count towards the GI Bill.   Third, the minimum GI Bill benefit for veterans with less than 36  months of qualifying active service increases to 50 percent of the  maximum amount payable.   Madam Speaker, I thank House Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Roe  and Ranking Member Walz for their leadership and commitment to working  together for the benefit of our veterans, a truly bipartisan product of  work.   I also commend the veteran service organizations we worked with for  their determination to ensure our country honors the promise made to  those who served and sacrificed on our behalf and in service to our  Nation.   Madam Speaker, I ask for support for this legislation.
