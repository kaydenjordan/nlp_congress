 Mr. President, I rise today, honored to speak after my  colleague from New Hampshire and joining my other colleagues in  opposing the nomination of Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to  serve as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.   Our beautiful natural resources define my home State of New  Hampshire. From the White Mountains to the Seacoast, to our pristine  lakes and our forests, our natural resources are critical to our  economy, our environment, our way of life, and protecting these  resources plays a critical role, as well, in protecting public health.   However, we are already beginning to see the real impacts of climate  change in New Hampshire, and these impacts threaten to have major  consequences for our natural resources and families and businesses in  every corner of my State. Recognizing that fact, members of both  parties have come together in New Hampshire to enact commonsense  bipartisan solutions to take on climate change and to grow and maintain  our State's renewable clean energy sector. We have worked to protect  our land, our air and water, and the health of our citizens.   Unfortunately, it is clear from Mr. Pruitt's opposition to the Agency  he will be tasked to lead, his record of working to weaken critical  environmental protections that our citizens need to thrive, and his  unwillingness to fight climate change, that he is unfit to serve in  this position.   The mission of the Environmental Protection Agency begins with  protecting our environment and the health of all of our citizens. The  EPA does critical work to protect the water we drink and the air we  breathe.   In recent years, the EPA has used sound scientific evidence to take  strong measures to protect our environment. Unfortunately, President  Trump has made clear that he does not support this critical Agency.  Throughout his campaign, the President has repeatedly attacked the EPA,  calling for its elimination and saying that our environment would be  ``just fine'' without it. The President has doubled down on his  hostility toward this Agency by nominating Mr. Pruitt to serve as its  Administrator.   As attorney general, Mr. Pruitt has been a vocal critic of the very  Agency he has now been nominated to lead, and he has been involved in  over 20 legal actions against it.   According to the Washington Post, Mr. Pruitt has ``spent much of his  energy as attorney general fighting the very agency he is being  nominated to lead.''   On social media, Mr. Pruitt has referred to himself as ``a leading  advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.'' He has questioned the  role of the Agency, stating that ``the EPA was never intended to be our  Nation's frontline environmental regulator.''   When asked by one of my colleagues if there were any clean air or  clean water EPA regulations in place today that he could support, Mr.  Pruitt declined to name a single one.   The foundation of a future where all Americans have an opportunity to  thrive starts with a healthy environment and healthy families. The EPA  serves an important role in protecting the health of our people. We  must do better than having an Administrator who has fought so  tirelessly to undermine the work that this Agency does.   I am also concerned by an EPA Administrator who has consistently  voiced skepticism about the clear facts on climate change. Throughout  my time in office, I have always fought to protect our environment and  have been a strong supporter of curbing the impacts of climate change.  As a State  [[Page S1247]]  senator, I sponsored legislation that allowed New Hampshire to join the  Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and I helped pass the State's  renewable portfolio standard to maintain and grow New Hampshire's clean  renewable energy sector.   During my time as Governor, I worked with members of both parties to  strengthen and build on those efforts, signing legislation to update  the renewable portfolio standard and to maximize the benefits of the  Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.   I am proud that my State has long led efforts to cut carbon  emissions, and it is crucial that other States follow our lead and take  responsibility for the pollution that they cause. That is exactly why I  am a strong supporter of measures like the Clean Power Plan.   I also strongly support the Paris agreement on climate change and  believe that the United States must take action to implement the  agreement while also ensuring that our international partners fulfill  their obligations.   Mr. Pruitt, however, has been a consistent skeptic on the role of  climate change and the role that it has had on our environment.   Mr. Pruitt has stated that we do not know the extent of human impact  on climate change and has called climate change a natural occurrence.  He has said that climate change is ``one of the major policy debates of  our time.''   And he continued:         That debate is far from settled. Scientists continue to       disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and       its connection to the actions of mankind.    Scientists are clear in their understanding of the climate change  science. The American Association for the Advancement of Science says  the scientific evidence is clear: Global climate change caused by human  activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society.   The American Geophysical Union says that humanity is the major  influence on the global climate change observed over the past 50 years.   The American Meteorological Society says it is clear from extensive  scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in  climate of the past half a century is human-induced increases in the  amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that warming of  the climate system is unequivocal and human influence on the climate  system is clear.   The EPA is a science-based organization, and it is unacceptable for  the EPA Administrator to be at odds with the well-established views of  leading scientists. As the Agency's own website says:         EPA is one of the world's leading environmental and human       health research organizations. Science provides the       foundation for Agency policies, actions, and decisions made       on behalf of the American people. Our research incorporates       science and engineering that meet the highest standards       for integrity, peer review, transparency, and ethics.    Mr. Pruitt disagrees with well-established climate science. Simply  put, that disqualifies him from leading an agency where ``science  provides the foundation for . . . policies, actions, and decisions.''  If you refuse to believe research from the world's leading scientists,  you cannot lead a science-based agency.   From protecting our environment to protecting public health, the EPA  plays a critical role in protecting the health of Granite Staters and  all Americans. We know that a cleaner environment plays a key role in  the economy, for the economy of New Hampshire and our entire country.  We should be building on the critical efforts the EPA has taken to  combat climate change and protect public health, not rolling them back.   Mr. Pruitt's hostility to the basic functions of the Environmental  Protection Agency and his work to undermine protections for clean air,  land, and water make clear that he should not serve in this role.   I will vote against Mr. Pruitt's nomination, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same.   I yield the floor.
