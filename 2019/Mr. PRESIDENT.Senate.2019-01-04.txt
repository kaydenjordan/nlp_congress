 Without objection, so ordered.                                     Department of the Treasury,                                  Washington, DC, December 19, 2018.      Hon. Sherrod Brown,      Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban           Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Brown: With this letter, we wish to       provide you with notification that Treasury intends to       terminate the sanctions imposed on En+ Group plc (``En+''),       UC Rusal plc (``Rusal''), and JSC EuroSibEnergo (``ESE'') in       30 days. En+, Rusal, and ESE have agreed to undertake       significant restructuring and corporate governance changes to       address the circumstances that led to their designation,       including reducing Oleg Deripaska's direct and indirect       shareholding stake in those entities to below 50 percent;       overhauling the composition of those entities' boards of       directors; taking restrictive steps related to their       corporate governance; and agreeing to unprecedented       transparency by undertaking extensive, ongoing auditing,       certification, and reporting requirements. As part of this       agreement, half of En+'s restructured board of directors will       be comprised of U.S. or UK nationals and Rusal's current       board chairman will step down. Deripaska will remain       sanctioned. All of Deripaska's property and interests in       property, including entities in which he owns a fifty percent       or greater interest, will remain blocked, and foreign persons       will continue to be subject to secondary sanctions should       they knowingly facilitate a significant transaction for or on       behalf of Deripaska or entities in which he owns a fifty       percent or greater interest. None of the transactions to be       undertaken to divest Deripaska of his interests in these       companies will allow Deripaska to obtain cash either in       return for shares relinquished in, or from future dividends       he may receive from, En+, Rusal, or ESE. OFAC reserves the       right to relist any or all of these companies should the       change in circumstances represented by their implementation       of the agreement with OFAC be reversed, including by a       material breach of the terms of the agreement.                               1. Background         On April 6, 2018, OFAC designated seven Russian oligarchs,       including Oleg Deripaska, and 12 companies they own or       control. This action also targeted 17 senior government       officials as well as a state-owned Russian weapons trading       company and its subsidiary, a Russian bank. The April 6       action aggressively targeted Russian oligarchs and elites       that further the Kremlin's global malign activities,       including its attempts to subvert Western democracy, its       support for the Assad regime, its malicious cyber activities,       its occupation of Crimea, and its instigation of violence in       Ukraine. This sanctions action was one of many that the       Treasury Department has taken to target Russia's malign       behavior. Under this Administration, Treasury has sanctioned       256 Russia-related individuals and entities, including 150       individuals and entities under Ukraine/Russia-related       sanctions authorities codified by the Countering America's       Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).        Among the 12 companies targeted on April 6, OFAC designated       En+ for being owned or controlled by, directly or indirectly,       Deripaska, and placed En+ on its list of Specially Designated       Nationals and Blocked Persons (``SDN List'') pursuant to       Executive Order 13661 of March 16, 2014, ``Blocking Property       of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in       Ukraine'' (``E.O. 13661'') and Executive Order 13662 of March       20, 2014, ``Blocking Property of Additional Persons       Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine'' (``E.O. 13662'').       OFAC also designated Rusal for being owned or controlled by,       directly or indirectly, En+; Deripaska has a 0.01 percent       direct ownership interest in Rusal, and his involvement was       not a basis for the designation of Rusal. OFAC also       designated ESE for being owned or controlled by, directly or       indirectly, En+ and Deripaska. As with En+, OFAC placed both       Rusal and ESE on the SDN List pursuant to E.O. 13661 and E.O.       13662.        The action on April 6 was among the most impactful targeted       sanctions actions ever taken by OFAC and included many of the       globally integrated companies the oligarchs rely on to       generate their wealth. The designation of Rusal, the world's       second largest aluminum producer, was felt immediately in       global aluminum markets. The price of aluminum soared in the       weeks following the designation, and Rusal subsidiaries in       the United States, Ireland, Sweden, Jamaica, Guinea, and       elsewhere faced imminent closure without limited sanctions       mitigation in the form of OFAC general licenses.             2. En+, Rusal, and ESE Petition OFAC for Delisting         As stated publicly by Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin,       the designations of En+, Rusal, and ESE, as well as the       follow-on collateral consequences, were not the primary aim       of the April 6 sanctions against Deripaska. Rather, En+,       Rusal, and ESE were designated due to their entanglement with       Deripaska. Economic sanctions, including those in E.O. 13661       and E.O. 13662, are designed to change behavior. In this       case, the objectives of the sanctions were to reduce       Deripaska's ownership in and sever his control of these       entities.        Upon their designation on April 6, 2018, En+, Rusal, and       ESE (collectively, the ``Petitioners'') approached the U.S.       Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control       (OFAC) to petition for delisting pursuant to 31 C.F.R.       Sec. 501.807. The Petitioners, led by Lord Gregory Barker,       the former Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change       for the United Kingdom, have engaged in negotiations with       OFAC extensively during the past eight months, while OFAC       evaluated whether Petitioners were credibly able to make       material changes in the structure and composition of the       companies such to be eligible for delisting. Petitioners       conducted themselves throughout in a cooperative and       transparent manner. Petitioners submitted proposals whereby       they would sever the ownership and control of Deripaska over       Petitioners. Throughout the negotiations, OFAC pressed for       terms that were targeted towards further restricting       Deripaska. Ultimately, OFAC and the Petitioners were able to       settle on terms acceptable to OFAC and implementable by       Petitioners. As a result, Petitioners have agreed to       undertake significant restructuring and corporate governance       changes to address the circumstances that led to their       designation, including significantly reducing Deripaska's       direct and indirect shareholding stake in Petitioners;       overhauling the composition of their boards of  [[Page S29]]       directors; taking other restrictive steps related to their       corporate governance; and agreeing to undertake extensive,       ongoing auditing, certification, and reporting       requirements.       3. Change in Circumstances With Respect to En+, Rusal, and ESE         Since their designation and following months of detailed       negotiations with Treasury, OFAC has secured from Petitioners       a binding agreement that severs Deripaska's control over       these critical revenue-generating entities and reduces his       ownership in these entities below 50 percent, thereby       untangling and protecting these companies from the       controlling influence of a Kremlin insider. The agreement       between OFAC and the Petitioners is subject to approval by a       number of stakeholders. Furthermore, the agreement reached       between OFAC and the Petitioners will create an unprecedented       level of transparency for the U.S. government into these       global companies, along with the other substantial       concessions obtained from them.        With the change in circumstances that led to the original       designations of Petitioners, including Petitioners' ongoing       substantial commitments, this letter serves as notification       of Treasury's intention to terminate the sanctions imposed on       En+, Rusal, and ESE in 30 days. Treasury also assesses that       this action--a removal based on a change in factual       circumstances that is in line with longstanding U.S.       sanctions precedent and practice designed to change       behavior--is not intended to significantly alter U.S. foreign       policy.        We stress that Deripaska will remain sanctioned and on       OFAC's SDN List. All of Deripaska's property and interests in       property, including entities in which he owns a fifty percent       or greater interest, will remain blocked. The result of       OFAC's conditions for delisting is that Deripaska's       investment in En+ is isolated and frozen. En+ is the linchpin       underlying the designations of these companies, since       Deripaska has virtually no direct ownership stake in Rusal,       and none at all in ESE. Specifically, Deripaska's stake in       En+ will be reduced from approximately 70 percent to 44.95       percent, and his stake cannot be increased in the future.       Pursuant to the agreement, Deripaska's stake in En+ will be       reduced through corporate restructuring transactions that do       not involve the transfer of funds directly or indirectly to       Deripaska, as well as by a donation of shares to a charitable       foundation. None of the transactions to be undertaken       consistent with the agreement will allow Deripaska to obtain       cash either in return for his shares or from future dividends       issued by En+, Rusal, or ESE. Future dividends to which       Deripaska may be entitled due to his diminished ownership       interests will be placed into a blocked account. Furthermore,       foreign persons will be subject to secondary sanctions under       section 228 of the CAATSA should they knowingly facilitate a       significant transaction for or on behalf of Deripaska.       Finally, OFAC has made it clear to the Petitioners that it       reserves the right to relist any or all of the Petitioners       should the change in circumstances represented by their       implementation of the agreement with OFAC be reversed,       including by a material breach of the terms of the agreement.      4. Details of the Restructuring Agreed to by En+, Rusal, and ESE         The significant restructuring and corporate governance       changes agreed to by Petitioners have been documented in a       ``Terms of Removal,'' which is a binding agreement between       Petitioners and OFAC that remains in effect as long as       Deripaska is on the SDN List. The foundation of this       agreement is the role of En+ in the restructuring and       corporate governance changes. Deripaska will have no direct       ownership stake in ESE and will retain only a 0.01 percent       direct ownership stake in Rusal. En+ will own and control       Rusal and ESE, which operates to isolate and freeze       Deripaska's indirect ownership in Rusal and ESE. Through the       Terms of Removal, Petitioners agreed to implement the       following:        Deripaska's ownership in En+ brought well below 50 percent.       Deripaska's stake in En+ will fall from approximately 70       percent to 44.95 percent, and his stake cannot be increased.       Pursuant to the Terms of Removal, VTB Bank or another non-SDN       assignee approved by OFAC (``VTB Bank'') will take ownership       of a block of Deripaska's shares in En+ pledged as collateral       for previously issued obligations of entities controlled by       Deripaska issued by VTB Bank. Deripaska's ownership interest       in En+ will fall further as a result of a restructuring       transaction whereby the Swiss company Glencore, or its       subsidiary, swaps shares in Rusal for a direct ownership       interest in En+. The end result of these corporate       transactions will be a significant fall in Deripaska's       ownership of En+, none of which involve the transfer of funds       directly or indirectly to Deripaska. Deripaska will also       donate a block of shares to a charitable foundation. None of       the transactions to be undertaken consistent with the       agreement will allow Deripaska to obtain cash either in       return for his shares or from future dividends issued by En+,       Rusal, or ESE.        Limited voting rights in En+. Deripaska will not be able to       vote more than 35 percent of En+ shares, as Deripaska will       assign any voting rights above 35 percent of En+ shares to a       voting trust obligated to vote in the same manner as the       majority of shares held by shareholders other than Deripaska.       Furthermore, OFAC has identified several shareholders with       professional or family ties to Deripaska. In all such cases,       En+ has agreed to assign the voting rights under these shares       to an independent third party with no personal or       professional ties to Deripaska. Furthermore, VTB Bank will       reassign voting rights associated with the shares it takes       ownership of to an independent third party.        Independent board of directors for En+. En+ agreed to       create a board of 12 directors with a majority of independent       directors. Eight of the directors will be independent of       Deripaska and selected through an agreed-to process that       utilizes an executive search firm to select members with no       business, professional, or family ties to Deripaska or any       other designated person. With these changes, half of the En+       board will now be U.S. or UK nationals with extensive       business expertise. OFAC has vetted the entire slate of the       proposed new board members. Prior to designation, En+'s board       was not majority-independent and consisted of 12 directors,       of whom only three were independent non-executive directors.       Deripaska will have the right to nominate no more than four       directors. Replacements for these eight will be selected       through the same process, with an opportunity for further       review by OFAC. En+ has agreed that Directors nominated by       Deripaska will not be permitted to sit on the Audit or       Nominations committees.        Further extinguishment of control. To further extinguish       potential avenues of control by Deripaska, Deripaska is       required by the Terms of Removal to provide a deed letter to       En+ that includes a number of binding legal commitments       severing his ability to control En+. Specifically, the deed       letter provides that En+ and Deripaska explicitly agree not       to act in any manner or to enter into any arrangement,       whether by contract, trust, or otherwise, that directly or       indirectly provides Deripaska with the ability to exercise a       controlling influence over the management or policies of En+       or any entity owned or controlled by En+, including Rusal and       ESE. En+ also has agreed to certify that, besides the right       to nominate four directors, it has not granted Deripaska or       any of his relatives any rights beyond those of ordinary       shareholders with respect to En+ and any entity owned or       controlled by En+.        Ongoing transparency through auditing, certification, and       reporting. The Petitioners have agreed to provide OFAC with       an unprecedented level of transparency into the management       and operation of these companies. En+ and Rusal agreed to       comply with ongoing auditing, certification, and reporting       requirements, including: (i) auditing En+'s and Rusal's       engagements with and obligations to Deripaska and any       entities controlled by Deripaska as well as certifications       that such engagements have been terminated or do not       constitute control by Deripaska; (ii) providing OFAC monthly       certifications of compliance with the agreed upon Terms of       Removal; (iii) providing OFAC quarterly company reports for       En+ and Rusal; (iv) providing OFAC board minutes for En+ and       Rusal; (v) immediately notifying OFAC of any change in the       composition of the independent En+ board and certifying that       any such change is consistent with the selection process       outlined in the Terms of Removal; (vi) immediately notifying       OFAC of any anticipated changes to the identity of any       independent third party assigned voting rights in relation to       En+ and certifying that such individual has no business,       professional, or family ties to Deripaska or any other SDN;       (vii) immediately notifying OFAC of any anticipated change in       ownership of shares of En+ related to the Terms of Removal       and certifying, inter alia, that the change is consistent       with the Terms of Removal and that Deripaska's ownership       shall not rise above 44.95 percent; (viii) immediately       notifying OFAC of any anticipated changes to the constituent       documents of any of the Petitioners and certifying the       anticipated changes are consistent with the Terms of Removal.        In all cases, notifications and certifications required to       be made under the Terms of Removal are designed to ensure       that Deripaska cannot obtain increased influence over En+ or       Rusal by changes in the management or ownership of En+.       Furthermore, En+ has agreed that no entity owned or       controlled by En+, including En+ and Rusal, will change its       place of incorporation to Russia from any other jurisdiction       without an affirmative vote of the new En+ board and       certifications to OFAC.        En+ has agreed to respond fully and expeditiously to any       request for information from OFAC regarding the Terms of       Removal or general sanctions compliance. OFAC will continue       to actively monitor the Petitioners' compliance with the       Terms of Removal for any information suggesting that       Deripaska, any entity in which he owns a 50 percent or       greater interest, or any other blocked person seeks to       influence the Petitioners. All of the information provided       and certifications En+ is required to make under the Terms       of Removal will be directed to OFAC's Office of Global       Targeting, the office that develops evidentiary packages       to designate individuals and entities and which manages       the delisting process.        Additional commitments with respect to Rusal. OFAC       designated Rusal for being owned or controlled by En+.       Therefore, through the same binding agreement with OFAC,       Rusal and En+ agreed that En+, once it is no longer subject       to sanctions, shall continue to control Rusal through a 56.88       percent stake and that En+ shall retain its right to nominate       the CEO of Rusal.  [[Page S30]]       Deripaska will only retain a direct shareholding interest in       Rusal of 0.01 percent and any dividends from this interest       would be placed in a blocked account. En+ has committed to       use its majority control of Rusal to create a board of 14       members, and a majority of those board members (eight) will       be independent non-executive directors who have no business,       professional, or family ties to Deripaska, or any other SDN.       The Chairman of the Board of Rusal will be one of the       independent non-executive directors, and the current Chairman       of Rusal (Matthias Warnig) is stepping down as a condition of       the delisting of Rusal and further will no longer be a member       of the Rusal board. The other six directors will likewise       have no business, professional, or family ties to Deripaska,       or any other SDN, other than their professional backgrounds       as employees of Rusal or En+. Deripaska will have no right to       appoint any board members of Rusal. Prior to designation,       Rusal's board was not majority-independent and consisted of       18 directors, of whom only six were independent non-executive       directors. OFAC has vetted the current slate of directors for       Rusal's board, will review any future independent director       candidates, and will monitor all director appointments to       ensure Rusal's ongoing compliance with the Terms of Removal.       Rusal has also agreed to extensive certification and       reporting requirements similar to those agreed to by En+.       Furthermore, En+ has agreed that it will use its majority       control of Rusal to provide ongoing auditing and monitoring       of potential Deripaska involvement in Rusal.        Commitments with respect to ESE. OFAC designated ESE for       being owned or controlled by En+ and Deripaska. ESE is a       Russian power company and a wholly owned subsidiary of En+.       It does not have an independent board of directors, and day-      to-day management is the responsibility of the General       Director, who is appointed and overseen by the En+ board of       directors. The change in ownership and control of En+       described above would also extinguish Deripaska's control of       ESE. Deripaska will not have any direct shareholding interest       in ESE. Furthermore, ESE's General Director will provide OFAC       with monthly certifications that he or she is not acting for       or on behalf of Deripaska, or any other SDN, and that control       over ESE rests with the General Director of ESE and En+. As a       wholly owned subsidiary of En+, the reporting and       certification requirements that En+ committed to will       necessarily encompass ESE operations and management.                 5. Ongoing OFAC Monitoring and Enforcement         OFAC will continue to enforce its sanctions on Deripaska       aggressively, including by closely monitoring the       Petitioners' compliance with the Terms of Removal (``TOR'').       Should one or all of the Petitioners fail to abide by the       binding TOR, OFAC will consider all remedies at its disposal,       including re-designating the offending entity.        Enforcement through complete transparency. The TOR agreed       to between OFAC and Petitioners require unprecedented       transparency. The Petitioners must regularly provide OFAC       with information and certifications about their compliance       with the TOR. This will supplement and be confirmed with the       U.S. Government's own information.        The Petitioners are required to provide OFAC monthly       certifications regarding independence from Deripaska and any       other designated person; En+ and Rusal, which make extensive       commitments in the TOR, are required to certify monthly to       their compliance with respect to all elements of the TOR.        En+ and Rusal are required to submit to OFAC copies of       their quarterly reports, board minutes, and audit reports       related to Deripaska's or other designated persons' potential       collateral involvement in En+ and Rusal.        En+ and Rusal are required to give OFAC notice of and an       opportunity to respond to anticipated changes in the       composition of their boards, as well as of anticipated       changes to third parties assigned voting rights pursuant to       the commitments in the TOR.        En+ and Rusal are required to commit to respond in full and       on a timely basis to any additional questions from OFAC       related to compliance with the TOR.        En+ and Rusal are required to agree that if OFAC provides       En+/Rusal with information that bears on the compliance of       En+/Rusal with any of the elements of the TOR--including with       respect to the independence of any of the eight non-Deripaska       appointed directors of En+ or with respect to any of the       eight independent non-executive directors of Rusal--En+/Rusal       will report to OFAC promptly on any actions that will be       undertaken to remediate the issues identified by OFAC and       will provide OFAC with an opportunity to respond or object to       those actions.        OFAC reserves the right to relist any or all of the       Petitioners to the extent that the change in circumstances       represented by Petitioners' entering into and adhering to the       TOR is reversed, including by a material breach of the TOR.        Additional mechanisms for enforcement. Over and above the       TOR, OFAC retains broad authorities to potentially designate       or bring an enforcement action for direct or indirect       dealings with Deripaska or any other designated person in the       course of dealing with the Petitioners.        Notwithstanding the delisting of the Petitioners, Deripaska       remains sanctioned. OFAC, therefore, has the authority to       designate any person for providing, directly or indirectly,       material support to Deripaska, including, for example, an       ``independent'' director who acts at Deripaska's behest.        Notwithstanding a delisting of the Petitioners, U.S.       persons will continue to be prohibited from dealing, directly       or indirectly, with Deripaska or any other designated person.       OFAC's civil enforcement authorities and processes to address       such a situation are described in detail in OFAC's Economic       Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. part 501, app. A.        Notwithstanding a delisting of the Petitioners, non-U.S.       persons will face potential secondary sanctions for knowingly       facilitating significant transactions for or on behalf of       Deripaska or any other person or entity subject to sanctions       imposed by the United States with respect to the Russian       Federation, as described in OFAC's guidance.                               6. Conclusion         Treasury officials stand ready to engage and answer any       questions that may arise upon review of this submission,       Moreover, the Petitioners have confirmed their consent to the       release of the proprietary information contained in the TOR       to the appropriate congressional leadership and committees as       may be necessary. Please feel free to reach out to Treasury's       Office of Legislative Affairs at (202) 622-1900 if you would       like to discuss this matter further.            Sincerely,                                                   Andrea M. Gacki,                        Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control.          Without objection, so ordered.                                     Department of the Treasury,                                  Washington, DC, December 19, 2018.      Hon. Sherrod Brown,      Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban           Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Brown: With this letter, we wish to       provide you with notification that Treasury intends to       terminate the sanctions imposed on En+ Group plc (``En+''),       UC Rusal plc (``Rusal''), and JSC EuroSibEnergo (``ESE'') in       30 days. En+, Rusal, and ESE have agreed to undertake       significant restructuring and corporate governance changes to       address the circumstances that led to their designation,       including reducing Oleg Deripaska's direct and indirect       shareholding stake in those entities to below 50 percent;       overhauling the composition of those entities' boards of       directors; taking restrictive steps related to their       corporate governance; and agreeing to unprecedented       transparency by undertaking extensive, ongoing auditing,       certification, and reporting requirements. As part of this       agreement, half of En+'s restructured board of directors will       be comprised of U.S. or UK nationals and Rusal's current       board chairman will step down. Deripaska will remain       sanctioned. All of Deripaska's property and interests in       property, including entities in which he owns a fifty percent       or greater interest, will remain blocked, and foreign persons       will continue to be subject to secondary sanctions should       they knowingly facilitate a significant transaction for or on       behalf of Deripaska or entities in which he owns a fifty       percent or greater interest. None of the transactions to be       undertaken to divest Deripaska of his interests in these       companies will allow Deripaska to obtain cash either in       return for shares relinquished in, or from future dividends       he may receive from, En+, Rusal, or ESE. OFAC reserves the       right to relist any or all of these companies should the       change in circumstances represented by their implementation       of the agreement with OFAC be reversed, including by a       material breach of the terms of the agreement.                               1. Background         On April 6, 2018, OFAC designated seven Russian oligarchs,       including Oleg Deripaska, and 12 companies they own or       control. This action also targeted 17 senior government       officials as well as a state-owned Russian weapons trading       company and its subsidiary, a Russian bank. The April 6       action aggressively targeted Russian oligarchs and elites       that further the Kremlin's global malign activities,       including its attempts to subvert Western democracy, its       support for the Assad regime, its malicious cyber activities,       its occupation of Crimea, and its instigation of violence in       Ukraine. This sanctions action was one of many that the       Treasury Department has taken to target Russia's malign       behavior. Under this Administration, Treasury has sanctioned       256 Russia-related individuals and entities, including 150       individuals and entities under Ukraine/Russia-related       sanctions authorities codified by the Countering America's       Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).        Among the 12 companies targeted on April 6, OFAC designated       En+ for being owned or controlled by, directly or indirectly,       Deripaska, and placed En+ on its list of Specially Designated       Nationals and Blocked Persons (``SDN List'') pursuant to       Executive Order 13661 of March 16, 2014, ``Blocking Property       of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in       Ukraine'' (``E.O. 13661'') and Executive Order 13662 of March       20, 2014, ``Blocking Property of Additional Persons       Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine'' (``E.O. 13662'').       OFAC also designated Rusal for being owned or controlled by,       directly or indirectly, En+; Deripaska has a 0.01 percent       direct ownership interest in Rusal, and his involvement was       not a basis for the designation of Rusal. OFAC also       designated ESE for being owned or controlled by, directly or       indirectly, En+ and Deripaska. As with En+, OFAC placed both       Rusal and ESE on the SDN List pursuant to E.O. 13661 and E.O.       13662.        The action on April 6 was among the most impactful targeted       sanctions actions ever taken by OFAC and included many of the       globally integrated companies the oligarchs rely on to       generate their wealth. The designation of Rusal, the world's       second largest aluminum producer, was felt immediately in       global aluminum markets. The price of aluminum soared in the       weeks following the designation, and Rusal subsidiaries in       the United States, Ireland, Sweden, Jamaica, Guinea, and       elsewhere faced imminent closure without limited sanctions       mitigation in the form of OFAC general licenses.             2. En+, Rusal, and ESE Petition OFAC for Delisting         As stated publicly by Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin,       the designations of En+, Rusal, and ESE, as well as the       follow-on collateral consequences, were not the primary aim       of the April 6 sanctions against Deripaska. Rather, En+,       Rusal, and ESE were designated due to their entanglement with       Deripaska. Economic sanctions, including those in E.O. 13661       and E.O. 13662, are designed to change behavior. In this       case, the objectives of the sanctions were to reduce       Deripaska's ownership in and sever his control of these       entities.        Upon their designation on April 6, 2018, En+, Rusal, and       ESE (collectively, the ``Petitioners'') approached the U.S.       Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control       (OFAC) to petition for delisting pursuant to 31 C.F.R.       Sec. 501.807. The Petitioners, led by Lord Gregory Barker,       the former Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change       for the United Kingdom, have engaged in negotiations with       OFAC extensively during the past eight months, while OFAC       evaluated whether Petitioners were credibly able to make       material changes in the structure and composition of the       companies such to be eligible for delisting. Petitioners       conducted themselves throughout in a cooperative and       transparent manner. Petitioners submitted proposals whereby       they would sever the ownership and control of Deripaska over       Petitioners. Throughout the negotiations, OFAC pressed for       terms that were targeted towards further restricting       Deripaska. Ultimately, OFAC and the Petitioners were able to       settle on terms acceptable to OFAC and implementable by       Petitioners. As a result, Petitioners have agreed to       undertake significant restructuring and corporate governance       changes to address the circumstances that led to their       designation, including significantly reducing Deripaska's       direct and indirect shareholding stake in Petitioners;       overhauling the composition of their boards of  [[Page S29]]       directors; taking other restrictive steps related to their       corporate governance; and agreeing to undertake extensive,       ongoing auditing, certification, and reporting       requirements.       3. Change in Circumstances With Respect to En+, Rusal, and ESE         Since their designation and following months of detailed       negotiations with Treasury, OFAC has secured from Petitioners       a binding agreement that severs Deripaska's control over       these critical revenue-generating entities and reduces his       ownership in these entities below 50 percent, thereby       untangling and protecting these companies from the       controlling influence of a Kremlin insider. The agreement       between OFAC and the Petitioners is subject to approval by a       number of stakeholders. Furthermore, the agreement reached       between OFAC and the Petitioners will create an unprecedented       level of transparency for the U.S. government into these       global companies, along with the other substantial       concessions obtained from them.        With the change in circumstances that led to the original       designations of Petitioners, including Petitioners' ongoing       substantial commitments, this letter serves as notification       of Treasury's intention to terminate the sanctions imposed on       En+, Rusal, and ESE in 30 days. Treasury also assesses that       this action--a removal based on a change in factual       circumstances that is in line with longstanding U.S.       sanctions precedent and practice designed to change       behavior--is not intended to significantly alter U.S. foreign       policy.        We stress that Deripaska will remain sanctioned and on       OFAC's SDN List. All of Deripaska's property and interests in       property, including entities in which he owns a fifty percent       or greater interest, will remain blocked. The result of       OFAC's conditions for delisting is that Deripaska's       investment in En+ is isolated and frozen. En+ is the linchpin       underlying the designations of these companies, since       Deripaska has virtually no direct ownership stake in Rusal,       and none at all in ESE. Specifically, Deripaska's stake in       En+ will be reduced from approximately 70 percent to 44.95       percent, and his stake cannot be increased in the future.       Pursuant to the agreement, Deripaska's stake in En+ will be       reduced through corporate restructuring transactions that do       not involve the transfer of funds directly or indirectly to       Deripaska, as well as by a donation of shares to a charitable       foundation. None of the transactions to be undertaken       consistent with the agreement will allow Deripaska to obtain       cash either in return for his shares or from future dividends       issued by En+, Rusal, or ESE. Future dividends to which       Deripaska may be entitled due to his diminished ownership       interests will be placed into a blocked account. Furthermore,       foreign persons will be subject to secondary sanctions under       section 228 of the CAATSA should they knowingly facilitate a       significant transaction for or on behalf of Deripaska.       Finally, OFAC has made it clear to the Petitioners that it       reserves the right to relist any or all of the Petitioners       should the change in circumstances represented by their       implementation of the agreement with OFAC be reversed,       including by a material breach of the terms of the agreement.      4. Details of the Restructuring Agreed to by En+, Rusal, and ESE         The significant restructuring and corporate governance       changes agreed to by Petitioners have been documented in a       ``Terms of Removal,'' which is a binding agreement between       Petitioners and OFAC that remains in effect as long as       Deripaska is on the SDN List. The foundation of this       agreement is the role of En+ in the restructuring and       corporate governance changes. Deripaska will have no direct       ownership stake in ESE and will retain only a 0.01 percent       direct ownership stake in Rusal. En+ will own and control       Rusal and ESE, which operates to isolate and freeze       Deripaska's indirect ownership in Rusal and ESE. Through the       Terms of Removal, Petitioners agreed to implement the       following:        Deripaska's ownership in En+ brought well below 50 percent.       Deripaska's stake in En+ will fall from approximately 70       percent to 44.95 percent, and his stake cannot be increased.       Pursuant to the Terms of Removal, VTB Bank or another non-SDN       assignee approved by OFAC (``VTB Bank'') will take ownership       of a block of Deripaska's shares in En+ pledged as collateral       for previously issued obligations of entities controlled by       Deripaska issued by VTB Bank. Deripaska's ownership interest       in En+ will fall further as a result of a restructuring       transaction whereby the Swiss company Glencore, or its       subsidiary, swaps shares in Rusal for a direct ownership       interest in En+. The end result of these corporate       transactions will be a significant fall in Deripaska's       ownership of En+, none of which involve the transfer of funds       directly or indirectly to Deripaska. Deripaska will also       donate a block of shares to a charitable foundation. None of       the transactions to be undertaken consistent with the       agreement will allow Deripaska to obtain cash either in       return for his shares or from future dividends issued by En+,       Rusal, or ESE.        Limited voting rights in En+. Deripaska will not be able to       vote more than 35 percent of En+ shares, as Deripaska will       assign any voting rights above 35 percent of En+ shares to a       voting trust obligated to vote in the same manner as the       majority of shares held by shareholders other than Deripaska.       Furthermore, OFAC has identified several shareholders with       professional or family ties to Deripaska. In all such cases,       En+ has agreed to assign the voting rights under these shares       to an independent third party with no personal or       professional ties to Deripaska. Furthermore, VTB Bank will       reassign voting rights associated with the shares it takes       ownership of to an independent third party.        Independent board of directors for En+. En+ agreed to       create a board of 12 directors with a majority of independent       directors. Eight of the directors will be independent of       Deripaska and selected through an agreed-to process that       utilizes an executive search firm to select members with no       business, professional, or family ties to Deripaska or any       other designated person. With these changes, half of the En+       board will now be U.S. or UK nationals with extensive       business expertise. OFAC has vetted the entire slate of the       proposed new board members. Prior to designation, En+'s board       was not majority-independent and consisted of 12 directors,       of whom only three were independent non-executive directors.       Deripaska will have the right to nominate no more than four       directors. Replacements for these eight will be selected       through the same process, with an opportunity for further       review by OFAC. En+ has agreed that Directors nominated by       Deripaska will not be permitted to sit on the Audit or       Nominations committees.        Further extinguishment of control. To further extinguish       potential avenues of control by Deripaska, Deripaska is       required by the Terms of Removal to provide a deed letter to       En+ that includes a number of binding legal commitments       severing his ability to control En+. Specifically, the deed       letter provides that En+ and Deripaska explicitly agree not       to act in any manner or to enter into any arrangement,       whether by contract, trust, or otherwise, that directly or       indirectly provides Deripaska with the ability to exercise a       controlling influence over the management or policies of En+       or any entity owned or controlled by En+, including Rusal and       ESE. En+ also has agreed to certify that, besides the right       to nominate four directors, it has not granted Deripaska or       any of his relatives any rights beyond those of ordinary       shareholders with respect to En+ and any entity owned or       controlled by En+.        Ongoing transparency through auditing, certification, and       reporting. The Petitioners have agreed to provide OFAC with       an unprecedented level of transparency into the management       and operation of these companies. En+ and Rusal agreed to       comply with ongoing auditing, certification, and reporting       requirements, including: (i) auditing En+'s and Rusal's       engagements with and obligations to Deripaska and any       entities controlled by Deripaska as well as certifications       that such engagements have been terminated or do not       constitute control by Deripaska; (ii) providing OFAC monthly       certifications of compliance with the agreed upon Terms of       Removal; (iii) providing OFAC quarterly company reports for       En+ and Rusal; (iv) providing OFAC board minutes for En+ and       Rusal; (v) immediately notifying OFAC of any change in the       composition of the independent En+ board and certifying that       any such change is consistent with the selection process       outlined in the Terms of Removal; (vi) immediately notifying       OFAC of any anticipated changes to the identity of any       independent third party assigned voting rights in relation to       En+ and certifying that such individual has no business,       professional, or family ties to Deripaska or any other SDN;       (vii) immediately notifying OFAC of any anticipated change in       ownership of shares of En+ related to the Terms of Removal       and certifying, inter alia, that the change is consistent       with the Terms of Removal and that Deripaska's ownership       shall not rise above 44.95 percent; (viii) immediately       notifying OFAC of any anticipated changes to the constituent       documents of any of the Petitioners and certifying the       anticipated changes are consistent with the Terms of Removal.        In all cases, notifications and certifications required to       be made under the Terms of Removal are designed to ensure       that Deripaska cannot obtain increased influence over En+ or       Rusal by changes in the management or ownership of En+.       Furthermore, En+ has agreed that no entity owned or       controlled by En+, including En+ and Rusal, will change its       place of incorporation to Russia from any other jurisdiction       without an affirmative vote of the new En+ board and       certifications to OFAC.        En+ has agreed to respond fully and expeditiously to any       request for information from OFAC regarding the Terms of       Removal or general sanctions compliance. OFAC will continue       to actively monitor the Petitioners' compliance with the       Terms of Removal for any information suggesting that       Deripaska, any entity in which he owns a 50 percent or       greater interest, or any other blocked person seeks to       influence the Petitioners. All of the information provided       and certifications En+ is required to make under the Terms       of Removal will be directed to OFAC's Office of Global       Targeting, the office that develops evidentiary packages       to designate individuals and entities and which manages       the delisting process.        Additional commitments with respect to Rusal. OFAC       designated Rusal for being owned or controlled by En+.       Therefore, through the same binding agreement with OFAC,       Rusal and En+ agreed that En+, once it is no longer subject       to sanctions, shall continue to control Rusal through a 56.88       percent stake and that En+ shall retain its right to nominate       the CEO of Rusal.  [[Page S30]]       Deripaska will only retain a direct shareholding interest in       Rusal of 0.01 percent and any dividends from this interest       would be placed in a blocked account. En+ has committed to       use its majority control of Rusal to create a board of 14       members, and a majority of those board members (eight) will       be independent non-executive directors who have no business,       professional, or family ties to Deripaska, or any other SDN.       The Chairman of the Board of Rusal will be one of the       independent non-executive directors, and the current Chairman       of Rusal (Matthias Warnig) is stepping down as a condition of       the delisting of Rusal and further will no longer be a member       of the Rusal board. The other six directors will likewise       have no business, professional, or family ties to Deripaska,       or any other SDN, other than their professional backgrounds       as employees of Rusal or En+. Deripaska will have no right to       appoint any board members of Rusal. Prior to designation,       Rusal's board was not majority-independent and consisted of       18 directors, of whom only six were independent non-executive       directors. OFAC has vetted the current slate of directors for       Rusal's board, will review any future independent director       candidates, and will monitor all director appointments to       ensure Rusal's ongoing compliance with the Terms of Removal.       Rusal has also agreed to extensive certification and       reporting requirements similar to those agreed to by En+.       Furthermore, En+ has agreed that it will use its majority       control of Rusal to provide ongoing auditing and monitoring       of potential Deripaska involvement in Rusal.        Commitments with respect to ESE. OFAC designated ESE for       being owned or controlled by En+ and Deripaska. ESE is a       Russian power company and a wholly owned subsidiary of En+.       It does not have an independent board of directors, and day-      to-day management is the responsibility of the General       Director, who is appointed and overseen by the En+ board of       directors. The change in ownership and control of En+       described above would also extinguish Deripaska's control of       ESE. Deripaska will not have any direct shareholding interest       in ESE. Furthermore, ESE's General Director will provide OFAC       with monthly certifications that he or she is not acting for       or on behalf of Deripaska, or any other SDN, and that control       over ESE rests with the General Director of ESE and En+. As a       wholly owned subsidiary of En+, the reporting and       certification requirements that En+ committed to will       necessarily encompass ESE operations and management.                 5. Ongoing OFAC Monitoring and Enforcement         OFAC will continue to enforce its sanctions on Deripaska       aggressively, including by closely monitoring the       Petitioners' compliance with the Terms of Removal (``TOR'').       Should one or all of the Petitioners fail to abide by the       binding TOR, OFAC will consider all remedies at its disposal,       including re-designating the offending entity.        Enforcement through complete transparency. The TOR agreed       to between OFAC and Petitioners require unprecedented       transparency. The Petitioners must regularly provide OFAC       with information and certifications about their compliance       with the TOR. This will supplement and be confirmed with the       U.S. Government's own information.        The Petitioners are required to provide OFAC monthly       certifications regarding independence from Deripaska and any       other designated person; En+ and Rusal, which make extensive       commitments in the TOR, are required to certify monthly to       their compliance with respect to all elements of the TOR.        En+ and Rusal are required to submit to OFAC copies of       their quarterly reports, board minutes, and audit reports       related to Deripaska's or other designated persons' potential       collateral involvement in En+ and Rusal.        En+ and Rusal are required to give OFAC notice of and an       opportunity to respond to anticipated changes in the       composition of their boards, as well as of anticipated       changes to third parties assigned voting rights pursuant to       the commitments in the TOR.        En+ and Rusal are required to commit to respond in full and       on a timely basis to any additional questions from OFAC       related to compliance with the TOR.        En+ and Rusal are required to agree that if OFAC provides       En+/Rusal with information that bears on the compliance of       En+/Rusal with any of the elements of the TOR--including with       respect to the independence of any of the eight non-Deripaska       appointed directors of En+ or with respect to any of the       eight independent non-executive directors of Rusal--En+/Rusal       will report to OFAC promptly on any actions that will be       undertaken to remediate the issues identified by OFAC and       will provide OFAC with an opportunity to respond or object to       those actions.        OFAC reserves the right to relist any or all of the       Petitioners to the extent that the change in circumstances       represented by Petitioners' entering into and adhering to the       TOR is reversed, including by a material breach of the TOR.        Additional mechanisms for enforcement. Over and above the       TOR, OFAC retains broad authorities to potentially designate       or bring an enforcement action for direct or indirect       dealings with Deripaska or any other designated person in the       course of dealing with the Petitioners.        Notwithstanding the delisting of the Petitioners, Deripaska       remains sanctioned. OFAC, therefore, has the authority to       designate any person for providing, directly or indirectly,       material support to Deripaska, including, for example, an       ``independent'' director who acts at Deripaska's behest.        Notwithstanding a delisting of the Petitioners, U.S.       persons will continue to be prohibited from dealing, directly       or indirectly, with Deripaska or any other designated person.       OFAC's civil enforcement authorities and processes to address       such a situation are described in detail in OFAC's Economic       Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. part 501, app. A.        Notwithstanding a delisting of the Petitioners, non-U.S.       persons will face potential secondary sanctions for knowingly       facilitating significant transactions for or on behalf of       Deripaska or any other person or entity subject to sanctions       imposed by the United States with respect to the Russian       Federation, as described in OFAC's guidance.                               6. Conclusion         Treasury officials stand ready to engage and answer any       questions that may arise upon review of this submission,       Moreover, the Petitioners have confirmed their consent to the       release of the proprietary information contained in the TOR       to the appropriate congressional leadership and committees as       may be necessary. Please feel free to reach out to Treasury's       Office of Legislative Affairs at (202) 622-1900 if you would       like to discuss this matter further.            Sincerely,                                                   Andrea M. Gacki,                        Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control.
