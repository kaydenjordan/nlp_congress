 Madam Speaker, so far this year, our country has  experienced more than 250 mass shootings. And it is only June. Gun  violence is now the number one cause of death of children in this  country. We cannot let this continue.   The Protecting Our Kids Act is an important step toward curbing gun  violence by limiting high-capacity magazines, raising the minimum age  to buy assault weapons to 21, and encouraging safe storage practices.   If these measures had been in place, the 18-year-old gunman in  Uvalde, Texas, would not have been able to buy the two assault weapons  he used to murder 19 children and two teachers.   The Dayton, Ohio, shooter would not have been able to buy the high- capacity magazine that allowed him to shoot 26 people in 30 seconds.   Madam Speaker, we can't solve this complex problem at once, but  neither can we desist from taking commonsense measures to help make  this country safer for our children. Let's honor our oath. Let's do our  job to keep the American people safe. Vote ``yes'' on this bill. It is  the least we can do for our constituents.
