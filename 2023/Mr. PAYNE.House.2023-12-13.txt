 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the Gun Violence  Prevention and Community Safety Act.   This bill would take important steps towards ending the epidemic of  gun violence in our country.   It would create a license gun owners would need to get before the  purchase of a firearm. It would require universal background checks and  close loopholes to avoid them. It would ban individuals who present a  safety risk from owning a gun. It would raise the minimum age for  buying a gun and establish a 7-day waiting period before a gun purchase  could be made. It would ban military-style assault weapons and ghost  guns. It would hold the gun industry accountable for the harm their  products cause to society, and it would provide funding for Federal  research into gun violence.   We must do something to stop this country's epidemic of gun violence.  The longer we wait, the more lives we lose.                            ____________________
