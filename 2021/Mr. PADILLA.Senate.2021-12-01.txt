 Madam President.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, this  bill is yet another attempt by our Republican colleagues to stoke fear  about the migrations we are seeing at the southern border rather than  work collaboratively with us to actually address the issue and their  stated concerns.   For a decade now, we have seen increasing arrivals at the southern  border, especially of vulnerable populations. I am talking about  families and unaccompanied children, many who are fleeing horrific  conditions in their home countries, such as gang violence, drug  trafficking, corruption, a global health pandemic, or the devastating  effects of climate change, if not a multitude of these dangers. It is  unsafe for many of them to remain in their countries, and so they make  the arduous journey to the United States to seek asylum and, heaven  forbid, a better future.    Asylum seekers aren't just seeking a better life; they are simply  trying to not die or to not be killed. Too many policymakers act like  asylum seekers are simply choosing to come here, but, given the  horrific conditions in their home countries, it is really no choice at  all. So I am deeply disappointed to see Republicans in both the House  and the Senate distorting these desperate young children and families  at the border into some sort of threat to our Nation.   Responsibly addressing migration requires going beyond partisan  finger-pointing. We must, instead, thoughtfully address the root causes  of migration and reform our border to ensure an orderly, secure, and  well-managed process that treats migrants fairly and humanely. I have  been frustrated that, despite numerous--and I mean numerous--bipartisan  meetings on immigration reform, our Republican colleagues seem more  interested in scoring political points rather than in pursuing  meaningful solutions. They simply refuse to truly engage.   This bill would create onerous, repetitive, and unnecessary reporting  and investigative requirements for the inspector general of the  Department of Homeland Security and require the inspector general to  report on these items every 60 days for the foreseeable future, not to  mention that many of the requirements in the bill are frivolous,  irrelevant, or duplicative. For example, the bill would require the  Department of Homeland Security to report on the number of migrants  resettled when the DHS isn't even the Agency that handles the  resettlement of migrants. The DHS already has an Office of Immigration  Statistics that does report on many of the same statistics that this  bill would now require the inspector general to report on.   Finally, much of the rhetoric from my colleagues has centered around  the  [[Page S8848]]  large increase on the number of encounters at the border. Let me  emphasize the word ``encounters'' at the border. However, these numbers  ignore the large rates of recidivism that we are seeing. The ongoing  use of title 42 to block and expel asylum seekers at the southern  border has led to an increase in the number of people crossing the  border more than once. Under title 42, single adults are rapidly  processed at the border and sent right back to Mexico without a  deportation order. What this arrangement has, in essence, done is  incentivize repeated attempted crossings. According to the Migration  Policy Institute, the recidivism rate is somewhere between 28 and 38  percent. So this encounter statistic that is being called for is  actually misleading.   I am more than willing to work with my colleague here to try to  develop actual solutions to address migration at our border, but when I  say ``solutions,'' I mean real solutions--solutions that recognize the  fundamental humanity of the desperate children and families who simply  want to live to see their next birthdays and solutions that stay true  to the values of our Nation.   So, yes, I object.    Madam President, I rise to celebrate the life and  mourn the passing of Bruce Corwin, a pillar of the sports and  entertainment industries, a dedicated philanthropist, and a dear  friend.   Born and raised in California, Bruce believed deeply in the power of  people. As a college student at Wesleyan, he traveled to Baltimore to  march alongside Martin Luther King, Jr., and he protested fraternity  discrimination by starting a new, inclusive group. After graduating in  1962, he participated in the Coro Fellows Program for aspiring public  servants, the start of a lifelong relationship with Coro through which  Bruce supported generations of civic leaders.   Bruce made his career at Metropolitan Theaters, his family's  business, which brought English- and Spanish-language movies to  theaters across the Southwest. He was the third generation of his  family to oversee the company, and he led it with passion for 40 years.  Bruce extended his leadership into the community, where he was  [[Page S8862]]  known for organizing mentorship and tutoring programs at his alma  mater, Los Angeles High School. He supported countless charitable  causes and was a beloved leader in California's Jewish community.   I first met Bruce in 1994, when I was a Coro Fellow. Over the years,  we bonded over talks of family, community, and leadership, as well as  baseball, movies, and just a little politics. He always supported my  public service aspirations. And he was an invaluable partner in  fulfilling one of my passion projects, to open a state-of-the-art  children's museum in the San Fernando Valley. After a 14-year journey,  the Discovery Cube Los Angeles opened its doors in 2014.   Bruce was incredibly kind, wise, generous, and compassionate.  Everyone who knew Bruce felt blessed by his infectious and infinite  optimism and inspiration. On a personal note, I remain in incredible  admiration of the love that he and his wife Toni shared. It reminds me  so much of the love and commitment my own parents shared.   My wife Angela and I send our deepest condolences, love, and prayers  to Toni Corwin and the entire Corwin family. We were blessed to share  in so many great memories with the countless people around the country  that Bruce touched and inspired throughout his life.                            ____________________
