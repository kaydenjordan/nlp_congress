 Mr. Speaker, I represent nearly 50,000  veterans across North Carolina's First Congressional District, more  than 10,000 of whom sustained injuries while serving our country.   Because of their sacrifice, I introduced a bipartisan Veteran  Caregiver Application and Appeals Reform Act of 2023, or the CARE Act  of 2023, for the specific purpose of helping to repay our veterans who  can never fully be repaid.   The CARE Act, introduced with Congresswoman Jen Kiggans of Virginia  and Congressman Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, allows veterans service  organizations and other accredited agents to advocate for disabled  veterans while directing the VA to hire medical specialists to review  applications.   We must allow servicemembers who nearly died for this country to  assess the resources they need to apply for assistance. We must always  keep our country's promises to our heroes in eastern North Carolina and  across this Nation.                            ____________________
