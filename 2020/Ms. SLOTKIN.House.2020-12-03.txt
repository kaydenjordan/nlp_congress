 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate the 75th  anniversary of VFW Post 334 in Oxford, Michigan.   Since its founding, VFW Post 334 has served the local community in  Oxford. Whether it is their shelf at the Oxford/Orion food pantry, a  float in the annual Christmas parade, a regular fish fry, or  maintaining the Orion Veterans Memorial, residents can count on the  post to show up and support the community.   Post 334 is committed to making a difference in the lives of  veterans. By praying for those deployed, supporting their families at  home, providing a form to gather and share experiences of service, and  honoring those who are no longer with us, the VFW preserves the bonds  that are forged through military service.   For its work, Post 334 was recognized in 2019 as a Michigan All-State  Post for the third year in a row. Most recently, it was awarded the  Diamond Jubilee Award, given to VFW charters that have demonstrated  exceptional service for three-quarters of a century.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Quartermaster Chuck Haskin, Senior  Advisor Commander Randy Stetson, and Post Commander Jim Hubbard for  their leadership and their service to the North Oakland community.   The spirit of Post 334 is perhaps best said by Commander Hubbard:  ``We honor the dead by helping the living.''   Mr. Speaker, in addition to these remarks which will live on in the  Record of the people's House, it is my privilege to recognize their  service by arranging for a flag to be flown over the Capitol in their  honor. This flag will be presented in Oxford to recognize their  continued service to community and to country.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Post 334 on a successful 75 years and  wish them the best in the 75 years to come.                            ____________________
