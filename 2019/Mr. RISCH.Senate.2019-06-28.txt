POLICY JUSTIFICATION                      Germany--AGM-88E AARGM Missiles         The Government of Germany has requested to buy, through the       NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) acting as its       Agent, up to ninety-one (91) AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation       Guided Missile (AARGM) Tactical Missiles, and up to eight (8)       AGM-88E AARGM Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM). Also       included are up to six (6) telemetry/flight termination       systems, Flight Data Recorders (FDR), U.S. Government and       contractor engineering, technical and logistics support       services and miscellaneous support equipment, and other       related elements of logistical and program support. The total       estimated cost is $122.86 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a NATO ally, which is an important force for       political and economic stability in Europe. It is vital to       the U.S. national interests that Germany develops and       maintains a strong and ready self-defense capability.        The AGM-88E AARGM is an upgrade to the older generation       AGM-88B High-Speed AntiRadiation Missile (HARM), which       Germany first purchased in 1988. The AGM-88E AARGMs in this       case will be manufactured using a mixture of new components       and older sections from Germany's existing stock of AGM-88Bs       provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). Germany       will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment and support       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        Germany has requested that the NSPA act as its agent for       the FMS procurement and case management to support the AARGM       program. The principal U.S. contractor will be NGIS,       Ridgecrest, CA. The integration efforts will be via a Direct       Commercial Sale (DCS), initiated by the Luftwaffe, between       the Tornado Management Agency (NETMA) and the AARGM Original       Equipment Manufacturer, Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems,       formerly known as Orbital ATK (OA). There are no known offset       agreements associated with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require five U.S.       government personnel and three contractor representatives to       travel to Germany to provide Program Management Reviews. Two       visits are planned per year over the next five years.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-24       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile       (AARGM) AGM-88E weapon system is an air-to-ground missile       intended to suppress or destroy land or sea-based radar       emitters associated with enemy air defenses and provides       tactical air forces with a lethal countermeasure to enemy       radar directed, surface-to-air missiles, and air defense       artillery weapons systems. Destruction or suppression of       enemy radars denies the enemy the use of air defense systems,       thereby improving the survivability of our tactical aircraft.       It uses a multimode seeker that incorporates global       positioning system/inertial measurement unit (GPS/IMU)       midcourse guidance, a radio frequency (RF) radiation homing       receiver, an active millimeter. When assembled, the AGM-88E       AARGM is classified SECRET. The AARGM Guidance Section       (seeker hardware) and Control Section with the Target       Detector is classified CONFIDENTIAL.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that the Government of       Germany can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This sale supports the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives as outlined in the Policy       Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Germany.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin       Corporation, Bethesda, Maryland. The purchaser typically       requests offsets. Any offset agreement will be defined in       negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of additional U.S. Government and/or contractor       representatives to Morocco.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________
