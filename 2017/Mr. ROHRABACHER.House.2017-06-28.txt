 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3003. This is  a very positive first step toward coming to grips with an issue that  has divided this country because it is causing great damage to so many  Americans.   What we are talking about is not immigrant hysteria. That type of  mixing legal immigrants with illegal immigrants, that is the true  racism because it hurts those people who have come here legally. Now,  what we have got here are legal immigrants who are being cast into the  same pot as illegals, with the opposition to this bill.   People who are here legally understand that we need protection for  people who are here in this country against, especially, criminals who  come from overseas and illegal aliens who are criminals, at that.   Working Americans of every race, religion, and ethnic group have seen  that their families are less secure, and they are even sometimes being  murdered by the insane lack of action on the part of our government to  protect our citizens.   Our number one responsibility is to make sure our own people, legal  immigrants, and all Americans of every race, creed, and color are  protected.   And what do they see?   This massive flood of illegals coming into our country, taking jobs,  bidding down wages, lowering the education standards and the healthcare  that most Americans rely upon.                                time  1315    No wonder the American people want action. But then, when they are  faced with a city saying even criminals who have committed acts of  aggression, murder, et cetera, upon our citizens, that we are going to  let them just stay, and that there is going to be a block.   Whose side are you on is what this amendment is all about. Are we on  the side of the American people? Are we on the side of those victims  who work hard every day and try to raise their families; or are we on  the side of a massive flow of people, many of whom, and most of whom,  are good people?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Most of the people who come here, most of the people  flooding here, even the illegals, are basically wonderful people. But  that doesn't mean that we can bring in more than that, 1 million--   By the way, we need to understand, don't condemn America on its  immigration policy. We let a million legal immigrants into our country  every year, and that is more than the rest of the world combined. We  can be proud of that.   But, at the same time, we have to make sure that our people are  protected, that they don't lose their jobs, or they don't have to  accept less money for the same work because you have got somebody here  who will work for nothing.   We want to make sure when they need their healthcare, they get their  healthcare. That will bankrupt our system. Are we going to have a  sanctuary healthcare system, too, so anybody in the world can come here  and use up our scarce health dollars?   No, it is time for us to strike a blow for the protection of  Americans and legal immigrants of every race and religion and ethnic  background, not to show these things. Immigrant hysteria; shame, shame,  shame.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I include in the Record a letter to every Member of Congress from The  Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights in opposition to this  bill; a letter to all of us from the ACLU in opposition to this bill; a  letter to every Member of Congress from the National Task Force to End  Sexual & Domestic Violence that is in opposition to this bill; as well  as a letter to Members of Congress from the United States Conference of  Catholic Bishops and Catholic Charities USA in opposition to this bill;  and a letter from NETWORK, which is a lobby for Catholic social justice  in opposition to this bill.                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.   Oppose the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's                             Law'' (H.R. 3004)         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200       national advocacy organizations, I urge you to oppose H.R.       3003, the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' and H.R. 3004,       ``Kate's Law.'' These two bills may sound ``tough,'' but they       would ultimately make the problems with our national       immigration system even worse than they already are.        H.R. 3003 would unnecessarily and unwisely penalize states       and municipalities that are attempting to strike the delicate       balance between cooperating with federal immigration       authorities, on one hand, and respecting the constraints       imposed on them by the U.S. Constitution, on the other. At       the same time, it would do nothing to address the       constitutional concerns raised by the use of immigration       ``detainer'' requests, concerns that the Department of       Homeland Security (DHS) itself has recognized in the past.        Among its provisions, H.R. 3003 would eliminate various       federal law enforcement grants to states and municipalities,       such as the ``Cops on the Beat'' program, unless       jurisdictions comply with all DHS detainer requests. It aims       to overturn local policies adopted by over 300 jurisdictions       across the country that have determined, as a matter of       constitutional law and sound public policy, including       community policing efforts, that they cannot hold individuals       beyond their release dates solely on the basis of a DHS       detainer request.        The senseless and tragic 2015 killing of Kathryn Steinle in       San Francisco has renewed the debate over so-called       ``sanctuary cities.'' Yet the term suggests, incorrectly,       that certain states and municipalities are refusing to work       with federal immigration enforcement authorities. The truth       is that state and local law enforcement agencies (``LEAs'')       throughout the country already aid in the identification of       individuals who are subject to immigration enforcement action       through the sharing of fingerprints of those who are taken       into custody. LEAs with limited detainer policies have       determined, however, that they cannot continue to detain       individuals for immigration enforcement purposes, under the       Fourth Amendment and pursuant to numerous court rulings,       unless DHS obtains a judicial warrant, as all other law       enforcement agencies are required to do.        H.R. 3003 would not address the Fourth Amendment concerns       raised by the use of DHS detainers. Instead, it would leave       many state and municipal governments in an untenable       position: either they must disregard their constitutional       responsibilities and erode the trust they have built between       the police and the communities they serve, or they will face       the loss of vital federal law enforcement funding that helps       them fight crime in their jurisdictions. Congress should not       force such an arbitrary and unwise choice on cities.        H.R. 3004, the other immigration-related bill expected to       come to the House floor this week, would significantly       increase sentences for previously-removed individuals who       reenter the country. While the bill is an improvement over       other bills by the same name, in that it does not include       mandatory minimum sentencing provisions, it would still lead       to a likely increase in the federal prison population without       any tangible benefits. The Department of Justice's       ``Operation Streamline'' program, upon which this bill would       build, has already shown that increased criminal prosecutions       do little but waste resources while failing to deter       unauthorized border crossings. It should be ended, not       expanded.        For these reasons, I urge you to vote against H.R. 3003 and       H.R. 3004.            Sincerely,                                                      Vanita Gupta,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                   American Civil Liberties Union,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.      Re ACLU Opposes H.R. 3003 (No Sanctuary for Criminals Act)           and H.R. 3004 (Kate's Law).      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       the American Civil Liberties Union (``ACLU''), we submit this       letter to the House of Representatives to express our strong       opposition to H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,       and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law.                  no sanctuary for criminals act (h.r. 3003)         H.R. 3003 conflicts with the principles of the Fourth       Amendment.        H.R. 3003 defies the Fourth Amendment by amending 8 USC       Section 1373 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA'')       to force localities to comply with unlawful detainer requests       or risk losing federal funding. This is despite the fact that       an ``increasing number of federal court decisions'' have held       that ``detainer-based detention by state and local law       enforcement agencies violates the  [[Page H5257]]       Fourth Amendment,'' as recognized by former Department of       Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2014.        Disturbingly, H.R. 3003 seeks to penalize the 600+       localities that abide by the Fourth Amendment. These       jurisdictions have recognized that by entangling local       authorities and federal immigration enforcement, immigration       detainers erode trust between immigrant communities and local       law enforcement. In this way, immigration detainers       ultimately undermine public safety, as entire communities       become wary of seeking assistance from police and other       government authorities that are supposed to provide help in       times of need. Thus, by forcing jurisdictions to comply with       unlawful detainer requests, H.R. 3003 will only make       communities less safe, not more.        H.R. 3003 would also amend Section 287 of the INA to allow       the Department of Homeland Security (``DHS') to take custody       of a person being held under a detainer within 48 hours       (excluding weekends and holidays) ``but in no instance more       than 96 hours'' following the date that the individual would       otherwise be released from criminal custody. This, again,       raises serious Fourth Amendment concerns, as the Supreme       Court has stated that the Constitution requires a judicial       finding of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest. This       provision would disregard the Court's ruling entirely and       allow a local law enforcement agency to hold a person for up       to 7 days before requiring DHS intervention--and never       requiring the person be brought before a judge for a probable       cause hearing.        Protection against unreasonable detention by the government       is the bedrock of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which       provides that the government cannot hold anyone in jail       without getting a warrant or approval from a neutral       magistrate. This constitutional protection applies to       everyone in the United States--citizen and immigrant alike.        Immigration detainers, however, do not abide by these       standards. Detainers are one of the key tools that DHS uses       to apprehend individuals who come in contact with local and       state law enforcement agencies. An immigration detainer is a       written request from DHS to that local law enforcement       agency, requesting that they detain an individual for an       additional 48 hours after the person's release date, in order       to allow immigration agents extra time to decide whether to       take that person into custody for deportation purposes.        DHS' use of detainers to imprison people without due       process, without any charges pending, and without probable       cause of a criminal violation flies in the face of our Fourth       Amendment protections. Policies that allow DHS to detain       people at-will are ripe for civil and human rights violations       and have resulted in widespread wrongful detentions,       including detentions of U.S. citizens. That is why many of       the 600+ localities targeted by H.R. 3003 have decided not to       execute a DHS immigration detainer request unless it is       accompanied by additional evidence, a determination of       probable cause, or a judicial warrant.        Unfortunately, H.R. 3003 does nothing to address the       fundamental constitutional problems plaguing DHS's use of       immigration detainers. Rather than fix the constitutional       problems by requiring a judicial warrant, the bill       perpetuates the unconstitutional detainer practices and       forces the federal government to absorb legal liability for       the constitutional violations which will inevitably result.       This is irresponsible lawmaking. Instead of saddling       taxpayers with the liability the federal government will       incur from Fourth Amendment violations, Congress should end       the use of DHS's unconstitutional detainer requests.        H.R. 3003 violates the Due Process Clause by allowing DHS       to detain people indefinitely without a bond hearing.        Section 4 of H.R. 3003 radically expands our immigration       detention system by amending Section 236(c) of the INA to       authorize mandatory detention ``without time limitation.''       This empowers DHS to detain countless immigrants for as long       as it takes to conclude removal proceedings--even if that       takes years--without the basic due process of a bond hearing       to determine if their imprisonment is even justified. This is       a clear constitutional violation, as the federal courts have       overwhelmingly held that jailing immigrants for months and       years without bond hearings raises serious problems under the       Due Process Clause.        Although the bill claims to provide for the ``detention of       criminal aliens,'' it massively expands mandatory detention       to people with no criminal record whatsoever, including       immigrants who lack legal papers or who overstay a tourist       visa. The ``lock `em up'' approach to immigration enforcement       is cruel, irrational, and unconstitutional. The Supreme Court       has permitted brief periods of mandatory detention only in       cases where individuals are charged with deportation based on       certain criminal convictions. The Court has not endorsed the       mandatory lock-up of people who have never committed a crime.                            Kate's Law (H.R. 3004)         H.R. 3004 is piecemeal immigration enforcement that expands       America's federal prison population and lines the coffers of       private prison companies.        Increasing the maximum sentences for illegal reentrants is       unnecessary, wasteful, and inhumane. H.R. 3004 envisions a       federal criminal justice system that prosecutes asylum-      seekers, persons providing humanitarian assistance to       migrants in distress, and parents who pose no threat to       public safety in returning to the U.S. to reunite with       children who need their care (individuals with children in       the United States are 50 percent of those convicted of       illegal reentry).        Current law already imposes a sentence of up to 20 years on       anyone convicted of illegally reentering the country who has       committed an aggravated felony. U.S. Attorneys' Offices       aggressively enforce these provisions. According to the U.S.       Sentencing Commission, immigration prosecutions account for       52 percent of all federal prosecutions--surpassing drugs,       weapons, fraud and thousands of other crimes. Nearly 99       percent of illegal reentry defendants are sentenced to       federal prison time.        H.R. 3004 would drastically expand America's prison       population of nonviolent prisoners at a time when there is       bipartisan support to reduce the federal prison population.       It offends due process by cutting off all collateral attacks       on unjust prior deportation orders, despite the Supreme       Court's contrary ruling in United States v. Mendoza-Lopez.       Profiteering by private prison companies has been the main       consequence of border-crossing prosecutions, which the       Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of       Inspector General have criticized as lacking sound deterrent       support.        H.R. 3004 is an integral part of this administration's mass       deportation and mass incarceration agenda. Longer sentences       for illegal reentry are not recommended by any informed       federal criminal-justice stakeholders; rather they represent       this administration's anti-immigrant obsession and would       expensively expand substandard private jail contracting       despite the life-threatening conditions in these facilities.        In conclusion, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 are fraught with       constitutional problems that threaten the civil and human       rights of our immigrant communities, undercut law       enforcement's ability to keep our communities safe, and would       balloon our federal prison population by financing private       prison corporations. Rather than taking a punitive approach       to local law enforcement agencies that are working hard to       balance their duties to uphold the Constitution and to keep       their communities safe, Congress should end DHS's       unconstitutional detainer practices or fix the constitutional       deficiencies by requiring judicial warrants for all detainer       requests. Congress should also repeal mandatory detention so       that all immigrants receive the basic due process of a bond       hearing and reject any attempt to unfairly imprison       individuals who are not a threat to public safety.

Lorella Praeli,        Director of Immigration Policy and Campaigns.                                   ____                                          National Task Force to End                                    Sexual and Domestic Violence,                                                      June 27, 2017.        The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence       (NTF), comprised of national leadership organizations       advocating on behalf of sexual assault and domestic violence       victims and representing hundreds of organizations across the       country dedicated to ensuring all survivors of violence       receive the protections they deserve, write to express our       deep concerns about the impact that H.R. 3003, the ``No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' and H.R. 3004, or ``Kate's       Law,'' will have on victims fleeing or recovering from sexual       assault, domestic violence, or human trafficking, and on       communities at large.        This year is the twenty-third anniversary of the bipartisan       Violence Against Women Act (``VAWA'') which has, since it was       first enacted, included critical protections for immigrant       victims of domestic and sexual violence. H.R. 3003 and H.R.       3004 will have the effect of punishing immigrant survivors       and their children and pushing them into the shadows and into       danger, undermining the very purpose of VAWA. Specifically,       the nation's leading national organizations that address       domestic and sexual assault oppose H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004       because:        Community trust policies are critical tools for increasing       community safety. Laws that seek to intertwine the federal       immigration and local law enforcement systems will undermine       the Congressional purpose of protections enacted under VAWA       and will have the chilling effect of pushing immigrant       victims into the shadows and undermining public safety.       Immigration enforcement must be implemented in a way that       supports local community policing and sustains community       trust in working with local law enforcement. H.R. 3003 runs       contrary to community policing efforts and will deter       immigrant domestic violence and sexual assault survivors not       only from reporting crimes, but also from seeking help for       themselves and their children. While H.R. 3003 does not       require that local law enforcement arrest or report immigrant       victims or witnesses of criminal activity, the language in       the bill provides no restriction prohibiting such practices.        Perpetrators use fear of deportation as tool of abuse.       Local policies that minimize the intertwining of local law       enforcement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  [[Page H5258]]       (ICE) help protect the most vulnerable victims by creating       trust between law enforcement and the immigrant community,       which in turn help protect entire communities. Abusers and       traffickers use the fear of deportation of their victims as a       tool to silence and trap them. If immigrants are afraid to       call the police because of fear of deportation, they become       more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Not only are the       individual victims and their children harmed, but their fear       of law enforcement leads many to abstain from reporting       violent perpetrators or seeking protection and, as a result,       dangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished.        As VAWA recognizes, immigrant victims of violent crimes       often do not contact law enforcement due to fear that they       will be deported. Immigrants are already afraid of contacting       the police and HR 3003 proposes to further intertwine federal       immigration and local law enforcement systems will only       exacerbate this fear. The result is that perpetrators will be       able to continue to harm others, both immigrant and U.S.       Citizen victims alike. Since January of 2017, victim       advocates have been describing the immense fear expressed by       immigrant victims and their reluctance to reach out for help       from police. A recent survey of over 700 advocates and       attorneys at domestic violence and sexual assault programs       indicate that immigrant victims are expressing heightened       fears and concerns about immigration enforcement, with 78% of       advocates and attorneys reporting that victims are describing       fear of contacting the police; 75% of them reporting that       victims are afraid of going to court; and 43% reporting       working with immigrant victims who are choosing not to move       forward with criminal charges or obtaining protective orders.        In addition, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie       Beck, reporting of sexual assault and domestic violence among       Latinos has dropped significantly this year, possibly due to       concerns that police interaction could result in deportation.       According to Chief Beck, reports of sexual assault have       dropped 25 percent among Los Angeles' Latino population since       the beginning of the year compared to a three percent drop       among non-Latino victims. Similarly, reports of spousal abuse       among Latinos fell by about 10 percent among Latinos whereas       the decline among non-Latinos was four percent. The Houston       Police Department reported in April that the number of       Hispanics reporting rape is down 42.8 percent from last year.       In Denver, CO, the Denver City Attorney has reported that       some domestic violence victims are declining to testify in       court. As of late February, the City Attorney's Office had       dropped four cases because the victims fear that ICE officers       will arrest and deport them. Both the City Attorney and       Aurora Police Chief have spoken on the importance of having       trust with the immigrant community in order to maintain       public safety and prosecute crime.        HR 3003 Will Unfairly Punish Entire Communities.        H.R. 3003 punishes localities that follow Constitutional       guidelines and refuse to honor detainer requests that are not       supported by due process mandates. H.R. 3003 likely covers       more than 600 jurisdictions across the country, most of which       do not characterize their policies to follow constitutional       mandates as ``sanctuary'' policies. H.R. 3003 penalizes       jurisdictions by eliminating their access to various federal       grants, including federal law enforcement grants, such as the       Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and       other federal grants related to law enforcement or       immigration, such as those that fund forensic rape kit       analysis. Withholding federal law enforcement funding would,       ironically, undermine the ability of local jurisdictions to       combat and prevent crime in their communities.        In addition, the fiscal impact of both H.R. 3003 and H.R.       3004 will result in limited federal law enforcement resources       being further reduced as a result of shifting funding from       enforcing federal criminal laws addressing violent crimes,       including those protecting victims of domestic violence,       sexual assault, and human trafficking, to the detention and       prosecution of many non-violent immigration law violaters.        H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 Will Unfairly Punish Victims.        By greatly expanding mandatory detention and expanding       criminal penalties for reentry, H.R. 3003 and H.R.3004 will       have harsh consequences for immigrant survivors. Victims of       human trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence are       often at risk of being arrested and convicted. In recognition       of this fact, existing ICE guidance cites the example of when       police respond to a domestic violence call, both parties may       be arrested or a survivor who acted in self-defense may be       wrongly accused. In addition, if the abuser speaks English       better than the survivor, or if other language or cultural       barriers (or fear of retaliation from the abuser) prevent the       survivor from fully disclosing the abuse suffered, a survivor       faces charges and tremendous pressure to plead guilty       (without being advised about the long-term consequences) in       order to be released from jail and reunited with her       children. In addition, victims of trafficking are often       arrested and convicted for prostitution-related offenses.       These victims are often desperate to be released and possibly       to be reunited with their children following their arrests or       pending trial. These factors--combined with poor legal       counsel, particularly about the immigration consequences of       criminal pleas and convictions--have in the past and will       likely continue to lead to deportation of wrongly accused       victims who may have pled to or been unfairly convicted of       domestic violence charges and/or prostitution. H.R. 3003       imposes harsh criminal penalties and H.R. 3009 imposes       expanded bases for detention without consideration of       mitigating circumstances or humanitarian exceptions for these       victims.        In addition, HR. 3004 expands the criminal consequences for       re-entry in the U.S. without recognizing the compelling       humanitarian circumstances in which victims who have been       previously removed return for their safety. Victims of       domestic and sexual violence and trafficking fleeing violence       in their countries of origin will be penalized for seeking       protection from harm. In recent years, women and children       fleeing rampant violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and       Honduras, have fled to the United States, seeking refuge.       Frequently, because of inadequate access to legal       representation, they are unable to establish their       eligibility for legal protections in the United States,       resulting in their removal. In many cases, the risk of       domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or human trafficking       in their countries of origin remain unabated and victims       subsequently attempt to reenter the U.S. to protect       themselves and their children. Other victims of domestic and       sexual violence and trafficking may be deported because their       abusers or traffickers isolate them, or prevent them from       obtaining lawful immigration status. They are deported, with       some victims having to leave their children behind in the       custody of their abusers or traffickers. Under H.R. 3004,       these victims risk harsh criminal penalties for re-entry for       attempting to protect themselves and their children.        On behalf of the courageous survivors of domestic violence,       sexual assault, dating violence, stalking and human       trafficking that our organizations serve, we urge you to vote       against HR 3003 and 3004, and to affirm the intent and spirit       of VAWA by supporting strong relationships between law       enforcement and immigrant communities, which is critical for       public safety in general, and particularly essential for       domestic and sexual violence victims and their children.            Sincerely,        The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence       (www.4vawa.org).                                   ____                                                      June 26, 2017.        Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the Committee on       Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB/      COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our       opposition to H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004.        The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare       of migrants and how our nation welcomes and treats them. Our       parishes include those with and without immigration status,       unfortunately some who have witnessed or been victims of       crime in the United States, including domestic violence,       armed robbery, and assault. We understand the importance of       fostering cooperation and information-sharing between       immigrant communities and local law enforcement.        We oppose H.R. 3003 because it would impose obligations on       local governments that we fear--and that many of them have       warned--would undermine authority and discretion of local law       enforcement. This, in turn, would hamper the ability of local       law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure       public safety in all communities.        Furthermore, Section 2 of H.R. 3003 would deny to       jurisdictions vital federal funding related to law       enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and       naturalization if those jurisdictions are deemed to be non-      compliant with H.R. 3003. The Catholic service network,       including Catholic Charities, works in partnership with the       federal government on a number of Department of Justice and       Department of Homeland Security initiatives, including       disaster response and recovery, naturalization and       citizenship services, and services for the immigrant,       including victims of human trafficking, and domestic       violence. These services are incredibly valuable to the       protection and promotion of the human person and in some       instances life-saving. Cutting grants related to these       important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not       humane or just, nor is it in our national interest.        Also, we oppose H.R. 3004 as it would lead to an expansion       of incarceration and does not include adequate protections       for people who re-enter the U.S. for humanitarian reasons or       seek protection at the border. While H.R. 3004 makes notable       efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent       criminal offenses, the legislation goes far beyond this goal       by expanding the government's ability to prosecute illegal       re-entry cases and heightening the criminal penalties in       these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that       important judicial resources are efficiently utilized to       prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent       crimes. Expanding who is eligible to be prosecuted for entry       or re-entry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does       not advance the common good nor will it ensure that       communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as       introduced, H.R. 3004 would also prevent vulnerable asylum       seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented       themselves repeatedly at the U.S. border in the flight from       violence), from being able to access protection, and instead       face fines, imprisonment or both.  [[Page H5259]]         We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of       a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration       reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family       unity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs       and rights of immigrants with our nation's best interests and       security.        The United States has a long and proud history of       leadership in welcoming newcomers regardless of their       circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready       to work with you on legislation that more closely adheres to       this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of       our views in this regard.            Sincerely,      Most Rev. Joe Vasquez,        Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration.      Sr. Donna Markham, OP, PhD,        President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA.                                   ____                                                      June 27, 2017.        Dear Representative McGovern: NETWORK Lobby for Catholic       Social Justice stands in strong opposition to the ``No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law''       (H.R. 3004) to be considered this week by the House of       Representatives. We urge Congress to reject these bills. In a       country that prides itself on being the land of welcome and       opportunity, we must ensure that our immigration laws reflect       our shared values.        As Congress continues to delay comprehensive immigration       reform and a permanent solution for the nation's 11 million       undocumented immigrants, we are left with the status quo--an       enforcement-only approach that tears apart families and keeps       people in the shadows. Despite the gridlock in Congress,       localities across the country still have the responsibility       to uphold safety and peace in their communities. To fulfill       this goal, local police and residents have fostered mutual       trust to root out crime and promote public safety,       encouraging community members to cooperate with local       authorities. The ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R.       3003) does nothing to promote public safety and instead will       make communities more dangerous while striking fear in the       hearts of our immigrant families.        Likewise, ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004) would criminalize       immigrants who simply want an opportunity to succeed in the       United States, and often are simply trying to be reunited       with their family. Punishing immigrants for wanting to       provide for their families with fines and imprisonment is       harsh and cruel--we, as a nation, are called to be better       than that. Again, we ask Congress to abandon the       ``enforcement first'' policies that have been the de facto       U.S. strategy for nearly thirty years, yielding too many       costs and too few results. Our antiquated system that does       not accommodate the migration realities we face in our nation       today does not serve our national interests and does not       respect the basic human rights of migrants who come to this       nation fleeing persecution or in search of employment for       themselves and better living conditions for their children.        Pope Francis cautions that ``migrants and refugees are not       pawns on the chessboard of humanity'' and he asks political       leaders to create a new system, one that ``calls for       international cooperation and a spirit of profound solidarity       and compassion.'' This is a holy call to embrace hope over       fear. Congress should recognize the God-given humanity of all       individuals and uphold our sacred call to love our neighbor       and welcome the stranger in our midst. Any action that       further militarizes our borders, criminalizes assistance to       immigrant communities, or weakens legal protection of       refugees is neither just nor compatible with the values that       we, as Americans, strive to uphold.            Sincerely,                                       Sr. Simone Campbell, SSS,                                                 Executive Director,                         NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I, again, would simply say that if we  really want to do something about immigration, we ought to come  together, like the Senate did not long ago, and pass comprehensive  immigration reform. But, apparently, that is not in the DNA of the  current leadership of this House.   Instead, we have bills that demagogue the immigration issue, that  demean immigrants, that cause hysteria, and I find that very  unfortunate.   This bill is a bad idea. It falls in the same category as that other  bad, stupid idea of building a wall across our country.   What we ought to be doing is serious legislating, enough demagoguing,  and let's get back to doing the people's business, and that includes  comprehensive immigration reform.   Mr. Speaker, as I said, we need to fix our immigration laws. When a  mother in the Philippines has to wait 25 years or more for a visa to  reunite with her son in the United States, is that system working? No.   To lose the entire childhood and young adulthood of your son? What  mother wouldn't try to enter the United States some other way, in fact,  any way that she could in order to be with her child?   When your daughter is threatened with rape and murder if she doesn't  become a sexual slave to gang members; when your son and the entire  family is threatened with death if the boy doesn't join the gangs,  wouldn't you run away and try to find safety someplace else?   And when the family arrives at the U.S. border and they actively seek  out the U.S. Border Patrol and voluntarily surrender to them and ask  for safe refuge and asylum, is that really entering our borders  illegally?   You know, when you have been an upstanding member of the community  for 10, 15, 20 years or more in the United States, and you get pulled  over because the tags have expired on your car, or your license, do you  really deserve to be deported, to tear apart your family, to leave  behind the businesses that you have spent a lifetime creating?   And does anyone in this Chamber honestly think that if this father or  mother is deported, that they won't do everything they can to try to  come back to be with their kids?   I mean, these are real stories. It is not fiction. They are not  fantasies. It is real. And if you listened to people in your community,  you would know these stories.   If you paid attention to your local police, you would know why it is  so damaging to turn them in to ICE, because they rely on these  community members to inform them of criminal activities in their  community. The police don't want to do what you are asking them to do.  Why would you force this on them? And why would you punish them by  taking away essential Federal funding to help them protect the citizens  of this country?   This is a bad idea. I guess, maybe it is a good press release. Maybe  Steve Bannon thinks it is a good idea. Maybe it is a good sound bite  for Trump. Who knows what the rationale behind this is. But it is not  sensible. It is not thoughtful.   So if you want to get serious about these issues, you know, come  together, like the Senate did, in a bipartisan way, and come up with  comprehensive immigration reform. That is our duty. That is our job, as  Members of Congress, not this garbage. This is a waste of time. This is  an insult to the American people. We ought to be able to do better.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this. I urge them to  defeat the previous question so we can have a debate and vote on  whether or not to increase the minimum wage to $15 to give people a  raise. Again, we have to do that because this House is being so tightly  controlled that you can't get anything to the floor.   I would remind my colleagues that the underlying bill that we are  talking about here today on immigration is under a closed rule. We will  have another closed rule tomorrow. So much for democracy. So much for  deliberative process. So much for openness. There is no such thing  here. I mean, the Rules Committee has become a place where democracy  goes to die, where everything gets shut down.   We need to do better. This process stinks, and this bill is lousy. I  urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question, vote ``no''  on the rule, and if it gets to the point we have to debate this, vote  ``no'' on the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
