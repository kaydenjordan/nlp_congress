 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, what is the legislative situation?    Mr. President, I wish to speak for just a few minutes  about H.J. Res. 43. I see this as a misguided and unfortunate attack on  healthcare for women. Certainly that is what I am hearing from women  from the State of Vermont.   Three months into the 115th Congress, the Senate has yet to consider  real legislation aimed at addressing the many challenges we Americans  face today. Instead, the Senate, with simple-majority votes-- permissible through the rarely used Congressional Review Act--is  rolling back key protections for the American people that were put in  place by the last administration. Never mind that the current  administration has the power to address certain aspects of regulations  that they wish to rewrite. No. They could address these. They could  seek a rewriting of them. They could seek legislation. But, instead,  Republicans in Congress are intent on using this blunt procedure to  unravel years of very careful and deliberative work. These raw power  plays are part of the Trump-Republican ``know-nothing, anti-science''  agenda, in which the winners are not the American people. They are not  the women of my State. They are not the average person you might meet.  Instead, they are typically the wealthy and powerful special interests  and big polluters. They win, and the losers are real Americans.   Today, we are considering the 12th such resolution, one that rolls  back protections under the Title X program. Title X of the Public  Health Service Act is the only Federal grant program dedicated to  providing those eligible with comprehensive family planning and  preventive health services. In rural areas--and every single State has  a rural area, but my State is especially rural--we know that Title X is  crucial in making sure women have access to the basic healthcare they  need. Unfortunately, in recent years, some States have made exceptions  about which providers may deliver services under Title X, excluding  family planning clinics.   Seeing the burden these rules would place on women seeking  healthcare, the Obama administration finalized a regulation in December  2016 that protects these providers from this type of discrimination,  and women from these hardships. The resolution we are considering today  would undo this regulation, once again allowing States to discriminate  against providers, thereby limiting access to healthcare services for  millions--that is not hyperbole; it really is millions--of women and  their families. Worse still, the resolution would prevent a similar  rule or regulation from being implemented in the future.   In Vermont, our sole Title X provider is Planned Parenthood. Even in  a State as rural as Vermont, no one has to drive longer than 45 minutes  to reach a clinic. That is important to us. We consider 4 to 5 inches  of snow a heavy dusting, but we often have 10 to 15 inches of snow.  Nobody should have to drive farther than that to reach healthcare.  [[Page S2129]]    This type of access is critical for those who need these services. It  is especially important because for 40 percent of women, their visit to  a family planning health center is the only healthcare they receive  during the year. Vermonters are lucky because our State recognizes that  this issue isn't about abortion, it is about ensuring the best network  of providers for the people of our State. But other States have already  worked to undermine family planning clinics like Planned Parenthood.   The passage of this resolution will allow these discriminatory  efforts to advance, especially discriminatory efforts against women.  There is no question about it: A vote for this resolution is a vote  against women. This resolution would not only affect the lives of  millions of American women, but it would also affect the lives of men  and young people who trust and depend on family planning clinics for  their basic healthcare needs, including for annual health exams,  cervical and breast cancer screenings, and HIV screenings.   Last year in Vermont--keep in mind that Vermont has a population of  just over 600,000 people--Planned Parenthood centers provided vital  primary and preventive services to more than 16,000 patients. In a  small State like Vermont, this harmful impact cannot be overstated.   Those who support this resolution argue that the States should be  able to determine who receives Title X grants, and that women under  this program can simply find another clinic to go to. Well, that is  simply not the case. In fact, that argument is false. It is a lie.  Family planning clinics overwhelmingly serve populations in rural and  medically underserved parts of the country where access to healthcare,  especially for low-income individuals, is difficult.   It is easy--easy--for Senators to vote to cut off this healthcare for  women and children and people in rural areas because each one of us, if  we need healthcare, can walk 2 minutes down this hall and walk to the  Capitol physician and say ``I am a U.S. Senator. I need healthcare,''  and we are going to get it. While that may be the reality for 100  people in this body, it is not the reality for millions and millions of  people in every single State we represent.   What this partisan resolution would do is force women and families in  States who depend on family planning clinics for their healthcare to  find another doctor--and often very few are available--or what is more  likely, go without care at all. So they don't get preventive care, they  don't get checkups, and they don't find the first indication that they  may be facing melanoma or some other serious health problem. That  undermines all of our efforts, which we should be joining, to  strengthen our Nation's healthcare system, to try to make our  healthcare system at least as good as many other countries', and to  ensure access to care for everyone.   This Republican resolution marks just the latest overreach and  intrusion into women's healthcare.   We even voted for a resolution to allow people to spy on what you do  on the internet, and then sell that information for their own profit,  destroying your privacy, but making money doing it.   Until the House failed to even take it up, the Senate was scheduled  to consider a reconciliation bill this week that would have defunded  Planned Parenthood and would have allowed health insurers to deny  coverage for maternity care, thus requiring women to pay more for  health insurance.   In the last Congress, it was more of the same--deny coverage for  maternity care, and then go out and say: We believe in the right to  life. Clearly not so much for the mother when she needs maternity care.   Should we really walk back from the remarkable progress we have made  as a nation in women's health? Of course not. But I am concerned that  we will still see the same irresponsible attack surfacing again and  again.   Look, it is 2016; it is not 1917. It is time for the mean-spirited  and ideological assaults on women's healthcare to end. Women are not  second-class citizens. My wife is not, my daughter is not, and my three  granddaughters are not. They deserve the same access to care as men.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution that will  degrade the healthcare and access to healthcare, of so many Americans.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, last week I spoke about the importance of  the rule of law in Guatemala and praised the work of Attorney General  Thelma Aldana and the commissioner of the International Commission  Against Impunity in Guatemala, Ivan Velasquez. These two individuals  have helped to create hope among the Guatemalan people in the  possibility of justice in a country where the justice system has too  often been used to perpetuate corruption, impunity, and inequality.   The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG,  has been strongly supported by the United States. I commended President  Morales when, shortly after taking office last January, he extended  CICIG's mandate. He has affirmed that he supports CICIG's mandate  through September 2019, for which, again, I commend him.   Last week, I expressed a concern that had been conveyed to me by  several individuals that President Morales might recommend against  renewal of Mr. Velasquez as commissioner beyond September 2017, when  Mr. Velasquez's current term expires. In response, according to press  reports, President Morales denied this and said he supports Mr.  Velasquez for as long as Mr. Velasquez does the job he is supposed to  do.   Ivan Velasquez is a respected former judge from Colombia who has  carried out his responsibilities as the commissioner of CICIG with  professionalism. He and Attorney General Aldana have collaborated on  sensitive, complex cases, which until recently would never have been  prosecuted in Guatemala, given its history of impunity. It is important  that their collaboration continue for as long as possible.   I welcome President Morales's public statement of support for CICIG  and for Mr. Velasquez, particularly at a time when the U.S. Congress is  again being asked to provide hundreds of millions of dollars to support  the Alliance for Prosperity Plan. That plan, which is in its early  stages, has the potential to make progress in combating the poverty,  lack of opportunity, inequality, violence, and impunity that are among  the key contributors to migration from Central America to the United  States. These are deeply rooted problems that the Central American  countries and the United States have a strong interest in working  together to address.   For the Alliance for Prosperity Plan to succeed, each of the Central  American governments needs to take steps that their predecessors were  unwilling or unable to take. Those steps include ensuring that senior  government officials and their advisers are people of integrity;  redefining the antagonistic relationship between government and civil  society, to one of mutual respect for each other's legitimate role;  fully supporting efforts to combat corruption by CICIG and by the  Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in  Honduras--El Salvador should also recognize the important role these  entities are playing and support the establishment of a similar  commission to combat corruption and impunity in that country-- increasing the budget of the Office of the Attorney General, so they  have the necessary personnel, training, equipment, and protection to  carry out their responsibilities throughout the country, especially in  areas where they have never had the resources to operate; supporting  the independence of the judiciary, including the selection of judges  based on their qualifications and the principle of equal access to  justice; and building transparent and accountable institutions of  democracy that can withstand attempts to subvert the rights of the  people, including demilitarizing law enforcement and building  professional, civilian police forces.   It is the responsibility of the Central American governments to take  these steps and, by doing so, create the conditions for building more  prosperous, equitable, and just societies. If they do that and they  meet the other conditions in U.S. law, the United States should support  them.                            ____________________
