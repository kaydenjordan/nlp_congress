 Mr. President, it is a solemn honor to recognize  National Police Week. Each year, we dedicate this week to express our  admiration and gratitude to all of the law enforcement officers working  to keep us safe. We also take this time to remember those who have paid  the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty over the past year.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S2516, May 13, 2021, second column, the following  appears:   Mr. President, it is a solemn honor to recognize National Police  Week. Each year, we dedicate this week to express our admiration  and gratitude to all of the law enforcement officers working to  keep us safe. We also take this time to remember those who have  paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty over the past  year.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Law enforcement officers face many challenges in their mission to  protect and serve. I greatly admire members of the law enforcement  community who remain steadfast amidst the dangers of their noble  profession.   To all the law enforcement officers across the State of Mississippi,  I want to say to you that I am in Washington, DC, as your Senator to  support you and to work to ensure you have what you need to do your  job. You are truly our hometown heroes. You are the thin blue line  keeping our families and our communities safe.   The loss of any officer deeply affects entire communities beyond  their own department, and the ramifications for their family and  friends are heartbreaking.   This Police Week, we honor and mourn three heroes from Mississippi,  officers who died in the line of duty last year.   Monroe County Deputy Sheriff Dylan Scott Pickle, 24, died on July 26,  2020, while on duty after a vehicle struck him during a safety  checkpoint operation. Dylan, a decorated veteran awarded three medals  for his heroism in Syria, knew at an early age that he wanted to serve  his community and his country. An Amory native and an Itawamba  Community College graduate, Deputy Pickle's life of service was cut  short soon after earning a promotion within the sheriff's department.  He leaves behind his mother, a sister, a brother, and stepsister.   Simpson County Sheriff Deputy James Harold Blair lost his life on  July 12, 2020, after a subject he was transporting fatally wounded him.  This 77-year-old grandfather served in law enforcement honorably for  more than 50 years in Simpson County, Lincoln County, Pike County, and  Louisiana. He even worked as a crossing guard for his grandchildren's  school. Deputy Sheriff Blair leaves behind a large grieving family,  including his wife, 3 sons, 4 daughters, 17 grandchildren, and 48  great-grandchildren.   Correctional Officer Marshall Lee ``Bem'' London, Jr., 66, of the  Lincoln County Sheriff's Office, passed away May 18, 2020. A 16-year  veteran of the sheriff's office, Bem is among the tragic number of law  enforcement officers who succumbed to COVID-19 last year while serving  the public. A dedicated family man, Deputy London is survived by his  children and grandchildren.   As a lasting tribute, the names of these three brave officers will be  added this year to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in  Washington, DC.   In addition to these recent losses, the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial will now also bear the names of three DeSoto County  sheriff's deputies who died in the line of duty 123 years ago. Deputy  Sheriffs Henry R. Campbell, William C. Cooper, and Carter I. Jones lost  their lives on May 18, 1898, while attempting to arrest a father and  son wanted for four murders. Even after more than a century, we still  remember loss and honor their service.   Then and now, our law enforcement offices face tremendous dangers as  they work to ensure the public safety and enforce the law. Today, all  officers must deal with unprecedented challenges, pressures, and  scrutiny. Supporting our law enforcement ought to be uncontroversial.  Unfortunately, that is not always the case.   As we mark National Police Week, let us embrace the memories of these  fallen officers as a cause to redouble our commitment to supporting law  enforcement. I assure you that I will continue to be an advocate for  law enforcement professionals and do my very best to honor the legacy  of all those lost in the line of duty.   To the families of Deputy Pickle, Deputy Blair, and Officer London, I  know you have faced enormous loss. I want you to know that you are  continually in our prayers.
