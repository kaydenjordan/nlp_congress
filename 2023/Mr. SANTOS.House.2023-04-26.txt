 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the beginning of Yom  Ha'atzmaut, Israel's Independence Day.   Since 1948, Israel has displayed great resilience and strength  against its opposition. This incredible nation is our strongest ally in  the Middle East. Our friends in Israel carry a long history of faith  and resolve.   Here in the United States, we are forever grateful for their  friendship and their continued partnership. We congratulate you on this  tremendous milestone of 75 years of independence and democracy. In the  State of New York, we are proud to be the home of the largest Jewish  population outside of Israel.   For 75 years, Israel has been a tried and trusted ally of the United  States. Together, we have Americans and Israelis united by our shared  commitment to democracy, economic prosperity, and regional security.   Israel is America's base in the Middle East. As the only democracy in  the region, Israel is the only country that embraces American values.  We have witnessed the strongest relationship between America and Israel  yet, not just in words but in actions.   The American Embassy officially moved to Jerusalem. America  officially recognizes the Golan Heights as part of Israel. The 118th  Congress is holding strong to the commitment of allegiance to Israel  even in the face of adversity.   Mr. Speaker, here is to 75 more years of partnership.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to address my first 100 days in  Congress. As freshmen Members of Congress, we arrive in D.C. with a  ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' mentality. As you walk through these  Halls for the first time, you realize that you are now a part of  history.   Like any new kid on the block, there is a learning curve. Although my  learning curve might be slightly different compared to others, what I  can say is that mistakes will be made, lessons learned, but speaking as  a freshman, try to give yourself a grace period and learn to grow.   Despite everything, I have learned and grown over the past 100 days  in Congress. If only I could figure out how to navigate the Rayburn  building.   In 100 days, little did I know that I would introduce 11 bills of my  own, be a cosponsor of 63 bills, and see three of those cosponsored  bills pass in the House.   Each of us, both Republicans and Democrats, are here because we  individually believe that we can improve not just our congressional  districts but our country. We may not always agree, but like any  freshman Member, I am learning to find some common ground.   One thing that is financially hurting not just my constituents, but  all New Yorkers are the State and local taxes, also known as SALT. The  first bill I introduced is H.R. 1260, the SALT Relief Act. The State of  New York's top marginal individual income tax rate is 10.9 percent,  making it the third highest top marginal income tax rate in the country  after California and Hawaii.   My constituents who specifically reside in Nassau County pay some of  the highest property taxes in the country. My SALT bill aims to  increase the $10,000 cap to $50,000. According to the Tax Foundation,  the average SALT amount--property tax liability or sales tax  liability--reported among itemizing filers was $30,227. Sadly, due to  the $10,000 cap, the average SALT deduction was $9,023.   I am aware that my district is a combination of affluent  neighborhoods with famous constituents like Billy Joel, but it also  includes the middle and working classes. This is not about handing out  tax relief to the wealthy. It is about real tax relief for all  Americans.   In addition to my SALT bill, I recently introduced the Alimony Relief  Act. Both of my bills are constituent-driven bills that seek additional  deductions for taxpayers who are required to submit government-directed  payments. The Alimony Relief Act is the classic example of a  constituent who contacted my office, explained in great detail the  issue that they were having with the government, and asking for my  assistance. The issue is that they are paying income taxes on money  they won't be able to spend themselves. For State tax purposes, alimony  may be taxable income to the recipient and tax deductible to the  individual obligated to pay spousal support. My alimony bill aims to  implement that tax deduction for Federal purposes.   Most of my legislative priorities in Congress are driven to provide  economic relief, not just to my constituents but to all Americans. We  must take a deep dive into the amount of foreign aid that the United  States provides to countries who apply barbaric practices to those  based on gender or sexual orientation. My bills, H.R. 2404 and H.R.  1736, both send a clear message that we should be standing up to  countries that enforce policies that limit individuals to freely  exercise any religion, and enrolling in or attending any educational  institution.   For example, in 2019, the foreign assistance statistic by country is  staggering. I will not read off every country, but Afghanistan, we were  providing them with a grand total of $4.8 trillion. To break it down,  that is $1.2-plus trillion for economic aid and $3.6-plus billion in  aid since the United States withdrew from Afghanistan. Restrictions on  women's rights increased exponentially, including freedom of speech. In  addition, institutions designed to support human rights were either  shut down or severely limited.   Another accomplishment since the Republicans took back the House, we  have made great strides with putting an end to COVID-19.                                time  1845    We passed a resolution terminating the COVID-19 national emergency  declaration and passed the Pandemic is Over Act.   In addition, I have introduced H.R. 2631, a bill called the Medical  Information Nuanced Accountability Judgement Act. Medical freedom is an  absolute right, and any Federal Government should not impose a mandate  that requires individuals to receive a vaccine that has not been  properly authorized for at least 10 years.   My bill would help restore our military readiness. As a result of the  Biden administration's vaccine mandate, more than 3,400 men and women  were being involuntarily separated. Under the MINAJ Act, this would not  be the case.   While I look forward to the day when one of my bills passes, I can  say that it is amazing to see three bills that I have cosponsored pass.  House Republicans have made a commitment to put the country first and  to reverse consistently bad policies from the Biden administration.   Last week, we passed the Protection of Women and Girls Sports Act. I  joined my colleagues to cosponsor a bill that protects biological women  in sports.   Over the last couple of years, biological women have been on the  receiving end of an unfair disadvantage by competing against  transgender male athletes. While the left calls this discrimination  against transgender athletes, we simply call it as it is: robbing women  of their hard-earned athletic achievements.   I am proud to have cosponsored H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights  Act. Since House Republicans have taken the majority, we continue to  build a future that allows for parents to be the primary stakeholders  in their children's education. We are making their voices heard. Every  parent has the right to know what their children are being taught and  to be updated on their school's budget, spending, and, most  importantly, when there is violent activity at school.   One of the first bills I proudly cosponsored was the REIN In Act.  Since President Biden was sworn into office, we have seen reckless  government spending, historically high inflation that is harming the  livelihoods of the American people, and small businesses that are still  recovering from the pandemic.   We demand transparency from the administration, and this bill would  require the Office of Management and Budget to prepare a report  including inflationary effects for any executive action with an  estimated impact of at least $1 billion. The White House must report  these findings to Congress each year to increase transparency over  their actions.   If I have learned anything in the past 100 days, it is that being a  Member of Congress goes beyond spending time in our Nation's Capital.  Spending as much time in our congressional districts as possible is a  major key to success.   As I split my time between Washington, D.C., and my district, there  is one thing I can say for certain: Our best government is local. The  mayors and other local government workers  [[Page H2045]]  truly know what is best for their communities and what kind of funds  are needed from both the State and Federal levels.   It is my goal to do all that I can to bring back funding to local  towns in my district that will better their communities.   Since opening my district office, I cannot begin to say how grateful  I am for their hard work and commitment to helping my constituents  directly with real issues and assisting them with requests that we can  provide at the Federal level.   My office has received 238 cases and resolved 143 of them. The top  issues in New York's Third Congressional District are passports and  immigration. As a reminder, this is a freshman office, and I do  anticipate that the more we help, the more people will walk through our  doors.   I personally have taken constituent calls, some good, some not so  good. At the end of the day, that is part of the job, and there is not  much I can do about it. Whether they vote for you or not, you are their  Member of Congress, and you work for them. I commonly say I have  700,000 employers, and I work for each and every one of them.   During my time in the district, I have met with local government  officials and discussed their concerns affecting their communities. It  has been a privilege to work collaboratively with them and help secure  Federal funding to help better our communities.   The cities and towns of NY-3 asking for Federal assistance include  Sands Point, Old Westbury, Port Washington, Belgrave, Great Neck, and  Farmingdale. Their requests are centered around water filtration,  public safety, and water infrastructure. These are issues that many  communities face, and while they may not sound flashy, these are the  matters of public health and the lives of our constituents, and the  God-given right to clean water.   One of the benefits of living in New York's Third Congressional  District is having the privilege of honoring the dedicated men and  women of the U.S. Coast Guard Sector Long Island Sound and Sector New  York. While most of us take it for granted, the U.S. Coast Guard  carries out more than just search and rescue missions. They protect our  border, and they are the law enforcement branch of the U.S. Armed  Forces.   Having recently spent some time touring the Eaton's Neck station, all  I could think of was how I could do more for them.   The Coast Guard has made great strides in up-to-date equipment, yet  they are still severely underfunded. Their search and rescue operations  have increased by over 30 percent, and sadly, fatalities have gone up  20 percent since COVID.   You see, Mr. Speaker, in New York's Third Congressional District, we  have a lot of water activity, and with that, it created this new boater  community that drove folks to the water in the absolute boredom of the  pandemic, so that also increased the work activity for our Coast Guard.   They mentioned that there are things boaters can do that can easily  prevent some of these rescues, including buying a high-frequency radio  for your boat, which allows communications between other boats and,  most importantly, the Coast Guard.    Another thing that I took away from our tour, and I will continue to  state it publicly, is to dress for the water, not the weather. Although  it might be 80, 90 degrees outside, the water is still 40 degrees, so  15 minutes in the water and hypothermia kicks in. That just worsens the  odds of a successful rescue. What I am saying tonight may sound boring,  but part of the job is about listening.   As a reminder, these unsung heroes safely evacuated over 500,000  people from Manhattan to escape New York City during 9/11, and now they  are facing the potential of offshore turbines, which pose a major  concern for the Coast Guard. Having previously stated that there has  been an increase in search and rescue operations mainly due to the  pandemic, having approximately 3,000 offshore wind turbines will pose a  real concern for future search and rescue. Their helicopters would have  to carefully traverse a waterway during a rescue operation without  getting caught up in the wind turbines, in addition to Coast Guard  vessels having difficulties with their radar capabilities navigating in  and around these windmills.   I will also add that the construction of these turbines can take up  to 15 to 20 years to build, resulting in an expected 1,800 transits up  the Hudson River from the Port of New York out to the sea. This places  a huge responsibility on the shoulders of the Coast Guard to ensure the  safety of all types of boaters and vessels.   When meeting with members of the Coast Guard, there was something  that stuck out, and it was their personal well-being. Men and women  sometimes carry out very serious and dangerous missions at sea, which  can be long and lonely. They sometimes have difficulties finding mental  health services due to a limited budget. Some are utilizing food  pantries and are unable to afford housing.   Besides our gratitude, we should be doing more to invest in the Coast  Guard. They protect our seacoasts, economic and security interests  abroad, and, above all, save thousands of lives per year.   This Friday evening, we will be announcing the New York Third  Congressional District's winner of the 2023 Congressional Art  Competition. Since I have been in Washington, I have always been amazed  by the plethora of talent from high school students whose art hangs in  the Cannon Tunnel heading toward the Capitol. I look forward to meeting  with these students, learning about their talents, and hearing about  their next steps in life.   Water contamination is probably the last thing that one might  associate with Long Island. Unfortunately, it is a fact. A local  village in New York's Third District, Farmingdale, has been plagued  with an ongoing water contamination issue, which has been declared an  emergency since July 2021.   Recently, I met with the mayor of Farmingdale, along with an  environmental advocate, to discuss the ongoing issue, the strides they  are making, and the Federal assistance requested to ease the financial  burden on the taxpayers.   In my district, the water contaminants, including PFAS, which are  also known as forever chemicals, are impacting the water supply wells,  which operate nearly 2 million gallons per day. This opened my eyes and  made me truly see the positive side of public service.   When political differences can be set aside, we can roll up our  sleeves, show how we can find common ground, and work together for the  greater good.   While Annapolis has the Naval Academy, in New York's Third District,  we have the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy located in Kings Point. It  trains midshipmen as officers in the Merchant Marine Reserve.   Like the Coast Guard, the academy needs more than $300 million in  Federal funds to rehabilitate dilapidated buildings. Other long-term  projects include the construction of academic buildings and projects to  protect the waterfront basin of rickety piers.   Since they opened their doors in 1943 on Long Island, we have taken  great pride in being the home of the Merchant Marine Academy. Students  come from all across the country to receive a quality education in our  backyard.   It is my hope to work closely with the academy, as well as the  Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration, and see what we  can do at the Federal level to continue to improve the infrastructure  at the academy.   These have been the last hundred days from my perspective, but as  many of my colleagues have already said, we have only just begun.   One final item before I wrap up. I want to talk about neuropathy.  Neuropathy is a medical condition that results in damage to the nerves  outside the brain and spinal cord. Those who suffer from neuropathy  experience weakness and numbness, which typically occurs in the hands  or feet. This can be incredibly painful and debilitating, and many are  unable to live normal lives.   This is also known as the suicide disease, due to limited effective  treatments and because there is no cure.   In February, I brought a guest to attend the State of the Union who  suffers from neuropathy. He is a former volunteer firefighter named  Michael  [[Page H2046]]  Weinstock, and he was assigned to the bucket brigade at Ground Zero.  His responsibilities with the bucket brigade included finding survivors  and removing rubble from the World Trade Center.   In 2016, the World Trade Center Health Program was petitioned to add  peripheral neuropathy to its list of covered conditions, which it  declined to do. In 2017, an FDNY responder again petitioned the program  to add peripheral neuropathy to its covered conditions list.  Unfortunately, the World Trade Center Health Program declined to update  its list a second time, citing insufficient evidence.                                time  1900    It is sad that a bill needs to be introduced in the first place on  this floor. My staff and I are in the process to find out why  neuropathy is not recognized as a valid condition under the World Trade  Center Health Program. The timeline for adding a condition is painfully  slow, and it is frustrating to my constituents and others, who were  impacted directly by the events of 9/11, who simply cannot wait any  longer.   As a Member of Congress, I can think of nothing more important than  honoring our 9/11 first responders and see that neuropathy be included  as a medical condition that is covered in the World Trade Center Health  Program immediately.   In my first 100 days, I can say without doubt that serving in  Congress is a great honor and humbling, as any commitment to public  service should be. I am eagerly looking forward to what the House GOP  will achieve in the days and months ahead. Our Commitment to America  will not waver.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 1 minute  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, April 27, 2023, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
