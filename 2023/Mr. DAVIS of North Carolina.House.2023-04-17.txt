 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a true  trailblazer in North Carolina's First Congressional District, retired  United States Army Air Corps bomber pilot, Major Joe Balogh.   Joe and I had a chance to chat in Franklin County, and this World War  II hero, at the age of 102, shared countless stories of service with a  vivid recollection of the detail.   During our chat, Joe shared with me when his airplane was shot down.  He also shared about witnessing soldiers paying the ultimate sacrifice.  Joe will continue to be a beacon of hope for eastern North Carolina and  America.   Mr. Speaker, Joe's selfless service will ensure the freedom of future  generations of North Carolinians and Americans.   I thank and salute Joe and others like him across America.                            ____________________
