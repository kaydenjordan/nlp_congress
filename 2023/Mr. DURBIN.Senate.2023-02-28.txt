 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Jamar Walker to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Virginia. Mr. Walker's commitment to public service and deep ties to  the Virginia legal community will serve the district court well.   Born in Nassawadox, VA, Mr. Walker received his B.A. from the  University of Virginia in 2008 and his J.D. from the University of  Virginia School of Law in 2011. He then clerked for Judge Raymond A.  Jackson, whom he has now been nominated to succeed, on the U.S.  District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.   Mr. Walker began his career in private practice in Washington, DC,  where he specialized in commercial insurance litigation and products  liability. He then joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern  District of Virginia as an Assistant U.S. Attorney assigned to the  Financial Crimes and Public Corruption Unit. In this role, Mr. Walker  has prosecuted a wide range of cases, including bribery, money  laundering, wire fraud, bank fraud, foreign corrupt practices, and  securities fraud. Following 7 years of dedicated service, Mr. Walker  was named the unit's acting chief in 2022.   Mr. Walker has spent nearly his entire legal career litigating in  Federal court, and he has gained significant experience in both civil  and criminal matters. In recognition of his expertise, the American Bar  Association rated him ``well qualified'' to serve on the district  court. He also has the strong support of Senators Warner and Kaine. And  if confirmed, Mr. Walker would make history as the first openly LGBTQ  article III Judge to serve in the State of Virginia.   I will vote in favor of his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), the Senator  from Oregon (Mr. Merkley), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders)  are necessarily absent.
