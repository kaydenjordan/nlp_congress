 Madam Speaker, last week marked 100  tragic days since war criminal Putin's war of mass murder against the  sovereign country of Ukraine. Putin's merciless killing continues to  horrify the world, while the heroic fight by President Volodymyr  Zelenskyy and the brave Ukrainians continue to draw inspiration.   Ukrainians are front line in the global conflict of democracy's rule  of law, opposed by authoritarian's rule of gun.   I was grateful to be in Lithuania last week meeting with members of  the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Led by its president, Gerry Connolly,  the bipartisan delegation welcomed Finland and Sweden into NATO, which  Putin has unintentionally unified for victory in Ukraine.   Putin is sacrificing Russian troops for his personal gain of oil,  money, and power. Ever resolute, President Zelenskyy has said, ``We  have defended Ukraine for 100 days already. Victory will be ours.''   America and the world support Ukraine in its efforts to protect its  citizens and defeat evil.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who have successfully protected  America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism as it continues  moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
