 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Hispanic Heritage Month.  We know that millions and millions of Hispanics for generations have  made so many contributions to our country in every way of life.   Today, I want to recognize the distinguished career of Coach Tom  Flores, a trailblazer in the Latino community in the sport of  professional football.   A son of immigrants from Mexico, a native of my hometown, Fresno,  California, Coach Flores was a gifted high school and collegiate  athlete and later made an indelible mark on professional football.   Playing for the Oakland Raiders' silver and black, Flores became the  first Hispanic starting quarterback in the NFL.   But his success didn't stop there. After ending his playing career,  he went on to Super Bowl XI as an assistant coach for the Raiders.  Whether they be the Oakland Raiders, the Los Angeles Raiders, or now  the Las Vegas Raiders, we all know the silver and black, with a great  deal of pride.   Four years later, he led the team to victory as a head coach,  becoming the first Hispanic head coach to win a Super Bowl. He did it  twice.   To this day, he is only one of two people in history to win multiple  Super Bowls as a player, an assistant coach, and a head coach.   Despite his success, he never forgot where he came from. That is Tom.   We hope and pray the third time is a charm and that he will be  inducted into the NFL's Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.   Since leaving professional football, Coach Flores has used his  influence to bring educational opportunities to the valley home where  he came from through the Tom Flores Youth Foundation.   He has raised nearly $2 million to support local school districts,  science, art, and athletic programs. He never forgot where he came  from.   Before the pandemic, he was also scheduled to be an honored guest for  Fresno's annual FresYES Fest.   Sadly, despite such a decorated career, he was passed over for  induction in the Professional Football Hall of Fame back in February.  It was not the first time.   In January, I introduced legislation calling for the recognition of  his significant achievements in the sport and for his induction into  the Professional Football Hall of Fame.   Recently, the Professional Football Hall of Fame Selection Committee  announced Coach Flores as the single finalist in the 2021 class in a  new coach category. This development is welcome news and opens the door  for Coach Flores to receive the overdue recognition he deserves.   So, we recognize the important contributions Hispanic Americans have  made to our culture, to our communities, in every way of life in the  United States.   I urge my colleagues to support the Tom Flores resolution to honor  the invaluable contribution he has made to his community, to our  country, and to America's game. It is time.                     Honoring Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the passing of Supreme  Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, RBG.   For all Americans, I believe Friday night was a sad evening as we  learned the news. Justice Ginsburg truly made a difference, both during  her tenure on the Court and through her long career.   Justice Ginsburg inspired people. Justice Ginsburg inspired women.  Justice Ginsburg inspired young women.   Justice Ginsburg broke the glass ceiling in so many different ways  through  [[Page H4723]]  her fierce advocacy for women's rights and civil justice.   Justice Ginsburg's keen ability to build bridges between  conservatives and liberal Justices garnered the respect of all jurists,  regardless of their political philosophy, something we should take note  of here in the people's House of Representatives, that we bridge the  gap between our political differences and remember that we are  Americans first.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg always reminded us that we are Americans first  and that equal justice under the law is always the credo of the  American way.   Justice Ginsburg served in so many ways for so many examples on how  to balance the scales of justice. Our Nation will mourn Justice  Ginsburg's loss and honor her legacy for generations to come, I truly  believe, because she is a role model for all.                            ____________________
