 HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of Quentin Moses, a 10th District native, a star athlete, and a  dedicated coach who tragically passed away in a house fire this past  Sunday morning.   I pray and grieve for the family and friends of Quentin, as well as  the family of Andria Godard and her daughter, Jasmine, who also lost  their lives.   Mr. Speaker, Quentin Moses grew up in my home district in Athens,  Georgia. He attended Cedar Shoals High School, starting his career as a  defensive standout. He went on to play for the University of Georgia,  was named first-team All-SEC on the Bulldogs' 2005 SEC Championship  team. Following that, he spent 4 years in the NFL as a linebacker. He  returned to our community in 2012, where he started coaching student- athletes at Reinhardt University in Waleska, Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, Quentin's positive impact on the community was evident  by the outpouring of love and condolences by coaches, players, and  fans.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to rise and join me for a moment of  silence to honor the lives of Quentin Moses and Andria and Jasmine  Godard--precious lives lost too soon.                            ____________________     HICE of Georgia (for himself, Mr. Smith               of Texas, Mr. Farenthold, Mr. Carter of Georgia, Mr.               Jones, Mr. Roe of Tennessee, Mr. Brat, and Mr.               Marchant):        H.R. 1149.
