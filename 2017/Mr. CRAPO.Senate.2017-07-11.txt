 Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator  Risch, to speak on the nomination of Judge David Nye to be a U.S.  district judge for the Federal district of Idaho.   First, let me acknowledge the diligent work of Judiciary Committee  [[Page S3902]]  Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein in expediting the  confirmation process for Judge Nye's renomination.   I also thank both President Obama and President Trump for nominating  Judge Nye to the Federal bench. It is rare to be nominated by  Presidents of two different parties, but it is a fitting testament to  Judge Nye's sterling reputation that he has secured that distinction.   Finally, I appreciate the majority leader giving Judge Nye the honor  of being the first U.S. district judge by the 115th Congress.   Judge Nye is supremely qualified as a candidate for the Federal  district court seat, having a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from  the American Bar Association and having received approval from the  Senate Judiciary Committee without dissent twice in a little less than  a year.   Judge Nye has long been ready to assume this high office. A longtime  member of Idaho's legal community, Judge Nye has been a law clerk, a  practicing lawyer, and since 2007 a judge on Idaho's Sixth Judicial  District Court. This court handles all felony criminal cases, major  civil cases, and appeals from the magistrate court from six counties  throughout the southeast portion of Idaho. He also served from 2009 to  2012 as the administrative district judge for the Idaho Sixth Judicial  District, elected by his peers on the court for the 3-year term to this  position.    He is not just a well-respected jurist in Idaho. Judge Nye is heavily  involved in the training and orientation of new Idaho judges, and he  serves on the Idaho Supreme Court's committees on judicial education  and felony sentencing.   Action on Judge Nye's nomination is critical and timely. Idaho is one  of only three States having just two authorized district court  judgeships. The nonpartisan Judicial Conference of the United States  has declared a judicial emergency for Idaho and has recommended in  every one of its reports to Congress since 2003 that Idaho be  authorized a third district judge position. For the past 2 years, Idaho  has had a three-judge caseload handled by just one active judge. What  is even more challenging is that our lone remaining active judge is  already eligible to take senior status since this past March. Even with  Judge Nye's confirmation, Idaho still needs another U.S. district court  judge.   Confirmation of Judge Nye today or tomorrow is undoubtedly a proud  day for the entire Nye family, including Judge Nye's wife Katre and  their eight children. Knowing that a successful public servant draws so  much strength from the family surrounding him or her, I salute their  partnership with Judge Nye in making this important occasion possible.   Again, I strongly endorse Judge Nye's nomination and appreciate the  Senate's confirmation of him.    Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
