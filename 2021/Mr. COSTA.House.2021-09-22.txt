 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a significant  milestone for one of the local news stations in my hometown and  district in Fresno, California. KMPH Television is celebrating 50 years  of TV programming and broadcast news excellence.   First taking the air in 1971, by the Pappas family, KMPH launched its  news department 7 years later, serving as a vital source of information  for viewers across the Central Valley.   It has not been an easy time for journalists in the last decade  throughout our country. Nearly one-fourth of America's newspapers have  shuttered their operations, and a significant portion of print and TV  journalists, sadly, have lost their jobs. This leaves many smaller  stations with fewer reporters to inform the public on what is happening  in their communities. Getting local news is so critical to having an  informed public.   KMPH is no stranger to these challenges, but it continues to thrive,  make a difference, and inform the public.   A free press, as we all know, is the cornerstone of our democracy.  Local news plays an integral role in shaping America, keeping people  informed, and allowing them to be active in participatory democracy.   During a time of disinformation--sadly, these days--in social media,  I think supporting local journalism has never been more critical.   Fifty years of public service is worth celebrating. Congratulations  to KMPH in Fresno for 50 years of informing the public.                     Celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Hispanic Heritage  Month, to honor the cultures, history, and achievements of the Hispanic  community, both in my district and across the country, for generations.   Throughout the last year, every segment of our society has been  impacted by the COVID pandemic. Certainly, Hispanic Americans have felt  this impact as well, but they have worked hard to do their part.   Many of them are essential workers who have to be on their job every  day, like the farmworkers, some of the hardest working people you will  ever meet in your life, putting food on America's dinner table every  night. Some are healthcare workers--doctors, nurses, technicians, first  responders--and they risk their lives every day doing their jobs and  putting their families at risk.   Every day, the Hispanic-American community's quest for the American  Dream has impacted our communities. They are living the American Dream  of immigrants past and immigrants present.   There are examples such as the Fresno Area Hispanic Foundation, where  over 320 female small business owners have participated in the  Latinapreneur and Womanpreneur programs to grow their small businesses,  creating jobs and creating vital economic activity.   Other individuals historically have played a role and have been  barrier-breakers, like our valley's own Coach Tom Flores, son of  migrant workers in the San Joaquin Valley. He spent 30 years in the  NFL, as the first Hispanic quarterback and then coaching and becoming  the first Hispanic Super Bowl champion. Just a month ago, Coach Flores  was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame for these achievements.   We have so many others who have made a difference, such as my dear  friend Joseph Castro from Hanford, California, who is today chancellor  of the California State University System, the largest public  university system in America. We also have Juan Sanchez Munoz, who is  chancellor of UC Merced, one of the newest universities in America,  making a difference. In addition, my neighbor, Dr. Saul Jimenez- Sandoval, is the newest president of Fresno State University. Go Dogs.   All of these individuals have played a role. All have unique stories  and careers. They have helped to educate and create new opportunities,  and they serve as a role model for future leaders. But we must not  forget that many in our Hispanic community live in fear of attaining  these important goals.   Over the past few years, I have met with DACA students across my  district to hear their stories and discuss the need for immigration  reform. For them, America is the only country they have really known,  and so immigration reform is so critical.   As we commemorate this month, let us not forget that they are  counting on Congress to bring about comprehensive immigration reform.   As a proud member of the Hispanic Caucus, I work with my colleagues  every day to ensure the promise of America is accessible to the 62  million Hispanics living across the country.                            ____________________
