 Madam Speaker, this week is National School Lunch Week. I  rise today to recognize the importance of school lunch programs in our  Nation, which provide low-cost or free lunches to more than 29 million  children in nearly 100,000 public and residential child care  institutions across the country. I have great appreciation for all the  hard work the school nutrition service industry provides to ensure our  children are fed nutritious meals.   As the former commissioner of agriculture in Kentucky, I understand  the importance of child nutrition programs. Quality food service at  school should be the least of a child's worries as they are navigating  the school environment and engaging in new learning opportunities. The  health and well-being of our Nation's children is something all  congressional Members can  [[Page H8252]]  adamantly support. This is a main priority of mine as the  representative of several rural, underserved communities in Kentucky's  First Congressional District.   As a member of the House Committee on Education and Labor, finding  solutions to better serve our Nation's children is a goal we are  constantly striving to build upon. I look forward to continuing to  support important programs proven to serve and aid our Nation's  children.                            ____________________
