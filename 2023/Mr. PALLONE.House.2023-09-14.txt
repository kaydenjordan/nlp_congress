 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1435.   Tens of millions of Americans battled extreme heat, flooding, and  storms this summer, threatening their health, homes, and livelihoods.  Last month, Hurricane Idalia became our Nation's 23rd billion-dollar  weather disaster this year. That is a record, and it is only September.   The damage caused by climate change and dangerous pollution cannot be  ignored, yet that is exactly what House Republicans are doing with this  bill. They are, once again, doing the bidding of their corporate  polluter friends at the expense of Americans' health and security and  our Nation's economy.   The transportation sector is the single largest contributor of  greenhouse gas emissions and other dangerous air  [[Page H4319]]  pollution, but, once again, Republicans want to bury their heads in the  sand and ignore reality, even while more than 100 million Americans are  right now living in counties with unhealthy levels of air pollution.   Thanks to decades of innovation in the American auto industry,  spurred forward by technology-driven standards, we have a large and  growing fleet of cleaner, more affordable cars that benefit all  Americans. These standards have helped cement the United States as a  global leader in the transportation sector.   Congress carefully crafted the Clean Air Act to recognize the diverse  air pollution challenges facing each State. Due to a history of severe  air quality problems, the EPA can grant California waivers to set  vehicle emission standards that are more protective than those at the  Federal level, and other States can voluntarily adopt California's  standards if they choose to do so. EPA has granted dozens of these  waivers, and 17 States and the District of Columbia have followed  California's lead, including my home State of New Jersey.   The law ensures that any State has the freedom to choose to adopt  these stronger vehicle emission standards if it works for them. H.R.  1435 would gut that freedom of choice.   The bill directs the EPA to revoke all existing waivers and future  waivers under the Clean Air Act for any California vehicle emission  standards related to internal combustion engines.                                time  1415    This bill would turn back the clock over 50 years of both Congress  and the EPA recognizing California's statutory authority to set more  protective vehicle emission standards. It infringes on the rights of  States like my home State of New Jersey to voluntarily adopt those  standards to protect people from dangerous air pollution. This bill  would also cause chaos and uncertainty for the American automotive  industry by forcing the EPA to revoke waivers going all the way back to  2013.   Now, Republicans' portrayal of this bill as protecting consumer  choice is completely detached from reality. This bill will discourage  any manufacturing of hybrid or electric vehicles. There would be no  incentives for automakers to invest in the production of hybrids and  EVs, and they would simply not be available as a cleaner and cheaper  choice. The bill blocks any State's ability to break free from the grip  of Big Oil.   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker: Nobody is taking away your gas-powered  vehicle. Republicans are fear-mongering in a deliberate effort to  mislead the American people. The truth is, Republicans are trying to  legislate away years of American innovation in cleaner transportation  in yet another attempt to do the bidding of their Big Oil friends. They  are once again putting polluters over people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Tonko), who is the ranking member of our Environment,  Manufacturing, and Critical Materials Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Matsui), who is the ranking member of our  Subcommittee on Communications and Technology.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Clarke), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Peters), a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Mullin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I hear the Republicans constantly talk about choice, a choice of  vehicles. Let me just stress again that nobody is taking away your gas- powered vehicle.   We are actually providing you the choice, and the States that are  adopting the California standards are providing you a choice of  vehicles because if you pass this bill, then you are basically  insisting that people have to have gas-powered vehicles because  nobody's going to develop EVs.   The fact of the matter is, contrary to my colleague from Indiana's  remarks, people are buying EVs, more people than ever. Even Republicans  are buying electric vehicles.   This bill will discourage any manufacturing of hybrid or electric  vehicles because there will be no incentives for the automakers to  invest in the production of hybrids or EVs, and they would simply not  be available.   People won't have a choice of a cleaner car either because of better  emission standards if it is gas powered or because they might want to  buy a hybrid or an EV.   The other argument that is being made here is about China, and I have  to dispute that, as well. Republicans are making the claim that this  bill protects America from playing into China's hands. I totally  disagree.   Basically, Republicans think that China is leading in the EV space.  Rather than relying on American industry and American ingenuity to  compete with China, Republicans think we should step aside. They  basically say we will just stand down.   While the global demand and the American demand for EVs is rising, if  we don't compete, China benefits. If we step back, China ends up  controlling all the supply chains.   Democrats aren't denying that China is very active in this space and  controls a lot of the existing supply chains for electric vehicles, but  rather than ceding more ground, we are investing in America's ability  to compete. We are investing in domestic battery manufacturing,  creating jobs here and reducing our dependence on foreign supply  chains.   Republicans are operating under the assumption that by stepping away  from electric vehicles, China's dominance in the space disappears. That  is nonsense. In reality, it means that the growing global demand for  electric vehicles will be met by China, and American progress and  competitiveness just recedes.   One of my colleagues--I think it was Mr. Peters--said that the  Republicans are stuck in the past. That is exactly the problem here.  They don't understand that the auto industry is innovating. The auto  industry has been creating gas-powered cars with less emissions.   The auto industry is creating EVs here. Let them flower. Let them do  what they can so, ultimately, we are in charge of manufacturing these  vehicles so that Americans buy and the rest of the world buys our  electric vehicles.    Don't let China continue to dominate the market. That is what this  bill will do.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining on  both sides?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time. I don't have much time left.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time because I  have very little time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask the time remaining on both sides  again?    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. DeSaulnier).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear again. Nobody is taking away your  gas-powered vehicles. If this bill were to become law, there would be  no choice because the United States would not build electric vehicles  and we would fall further and further behind China.   The Republicans are trying to legislate away years of American  innovation and cleaner transportation in yet another attempt to do the  bidding of their Big Oil friends. They are once again putting polluters  over people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.
