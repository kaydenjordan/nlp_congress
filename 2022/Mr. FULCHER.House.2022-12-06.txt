 Mr. Speaker, it is 2022 in the U.S. Congress. We have  crises with inflation, energy, and homeland security. We have got  issues with the border, the Ukrainian invasion, and the list goes on.  The only thing higher than the degree of partisanship is our national  debt. The only thing lower than congressional approval is confidence in  the President.   So why would anybody want to serve at a time like this?   There tends to be two types of congressional Members, those with a  personal agenda, typically one that places themselves and the title of  Congressman at the forefront, and those who sincerely desire to serve  Americans and protect the divine principles our Nation was founded on.   Louie Gohmert is clearly in the latter category.   Time after time, when personal liberties were being challenged,  taxpayer money misused, and Christian values maligned, Louie Gohmert  would stand, and with his unrivaled passion he would state his case.   Mr. Gohmert, you are that rare type of Member our Founders had hoped  would sit in this Chamber in the future. You made your constituents  proud. You honored biblical guidelines for governance.   It is an honor to call you a friend. You will be missed.
