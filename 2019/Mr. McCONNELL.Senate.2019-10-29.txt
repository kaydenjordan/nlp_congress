 Madam President, this week will provide an opportunity  for our Democratic colleagues to prove that their longstanding goal of  impeaching the President is not--not--getting in the way of their  ability to legislate. The Speaker of the House and the Democratic  leader have taken pains to insist that their party's impeachment  obsession will not block important business for the American people.   Well, we are going to find out. As soon as the Senate completes the  domestic funding legislation we are currently considering, we will turn  back toward national defense and give Senate Democrats another chance  to advance the funding for our Armed Forces, which they chose to  filibuster just last month.   In other words, this week will bring a litmus test. Are Washington  Democrats so consumed by impeachment that they cannot even fund our men  and women in uniform? Do our servicemembers really need to be pawns in  the Democrats' fight with the White House?   It is hard to imagine a more basic legislative responsibility than  funding the Department of Defense. We need to fund the tools and  training that our men and women in uniform need to carry out their  missions. We need to give our military commanders the resources to keep  pace with major competitors like China, which has nearly doubled its  military spending over the past decade.   In recent days, our Democratic colleagues have been publicly railing  against the administration's approach to Syria and the Middle East,  without, I would note, offering much of a strategy of their own. But if  they vote to block defense funding later this week, they will literally  be obstructing the very funding to carry out the missions they say are  so important.   The last few days have shown us especially clearly that American  forces remain in harm's way every day, and their missions do not pause  just because some politicians don't find it convenient to fund them. We  owe the Pentagon the budgetary certainty it needs to maintain the  readiness of our military forces and to invest in the capabilities  needed to sustain our military edge into the future.   We also need to be good, reliable partners to our friends and allies.   Get this. This appropriations bill would fund $250 million in  military assistance for Ukraine under the Ukraine Security Assistance  Initiative. If that sounds familiar, that would be the exact same  program that Democrats are currently trying to impeach the President  for allegedly slow-walking.   So welcome to Washington, where Democrats try to impeach President  Trump for supposedly slow-walking aid for Ukraine and simultaneously  filibuster the funding for the exact same Ukraine program in the  Senate. Welcome to Washington.   I think it is safe to say that would elevate irony to a whole new art  form. I hope it doesn't come to that. I hope, instead, that our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle will land on the  [[Page S6206]]  same side when it comes to support for the men and women who keep us  safe and for our vulnerable international partners who look to us for  leadership.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, this week, we will  vote on another effort by our Democratic colleagues to undo successful  Trump administration policy. In recent days, our colleagues across the  aisle have forced two failed votes on similar resolutions. One would  have cut taxes for the wealthiest residents in blue States at the  expense of working families everywhere else. The other would have  resurrected an Obama-era proposal to bury American energy under  redtape.   Both of those efforts failed, but our Democratic colleagues are back  at it--back at it--with another bad policy. This time, they would like  to reverse Trump administration guidance that has reduced healthcare  premiums for American families and reaffirmed protections for those  with preexisting conditions.   Section 1332 of ObamaCare gives States the opportunity to escape some  of that law's worst burdens. States have the opportunity to apply for  waivers that allow for more types of health insurance plans and more  options for consumers.    More than a dozen States have already had these waivers approved, not  just red States. Democratic Governors in places like Colorado,  Delaware, and Rhode Island have applied for and received these waivers.  Where Governors of both parties are embracing this opportunity, good  things are happening. According to one analysis, in the seven States  where new waivers were implemented during the Trump administration, it  seems that premiums declined--declined--by 7.5 percent.   The Trump administration guidance continues this success and gives  States even more of what they asked for--even more flexibility to  escape ObamaCare's burdens and more choices for consumers and lower  premiums. But, apparently, our Democratic colleagues are not terribly  fond of letting States shake off the unhelpful strictures of ObamaCare.  Perhaps, it makes their signature law look bad that Governors of both  parties are so eager to escape it.   That can't be their public argument. In their effort to reduce this  flexibility, some Democrats are rehashing tired, old claims about a  conspiracy to hurt Americans with preexisting conditions. Republicans  have been clear, and we have been consistent. We support protections  for Americans with preexisting conditions.   The CMS Administrator, Seema Verma, has specifically stated that ``a  section 1332 waiver cannot undermine coverage for people with pre- existing conditions.'' That is the head of CMS.   In fact, it is this Trump administration's policy that will help  American families, including those with preexisting conditions, by  helping to bring down the soaring premiums and restore the dwindling  options that ObamaCare's failures have brought about.   I urge the Senate to reject this misguided resolution. We don't need  healthcare policy from the supporters of ``Medicare for None,''  Democrats' grand scheme to take away the health insurance plans of 180  million Americans and replace it with a one-size-fits-all government  plan. Americans deserve more say, not less.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, when I joined  President Trump last year as he signed the farm bill, we marked a new  chapter for an historic American crop. In a victory for growers,  processors, and manufacturers across the country, especially in my home  State of Kentucky, my initiative for full hemp legalization became law.   This morning, the U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to take the  important next step. Secretary Perdue will release a new USDA  regulation to implement my initiative and move hemp closer to being  treated just like every other commodity. This new policy will help  farmers around the country continue pioneering this crop into the 21st  century.   I am proud to say that Kentucky is prepared to take the lead. For  generations, our growers and producers have made the Bluegrass State an  agricultural powerhouse, well-positioned at the forefront of hemp's  resurgence. Following the downturn in tobacco, it was my tobacco buyout  legislation that helped farmers transition toward new opportunities,  and a growing number are looking to this past crop--one grown by  Washington, Jefferson, and Henry Clay--as they plan for the future.   As the buyout payments came to an end, I secured the creation of hemp  pilot programs in the 2014 farm bill, empowering farmers and  researchers to begin a multiyear experiment with hemp's capabilities.   Thanks to leaders like Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles and his  predecessor, now-Congressman   James Comer, Kentucky was leading the  charge. The results were clear. The pilot program was working. So we  knew the 2018 farm bill had to take the next step.   I am grateful to Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, who  included my hemp initiative in the bill that is now law. I would also  like to thank the many Members on both sides of the aisle, including  Senator Ron Wyden, who have helped in this effort as well.   My hemp provisions in the farm bill directed USDA to craft a new  regulatory framework so hemp could be cultivated nationwide, with each  State given the opportunity to develop its own plan for hemp oversight.   I am grateful that Secretary Perdue accepted my invitation for a  Kentucky hemp tour so he could see our progress up close and learn from  Kentucky hemp farmers and regulators as USDA developed its policies.   This year alone, hemp is growing on more than 26,000 acres in  Kentucky, across 101 of our 120 counties. It supports hundreds of jobs  and tens of millions in sales.   I impressed upon USDA the need to finalize this new framework before  the 2020 growing season. I would like to thank Secretary Perdue and the  USDA for fulfilling this commitment with the announcement we are  expecting later this morning. I look forward to reviewing USDA's  guidelines and hearing from hemp stakeholders around Kentucky.   Our work to support the future of hemp is hardly over. There are  ongoing conversations with the FDA on CBD products and ongoing work to  help growers and retailers to access credit and financial products.  There will inevitably be ups and downs as this new industry develops,  but today's announcement is another crucial step. It is a privilege for  me to stand with Kentucky farmers every step of the way. Together, we  will continue charting hemp's course well into the future.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that debate  time for S.J.
