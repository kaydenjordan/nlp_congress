 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday the Senate received a  classified briefing for all Senators from the Trump administration on  the recent military operation that killed Iranian General Soleimani.  Nearly the entire Senate attended, but only 15 Senators were able to  ask questions before the administration decided they had to go. As many  as 82 Senators were left hanging in the balance without a chance to  answer their questions. It was a sight like none I have ever seen in my  time in the Senate.   This is a crucial issue: war and peace. These were five of the  leading people involved in the decision making, past, present and  future. If they couldn't stay to answer questions in a classified  briefing, that is the ultimate disrespect to the Senate.   I have to tell you, it was not just Democrats who were upset and not  just on the Republican side. Senator Paul and Senator Lee were upset.  Four or five Senators came over to me, in that room, when I made the  request that they come back, and said: Please count me in on that.   As Secretary Pompeo was practically running out the door, I asked the  White House representative if they would come back and finish the  briefing. Pompeo said no, on his behalf, but the White House  representative assured me the group would be back in short order.   I said: Within a week.   In the room, in the SCIF, he said they will definitely come back.   This morning, the White House told me they would explore coming back.  They are already backing off, as usual. This is imperative. We are  asking, in as polite a way as we can right now, Democrats and  Republicans, that these five leaders--the head of DNI, the head of the  CIA, the head of the Joint Chiefs, Secretary of Defense, and the  Secretary of State--come before us within a week and answer the  questions of the 82 Senators who were on the list and wanted to ask  questions but couldn't.   The scene at yesterday's briefing was unacceptable, as Members of  both sides of the aisle have attested. Eighty-two Senators--chairs,  ranking members, appropriators, authorized--were snubbed by this  administration on a matter of war and peace. They must return.   Again, this administration's thwarting of the exquisite balance the  Founding Fathers put in place between the Congress and Presidency is  something that would make the Founding Fathers turn over in their  graves and strikes at the core of what America is all about.   Why is it important we have this briefing? Because the danger of war  is still very real. There seems to be a sense that Iran's missile  strikes on U.S. installations in Iraq, which resulted in no U.S. or  coalition casualties, was a signal that our hostilities between our two  countries are deescalating. If that is true, it would certainly be a  good thing, but we all know Iran has many different ways of causing  trouble in the Middle East. Over  [[Page S101]]  the last decade, Iranian proxies have exported terror, fomented civil  strife throughout the region. We know they may seek to strike the  United States in many new ways, like through cyber attacks.  Undoubtedly, there is still a danger Iran will retaliate for the death  of General Soleimani in other ways, not only in the next days, where it  is possible they could, but in the next weeks and months.   In a speech yesterday, the Iran Supreme Leader said the Iranian  missile strike was just ``one slap.'' ``Such military actions,'' he  continued, ``are not enough as far as the importance of retaliation is  concerned.'' We have good reason to worry that Iran will do more,  particularly, given the fact that they are a regime that has many hard- liners who hate the United States and will try to do us as much damage  as they can. For other reasons as well, the risk of confrontation with  Iran has grown more acute, some of it because of President Trump's  actions.   At the President's order, we now have at least 15,000 additional U.S.  forces in the Middle East--more forces than we had at the beginning of  last summer--15,000 more. The Iranian public, which only weeks ago was  protesting its own political leaders, has rallied behind the regime and  is directing its entire ire at the United States. Iran has also  announced that it will no longer abide by any restraints on its nuclear  program that were imposed by the JCPOA, signaling its possible intent  to pursue a nuclear weapon.   For all these reasons--that clearly Iran is still a great danger and  the risk of war still looms--we need Senator Kaine's War Powers  Resolution more than ever.   The President has made several erratic and impulsive decisions when  it comes to foreign policy that have made Americans less safe, put even  more American forces in harm's way. More American troops are now headed  to the Middle East. We are not reducing our troop load; we are  increasing it.   Iran is no longer constrained by limits on its nuclear program. We  find ourselves even more isolated from allies and partners around the  world who are shaken by the recklessness and inconsistency of the  administration's foreign policy. The Trump administration cannot even  complete a congressional briefing. Congress, unequivocally, must hold  the President accountable and assert our authority over matters of war  and peace. That is what Senator Kaine's resolution would do.   We will have a debate on the floor in the Senate. I urge my  colleagues to support the Kaine resolution. There are many different  ways we can make sure we don't go into a war recklessly and without  check.   Senator Sanders today is introducing legislation, of which I am a  cosponsor, that will hold back funding for such a war. We Democrats  will continue to pursue ways to assert our constitutional authority and  make sure that before the administration takes any actions--because so  many of their actions tend to be reckless and impulsive--they have to  get the OK of Congress.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3178         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
