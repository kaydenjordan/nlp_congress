 Mr. President, government shutdowns are never the  answer. No matter how difficult the problem, we should never resort to  shutting down government. It harms too many innocent Federal  employees--in this case, 800,000 Federal employees and their families-- and it hampers the ability of American citizens to deal with their  government.   At the same time, we do have a problem at our southern border. We do  need to strengthen our border security and fix our broken immigration  system. We need to address the issue of the Dreamers population, those  young children brought to this country through no decision of their own  who are now, often, young adults and who are going to school or working  or otherwise serving in the military or contributing to our country.   The outlines of a compromise are evident, but in order to get there,  I believe we need to assure the President that we will seriously  consider his supplemental request for border security, a request that  includes not just funding for additional physical barriers to  supplement the more than 600 miles of physical barriers--walls,  fences--that were built during two previous administrations but also  includes $800 million to meet the humanitarian needs of those who are  crossing the border. It also includes additional funding for Border  Patrol agents and for Immigration and Customs and Border Enforcement.   This simply cannot continue. We need to come together in good faith,  reopen government for a limited period of time at least, and negotiate  a package that will strengthen security on our borders, and that is  what I would urge the President, his administration, and my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to do.   In the meantime, we also need to get back to the work of the Senate.  That, too, is important, and today I rise to introduce a bill that  would help Americans who are struggling with high healthcare expenses.  The tax deduction for certain unreimbursed, out-of-pocket medical  expenses affects many taxpayers significantly.   Regrettably, the threshold to claim this important tax deduction rose  from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income at the end of 2018, ending its  value for many American taxpayers who simply will no longer qualify.   Today, I reintroduce legislation, which I have sponsored with my  colleague Senator Cantwell, that would reinstate and make permanent the  lower income threshold for the medical expense deduction. Our bill, the  Medical Expense Savings Act, would once again allow taxpayers to deduct  unreimbursed healthcare costs that exceed 7.5 percent of their income.   For those who suffer from preexisting medical conditions, have  chronic illnesses, experience unexpected sickness or injuries, or  require long term care, out-of-pocket healthcare expenses can quickly  become an unbearable burden. Too many Americans are forced to choose  between medical services and other equally necessary expenditures or  they find themselves going deeply in debt.   The Affordable Care Act increased the income threshold for taxpayers  to deduct their medical expenses from 7.5 percent to 10 percent. I very  much opposed that provision of the ACA. For individuals under 65, the  increase went into effect in 2013, but for those over 65, individuals  would have been exposed to this higher threshold for the first time in  2017. Fortunately, we were able to remedy that for those over age 65.   When the ACA increase was phased in, many individuals struggling with  serious health conditions saw their financial health worsen. For  example, a 2016 study estimates that parents, including many with  limited means, already provide nearly $36 billion annually in  uncompensated medical care at home to children with special healthcare  needs, such as muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis.   A 2016 survey of cancer survivors showed that one-third go into debt,  and of those, more than half incurred more than $10,000 in unreimbursed  expenses.   For seniors with significant long-term care needs, the deduction  helps with the cost of home health or personal care services or, when  needed, the cost of a long-term care facility, such as a nursing home.  The deduction can also be used for other expenses that Medicare  generally does not cover, including dental treatment, vision care, and  certain transportation costs. Seniors can also use the medical expense  deduction for expenses like wheelchair ramps, installing railings and  support bars in bathrooms, and lowering or modifying kitchen cabinets  and equipment and other home modifications made for medical reasons.  These improvements can allow seniors with medical conditions or  disabilities to live at home in the safety, comfort, and familiarity of  their own home.   Some seniors find that their savings become rapidly depleted. They  may spend down their financial resources in order to receive the  services and support they require through the Medicaid Program.  According to Genworth's 2018 Cost of Care Survey, home health aide  services can cost $50,000 annually, while a private room at a nursing  home can cost nearly $100,000. By retaining a lower threshold for the  medical expense tax deduction, some families would be able to continue  to pay these essential costs themselves.   Some erroneously believe that this deduction only benefits the  wealthy, when, in fact, it is mainly lower and middle-income Americans  who have been hurt. According to AARP, nearly 70 percent of taxpayers  taking the deduction in 2014 reported income of $75,000 or less, and  nearly half reported incomes of $50,000 or less. In Maine, according to  AARP, almost 36,000 of our residents claimed this deduction in 2014,  and nearly 19,000 of these individuals reported an income of $50,000 or  less.  [[Page S265]]    That is why, during the tax reform debate in 2017, I introduced a  successful amendment that rolled back the income threshold to 7.5  percent for taxpayers to deduct their medical expenses in 2017 and  2018. My amendment expanded upon the efforts of Senators Rob Portman  and Sherrod Brown, who had worked to prevent this increase from going  into effect for individuals over 65. As I said, my amendment was  incorporated into the new tax law, and thus, for 2017 and for 2018, the  threshold for deducting these out-of-pocket medical costs was 7.5  percent of income. But at the end of last year, that expired.   The AARP and 44 other consumer groups have strongly endorsed the  effort undertaken by Senator Cantwell and me, stating that ``it  provides important tax relief which helps offset the costs of acute and  chronic medical conditions for older Americans, children, pregnant  women, disabled individuals, and other adults as well as the costs  associated with long-term care and assisted living.''   This is a step we can take to reinstate an expired tax deduction that  will make a real difference to people who are struggling with high out- of-pocket medical costs.   I urge my colleagues to support our legislation that will help our  families cope with high medical costs by making sure that this  important deduction remains available for future tax years.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a letter from AARP dated January 15, 2019, endorsing the Collins- Cantwell legislation.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                           AARP,                                       Washington, January 15, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Maria Cantwell,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins and Cantwell: On behalf of our       members and all Americans age 50 and older, AARP is writing       to thank you for introducing the Medical Expense Savings Act       (S. 110), legislation to permanently extend the 7.5 percent       income threshold for the medical expense deduction AARP, with       its more than 38 million members in all 50 states, the       District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories, represents       individuals seeking financial stability while managing their       health care and every effort should be made to keep the       threshold for the deduction as low as possible to help       protect those with high medical costs.        The medical expense deduction provides important tax relief       that helps offset the cost of acute and chronic medical       conditions for older Americans, children, and individuals       with disabilities. For many, the medical expense deduction       can help offset high out-of-pocket expenses--expenses that       qualify include money paid for diagnosis, treatment,       equipment, long-term care services, and long-term care       insurance premiums.        The tax filers who claim the medical expense deduction have       historically been age 50 or older and living with a chronic       condition or illness. The average Medicare beneficiary spends       about $5,680 out of pocket on medical care. The medical       expense deduction makes health care more affordable for       people with significant out-of-pocket expenses.        Furthermore, older Americans often face high costs for       long-term services and supports--which are generally not       covered by Medicare--as well as hospitalizations and       prescription drugs. The median cost for a private room in a       nursing home is over $97,000 annually, while the median cost       for even more cost-effective home-based care is still over       $30,000 per year (for 20 hours of care a week). In 2013,       roughly 25.8 million beneficiaries in traditional Medicare       spent at least 10 percent of their income on out-of-pocket       health care expenses. Tax relief in this area can provide       needed resources, especially important to middle income       seniors with high long-term care and medical costs.        The medical expense deduction is a critical tool in       managing health care cost for Americans with high out-of-      pocket expenses. For these reasons, we are pleased to endorse       this legislation and look forward to working on a bipartisan       basis with you to enact this legislation into law.

Rogers,                                              Senior Vice President,                                                Government Affairs.     Mr. President, I yield the floor.
