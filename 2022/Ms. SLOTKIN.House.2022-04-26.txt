 Madam Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the subject of the Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur).                   Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act     Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of our  country's greatest public servants and diplomats.  [[Page H4492]]    Madeleine Albright was a stateswoman, a trailblazer, and someone who  has been a friend and mentor to me and to so many other women in  national security.   I appreciate Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer for creating  this Special Order hour and allowing me to host it here and allow  Members of Congress from across this entire body to contribute some  remarks, some recognition, for a woman who has done so much to change  the course of history in the United States.   I think it is particularly important because not only was she our  first Secretary of State, not only was she at the U.N., not only does  she have a storied history in national security in the executive  branch, she was also here in Congress as a Congressional aide, a chief  of staff, a national security staffer, that made her mark in this body  as well.   She was also a national security staffer at the White House, one of  the first women to represent our country in the United Nations and, of  course, our very first female Secretary of State. Her remarkable career  and achievements are made all the more astonishing by the fact that she  first came to this country as a refugee, having first left  Czechoslovakia to escape the Nazis and then again to flee communist  rule in Eastern Europe after the Second World War.   Secretary Albright would be the first one to tell you that her story  would only be possible in the United States, the country she loved and  served even long after her time in government had come to an end.    She left her stamp at the U.N. and at the State Department with her  intelligence, her passion for human rights, and her unwavering  commitment to democratic ideals. On the world stage, she stood up to  dictators, shined the light on human rights abuses, and championed  diplomacy and democracy.   Even though she had always been an idol for me as a young woman in  national security, I actually didn't get a chance to meet her until  2018, until I became a Member of Congress. But the years that I have  spent getting to know her since then have been incredibly important to  me.   I think what many of us will recognize and remember is the class of  2018--that large group that were elected in 2018 to come into this  body--it had the most women that had ever been elected; one of the most  diverse classes that had ever been elected; one of the classes that  contained the largest number of national security people; people that  were veterans; and people that were former intelligence community  folks--like myself. Madeleine Albright was the speaker when we all  traveled to Williamsburg for our orientation, our session to get to  know each other and how to be a Member of Congress.   I met her there, along with her wonderful chief of staff, Jacob  Freedman, and basically had the honor of hosting her and walking her  around the room. What I remember very clearly is that she had  admiration coming at her from every corner: young, old, early parts of  their career, later parts of their career, and, importantly, Democrat  and Republican.   One of the fondest memories I have from that first year with her was  when she actually took me up on an offer to come to Michigan in early  2020, right before the pandemic really began. We did a road trip around  Michigan together.   I will go into that in just a moment, but I note that the Speaker has  just arrived on the floor.   We did this road trip across mid-Michigan. She was already over 80  years old. She took me up on this offer. She spoke at Michigan State  University. She spoke at Oakland University. She did events for folks  at restaurants and in private homes. We had her on an incredibly busy  schedule. She kept us on our toes, and she was never short of a kind  word or a borderline saucy joke the entire time. No matter where we  went, her presence was electric.   One of my proudest moments was when we brought in all the honor  students from the Rochester and Rochester Hills area. These are young  people, still in high school. I actually questioned whether they would  have a connection to this woman who had been the first female Secretary  of State long before some of them were born. It took about 1 second for  her to get a complete rock star welcome. All the students who came out  were desperate to talk to her about service, about being the first  female Secretary of State, about how to think about leading in their  own careers, and all the barriers that she had shattered.   At a separate event at Oakland University, the reception was no less  boisterous. We had, I think, up to 500 people. We were oversold; people  from across the community wanted to come in. And even at a moment of  deep polarization for our country, here was a woman who seemed to  supersede politics.   For us in Michigan, with so many Michiganders who left the Balkans to  come to the United States and resettled in Michigan, she, with that  community, is truly a hero. It is now etched firmly into the history  books that Secretary Albright was the driving force behind engaging the  United States and ending the genocide in the Balkans.   She understood that while America is not perfect, the world is better  off with a strong American leadership role in that world. She used her  moral authority to bring American might into that conflict and then  later negotiated the peace that, ever-tenuous, still holds today.   Her visit to Michigan was filled with people whose fates were quite  literally changed by her having a seat at the table as Secretary of  State, and being able to see that up close was a truly remarkable  experience for me and for all the people who came to greet her.   I would be remiss if I didn't point out that as someone who has spent  her career in national security, there just aren't that many senior  women we have to look up to for guidance, for mentorship. There are  very few women who had navigated the complicated waters of working and  leading in male-dominated fields.   Not only did Secretary Albright blaze a new trail for women in  national security, she also raised the bar for all of those who would  succeed her. She became the gold standard. Despite all the  accomplishments and accolades, this was a woman who never let ego cloud  her actions.                                time  1930    She was humble and gracious with everyone I saw her meet and engage  with in Michigan, students, parents, perfect strangers. She was  generous with her wisdom and insights, but never full of herself.   For her, the work she did in government was always about serving the  country that she loved, the country that welcomed her and her family as  refugees when she was just 11 year old.   Her preferred way of continuing to serve after leaving office was by  teaching the next generation of national security leaders. Her passion  for her students at Georgetown University was evident to everyone  around her, and it is no exaggeration to say that an entire generation  of rising public servants are better prepared for the challenges of the  21st century thanks to her guiding hand.   So this is how I will remember her: As a down-to-earth, warm, saucy  leader who meant something to perfect strangers and world leaders  alike. I am so grateful for the years that I had to get to know her and  for the chance to introduce her to the next generation in my State.   As we mourn the loss of this incredible humanitarian, we also  celebrate the life and achievements of a woman whose impact, both here  at home and in the farthest corners of the globe, will be felt for many  years to come.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I thank the Speaker for that personal  tribute.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority  leader.    Thank you, Mr. Leader, for those words.   I know we have a few other Members of Congress who are trying to make  it here, and so I will just say a couple more things as we wait for  them to come in.   When I was with Secretary Albright and brought her to Michigan, we  were on this road trip. I think most people know she is not a tall  woman. No one ever would describe her as a tall woman. She was quite  petite. I drove her around in my Ford Escape, and we had to kind of  help her into the front seat.   It happened to be what is called Paczki Day in Michigan, Fat Tuesday.  It is when we all eat these jelly doughnuts full of powdered sugar on  top. We brought a box of those in the car, and she indulged me and  tried a paczki that day.   We just had hours in the car driving around my very large district  and got to talking. I think that one of the best things you can have  when you are a younger person learning from someone who has really  broken glass ceilings is you have time with them to just hear stories  about what life was like.   She told me that her one regret in life is that she never ran for  Congress. She never ran for office. She was a chief of staff up here, a  legislative assistant. She was adjacent to campaigns pretty much her  entire adult life, but she never actually ran herself.   I can only imagine how successful she would have been as an elected  leader because, as Speaker Pelosi mentioned, she had that thing where  she could connect deeply with anyone from any background. Not all  Members of Congress elected today have that, and she had it in spades.   She had an ability, despite all the amazing things she had done, to  connect with real people, with strangers. I think people understood  that she was confident because she had seen a lot of things in her  life, and the woman had a code.   She had a code that she believed in, a principled place with which  she engaged in the world. When you meet someone who has a code, you  don't have to question whether they are kind of like a leaf blowing in  the wind, that they will bend to whatever whim. You have the confidence  to know that this person is going to make decisions based on character  and integrity. She really had that, and it kind of oozed out of her.  People could see that and feel that.   I know that this body would have been much strengthened should she  had ever decided to run for office. I am sorry that we all didn't get  to see that, but she helped so many of us who were seeking elected  office.   Then, just to add to what the majority leader said about her famous  quote, that there is a special place in hell for women who don't help  women--I think we have all seen that quote. I think most women  understand exactly what that means, but let me just give you an example  for many of us, particularly in national security, of what that really  meant.   When I joined the CIA as a young CIA officer in 2003, I was put on  the Iraq desk. We were in the middle of the Iraq war, and I would often  go and brief the senior-most folks at the CIA on kind of what was  happening on a daily basis. I would often go with mostly male  colleagues into these rooms and brief very senior folks.   At the time, there were a couple--just a couple--of very senior women  at the CIA. They had clawed their way to the top. I think at that  point, the most senior woman was the number three at the CIA, and there  were a few other senior women in the analytics side of the house.   I would go in and brief, and I remember very clearly going in with  all of my male colleagues, my peers, and this very senior woman kind of  had it out for the only other woman in the room. There was a generation  of women who were basically so sort of tough in making it to the top  that they really internalized this idea that there could only be one  senior woman. There could only be one woman who was in the shop with  the boys. So any other woman that came there was a threat, and you were  going to put your sights on that woman.   I remember my male colleagues saying, man, like, she just has it out  for you. It was a thing that a lot of us in national security grew up  with. Now, I am happy to say that, a few years later, that generation  largely retired, and in came the next generation of senior leaders who  believed in lifting women up.   But when Madeleine Albright gives that famous quote, that there is a  special place in hell for women who don't help women, she knows of what  she speaks. It is not a general statement. It is something that I know  she specifically had to deal with as a woman who was a leader on the  Hill, a leader in the executive branch.                                time  2000    And it is very hard when you are trained a certain way to change your  approach and say I am not going to repeat that kind of aggressive focus  on women, and I am going to learn from my experience and do something  different. I think she really embodied that. That was a very real thing  that was still going on until relatively recently in national security  circles.   Lastly, as we wait for Mr. Malinowski, somewhere in the ether, he  texted me to say that he was on his way. I will say that I noted that  Secretary Albright died just about exactly a month after the start of  the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I know that in her final days she was  watching, I am sure with rapt attention, what was happening in the  world.   As has been said many times tonight, she really was a person thinking  ahead that this competition between democracy and autocracy was not  over. It was not something of the past, it was not a Cold War-era  phenomenon that didn't exist anymore. It was very alive, like a bone in  the throat.   It gives me great peace that despite the terrible things that are  going on and watching the suffering of the Ukrainian people that  Madeleine Albright spent her life trying to push back on the kind of  violence and dictatorship that we see active right now. Her words and  lessons are helping us parse through what to do in a place like  Ukraine.   We have a history in places like Europe, particularly the Balkans, in  using American willpower and military power to help get us through  these conflicts because she laid that predicate by pushing in her era  when she was Secretary of State.   Despite the fact that she didn't get to see the end of this conflict,  I know that she would feel confident that whether it is in a few weeks  or a few months, whatever time it takes, that the principles of  democracy and freedom are not things you can just snuff out with the  barrel of a gun. I am sure she would have felt that deeply as she was  watching in her final days the events taking place in the world.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Malinowski).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those moving  remarks.   As I conclude here, I just want to thank everyone who came to speak,  and I feel extremely proud that these remarks and just a taste of the  Secretary's legacy will be kept forever in the official Record of the  people's House.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
