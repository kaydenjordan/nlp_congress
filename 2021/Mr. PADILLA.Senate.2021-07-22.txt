 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Water Reuse and  Resiliency Act.'' This legislation would authorize $1 billion for  innovative water infrastructure projects that respond to our Country's  growing water needs and the historic drought facing the Western United  States.   In the face of unprecedented heat and drought conditions across the  Western United States, and growing water resource challenges across the  entire Nation, it is critically important that we invest now to  modernize and adapt our water systems for the 21st century.   The Environmental Protection Agency's Alternative Water Source  Projects pilot program provides competitive grants to engineer, design,  construct, and test alternative water source systems, including water  recycling systems and projects that conserve, manage, reclaim, or reuse  water resources.   The Water Reuse and Resiliency Act would reauthorize the EPA's  Alternative Water Source Projects pilot program for five years,  increase the authorization to $1 billion, and make stormwater reuse and  groundwater recharge projects eligible for grant funding.   According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA), as of July 13, an estimated 89% of the Western U.S. is  experiencing drought. Unfortunately, historic droughts are becoming the  new normal. The impacts of drought on water availability are compounded  by triple-digit temperatures, record low snowpack levels, and a growing  population.   By expanding the use of alternative, non-traditional water sources,  such as capturing stormwater runoff and recycling wastewater for  groundwater recharge, the Water Reuse and Resiliency Act supports  innovations in water treatment that can deliver a new, safe, and  reliable source of water for potable use or irrigation.   I thank my co-lead, Senator Feinstein, for her tireless leadership  fighting for clean water for Californians and  [[Page S5054]]  all Americans. I also thank the cosponsors of this bill for championing  this vital effort with us in the Senate.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the ``Water  Reuse and Resiliency Act'' as quickly as possible.   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Water Reuse and  Resiliency Act.''
