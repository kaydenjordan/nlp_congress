 Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate a budget  scorekeeping report. The report, which covers fiscal year 2022, was  prepared by my staff on the Budget Committee and the Congressional  Budget Office pursuant to section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of  the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This information  allows the Senate Budget Committee to determine if budgetary points of  order lie against pending legislation.   The report shows the effect on spending and revenues of congressional  action through September 15, 2022, as compared to the levels the Senate  agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2022, S. Con. Res.  14. Since my last scorekeeping report on April 28, seven laws with  significant budgetary effects have been signed by the President, and I  have revised the levels in the budget resolution two times for  legislation.   The Democratic staff of the Budget Committee prepared tables 1 and 2.  Table 1 compares the mandatory spending of each authorizing committee  against the enforceable allocations under section 302 of the  Congressional Budget Act. It shows 10 of the 16 authorizing committees  are in compliance with their allocations, either because no legislation  with significant budgetary costs was enacted or the legislation  qualified under the budget resolution for an allocation adjustment.  Most of the spending above allowable levels is attributed to either the  CHIPS Act of 2022 or the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022.   Table 2 shows the Senate pay-as-you-go--PAYGO--scorecard tallying  enacted legislation with significant effects on mandatory spending and  revenues. The scorecard shows a savings of $4.7 billion in 2022, a  deficit of $174 billion over the 2022-2026 period, and a deficit of  $528 billion over the 2022-2031 period. When compared to the allowable  amounts on the PAYGO scorecard last adjusted on September 12, there is  a deficit of $1.3 billion on the scorecard for 2022, $185 billion over  the 2022-2026 period, and $667 billion over the 2022-2031 period.   In addition to these tables, I am submitting a letter from the  Congressional Budget Office with further detail. For fiscal year 2022,  current budgetary levels are within allowed amounts. Current law budget  authority is $2.6 billion below the maximum allowed in the revised  budget resolution, outlays are $17 billion below the allowed maximum,  and revenues are $68 million above the allowed minimum. The tables also  show that there has been no net change for Social Security.   I ask unanimous consent that the letter and accompanying tables from  CBO be printed in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     [[Page S4848]]      TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEE SPENDING COMPARED TO ALLOCATIONS   [$ In millions, positive numbers represent spending above enforceable                                  limits] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             2022    2022-2026  2022-2031 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:     Budget Authority....................    -2,293       -293       -393     Outlays.............................       287        707        607 Armed Services:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Commerce, Science, and Transportation:     Budget Authority....................    24,403     55,400     60,445     Outlays.............................         2     25,582     55,329 Energy and Natural Resources:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Environment and Public Works:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Finance:     Budget Authority....................       454        770         67     Outlays.............................       525        742        -43 Foreign Relations:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Indian Affairs:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Intelligence:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Judiciary:     Budget Authority....................         6        408        782     Outlays.............................         6        391        769 Rules and Administration:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Small Business and Entrepreneurship:     Budget Authority....................         0         10         93     Outlays.............................         0          1         60 Veterans' Affairs:     Budget Authority....................     2,114    191,809    679,440     Outlays.............................       630    183,533    667,116                                          -------------------------------     Memo--all committees, total over      allocation:         Budget Authority................    24,684    248,104    740,434         Outlays.........................     1,450    210,956    723,838 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                       TABLE 2.--SENATE PAY-AS-YOU-GO SCORECARD            [$ In millions, positive numbers increase deficits] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                        2022      2022-2026    2022-2031 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Deficit Impact of Legislation           -4,699      173,934      528,190  Enacted Through September 15,  2022............................

[[Page S4849]]    For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 in the Senate, the aggregate   spending and revenue levels for 2022 published in the Congressional Record on September 23, 2022, by the   Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget pursuant to section 4006 of the Concurrent Resolution on the   Budget for Fiscal Year 2022 (S. Con. Res. 14) do not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-   budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level report do not include those items. In keeping with the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255), certain funding for the Department of Health and   Human Services is excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Congressional Budget Act and the Balanced   Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.

P.L. = public law; -- = excluded from PAYGO scorecard; * = between -$500.000 and $500,000; n.e. = not able to   estimate a On September 23, 2021, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget reset the Senate's Pay-As-You-Go   Scorecard to zero for all fiscal years. b The amounts shown represent the estimated effect of the public laws on the deficit. c Excludes off-budget amounts. d Section 3201(b) requires the budgetary effects of that division to be excluded from the Senate's PAYGO   scorecard; however, the revenue effects from the immigration extensions included in division A are included in   the scorecard because division A does not fall within the exclusion in section 3201 of division D. e Pursuant to section 3110 of S. Con. Res. 11 (114th Congress), the Concurrent Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year   2016, the budgetary effects stemming from increases in enterprise guarantee fees of the Federal National   Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation are excluded. f Pursuant to section 905(b), the budgetary effects of division J are excluded from the Senate's PAYGO   Scorecard. In addition, 905(c) classifies the budgetary effects of division J as emergency and emergency   amounts are excluded from the Senate's PAYGO Scorecard. g Section 2201 requires the estimated budgetary effects stemming from division C to be excluded from the   Senate's PAYGO Scorecard; however, the insignificant revenue effects from immigration extensions included in   division A are included in the scorecard because division A does not fall within the exclusion of section   2201. h The act increases outlays and revenues by an equal amount resulting in a neutral net impact on the deficit. i CBO has insufficient information about how the Administration would use the authorities under this legislation   and thus has no basis to estimate its effects on federal spending. j Section 21(b) designates that the outlays that were previously designated as emergency would continue to be   designated as emergency pursuant to section 4001(a) and section 4001(b) of S.Con.Res. 14 (117th Congress). The   revenues however, are included in this table but are insignificant in every year and cumulatively. k Section 23005 excludes the budgetary effects of each division in this Act from the Senate's PAYGO Scorecard. l The budgetary effects of the bill are excluded from the Senate PAYGO Scorecard pursuant to sections 102(f)(2),   106(e)(2), 107(e)(2), and 10003(b). m Pursuant to section 4106(a)(6) of H.Con.Res. 71, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018   (115th Congress), a reconciliation bill that provides net deficit reduction shall not be entered on the   Senate's PAYGO Scorecard. Since the current year and five-year totals do not provide deficit reduction they   are included in this table.                                ____________________
