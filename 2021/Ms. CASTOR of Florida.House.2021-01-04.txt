 Madam Speaker, as we enter a new year,  Americans are urging us to come together and tackle our toughest  challenges, and that includes the costly climate crisis.   In the previous Congress, the House directed that a Select Committee  on the Climate Crisis develop a roadmap for America's clean energy  future. With a broad cross section of ideas and input, the committee  developed a majority staff report that was a detailed roadmap for  action. It was called the Solving the Climate Crisis plan. It has been  described as the most well-thought-out plan for addressing climate  change that has ever been part of U.S. politics, an extraordinary  synthesis of expertise from social and scientific fields.  [[Page H28]]    Some of our recommendations have already been adopted into law  through bipartisan legislation, but we have much more work to do. This  excellent rules package will allow us to continue our work in the 117th  Congress.   Our bipartisan committee intends to advance clean energy solutions  that unleash American innovation, promote environmental justice, and  create good family-sustaining jobs in all communities across the  country.   I urge Members to support the rules package, and I thank Speaker  Pelosi, Chairman McGovern, and the Committee on Rules for their work  and for their vision.
