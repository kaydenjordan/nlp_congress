 Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the  nomination of Neomi Rao to serve as a judge on the United States Court  of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Ms. Rao is the latest  in a string of ultra-conservative judicial nominees who will  rubberstamp Donald Trump's far-right agenda. Her record portends a  threat to the rights of women and minorities, to consumer protection  statutes and regulations, and to the security of our financial  institutions.   Moreover, Ms. Rao utterly lacks the experience to serve on the court  that many view as second in importance only to the U.S. Supreme Court.  She practiced for only 3 years as an associate at a large law firm.  None of her practice was in Federal courts or State courts, before  administrative agencies, or involved criminal proceedings.   These are disqualifying reasons on their own, but I rise to speak  about Ms. Rao's record on the environment, and the contempt she has  demonstrated for fair, reasonable, and commonsense regulations that  protect the health of our communities and the safety of our air and  drinking water.   Ms. Rao currently serves in the Office of Management and Budget as  Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,  OIRA. She is commonly known as the Trump administration's ``regulatory  czar.'' This role has her in charge of implementing the Trump  administration's anti-environment, climate-change-denying, and  polluter-friendly agenda.   Ms. Rao has called climate change a ``dangerous orthodoxy,'' led the  Trump administration's efforts to gut fundamental environmental  protections, and has misused the regulatory review process for partisan  political purposes.   The attacks on the environment that Ms. Rao has launched from OIRA  include rolling back national auto fuel efficiency standards,  challenging California's Clean Air Act waiver that allowed it to set  higher fuel efficiency standards, removing safety rules for fertilizer  plants, and rolling back safety rules put in place for oil rigs after  the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in 2010.   During review of a proposed rollback of the Methane and Waste  Prevention Rule, Ms. Rao's office repeatedly pressured the  Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to adopt fossil fuel industry  requests to significantly reduce natural gas leak inspections. This  would have doubled the amount of methane released into the atmosphere  and, according to the EPA's own determination, conflicted with its  legal obligation to reduce emissions.   Ms. Rao's office censored language about the impact of climate change  on child health when reviewing a proposed rollback of the Refrigerant  Management Program, a program that limited the release of greenhouse  gases thousands of times more powerful that carbon dioxide.   Ms. Rao's office approved a proposed EPA rule to roll back public  health protections that reduce pollution from wood-burning stoves,  despite the EPA's own admission that the new rule would cost nine times  as much in harm to public health as it would benefit the industry.   Ms. Rao has overseen the Trump administration's repeal of regulations  to address climate change, including a repeal of President Obama's  historic Clean Power Plan that would have significantly reduced  greenhouse gas emissions. By comparison, Ms. Rao has approved a  proposal to replace the Clean Power Plan with a rule that would lead to  increases in carbon dioxide emissions, asthma attacks, and even death  from black carbon, mercury, and other dangerous air emissions from  power plants.   It is bad enough that, with Donald Trump, we have a climate-change  denier in the White House, and with Andrew Wheeler, we have a coal  industry lobbyist running the EPA. We don't need a judge on the DC  Circuit whose record demonstrates that she is a sympathetic ally to  their anti-environment agenda. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the  nomination of Neomi Rao to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.    Mr. President, today I recognize Frank Moroney,  executive director of AFSCME Council 93 and the AFSCME International  vice president for the northern New England region. For his entire  life, Frank has been a committed and fearless advocate for working  people. Now, after four decades of service, he is entering a well- deserved retirement.   Frank began his career with AFSCME in 1967, when he joined Local 1358  as a worker in the Brookline Water Department. He quickly rose through  the union ranks, and in 1971, he was elected president of the local.  Frank scored two huge victories for his members early in his career. In  1973, he successfully took his local on strike  [[Page S1841]]  and received important longevity benefits for its members. He then  fought for survivor health insurance benefits for all Brookline's  municipal employees, taking the fight to the voters and winning on a  ballot initiative.   Frank would build on these achievements as his career progressed,  improving the lives of thousands of public employees throughout New  England. He secured numerous wage increases, obtained more paid sick  leave time, and successfully negotiated the Agency Fee in Maine. In  2012, Frank was appointed as the executive director of Council 93 and  as vice president to the AFSCME International Executive Board, where he  has served since. It is a leadership position befiting his service and  dedication.   On April 1, 2019, Frank will retire as AFSCME Council 93 executive  director. Throughout my and Frank's years of service, I have had the  privilege of working closely with him and am lucky enough to call him  my friend. Frank is irreplaceable, but his successes have left the  council strong and one of the most effective AFSCME affiliates in the  Nation.                            ____________________
