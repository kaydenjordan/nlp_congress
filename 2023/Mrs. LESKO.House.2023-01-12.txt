 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 22.   This administration's war on American energy has sent energy costs  through the roof. While this administration has continued to shift  blame for the rising prices, President Biden is draining our Strategic  Petroleum Reserve meant for emergencies by selling off some of these  reserves in a Band-Aid solution for his policy failures.   Since May of last year, the Biden administration has sold off 1  million barrels of oil per day until after the midterm elections.  Thanks to President Biden's actions, our oil reserve is now at the  lowest point in 40 years. Yet, this administration has no plan to  unleash American energy production to replenish our emergency oil  supply and reduce prices.   To make matters even worse, while the Biden administration is selling  off our emergency oil reserve at an unprecedented rate, some of these  barrels  [[Page H215]]  of oil have gone to Communist China. That is right. Our emergency oil  supply is now in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.   We are exporting a total of 300,000 barrels of oil per day to China.  In part--because of the Biden administration--China, not the U.S., has  the largest government-controlled stockpile of oil in the world.   With this legislation, House Republicans are delivering on our  promise to restore our Nation's energy security and better protect our  national security. This legislation stops the Biden administration from  selling any more of our emergency supply to the Chinese Communist  Party.   House Republicans will continue to stand up to China and stop the  Biden administration from ceding our energy security to our enemies.
