 Mr. Speaker, on Friday, April 27, 2018, I  missed rollcall vote 166, a Motion to Table H. Res. 856, a Privileged  Resolution offered by Mr. Crowley of New York to create Select  Committee to investigate the motivations and reasoning behind the  forced resignation of the House Chaplain. I stand in full support of  the Crowley resolution regarding the Speaker's decision to  [[Page H3728]]  forcibly push the House Chaplain Father Conroy to resign.   If I had been present for this vote, I would have voted: ``nay'' on  rollcall vote 166.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
