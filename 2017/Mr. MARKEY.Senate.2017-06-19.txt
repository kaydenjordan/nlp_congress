 Mr. President, last year, nearly 2,000 people in  Massachusetts died from opioid overdoses. If the same number had died  in America, it would have been 100,000 people. Thank God that because  of the Affordable Care Act, many of those people received treatment who  otherwise would have passed away last year. The number would have been  a much larger number across our State and across the country. Because  of the Affordable Care Act, the number was low, but that number was  still much too high.   I want to be able to tell the people in Massachusetts what the impact  of the Republican healthcare bill will be on their families in terms of  getting access to the opioid addiction treatment they will need so that  the number does not continue to go up but to go down. I want to be able  to tell them what that coverage will be before I vote upon it, but the  majority will just not let that happen. They are keeping the bill  hidden. They do not plan to make it public until the very last minute,  with our having less than a day to view it before we vote upon it. That  will be catastrophic for those families who need opioid addiction  treatment--absolutely catastrophic.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no motion to proceed to  Calendar No. 120, H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act, be in order  until the bill has been the subject of executive session meetings in  the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions, during which amendments from the majority and minority  received votes and the bill has been reported favorably from the  committees.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Mr. McCONNELL. I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from New York.    Mr. President, when I was home in Massachusetts this  weekend, I constantly had people coming up to me and asking me about  the secret Republican healthcare bill--what is in it and how it is  going to affect their families--because, to use Donald Trump's words,  they are afraid that it is going to increase premiums, and that would  be mean; that it is going to make it possible for insurers to deny  coverage for preexisting conditions, and that would be mean; that it  would create an age tax for older Americans, and that would be mean;  that it would cut Medicaid coverage for grandma and grandpa to get a  nursing home bed if they had Alzheimer's, and that would be mean.   So the question that kept coming to me all weekend was, is this  secret bill really meant to cut all of the funding that goes for the  poor, the sick, the elderly, and the disabled so they can give tax  breaks to the wealthiest people in America? Can we get that out so  people can see that?   They also said to me that they didn't want to be fooled, because  their fear is that TrumpCare is as much a healthcare bill as Trump  University was a college institution and that there really isn't any  healthcare in it and that it is cruel, inhumane, and immoral.   So we are demanding that the Republicans show us the bill so the  American people can see the bill and understand what is in it because  the consequences for their family's health are so dramatic.   As a result, I ask unanimous consent that Calendar No. 120, H.R.  1628, the American Health Care Act, be referred jointly to the  Committee on Finance and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions with instructions to report the bill with changes to eliminate  provisions that, No. 1, increase health insurance costs;  [[Page S3580]]  No. 2, reduce coverage; No. 3, make healthcare less affordable for  those with preexisting conditions; and No. 4, reduce tax liabilities  for corporations and individuals with incomes over $1 million.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Mr. McCONNELL. I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from New Jersey.    Mr. President, when a Pope dies, the cardinals meet in  secret to select the next Pope. A white cloud goes up in smoke. When  the Senate Republicans meet in secret to craft a healthcare bill,  coverage for the sick, the disabled, and the elderly is what goes up in  smoke--all of that coverage. The only thing more secret than the  Republican healthcare bill is Donald Trump's tax returns.   We might need ultimately to have a special counsel to go and to find  out what is inside of that healthcare bill because right now the  Democrats don't know, the American public doesn't know, and no one  knows what is in that bill. While we may not have details on the  Republicans' secretive proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable  Care Act, we know that they are not completely rewriting the House- passed legislation that eviscerates the Medicaid Program and reduces  coverage and increases costs for most Americans and for the  individuals, the families, and the communities caught in an opioid  crisis. This bill will be a complete calamity, and it is being done  totally in secret.   Right now, the press is being stifled. The White House didn't even  let reporters audiotape the press briefing today. Last week, the Senate  Republicans tried to keep the press from asking questions of Senators  in the hall. They don't want the press to know about this bill or to  cover it.   But for families who need treatment for opioids, the Republicans want  to take the money from substance use disorder coverage and care and use  it to offset a $5.5 trillion tax cut for the healthy wealthy and for  massive corporations. That would be cruel. It would be immoral. It  would be inhumane. Like President Trump himself has said, it would be  ``mean.''   We know the opioid epidemic knows no demographic, economic, or  political boundaries. It has ruined the lives of men and women from  Lexington, MA, to Lexington, KY. It is an equal opportunity destroyer.  That is one of the reasons why, over the last year, combating the  opioid epidemic has been a bipartisan issue.   Eleven months ago, this body passed and sent to the President's desk  the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Known as CARA, this  bipartisan law strengthens the States' responses to the opioid crisis,  and it passed the Senate 92 to 2.   Six months ago, the Senate passed the 21st Century Cures Act 94 to 5.  This bill quickly became law and allocated $1 billion to States to  provide much needed resources to help them address the opioid epidemic  on the ground and in their communities.   Yet today Senate Republicans are singlehandedly attempting to betray  that progress and to erase it from the history books. They are doing so  by crafting in secret a bill to gut Medicaid and repeal the Affordable  Care Act and replace it with a shell that hides a massive tax break for  the wealthiest people in our country--people who do not need or deserve  a tax break, especially if it is coming from the healthcare coverage of  those people who are sickest, those people who are oldest, those people  who are most disabled, those people who are most vulnerable to having  an addiction to opioids and need treatment. It would be wrong to take  their money for that healthcare coverage and give it as a tax break to  the wealthiest billionaires in America, who already have enough money  for their healthcare coverage.   This would be a death sentence to the 2.8 million Americans with  substance use disorders, including 220,000 with an opioid use disorder  at risk of losing their insurance coverage altogether in order to  ensure that their family member can get treatment.   For those who do manage to get insurance coverage, TrumpCare will  make it more expensive to get the treatment and the care they need. The  Congressional Budget Office explicitly said that out-of-pocket spending  on mental health and substance abuse services could increase by  thousands of dollars per individual in any one given year. For a  disease as critical as an opioid use disorder, any delay in treatment  can be the difference between life and death, not to mention that,  because TrumpCare reduces protections for people with preexisting  conditions, even those with insurance may find out that the coverage  they have won't work for them when they need it the most. Under the  Republican proposal, a substance use disorder could be classified as a  preexisting condition and, therefore, you couldn't get coverage for it.   The Congressional Budget Office also said that TrumpCare would slash  Medicaid by $834 billion, permanently decapitating Medicaid. They say  they are moving to a per capita system. Another way of saying that, if  you are an  [[Page S3585]]  ordinary person, is decapitation of Medicaid for the families across  our country who need it.   If this becomes law, there is no Narcan for Medicaid. Once it is cut  by TrumpCare, it is dead.   Those devastating cuts would grind the progress we have made in  expanding access to opioid treatment to a screeching halt and kick  people currently in treatment to the curb. Medicaid spent $7 billion on  substance use disorder treatment alone in 2014. That money facilitated  access to care, access to recovery, and access to hope for millions of  Americans. Medicaid can cover in-patient detox treatment, care  coordination, access to naloxone.   Additionally, Medicaid pays for one-third of the medication-assisted  treatments in the country, more than any other payer. In Massachusetts,  Medicaid pays for nearly one-half of the medication-assisted treatment  provided in the Commonwealth. So think about that. One half of the  people who get medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction will  lose their coverage, and, then, the Republicans are going to take the  money they save and give it to the wealthiest people in our country,  who also need the same coverage, leaving them with the money needed for  those who are the one-half who won't have it. What happens to those  other individuals? It could be a death sentence without treatment.   Those of us from States hardest hit by the opioid epidemic hear time  and again how Medicaid coverage of those services saves lives.   Dawn from Swansea, MA, shared the story of her son, who became  addicted to opioids after experimenting with prescription pain pills  from a family member. Through Medicaid, he was able to access  medication-assisted treatment to help treat his substance use disorder.  Dawn said:         He has done very well with his recovery so far but I fear       that without insurance coverage that will allow him to       continue obtaining his medication and counseling . . . he may       lose all that he has gained and fall back into the cycle of       addiction. His medical insurance is literally his lifeline.       Please don't abandon my son and others like him who need       Medicaid assistance to continue their fight against       addiction.    Instead of recognizing the importance of Medicaid for families like  Dawn's across the country, Republicans are proposing to starve this  lifesaving program from Federal funding through TrumpCare by cutting  more than a quarter of its budget. Because that is not enough to fund  the massive tax breaks that Republicans want for their donor friends,  President Trump has proposed in his budget to cut the program by an  additional $600 billion, leaving Medicaid a shell of its former self.   Although Republicans refer to the changes as capping the Medicaid  Program, for Dawn's son, what that really means is they will decapitate  his access to medication-assisted treatment, decapitate his ability to  seek counseling, and decapitate the peace of mind Dawn receives in  knowing her son is accessing the help he needs.   We also have to consider the Affordable Care Act's Prevention and  Public Health Fund and its role in the opioid epidemic. It is the  Federal Government's single largest investment in prevention.   Since 2010, Massachusetts has received more than $95 million through  the prevention fund. Importantly for Massachusetts, nearly $4.5 million  has been given to the preventive health services block grant that has  helped the State respond to the heroin, prescription drug, and fentanyl  drug crisis. Eliminating this fund will only hurt our ability to  respond to the opioid and other drug epidemics popping up in every one  of our communities.   We should not be building bridges to recovery with money that is  stolen from those programs in order to be spent on a wall that is going  to pretend to block the drugs from coming in from overseas. We should  be building bridges to recovery, not walls to isolation.   Instead of more commissions, we need more commitments from the  administration and congressional Republicans to not undo the progress  we have made in preventing and treating substance abuse disorder. It is  unfortunate that Republicans who touted our progress on opioid issues  aren't standing up to the policies in TrumpCare that would negate their  hard work. By supporting this, they are betraying the families and  communities who have suffered from the relentless grip of substance use  disorders. When discussing the opioid crisis, the only thing the GOP  stands for right now is Gutting Overdose Prevention. That is the new  GOP--Gutting Overdose Prevention.   While devastating, this isn't surprising for those of us who have  been watching many congressional Republicans salivate over ways to  annihilate Medicaid for decades. Republicans harbor an ancient  animosity toward Medicaid. Raiding the Medicaid coffers achieves two of  their goals: First, it kills a lifeline for more than 70 million low- income and working-class Americans. Second, it provides the GOP a  piggybank to aid their donors and pay for these tax breaks for their  friends. In fact, TrumpCare alone would provide the wealthiest  individuals and national corporations with over $660 billion in tax  breaks over 10 years. Included in this figure is the repeal of the  health insurance tax, which gives a $145 billion tax break to insurance  conglomerations and their CEOs. Millionaires will get a tax break of  $50,000 a year--more than three times the income of most Medicaid  beneficiaries--and the top 400 highest income earners would save $7  million in taxes annually. All of this comes at the expense of the 23  million Americans who will lose health insurance coverage under  TrumpCare.   Don't let the GOP fool you--TrumpCare is not about creating health,  it is about concentrating wealth in the hands of a small number of  Americans. It is about making middle-class and working Americans pay  for a tax break for people who need it least.   We can do better than this. We owe it to the families of the 33,000  Americans who died from an opioid overdose last year. The proposals  under consideration with Republicans is going to only add to the tally  of overdose deaths. We are hearing that Senate Republicans could create  an opioid fund as a paltry attempt to appease those who have called out  the cruelties in this bill. That extra funding would be crumbs. It  would be like trading a full-body cast for a bandaid, like trading land  for a couple of beads, like trading a Cadillac for a tricycle.   We will not be fooled. We know it took Republicans more than 1 year  to agree to providing the funding for emergency opioid response in the  CURES bill. One can only imagine how long it will take to get any money  the Republicans are promoting as a consolation prize out to the  communities who need it. We know that a vote for TrumpCare is a vote to  perpetuate overdose deaths. Passing this bill will be just aiding and  abetting one of public health's most wanted and most notorious serial  killers.   Americans from both political parties are not fooled by President  Trump's tax cut shell game on the backs of families and communities who  have been ravaged by opioids. That is why Democrats will continue to be  a public megaphone and shout from the rooftops that eviscerating  Medicaid to give a tax cut to the healthy and wealthy is mean,  inhumane, and immoral, and we are not going to stand for it, and the  American people are not going to stand for it.   The best vote I ever cast in my political career of 41 years in  Congress was for the Affordable Care Act. The second best vote I will  ever cast is to block the repeal of the Affordable Care Act because of  the good it has done for tens of millions of families in our country  who otherwise would not have the coverage they need.   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.
