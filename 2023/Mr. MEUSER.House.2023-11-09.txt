 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank and honor the brave  men and women who have served our country's military.   As we approach Veterans Day, let me especially recognize the more  than 800,000 veterans who call Pennsylvania home, including the 56,000  who reside in my district, Pennsylvania's Ninth. Pennsylvania's Ninth  is also home to the Army and Air Force National Guard at Fort  Indiantown Gap.   Throughout our history, our forefathers, forebears, and family  members have put service above self in defense of our freedoms. They  have fought to preserve our Republic, to promote righteousness, and to  protect our homeland. When fighting overseas, the only land we asked  for was enough to bury our dead.   Our veterans fought for us. It is now our duty here in this House to  work for them.   Since coming to Congress, we have enacted legislation like the PACT  Act, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, and more, all aimed at  expanding veterans benefits and ensuring veterans receive the medical  care they have earned.   Madam Speaker, this weekend, let's thank and honor those who have  served as we celebrate Veterans Day.                            ____________________
