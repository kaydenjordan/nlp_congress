 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of these Articles  of Impeachment. I come to this floor not as a Democrat, not as a  Republican, but as an American who cares deeply about the Constitution,  the rule of law, and the rights of the people.   Under our system of government, impeachment is not about policy  disagreements or ineffective governance, nor is it about criminality  based on statutes that did not exist at the time our Constitution was  written. Impeachment is about maintaining the integrity of the Office  of the Presidency and ensuring that Executive power is directed toward  proper ends in accordance with the law.   The Constitution grants the House ``the sole power of impeachment''  and the Senate ``the sole power to try all impeachments.''   We in the House are empowered to charge impeachable conduct. The  Constitution describes such conduct as ``high crimes and  misdemeanors,'' but because it pertains to high office and relates to  the misuse of that office, we need not rely on any other branch or body  to endorse our determinations. We have ``the sole power of  impeachment.''   In Federalist No. 65, Alexander Hamilton wrote that high crimes and  misdemeanors ``are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of  public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some  public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be  denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done  immediately to the society itself.''    President Donald J. Trump has abused and violated the public trust by  using his high office to solicit the aid of a foreign power, not for  the benefit of the United States of America, but, instead, for his  personal and political gain. His actions reflect precisely the type of  conduct the Framers of the Constitution intended to remedy through the  power of impeachment, and it is our duty to impeach him.
