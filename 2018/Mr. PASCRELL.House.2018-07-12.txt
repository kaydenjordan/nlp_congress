 Madam Speaker, in light of the upcoming one-on-one  meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, I rise today to  remind the American people about the cloud of collusion hanging over  their heads.   As the American people continue to learn details of this unfolding  scandal, the implausible idea of Russia compromising the President of  the United States becomes more fact than fiction. The President, his  family members, his campaign staff, and his close associates have  repeatedly lied about their multiple contacts with Russian officials  and close associates of Putin. They have had no consistent explanation  for these meetings. It has happened over and over.   Furthermore, the President continues to parrot Putin's version of  [[Page H6169]]  world events over those of his own American career civil servants,  intelligence operatives, military officials, and allies. This betrayal  has become like clockwork, an inexplicable routine we cannot simply  shrug off.   While it is possible the current list of known campaign contacts,  positive policy positions, and fawning statements have an innocuous  explanation, there is a simpler reason the House should be  investigating: Has President Donald Trump been covertly influenced or  personally compromised by Russia, a hostile foreign power?   Russian intelligence is known for using blackmail that exploits  greed, stupidity, and ego--and other weaknesses--to leverage over  people. He has employed Mr. Michael Cohen, Mr. Felix Sater--the record  is very clear on this--both of whom have links to the Russian mafia. He  has continued the secrecy about his business finances by not releasing  his tax returns.   The ethics commissioner told the President of the United States to  divest. He did not, and he defied that person most responsible for  draining the swamp, the ethics commissioner.   From operating his business at or beyond the edge of ethical  boundaries, Trump's penchant for compromising behavior, his willingness  to work closely with criminals and expressed desire to protect his  privacy makes him the ideal target.   With close business ties, Russia has enjoyed financial leverage over  President Trump for 15 years. This is a fact that his family has  admitted to multiple times. The story is well known.   After a series of brazen abuses of bankruptcy laws, President Trump,  who was not President at the time, Mr. Trump, found it impossible to  borrow from American banks, so he turned to unconventional sources of  capital, including Russian cash.   From 2003 to 2017, people from the former Soviet Union made 86 all- cash purchases that we know of, a known red flag of potential money  laundering of Trump properties, totaling $109 million.   ``Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot  of our assets.'' Those are the words of Donald Junior in 2008.   In 2010, the private wealth division of Deutsche Bank also loaned  President Trump hundreds of millions of dollars during the same period  it was laundering billions in Russian money.   ``We don't rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need  out of Russia.'' Those are the boasts of Eric Trump from 2014.   Shady business transactions offer the perfect cover for covert  payments, and President Trump's adamant refusal to release his tax  returns publicly only raises the level of suspicion.   The idea that Russia has been cultivating, supporting, and assisting  Donald Trump to undermine Western alliances should come as no surprise  to anyone paying attention. Before and during his campaign for  President--Mr. Trump--there were several odd connections between the  two men, which they lied about to the public.   As President, Mr. Trump called Putin ``fine people.'' He ignored the  fact that Putin invaded Crimea; intervened in eastern Ukraine; poisoned  people in the United Kingdom; has commissioned the murder of  dissidents, journalists, and spies; shot down a commercial airliner in  Europe; propped up the most ruthless dictator of our time in Syria; and  violated our sovereignty in the 2016 Presidential election, by every-- every--intelligence organization that says ``USA.''   To ensure the American people and future Congresses know how we got  here today, today I will read parts of the Trump-Russia dossier into  the Record, also known as the Christopher Steele dossier, and include a  link to its entirety in the Congressional Record.   Partisans on the other side of the aisle may dismiss the document as  bogus, even fake news, but they know that several allegations in this  document have already been verified. While the dossier represents raw  intelligence or, effectively, a first draft, not a single thing of  substance has been disproven--not one. And Christopher Steele has  reliably provided intelligence to the U.K. and U.S. intelligence  agencies for decades.   While history will be the final judge on these matters, these are  some of the allegations which we know have been verified.   Madam Speaker, this is serious business. When I read from the  dossier, I am reading from my prime source. What I read tonight has all  been verified and certified, that which I am reading.                                time  1845    While history will be a final judge on these matters, here are some  of the allegations. Page 1 of the dossier, the claim: ``Russian regime  has been cultivating, supporting, and assisting Trump for at least 5  years. Aim, endorsed by Putin, has been to encourage splits and  divisions in the Western alliance''--in the Western alliance.   ``So far,'' the dossier reads, I will continue, ``Trump has declined  various sweetener real estate business deals offered him in Russia in  order to further the Kremlin's cultivation of him. However, he and his  inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the  Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.''   Now, here is the truth: On January 6, 2017, an intelligence community  assessment released by the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence stated that Russian leadership favored Trump's candidacy  over Clinton's and that Putin personally ordered an influence campaign  to harm Clinton's electoral chances and ``undermine public faith in the  U.S. democratic process,'' as well as ordering cyber attacks on ``both  major U.S. political parties.''   Page 7 and 8, I don't have time to read the whole thing tonight,  obviously. Dossier claim on page 7 and 8: ``The Russian regime had been  behind the recent leak of embarrassing email messages, emanating from  the Democratic National Committee to the WikiLeaks platform. The reason  for using WikiLeaks was `plausible deniability,' and the operation had  been conducted with the full knowledge and support of Trump and senior  members of his campaign team. In return, the Trump team had agreed to  sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue and to  raise U.S./NATO defense commitments in the Baltics and Eastern Europe  to deflect attention away from Ukraine, a priority for Putin, who  needed to cauterize the subject.''   This is what he wrote. That is on page 7 and 8, what the dossier  claims.   Now here is the truth: In July 2016, the Republican National  Convention made changes to the Republican Party's platform on Ukraine.  Initially, the GOP platform proposed providing ``lethal weapons'' to  Ukraine. That is what it originally stated, that platform. But the line  was watered down to promise ``appropriate assistance.''   NPR reported that Diana Denman, a Republican delegate who supported  arming U.S. allies in Ukraine, has told people that Trump aide J.D.  Gordon said at the Republican Convention in 2016 that Trump directed  him to support weakening that position in the official platform.   J.D. Gordon, who was one of Trump's national security advisers during  the campaign, said he had advocated for changing language because that  reflected what Trump had said. The Trump campaign did not appear to  have intervened in any other platform deliberations, only the language  on Ukraine.   Here is the truth: As the President and throughout the campaign,  Donald Trump has called NATO ``obsolete''--although he changed his mind  today, a little bit--championed the disintegration of the European  Union, and said that he is open to lifting sanctions on Russia or has  declined to enforce them.   Trump has repeatedly questioned whether our allies are paying enough  into NATO, ultimately raising questions as to whether he is  deliberately facilitating Putin's long-term objective of undermining  the Western liberal order.   Dossier page 30: ``Speaking to a trusted compatriot in mid-October  2015, a close associate of Rosneft president and Putin ally Igor  Sechin''--his name appears all over the place in the dossier-- ``elaborated on the reported secret meeting between'' Mr. Sechin and  Carter Page, of United States Republican Presidential candidate's  foreign policy team, in Moscow in July 2016.   The secret meeting ``had been confirmed to him/her by a senior member  of the staff, in addition to by the  [[Page H6170]]  Rosneft president himself. It took place on either 7 or 8 July, the  same day or the one after Carter Page made a public speech to the  Higher Economic School in Moscow.   ``In terms of the substance of the discussion, Sechin's associate  said that the Rosneft president was so keen to lift personal and  corporate Western sanctions imposed on the company that he offered  Page,'' and Mr. Trump's associates as well, ``the brokerage of up to a  19 percent privatized stake in Rosneft in return. Page had expressed  interest and confirmed that were Trump elected U.S. President,''  sanctions on Russia would be lifted.   The truth: On December 29, 2016, during the transition period between  the election and the inauguration, National Security Advisor-designate  Mike Flynn spoke to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, urging him not  to retaliate for newly imposed sanctions. Ultimately, the Russians did  not retaliate.   Days after the inauguration, the Trump administration ordered State  Department staffers to develop proposals for immediately revoking the  economic and other sanctions imposed against Russia. Thankfully, these  staffers alerted Congress, who took steps to codify the sanctions in a  law passed in August 2017. The attempt to overturn the sanctions was  abandoned after Mr. Flynn's conversation was revealed and Mr. Flynn  resigned.   Carter Page has confirmed this meeting with top Moscow and Rosneft  officials, that company or corporation, in the House Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence testimony. It is all laid out.   When Page was asked if a Rosneft executive had offered him a  potential sale of a significant percentage of Rosneft, Page said, ``He  may have briefly mentioned it.''   Dossier claim on page 23: ``Finally, speaking separately to the same  compatriot, a senior Russian,'' Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ``MFA  official reported that, as a prophylactic measure, a leading Russian  diplomat, Mikhail Kalugin, had been withdrawn from Washington at short  notice because Moscow feared his heavy involvement in the U.S.  Presidential election operation, including the so-called veterans'  pensions ruse,'' which we reported previously in the dossier, ``would  be exposed in the media there. His replacement, Andrei Bondarev,  however, was clean in this regard.''    The truth: Mikhail Kalugin was the head of the economics section at  the Russian Embassy. He returned to Russia in August 2016. The BBC  would go on to report that United States officials in 2016 had  identified Kalugin as a spy, that he was under surveillance, thus  verifying this key claim in the dossier. Further reporting by McClatchy  has claimed that the FBI was investigating whether Kalugin played a  role in the election interference.   Mr. Speaker, these are facts. They just scratch the surface of what  we are dealing with. This is what we know. Despite some opponents and  opportunists and attempts, these facts are indisputable.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the link to the entire Trump/ Russia dossier produced by Christopher Steele, so future generations  will know the truth of how we got here today. The link is: https:// www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence- Allegations.html.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I am going to read a little bit more of  the dossier, and I am going to stay away from the scurrilous things  that have been reported in the newspaper, because they, to me, are just  distractions from what we should be looking at.   This is from the dossier: The ``mechanism for transmitting this  intelligence involves `pension' disbursements to Russian emigres  living'' in the United States as cover, using consular offices in New  York, Miami, and D.C.   ``Suggestion from source close to Trump and Manafort that Republican  campaign team happy to have Russia as media bogeyman to mask more  extensive corrupt business ties to China and other emerging countries.   ``Speaking in confidence to a compatriot in late July 2016, Source E,  an ethnic Russian close associate of Republican U.S. Presidential  candidate Donald Trump, admitted that there was a well-developed  conspiracy of cooperation between them and the Russian leadership. This  was managed on the Trump side by the Republican candidate's campaign  manager, Paul Manafort, who was using foreign policy adviser Carter  Page and others as intermediaries. The two sides had a mutual interest  in defeating Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whom  President Putin apparently hated and feared.   ``Inter alia, Source E acknowledged that the Russian regime had been  behind the recent leak of embarrassing email messages emanating from  the Democratic National Committee'' to that WikiLeaks platform.   Attention, attention: ``Source E said he understood that the  Republican candidate and his team were relatively relaxed about this  because it deflected media and the Democrats' attention away from  Trump's business dealings in China and other emerging markets.''   For the Record, Mr. Speaker, I will enter that in the Record at the  proper time, not this evening. We have a whole dossier, again, having  nothing to do with this, of every deal that we know of that the  President and his team made in 52 foreign countries. That will be  entered into the Record.   ``Finally, regarding Trump's claimed minimal investment profile in  Russia, a separate source with direct knowledge said this had not been  for want of trying. Trump's previous efforts had included exploring the  real estate sector in St. Petersburg as well as Moscow, but, in the  end, Trump had had to settle for the use of extensive sexual services  there from local prostitutes rather than business success.''   That is what the dossier says.   ``Trump adviser Carter Page holds secret meetings in Moscow with  Sechin and senior Kremlin Internal Affairs official, Divyekin. Sechin  raises issues of future bilateral U.S.-Russian energy cooperation and  associated lifting of Western sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.  Page noncommittal in response. Divyekin discusses release of Russian  dossier of `kompromat' on Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, but also  hints at Kremlin possession of such material on Trump.''   ``Kremlin concerned that political fallout from DNC email hacking  operation is spiraling out of control. Extreme nervousness among  Trump's associates as result of negative media attention/accusations.   ``Russians meanwhile keen to cool situation and maintain `plausible  deniability' of existing/ongoing pro-Trump and anti-Clinton operations;  therefore, unlikely to be any ratcheting up offensive plays in the  immediate future.   ``Source close to Trump campaign, however, confirms regular exchange  with Kremlin has existed for at least 8 years''--I said 5 years before;  8 years--``including intelligence fed back to Russia on oligarchs'  activities in U.S.''                                time  1900    ``Within this context, Putin's priority requirement had been for  intelligence on the activities, business and otherwise, in the U.S. of  leading Russian oligarchs and their families.'' And his associates duly  had obtained and supplied that information.   ``Speaking in early August 2016, two well-placed and established  Kremlin sources outlined the divisions and backlash in Moscow arising  from the leaking of Democratic National Committee emails and the wider  pro-Trump operation being conducted in the U.S. Head of Presidential  Administration, Sergei Ivanov, was angry at the recent turn of events.  He believed the Kremlin `team' involved, led by presidential spokesman  Dmitriy Peskov, had gone too far in interfering in foreign affairs with  their `elephant in a china shop black PR'. Ivanov claimed always to  have opposed the handling and exploitation of intelligence by this PR  `team'. Following the backlash against such foreign interference in  U.S. politics, Ivanov was advocating that the only sensible course of  action now for the Russian leadership was to `sit tight and deny  everything'.''   And they did.   ``Continuing on this theme, the source close to Ivanov reported that  Peskov now was `scared' ''--I will not  [[Page H6171]]  use the derogatory term--``that he would be scapegoated by Putin and  the Kremlin and held responsible for the backlash. . . . ''   Page after page, Mr. Ivanov appears. He is at the center of this. And  if we know this, then Mr. Mueller knows this. And if we know this, Mr.  Mueller knows more.   So this is the dossier, which has been public now since early last  year. And I wanted to bring this to the floor last year, but we chose  to do it another way, if you remember, in trying to get the President's  taxes made public.   So I will conclude with this, Mr. Speaker--you have been patient.  This is, to me, a big deal: 83 percent of this dossier has been proven  correct. I did not use anything that was dubious of the 17 percent.   So I say to you, the Congress has a right, as an equal branch of  government, to review what has happened so that our President, as Mr.  Shaub, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, said to  President Trump: What you need to do is cut yourself off from your  assets. That is what you need to do. That is what you must do.   And, obviously, he did not do it.   So there is a lot of material out there. Going at this a year and a  half is not a long time. You know how long Watergate took. But I would  think that this is going to take longer than Watergate--that is my  opinion--on some of these things which will have to be traced. Some  people have been indicted. Some people are going to prison already. But  I am telling you, the bulk of information is going to be laid out when  Mr. Mueller is ready, not when I am ready or anybody in the Chamber is  ready.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    That is unacceptable. I did not engage in any  personalities. I read from the record. I didn't call anybody a name. If  I read it, it was somebody else that was writing it, not me.    The President is not above the law, sir. I am not above  the law.    No, I don't have a motion.    Do you want me to make a motion to extend? Is that what  you are asking me to do?    Fine. You have it your way. I will be back.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 4 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, July 13, 2018, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
