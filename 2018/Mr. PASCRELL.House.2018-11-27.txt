 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 140,  the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. Congressman  LoBiondo has served his constituents in New Jersey's 2nd congressional  district well, including the Coast Guard Training Center Cape May in  Cape May, New Jersey. From his position on the House Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, a panel on which we served together for a  decade, he successfully fought on behalf of our state and the brave men  and women in uniform who guard our nation. Congressman LoBiondo has  focused on strengthening our nation's maritime industry, which is a  critical source of jobs and economic output in New Jersey. During his  time in Congress, Congressman LoBiondo fought to improve the lives of  our service men and women and their families. Given his service to  bettering the Coast Guard, it is fitting that this year's authorization  legislation is named after Congressman Frank LoBiondo. I look forward  to this bill's passage and strongly urge all my colleagues to support  S. 140.
