 Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to rise in support of the  brave men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol. I believe our agents  need to know how grateful we are for their service to the United States  of America.   No doubt they have rewarding careers, but these days it has become a  thankless job. Sadly, the media often ignores the role our agents play  in humanitarian efforts along our borders. They save lives and rescue  women and children who are being trafficked and abused.   U.S. Border Patrol agents are some of the most amazing people I have  ever met. Every day they risk their lives during confrontations with  cartels, coyotes, drug runners, and criminal gangs, all to keep you and  me and the sovereignty of our Nation safe.   It is time we stand in support of these fine men and women, encourage  them with prayer, and support them with policies and procedures they  need to keep America safe.   God bless each one of our U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents.                            ____________________
