 Madam President, today I pay tribute to a dear friend and  one of Rhode Island's most thoughtful and visionary civic leaders,  Jonathan ``Jon'' Houston. After 45 years of tireless advocacy, Jon will  be relinquishing his role as executive chairman of Justice Assistance,  the nonprofit organization he founded both to assist victims of crime  and to provide meaningful support for ex-offenders.   I have been privileged to know Jon since our time together as  students at La Salle Academy in Providence, RI. After high school, Jon  went on to graduate from the University of Rhode Island before  completing advanced management certification programs at Harvard and  Salve Regina University. He also served on a number of public safety  boards and commissions in Rhode Island, but his vision in founding  Justice Assistance in 1978 stands as a signature achievement in the  area of criminal justice reform.   It is no small task to radically change the way we treat and look at  victims of crime, nor is it easy to take on the challenges facing  former offenders after they have completed their sentences, but that is  why Jon has become such a respected figure in the community. He has  dedicated his life to a problem that few others were stepping up to  solve. And Justice Assistance has been enormously successful. According  to the Providence Journal, Justice Assistance's sentencing alternative  program--one of the organization's major initiatives--has collected  over $5 million in restitution on behalf of victims of crime, and 90  percent of its court-referred clients successfully complete its ex- offender intervention and support programs. Justice Assistance's  success is a testament to Jon's tenacity and devotion.   Rhode Islanders have been fortunate to have Jon dedicate more than  four decades to strengthening our communities and developing systems of  support for those who may otherwise not have had any. I, too, have  experienced Jon's knowledge, insights, and humility on criminal justice  reform when I worked with him to increase Federal support for  innovative and transformative solutions to recidivism and for victim  protection.   Jon has undoubtedly made a mark on Rhode Island. His work and  advocacy have directly impacted the lives of thousands who have come in  contact with our criminal justice system. Through Justice Assistance,  Jon's work will continue to improve lives of victims and offenders for  years to come, but this won't be the only way his mission carries on  after the mantle is passed. Jon was the primary author of the ``Rights  of Victims of Crime'' amendment in the State constitution, the first  constitutional amendment in the Nation dedicated to protecting the  rights of crime victims. In a very literal sense, Jon's passion and  words have been permanently added to the foundational document of the  state.   I would also like to take the time to recognize Jon's wife Pamela,  his daughter Shannon, and his son Adam. I join many others in the State  in thanking Jon for his service to our communities and the well-being  of those impacted by crime. I wish him fulfillment and continued  success in his next chapter.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to honor William Patrick ``Pat''  [[Page S5671]]  Towell, Ph.D., for his more than 17 years of service to Congress and  the American people as a specialist in U.S. Defense Policy and Budget  at the Congressional Research Service, CRS. Dr. Towell is widely  recognized as a foremost defense policy expert. Senators, Members of  Congress, and staff have all relied on his knowledge, expertise, and  guidance at pivotal points in the development of the annual defense  authorization and appropriations bills. Having served with CRS since  2006, Dr. Towell will retire at the end of this year.   Throughout his tenure at CRS, Dr. Towell has advised congressional  leaders, Department of Defense civilian and military officials, and  foreign dignitaries on a range of defense policy and budgetary matters.  A political scientist by training, he has exhibited a profound respect  for the institution of Congress and an encyclopedic knowledge of the  events and political personalities that have shaped defense issues. In  addition to coordinating and authoring reports on annual defense  authorization and appropriations legislation, Dr. Towell has written  insightfully about key strategic guidance documents such as the  Quadrennial Defense Review and the National Defense Strategy. He has  also provided analyses of the debates over how to best organize the  Federal Government to address national security challenges, and he has  closely monitored funding for post-9/11 military operations in  Afghanistan and Iraq.   Dr. Towell's vast knowledge of the history of congressional  operations has been an important source of institutional memory,  particularly for newer Members and staff seeking to understand the  lessons that can be drawn from past debates. A gifted public speaker  known for his humor, quick wit, and enthusiasm in discussing defense  matters, Dr. Towell has often presented at CRS's new Member seminar, an  orientation for new Members of Congress, in Williamsburg, VA. He has  served as a CRS speaker or panelist for visiting delegations from the  U.S. war colleges, the NATO Defense College, and foreign Parliaments  sponsored by the House Democracy Partnership. Dr. Towell also has  participated in a staff exchange with the European Parliamentary  Research Service--EPRS--in Brussels. For many years, he helped to  organize and present at CRS's annual defense budget seminar for  congressional staff. Drawing on a deep professional network built over  decades of experience in both journalism and policy, Dr. Towell has  mentored colleagues in part by organizing internal discussions with  various defense scholars and practitioners, from leading think tank  experts to senior Defense Department civilian leaders.   Before joining CRS, Dr. Towell was a lecturer in political science at  California State College, Bakersfield from 1972 to 1975, a defense  reporter at Congressional Quarterly from 1975 to 2003, and a fellow at  the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments from 2003 to 2006.  He received a bachelor's degree in liberal arts from Georgetown  University in Washington, DC; a master's degree in political science  from Northwestern University in Evanston, IL; and a Ph.D. in political  science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL.   On behalf of the U.S. Senate and the American people, I express deep  gratitude for the contributions of Dr. Towell during his nearly two  decades at CRS. Along with his family, friends, and colleagues, I thank  him and wish him and his wife K.T. all the best in retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I report  favorably the following nomination  [[Page S5674]]  lists which were printed in the Records on the dates indicated, and ask  unanimous consent, to save the expense of reprinting on the Executive  Calendar that these nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the  information of Senators.
