 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the House  Intelligence Committee for voting to release the classified memo  alleging misconduct by senior FBI officials involved in the Russian  probe. Chairman Nunes has done a great job of steering this through  evenhandedly, with dignity, and with the ultimate goal of fairness in  mind.   I also thank the President for approving the release of the memo, as  well.   The contents of this document are troubling. I previously joined many  of my colleagues in urging the committee to release this memo to the  public, as they have demanded.   This is not an attempt to undermine anything. This document outlines  some very serious misconduct at a very high level at a powerful  government agency, and the American people have the right to know.   Contrary to the narrative created before its release, this memo in no  way jeopardizes our national security but, indeed, shines a light on a  lot of misconduct.   As promised, the committee today approved releasing the Democratic  version of the memo. That is fair. We will let the people compare them.                            ____________________
