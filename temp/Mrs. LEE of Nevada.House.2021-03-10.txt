 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Nevada's  Third District.   With the passage of the American Rescue Plan, we have delivered on  our promise to provide the relief that is so desperately needed 1 year  after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out.   The pandemic has been especially hard on my home State of Nevada. The  primary pillar of our economy, travel and tourism, has been absolutely  devastated. It is not just our casinos and our hotels that have been  hit, but our restaurant and convention workers, our entertainment and  stage workers, and our aviation workers.   With the passage of the American Rescue Plan, we will save lives and  get our economy back on track. We will get vaccines into arms. We will  get our kids safely back into schools with the $130 billion investment  to get schools open and make up for lost time in the classroom. We will  get people back in jobs with the expanded PPP loans, relief for  restaurants and shuttered venues, and more. And, of course, we will get  money into people's pockets immediately through the direct stimulus  checks.   Mr. Speaker, in short, America, help is on its way, and it couldn't  be more urgently needed.                            ____________________
