 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Senate will consider three  important measures this week. Senators will vote on whether to repeal a  Trump-era rule that made it harder for victims of discrimination in the  workplace to pursue justice. It is another example of the sheer malice,  the nastiness of the Trump administration. It actively sought to make  it harder--harder--for workers to win employment discrimination claims.  The Senate should reverse the Trump-era rule this week.   Second, the Senate will also vote on whether to discharge the  nomination of Ms. Kristen Clarke from the Judiciary Committee. Ms.  Clarke would be the first Black woman ever to serve as the Assistant  Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. She is immensely  qualified, and I look forward to putting her nomination on the floor  after the Senate takes action this week.   But first, throughout the week--this is the third thing, very  important as well--the Senate will debate a very important piece of  legislation. This evening, the Senate will vote on whether to take up  the Endless Frontier Act on the Senate floor, a once-in-a-generation  investment in American science and American technology.   Last week, the Senate Commerce Committee voted on an overwhelmingly  bipartisan basis, 24 to 4, to advance the bill. The Endless Frontier  Act will form the core of what will be a comprehensive bill to boost  America's ability to compete, innovate, and win the technologies of the  21st century.   Over the course of the next week or two, the Senate will debate and  amend the legislation. I look forward to having another open and  bipartisan amendment process, just as we did on the Asian hate crimes  bill and the bipartisan water infrastructure bill. There is no reason-- no reason--the Senate can't finish our work on this important  legislation by the end of the month.   Members on both sides of the aisle know that decades of Federal  underinvestment in science and technology have imperiled America's  global economic leadership. When we invest in science, it inevitably  produces millions of good-paying jobs.   So this comprehensive bill will boost funding for basic scientific  research, tech development, and manufacturing. It will strengthen our  alliances and partnerships abroad. It will fortify weak spots in our  economy, like semiconductors, and will ensure that we hold the Chinese  Communist Party accountable for its predatory economic practices. It is  a forward-looking, comprehensive plan to preserve America's competitive  edge.   The benefits will be manifold. When we invest in scientific research,  the effect is diffusive. It helps our universities, our laboratories,  and our businesses. And, again, it creates new, good-paying jobs-- millions of them--millions of them. So if you are looking for the  future and our people want to have a brighter future and want to be  assured that their children will have better paying jobs than they  have, this is an answer--one of the most important answers we can come  up with.   An American workforce will help bring American inventions to the  global market, and the way we have been No. 1 in the economy for the  last century will continue on into this one. So I am excited about this  legislation.   Holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its years of  rapacious economic policies and theft of American ingenuity will help  create a level playing field that American workers have lacked for  decades.  [[Page S2534]]    Investing in scientific research also hardens our national security.  We can either have a world where the Chinese Communist Party determines  the rules of the road for 5G, AI, and quantum computing or we can make  sure the United States gets there first--few things that should bring  this Chamber together faster than securing another century of American  leadership than this.   I am proud to have worked with my colleagues Senator Young,  Chairwoman Cantwell, Ranking Member Wicker, and others to get this bill  to the floor of the Senate. And I greatly look forward to working with  all of my colleagues during these next few weeks on amending,  broadening, and passing this legislation before the month is out.                            ____________________     Madam President, one final matter. Tomorrow, President  Biden will visit an electric manufacturing facility in Michigan, where  a major American auto company is set to unveil its new electric-- electric--pickup truck.   Tomorrow's announcement is a significant breakthrough. Because it is  one of the bestselling cars in America, the success of an electric  pickup could hasten our Nation's transition to a cleaner, brighter, and  stronger transportation future.   And personally, I am very happy to see the Biden administration put a  spotlight on zero-emission vehicles. This is an issue I have been  working on for a very long time, and something I am passionate about.  No matter how you look at the data, there is no way that America can  meet our targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions without looking  at how we drive. Transportation accounts for nearly one-third of  America's carbon outlook. And while the transition to electric vehicles  is already underway, it is progressing too slowly.   That is why almost 2 years ago I developed and introduced an  ambitious new proposal to rapidly phase out gas-powered vehicles and  replace them with clean cars. All told, the object of the plan--called  Clean Cars for America--is that by 2040, all vehicles on the road  should be clean. I am delighted that President Biden has put this  proposal in his build back America infrastructure plan.   Through a mixture of credits and investments, it would make electric  vehicles affordable for all Americans, provide incentives to trade in  older gas vehicles, build the necessary charging infrastructure, and,  very importantly, create tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs in  automaking, construction, and battery manufacturing.   What distinguishes this proposal is its ability to unite the  environmental movement, the labor movement, and the large automakers.   Isn't that a great thing? We used to have the environmental proposals  and work and union proposals conflict--no more because we are taking  each other's needs into account. This bill has already earned the  support of the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the  League of Conservation Voters, the UAW, and the International  Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and car manufacturers like Ford and  General Motors are supportive as well.   So you have the whole span. Something like this should pass with a  lot of votes, I hope. And I was very proud to see President Biden put  my Clean Cars for America proposal at the heart of his American jobs  plan.   In recent weeks, the virtue of such a plan has been made apparent to  millions of drivers and not just for climate-saving reasons. The  gasoline shortages along the eastern seaboard, though temporary,  revealed, once again, that electric vehicles can be more reliable. For  EVs, the price and availability of fuel does not depend on the ebb and  flow of fossil fuel discovery, the volatility of international markets,  or panics, like the one we just saw.   On every front--on jobs, American economic leadership, protecting the  planet--transitioning to a clean car future provides benefits. In the  20th century, America led the way in auto manufacturing. If we fall  behind on electric cars, we will no longer lead the way. But this  legislation has us staying No. 1 and producing lots of good-paying  jobs--hallelujah.   So as the President prepares to go to Michigan for this important  announcement, we should also be talking about making a larger scale,  ambitious effort to speed our country's transition to zero-emission  vehicles. Clean Cars for America is the way to do it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
