 Madam Speaker, one of the advantages we have seen from  having a typed speech is you don't forget things like I often do that  are important points, but one of the weaknesses is you can't respond to  the myriad of points that somebody just made explaining why we need  massive reform to the FISA bill and the information that has come out.   Now, I got here 15 years ago, and I was part of the reauthorization  back in those days. We got lied to by the Justice Department about how  this would be used. They came back in the private meetings: Oh, we  don't go after Americans.   We have seen from the information that has come out in recent weeks  that they do exactly what they told us by behind closed doors they  never did.   This thing needs to be massively reformed.   What happened in the last 24 hours? Something called a Rules  Committee, and it wouldn't allow our reforms. It wouldn't allow this  body to vote on important reforms.   Go reread the Fourth Amendment. We are not supposed to authorize  searches and seizures against Americans without the proper due process,  without a probable cause, and without particularly describing the  places to be searched and what to be seized. And the FISA court has  violated that.   Oh, some say, we just add an amicus in there and that will take care  of it.   The FISA judges did not even have the honor of their courts after  finding out they were lied to repeatedly and fraud was committed  against them to do something about it. That tells you we need massive  reform.   A vote to go to conference is a total abdication of this body's job  to put out a good bill that does reform.   Madam Speaker, I ask everybody, vote ``no'' to go to conference so  that we can force this House to do its job.
