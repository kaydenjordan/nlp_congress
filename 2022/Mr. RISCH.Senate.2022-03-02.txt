 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Valor K9 Academy as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for March 2022.   Headquartered in Horseshoe Bend, Valor K9 Academy has established  [[Page S949]]  itself as one of the premier dog training companies in the Nation.  Following their combined 20 years of Active-Duty service in the U.S.  Air Force, veteran owners Amy and Justin Pishner realized their  lifelong dream of training dogs and opened Valor K9 Academy.   Thanks to Amy and Justin's passion for training dogs and dedication  to providing individualized service for each client, Valor K9 Academy  has gained national recognition since its founding in 2014. What  started as a two-person company has grown sixfold, with locations in  Idaho, Washington, and Tennessee. The success of Valor K9 Academy has  also allowed Amy and Justin to open a second business, Valor Protection  Dogs, which they operate out of Horseshoe Bend.   In addition to developing lifelong relationships with its canine  clients, Valor K9 Academy has immersed itself in the community. The  business routinely donates proceeds to support local rescues and Idaho  veterans in need. Thanks to its efforts, Valor K9 Academy is a beacon  of entrepreneurial and philanthropic spirit for all of Idaho to behold.   Congratulations to Amy, Justin, and all of the employees at Valor K9  Academy for being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for  March 2022. Thank you for your service to our Nation, and thank you for  serving Idaho as small business owners and entrepreneurs. You make our  great State proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
