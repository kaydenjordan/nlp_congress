 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on House Administration and the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure be discharged from further consideration of the bill  (H.R. 4009) to authorize the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian  Institution to plan, design, and construct a central parking facility  on National Zoological Park property in the District of Columbia, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4009, which  authorizes the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to plan,  design, and construct a central parking facility on National Zoological  Park property in the District of Columbia using non-appropriated funds.   Established by Congress in 1889, the National Zoo was incorporated as  a unit of the Smithsonian Institution in 1890. Today, the National Zoo  consists of two components: the 3,200-acre Conservation Biology  Institute in Front Royal, Virginia and the public National Zoological  Park (Zoo) located at the 163-acre Rock Creek campus in Washington,  D.C. Admission is free of charge and with more than two million people  visiting the Rock Creek facility in 2017, the Zoo remains a favorite  tourist and local destination in the nation's Capital.   While public transit is an option for some visitors, many others rely  on private vehicles to reach the Zoo. Currently, parking at the Zoo  includes several paved surface lots spread across the campus, which  often fill up early in the day during peak season. To better serve  these visitors, the proposed new parking facility consolidates public  parking into a multi-level parking garage located at the midpoint of  the Zoo.   Included in the Zoo's 2008 Comprehensive Facilities Master Plan, the  parking facility will provide a number of benefits that both further  the Zoo's mission and improve the visitor experience. These benefits  include expanding animal habitat space through repurposing existing  surface lots; improving visitor access with a centralized and  accessible arrival point; increasing security through consolidation of  access points; improved pedestrian safety; and expanding the number of  on-site visitor parking spaces which reduces the number of days the Zoo  must turn away visitors due to lack of parking. The additional parking  spaces will help accommodate a projected increase in the number of  visitors to the Zoo.   No appropriated funds will be expended for the project. The  Smithsonian intends to enter into a public-private-partnership for the  construction and operation of the parking facility. The developer would  be responsible for design, construction, maintenance, and operations  for a fixed term of 35 years after which ownership is retained by the  Zoo. Financing is the sole responsibility of the developer, with  construction cost estimated at $70-75 million and annual operating  costs at $1.5 million. As part of the agreement, the Zoo receives an  initial annual payment of $7 million and a recurring annual payment  based on revenues with a guaranteed minimum of $1 million. Design,  construction, operations and maintenance will be conducted in  accordance with the contract and plans approved by the Smithsonian.   The Committee on House Administration held a markup on this bill on  December 13, 2017 and ordered the bill reported favorably to the House,  by voice vote, with no amendments. In its December 21, 2017 cost  estimate, the Congressional Budget Office states that enacting H.R.  4009 would not affect the federal budget and would not affect direct  spending or revenues. Additionally, the Committee on House  Administration exchanged jurisdiction letters with the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4009.                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                  Washington, DC, December 21, 2017.      Hon. Gregg Harper,      Chairman, Committee on House Administration,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4009, the       Smithsonian National Zoological Park Central Parking Facility       Authorization Act.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Meredith       Decker.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.        Enclosure.      H.R. 4009--Smithsonian National Zoological Park Central Parking                         Facility Authorization Act   As ordered reported by the House Committee on House Administration on                             December 13, 2017         H.R. 4009 would authorize the Smithsonian Institution to       plan, design, and construct a central parking facility on the       National Zoological Park's property in the District of       Columbia. Construction would be financed with nonappropriated       funds.        CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4009 would not affect       the federal budget. Because enacting the legislation would       not affect direct spending or revenues, pay-as-you-go       procedures do not apply.        CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4009 would not increase       net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.        H.R. 4009 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.        The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Meredith Decker.       The estimate was approved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy       Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on House Administration,                                    Washington, DC, April 24, 2018.-      Hon. Bill Shuster,-      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: I am writing in regard to H.R. 4009,       Smithsonian National Zoological Park Central Parking Facility       Authorization Act. As you know, the bill was introduced on       October 11, 2017, and referred to the Committee on House       Administration, with an additional referral to the Committee       on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill authorizes the       Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to plan,       design, and construct a central parking facility on National       Zoological Park property in the District of Columbia using       non-appropriated funds. On December 13, 2017 the Committee on       House Administration reported H.R. 4009 favorably out of       Committee by voice vote without amendment.        The Committee on House Administration recognizes that the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has an       additional referral of H.R. 4009. We ask that the Committee       on Transportation and Infrastructure be discharged from       consideration of H.R. 4009 to expedite the bill. It is the       understanding of the Committee on House Administration that       forgoing action on H.R. 4009 will not prejudice the Committee       on Transportation and Infrastructure with respect to any       future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters       contained in the bill that fall under your Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction.            Sincerely,                                                      Gregg Harper,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                    Washington, DC, April 24, 2018.      Hon. Gregg Harper,      Chairman, Committee on House Administration, Washington, DC.

In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 4009, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to       forgo action on this bill. However, as you noted, this is       conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing       consideration of the bill would not prejudice the Committee       with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the bill or similar legislation that fall within the       Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. Should a conference on the       bill be necessary, I appreciate your agreement to support my       request to have the Committee represented on the conference       committee.        Thank you for your cooperation on this matter and for       agreeing to place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the       Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on       the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,                                                          Chairman.
