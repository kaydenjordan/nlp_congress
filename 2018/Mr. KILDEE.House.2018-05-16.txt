 Mr. Speaker, Americans depend on good roads and bridges  to get to work every day and to take care of their families. Good  infrastructure drives our economy.   Americans depend on water systems to provide clean and safe drinkable  water. But in this country, we have failed to make the necessary  investments in water infrastructure, in roads and bridges, in essential  infrastructure that is important to drive our economy.   I will work with anyone on any side of the question on both sides of  the aisle to make sure that we invest in America's infrastructure. It  is what we need to do to grow our economy, but, unfortunately, what the  President has suggested really puts the burden on State and local  governments, communities like the ones I represent. My own hometown of  Flint, for example, if they had the money to put into their water  system to prevent the disaster that occurred, they long ago would have  done this. We need--our communities need a strong Federal partner.   And the Democrats, we offer A Better Deal. We have a plan to rebuild  America's infrastructure. This is what the Congress ought to be doing.  We ought not wait for the President to offer his suggestion. We should  do the work ourselves. It is long overdue.                            ____________________
