This is the  seventh time that we will be in a position to at least meet someone who  is aspiring to that position. I have had opportunities with each one of  them to ask some questions before the formal hearing. I hope I have the  same opportunity with the current nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett.   What is different about this particular moment is the fact that we  know that there is an issue at stake here and one that is likely to be  decided almost immediately by the new Supreme Court Justice. It is the  only explanation I can find--perhaps one other--the only two  explanations I can find as to why there is this hurry to fill this  vacancy.   You see, it was 4 years ago, when there was a vacancy on the Supreme  Court with Antonin Scalia's death--and that occurred on the February  before the election--that Senator McConnell, then the Republican Senate  leader, argued there was no need to hurry. Why hurry about it? Leave  the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Wait until after the next  Presidential election. Let the American people decide who will be  filling that vacancy.   He made that argument, despite the clear history in this Chamber that  did not support him, and he won the support of his position by every  Republican Senator. They went so far as to say that if President Obama,  in his last year in office, nominated someone to fill the Supreme Court  vacancy, they wouldn't give that person a hearing.   Well, President Obama, in his last year of his Presidency, nominated  Merrick Garland, a person who was widely respected as the chief judge  in the DC Circuit Court--the second highest court in the land by some  measure--and Merrick Garland came to Capitol Hill in the hopes that he  would get his day in court, so to speak, in the Senate. But Senator  McConnell said: No way. Words out, Republican Senators, don't meet with  him. A couple of them broke his rule and met with him anyway. But the  word was out not to even give him the courtesy of a meeting 4 years  ago. So Merrick Garland never had his day before the Senate Judiciary  Committee, and his nomination departed with the Presidency of Barack  Obama.   Senator McConnell's new theory prevailed on how the Senate should  treat Supreme Court vacancies. Every one of his soldiers on the  Republican Senate marched in lock step with his theory. Well, guess  what happened 4 years ago later. An incumbent President had a late  vacancy on the Supreme Court with the untimely death of Ruth Bader  Ginsburg, just a little over a week-and-a-half ago. And the obvious  question to Senator McConnell is: Will you be consistent now and say  that that vacancy should not be filled until a new President is  elected, and that President should have the option to fill it? And  Senator McConnell said: Of course not. It is not to my political  advantage--he didn't add those words; I did--not to my political  advantage. I am going to change this hard-and-fast rule of 4 years ago,  and I am going to ask all of my Republican Senators to march before a  camera and a microphone and to look down at their shoes and say the  position they took 4 years ago, they are abandoning today. And all but  two of them did it. All but two of them walked away from their pledge  that they were under the old McConnell rule.   That McConnell rule was stated in just a few words. Here is what  Senator McConnell said 4 years ago:         The American people should have a voice in the selection of       their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy       should not be filled until we have a new President.    The McConnell rule was thrown out just a few days ago. Why? Because  it was to Senator McConnell's advantage to fill this vacancy and to the  President's and not to wait for the outcome of the November 3 election.  So what is the issue? What would cause Senator McConnell to change so  quickly and  [[Page S5892]]  to ask all of his loyal Republican Senators to go through the  embarrassment of recanting the position they took publicly 4 years ago?  What is the big deal, Senator McConnell? Well, it turns out we know  what the big deal is. It is the Affordable Care Act. To paraphrase a  Senator from Arkansas, Dale Bumpers, the Republicans and President  Trump hate the Affordable Care Act like the devil hates holy water.  They have tried every imaginable way to eliminate it, to change it, to  water it down, and to discourage it. There were 50 different votes in  the House of Representatives to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, and  were it not for the Democrats in the Senate, they might have had some  luck in doing that, but it didn't work. So they tried it on the Senate  floor under reconciliation. They thought: Here is our chance. We just  need a majority. We should be able to pull this one off.   And we had this historic moment just 3 years ago when, at 2:30 in the  morning, John McCain came through those doors, and, with his ``no''  vote and the vote of two other Republican Senators, saved the  Affordable Care Act. Imagine the frustration of Mitch McConnell. Here  was his moment to finally drive that dagger deep in the heart of the  Affordable Care Act, and John McCain voted no. What was he going to do  to get this job done?   Well, it turns out he figured he would get it done across the street  in the U.S. Supreme Court. So 18 Republican State attorneys general  filed a lawsuit to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. And then the  Trump administration said: We are on board too. Let's get rid of it  completely.   Off they went through the long treacherous journey in the courts all  the way up to the Supreme Court across the street. Guess when the  argument is scheduled to be heard. It is to be heard 7 days after the  election. So you wonder why there is such a hurry to put another  Supreme Court Justice on the Court who also opposes the Affordable Care  Act? And make no mistake, President Trump made that one of the  conditions of employment for anyone he would name to the Supreme Court.  You have to be ready to march right in there and put an end to it.   So if we can vote under Senator McConnell's timetable on or before  the election, November 3, the new Supreme Court Justice sworn in, in  her black robe, ascends to the bench in the Supreme Court on November  10, listens to the oral argument on the Affordable Care Act, and then a  few weeks or months later puts an end to it. That is why we are in such  a hurry, because if that Supreme Court vacancy is not filled by  November 10, then whomever is chosen, as they do by tradition, could  vote on the actual outcome of the case in the spring. That is what this  is all about.    As someone told me long ago in this business of politics, there is  always a good reason, and then there is always the real reason. The  real reason for the mad dash of the Senate Judiciary Committee to fill  the Supreme Court vacancy, the real reason why Republican Senators are  asked to march in lockstep and say that what they pledged 4 years ago  meant nothing today--the real reason--is to put an end to the  Affordable Care Act.   Let me tell the story, if I can, about the Affordable Care Act. I  voted for it and am proud to have done it. Twenty million Americans  have insurance because of it--600,000 in Illinois and, I might add,  protections for people all across America. Let me discuss one of the  protections of the Affordable Care Act that will go away and be  eliminated if President Trump, the Republican Attorney General, and the  Republican Senators who are supporting Mitch McConnell have their way.  Here is one of the provisions in the law.   Here is the story.   A couple of years ago, Tom from Palatine, IL, a suburb of Chicago,  wrote to me about the Affordable Care Act. I will show a picture here.  This is him. At the age of 30, Tom, married with dreams of fatherhood,  was diagnosed with cancer, a tumor in his chest. He underwent 20 rounds  of chemo and major surgery to remove the tumor. Thankfully, after that,  he was cancer free.   There is Tom in his better days, racing to Wrigley. And there he is  fighting his way through cancer in a hospital bed.   How much did it cost him for all of that care? Two million dollars.  Two million dollars was the bill.   Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies imposed arbitrary  annual and lifetime limits on how much they would actually reimburse a  patient for medical bills. If you pass the limit, you are on the hook  personally. That is why for years, medical debt was a leading cause of  bankruptcy in America.   A fellow like Tom, racing along here, looking as healthy and fit as  possible, ends up with a cancer diagnosis and goes through months and  months of therapy and a bill of 2 million bucks, and the insurance  company says: It is all yours. There is a limit in your policy.   That is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. The  Affordable Care Act put an end to those limits. Without those  protections, Tom wrote to me and said that he ``would most likely have  capped [his] coverage and be bankrupt.'' It is pretty clear.   Thousands of other Americans could also be right there with him  without the Affordable Care Act. Although Tom wants to continue working  and contributing to society, he said he is scared to death. He is  ``terrified''--in his words--that protections for preexisting  conditions would be ended. You see, Tom having defeated surgery and  declared this great victory--I am sure his friends and family couldn't  be happier--is now branded by the insurance companies as a man with a  preexisting condition.   In the old days, before the Affordable Care Act: Good luck, Tom. Good  luck, because if you had a preexisting condition--and almost anything  would count: acne, asthma, being a woman who might get pregnant, and on  and on and on--you were subjected to higher premiums, maybe even no  insurance at all. Those were the days before the Affordable Care Act.   Now, President Trump, the Republican attorneys general, and the  Republicans in the Senate are dutybound to send a new Supreme Court  Justice in to put an end to that protection, to put an end to the  Affordable Care Act. They are so determined to get rid of ObamaCare at  any cost that they could care less about Tom and people just like him  with these lifetime limits.   If the Affordable Care Act is struck down, insurers could once again  deny coverage to millions of Americans with preexisting conditions.  That isn't all.   The Affordable Care Act also made it clear that if you are a family  with a son or daughter who goes to college, comes out of school looking  for a job, maybe had taken that gap year, maybe had taken an  internship, but likely not to have health insurance, the Affordable  Care Act says don't worry. Until that young man or young woman in your  household reaches the age of 26, they can stay on your family's health  insurance plan--a provision of the Affordable Care Act and a provision  that a lot of families count on.   Our family needed something just like that when our daughter  graduated college and didn't have health insurance and assured me that  she sure didn't need it and she was so healthy. Well, that is scary  talk for a parent to hear. But when it came to the Affordable Care Act,  we would have been able to keep our young daughter under that policy-- our family policy--for a period of time. The Republicans want that to  go away--to go away with the Affordable Care Act.   You say to yourself: Well, clearly, Durbin, you are not telling the  whole story. You are not telling us what the Republican plan is to  replace the Affordable Care Act.   It is true--guilty as charged. I am not describing to you the  Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act because it doesn't  exist. It does not exist. That is why John McCain and two other  Republican Senators said: You can't eliminate the Affordable Care Act  unless you have a replacement that is as good or better. Otherwise, too  many American families will lose their insurance and lose their  protection.   We had a hearing a few weeks ago, and I asked the leaders in the  health community under the Trump administration the basic question:  What have you heard about the Republican substitute for the Affordable  Care Act? President Trump has told us over and over and over and over  again that it is  [[Page S5893]]  just a week or two away. So what have you heard about preparedness?    They said: Nothing. We have heard nothing.   There is no Republican substitute for the Affordable Care Act. They  are just dutybound to eliminate ObamaCare, and, sadly, the consequences  would be awful.   That is what this is about. So if you think, I don't want to tune in  to this whole debate about a new Supreme Court Justice from Indiana; I  don't want to hear all these arguments because what difference does it  make to me--if you are that person in America--I would say to you,  please, take a look at what we are really facing here--an effort to  fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court in a timely way to eliminate the  Affordable Care Act. That is what this is all about.   Then, the President, just for good measure, tossed in another issue  last week. How about this one--the first President in the history of  the United States to not publicly declare that he would accept the  outcome of an election? How about that? It is nothing short of a  constitutional outrage that any President would say that. It is no  surprise with this President because, when he was a candidate, he said  basically the same thing: If it doesn't turn out that I win, then, I am  not sure I want to live by the results.   He makes up these contrived arguments against paper ballots and how  fraudulent they are. There are five States--five States in America-- that use mail-in ballots exclusively. They include, of course, the  State of Oregon, which might have been one of the first, and they  include the State of Utah, as well, and Hawaii. Other States do it. How  much fraud is there? Almost none. But that doesn't stop the President  from claiming that mail-in ballots are fraudulent.   How does the President vote, incidentally? By mail-in ballot. What  hypocrisy for him to make that kind of statement when he is casting his  own vote with a mail-in ballot.   So now he said that he wants that Supreme Court vacancy filled: Do it  now because I need nine Justices sitting on that Supreme Court if there  is any election contest to follow.   It is pretty obvious what this is all about. The President needs a  sure vote on the Supreme Court.   What a shame that we have reached this point, that we have denigrated  the U.S. Senate to the point that we change the rules at our  convenience, that we have reached the point where we are prepared to  eliminate protections for 20 million Americans with nothing to replace  it, and that we have reached a point where a President is so brazen as  to say he wants to fill that spot on the Supreme Court just in case he  runs into an election contest.   You would think there would be a chorus--a bipartisan chorus--of  outrage for that statement by the President. Not so. There may have  been others--and I will scour the records to make sure--but two  Republicans stepped up and said that the President's public statement  on not abiding by election returns was terrible.   Who were those two? Senator Mitt Romney, here, the only Republican  Senator I know of. If there were more, I will come back and correct the  record. But I heard him clearly say that what the President said was  intolerable. Then there was the Republican Governor of Massachusetts. I  watched that press conference. He wasn't just declarative. He was upset  to think that any President of either party would make that kind of  statement. That is what we are up against.   Two weeks from yesterday, they want to hold a hearing in the Senate  Judiciary Committee on this nominee, Judge Barrett, and they want the  vote before the election, before the argument on the Affordable Care  Act, and before the President faces any possibility of an election  contest.   What a point we have reached in this country. The silence of  Republicans across the Nation is deafening. They ignore the obvious.   You cannot have a viable, trustworthy democracy if you don't have  viable, trustworthy elections, and in order to have that happen, you  need Presidents of both political parties who are committed to  fairness, committed to honesty, and committed to our Constitution.   Sadly, at this moment in time, we do not have a President who is, and  there are too many of his own political party who stand back in the  shadows in silence, recanting on pledges they made 4 years ago, doing  whatever is necessary to win the favor of this President.   I hope another day will come soon with different leadership and a  different view of this country. I am genuinely concerned about what we  face on November 3 and the days that follow, but I have never given up  on America, and I never will. I believe this democracy will prevail,  and I hope that after he is gone, some Republicans will step forward  and say: It is time to create a party not in his image.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4757         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

We have worked on things together. We, occasionally, don't see  eye-to-eye on issues. I certainly don't see eye-to-eye with him on what  he just said on the floor of the Senate. It would be credible if, 4  years ago, exactly the opposite result had not been produced by the  Republican majority. Remember, 4 years ago, Antonin Scalia's untimely  death on a hunting trip, and there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court,  in February, if I remember correctly? There was the question as to  whether the incumbent President, duly elected, of the United States of  America, Barack Obama, would be able to fill the Supreme Court vacancy?   But, no, the Republicans insisted that was unacceptable--unacceptable  for this lame duck President with only a year left in his term to fill  the vacancy on the Supreme Court. No, they had a more constitutional  idea. Their constitutional idea was to delay filling the vacancy on the  Supreme Court until the American people spoke in an election in  November of the same year.   So when President Obama sent his nominee, Merrick Garland, eminently  qualified, to be considered by the Senate, Senator McConnell instructed  his membership: We are not only going to refuse him a hearing; I am  going to refuse him even a meeting in my office. I will not dignify-- will not dignify--the nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme  Court vacancy, because--Senator McConnell told us in his golden rule-- the American people have to speak in the election about the next  President, who will then fill the vacancy.   That was the hard and fast rule that every Republican Senator swore  allegiance to on the floor of the Senate, before the microphones and  cameras, and said: That is the way it is going to be. It may be rude.  It may be crude to even ignore this man who is eminently qualified to  be the nominee of President Barack Obama, but that is the way it is  going to be, because we are so committed to the Constitution that we  will not fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court until after the  election.   And then came the epiphany--a vacancy on the Supreme Court with a  Republican President, Donald Trump, occurring in the last year of his  Presidency in his first term--maybe his only term--and the decision  then by Senator McConnell in the name of the Constitution to completely  reverse himself and to say: We will not fill the vacancy in the way we  did 4 years ago. We will fill it the way we want to fill it now, and  the way we want to fill it now is immediately, on a quicker timetable  than virtually any person who has been appointed to the Supreme Court  for a lifetime appointment, the highest Court in the land.   There was a time, as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that  after hearing the nominee's name you waited for the reports. Many of  them would come to you, talking about the biography of the nominee, the  background of the nominee, the writings, the speeches, the articles,  and, if they were judges, their judicial opinions. We would carefully  study those and be prepared when it came time for a hearing.   Not in this situation, no way--Senator McConnell wants this done and  done now. He clearly has doubts in his own mind as to whether this  President can be reelected, and he is not going to waste his time. He  is going to make sure the Senate Judiciary Committee acts before the  election on November 3. The hard and fast principle of 4 years ago has  disappeared with President Trump.   I have watched Republican Senator after Republican Senator, with only  two exceptions, march before the camera and look at their shoes and  say: I changed my mind. We are going to fill this vacancy now. Because  of the Constitution? No, because politically it helps us.   Why the hurry? Why before November 3? Why wouldn't they at least wait  until the end of November?   No, the hurry is obvious, because on November 10, the U.S. Supreme  Court will have oral arguments on whether or not the Affordable Care  Act will be eliminated. You see, Republican attorneys general, as well  as this administration, have decided they want to do away with it. They  want it to go away.   When they are asked very simple questions: How will people be  affected? They shrug their shoulders.   Well, I will tell you how. Twenty million Americans will lose their  health insurance if the Supreme Court abolishes the Affordable Care  Act, and nearly every American will lose the protections it gives for  people with preexisting conditions. The President said--and he said  again last night, in what some characterized as a debate,  [[Page S5904]]  and what I characterize as a free-for-all--the President said: Well, we  have a substitute plan.   Really, Mr. President? Where would that be? I haven't seen it--not on  the floor of the Senate, not in the newspapers, not in the press  releases.   There is no substitute plan. That is why 3 years ago Senator McCain  came to the floor and said he would not join the Republicans in killing  the Affordable Care Act, because there was no substitute. It would  leave too many Americans without the protection of health insurance.    Well, that is going to be argued in the Supreme Court on November 10,  and by tradition, a Supreme Court Justice cannot vote come next spring  on the fate of this lawsuit if they didn't sit in on the oral argument.  So there is a mad dash--a mad dash--by the Senate Judiciary Committee  to bring up the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett from Notre Dame  University Law School. They want it done before November 3 so she can  sit in on the decision--or at least on the oral argument and then the  decision--in this case, California v. Texas.   That is what it is all about. It is all about 600,000 people in the  State of Illinois--600,000--who rely on the Affordable Care Act to get  their health insurance. It is all about a law that eliminated the  number of uninsured in my State by 50 percent. It is all about a  protection that we all take for granted that says insurance companies  cannot discriminate against us because of preexisting conditions. That  is what it is all about.   Over 50 votes on the floor of the House of Representatives by the  Republican majority to end this Affordable Care Act couldn't get the  job done. A last minute scramble on the floor of the U.S. Senate in  2017 couldn't get the job done. Senator McConnell is going to get it  done. He is going to get it done by pushing through a nominee before  November 10 who can vote to eliminate this Affordable Care Act.   How do I know that this Supreme Court nominee is going to eliminate  the Affordable Care Act? Because she wrote it down. She wrote down her  opinion as to whether or not this was constitutional. She has already  let us know, and she obviously let President Trump know, and that is  why he named her.   And there is one other reason. You see, this President, for the first  time in the history of the United States of America, will not pledge if  he will accept the results of this election on November 3. It is the  first time it has ever, ever happened in our history, and it is a  constitutional outrage.   I commend the Presiding Officer, the only Republican Senator on the  floor who has spoken out against it, that I know of. Others should have  joined him. The Governor of Massachusetts, a Republican, joined him,  saying it is the wrong thing to say, the wrong thing to do, and both  parties should condemn it when either a Presidential candidate or an  incoming President says it.   But this President is pretty obvious. He wants to fill that Supreme  Court vacancy because he says: There may be an election contest after  November 3; I want 9 people on the Court.   What he didn't say, which is obvious, is that he wants that ninth  person to be his nominee. So that is what we face with this situation  and what we have ahead of us in the next week and a half.                             Presidential Debate    Mr. President, I watched what was supposedly called a debate last  night. It was painful. It was painful as this President showed so  little respect when it came to the rules of the debate.   Chris Wallace, the FOX Television newsman who moderated was beside  himself. He didn't know how to get the President to stop interrupting,  to follow the rules of the debate. This President doesn't follow  anybody's rules but his own. That was very obvious last night.   There was one moment, though, that I want to highlight. It was a  moment when Chris Wallace basically said: Will both of you, the  Democrat, Biden, and the Republican, President Trump--both of you-- condemn violence, White nationalism, and White supremacists? Well,  Biden did. Biden said: There is no place for violence in the name of  political protests--none. Unequivocal.   Then came the turn of the President, who, if you remember, had  difficulty parsing out the good guys and bad guys in Charlottesville-- those who went down to Charlottesville to march for civil rights and  those who went down to march, frankly, chanting what was used during  the time of the German rise of Nazism, their anti-Semitic chant. They  grabbed their torches and marched. When asked later, President Trump  struggled with it and said that there were good folks on both sides,  the White nationalist side, as well as those for civil rights. That was  an outrage. Last night, Chris Wallace served up an opportunity for the  President to clear it up.   I came to the floor today to speak about the President's response, to  speak also about the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing  our Nation today: the threat of violent White supremacists. Like most  Americans, I was stunned by the President's refusal last night to  condemn White supremacists during the course of last night's  Presidential debate.   Moderator Chris Wallace gave President Trump an uninterrupted  opportunity to condemn the Nation's biggest domestic terrorist group,  White supremacists. Instead, Trump said, and I quote: They should  ``stand back and stand by.'' ``Stand back and stand by.''   Trump's comments were quickly embraced by the Proud Boys, an alt- right self-described, ``western chauvinist'' group that clearly heard  it as a call to action. The group immediately turned the President's  words in the debate into a logo that has been widely circulated on  social media.   From the rightwing social media site--which I am not going to name  because I don't want to give any publicity to it, but I will put it in  the Record--Proud Boys leader Joe Biggs said he took Trump's words as a  directive to ``[F] . . . them up.''   For years now, in letters, briefings, and hearings, I have repeatedly  urged the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  and the Department of Homeland Security to take a strong stand against  the ongoing threat of violent White supremacy and other far rightwing  extremists. Unfortunately, instead of following up with a  comprehensive, coordinated effort--to no surprise--the Trump  administration has repeatedly chosen to downplay this deadly threat--a  law-and-order President who looks the other way, winks, nods, and says  ``stand by'' to militia groups and White supremacists.   Last year, several of us wrote to Attorney General Barr and FBI  Director Wray to inquire about the Trump administration's inexplicable,  irresponsible decision to stop tracking White supremacist incidents as  a separate category of domestic terrorism. The Trump administration has  yet to respond to our many letters asking what the Department of  Justice and the FBI are doing to combat the ongoing threat of White  supremacist violence targeting religious minorities and communities of  color.   Since then, our concern has obviously grown. Instead of focusing on  the significant threat of domestic terrorism motivated by White  supremacy and far-rightwing extremism, terrorists have killed more than  100 Americans since 9/11. President Trump claims, as he did last night,  that violence is a ``left-wing problem, not a right-wing problem.''   Let me tell you, we should condemn violence on both wings and  everything in between. I join Vice President Biden in condemning all  violence, including the alleged murder of a Federal Protective Service  officer in Oakland, CA, by a rightwing ``Boogaloo'' extremist, and the  alleged murder of two Black Lives Matter protesters in Kenosha, WI, by  an Illinois teenager who reportedly considered himself to be a member  of a militia--17 years old.   Unfortunately, as we have learned from former Trump administration  officials, the Trump administration has downplayed the threat of  violent White supremacy and other far rightwing domestic terrorists.   POLITICO recently reported that a draft homeland threat assessment  report from DHS was edited and changed by the Trump administration to  weaken language discussing the particular threat posed by violent White  supremacists. The Trump boys don't want to talk about it.   Shortly thereafter, a DHS whistleblower alleged that DHS officials,  including Ken Cuccinelli, requested the modification of the homeland  threat  [[Page S5905]]  assessment report to make the threat of White supremacists ``appear  less severe'' and add information on violent ``leftwing groups.''   The efforts of officials within the Trump administration to obscure  this threat posed by violent White supremacists and other far-rightwing  extremists are misguided and dangerous. We know the significance of  this threat.   An unclassified May 2017 FBI-DHS joint intelligence bulletin found  that ``White supremacist extremism poses a persistent threat of lethal  violence'' and that White supremacists were responsible for more  homicides from 2000 to 2016 than any other domestic extremist group.  FBI Director Wray admitted, when questioned before a Senate Judiciary  Committee at a hearing last year, that the majority of domestic  terrorism threats in America involve White supremacists.   Thankfully, there is something in the Senate we can do to respond to  this threat. I have introduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, a  bill that would enhance the Federal Government's efforts to prevent  domestic terrorism by requiring Federal law enforcement agencies to  regularly assess domestic terrorism threats, focus their limited  resources on the most significant domestic terrorism threat, and  provide training and resources to assist State, local, and Tribal law  enforcement.   Good news: Last week, the House of Representatives passed the House  companion to my bill on a unanimous voice vote. The Democrats and  Republicans all agreed. Senator McConnell has a chance take it up. Are  we going to stand together, as the House did, on a bipartisan basis,  condemning White supremacists who resort to violence and terrorism or  are we going to say to them: Stand back and stand by?   It is time for us to step up together on a bipartisan basis. Condemn  violent conduct on both political spectrums--on the right, on the left,  and everything in between. You can use our Constitution responsibly.  You don't have to resort to violence. You don't have to resort to  vandalism or looting, the use of guns and threats, or the killing of  innocent people. It is never ever acceptable, right or left.   The dominant group, when it comes to this activity, is White  supremacists. Our opportunity now to keep track of them and their  activities is before us. All it takes is for Senator McConnell to agree  to take up this unanimously passed bill from the House of  Representatives and to say to President Trump, once and for all, join  us in condemning all violence across the political spectrum.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Montana  (Mr. Tester) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Montana  (Mr. Tester) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Montana  (Mr. Tester) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, on July 17, America lost two giants of  justice: Congressman John Lewis and the Reverend C.T. Vivian. Sixty  years ago, John Lewis was the youngest member of Dr. Martin Luther  King's inner circle, and C.T. Vivian was Dr. King's field marshal,  organizing support for the civil rights movement throughout America. In  1966, when Martin Luther King moved to Chicago to help break the grip  of slumlords on mostly poor communities of color, C.T. Vivian came with  him.   Earlier this month, we lost another civil rights legend, a man who  remained in Chicago after Dr. King and Rev. Vivian left and who  continued the fight for the next 60 years for racial, social, and  economic justice for people and communities of color in Chicago.   The Rev. Leon Finney, Jr., was laid to rest this past weekend  following his home going service at the church he pastored for the last  20 years, the Metropolitan Apostolic Church in Bronzeville. Among those  paying tribute to Rev. Finney at his home going were Chicago Mayor Lori  Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. They are  among more than two generations of Chicago leaders whose careers in  public service Rev. Finney helped to nurture. Another public servant  whose work as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago was  was inspired in part by Rev. Finney couldn't attend the service but  paid his respects in a letter read by Rev. Finney's granddaughter.   ``Doc was always there for us,'' the letter read. It was signed:  ``Barack Obama.'' In the 1960s, after Dr. King and Rev. Vivian had left  Chicago, Leon Finney stayed. He understood that progress is a long  march. Systemic racism and deep, generational poverty can't be  eliminated in a year or two. Real change, real progress requires  sustained commitment and effort. It requires strategy, not just  slogans. Above all, Rev. Finney understood that real progress can't be  delivered from outside or imposed from above. It has to come from the  people who live in a community. He believed in power of grassroots  democracy to transform individual lives and whole communities.   Leon Finney was a Chicagoan by choice, not birth. He was born 82  years ago in Louise, MS., the eldest of six children. His father, Leon  Sr., moved the family north to Chicago when his children were young,  part of the Great Migration. In 1940, his dad opened his first  restaurant, Leon's Bar-B-Q, in Chicago's Woodlawn neighborhood. In its  heyday, Leon's had four locations throughout the South Side. Leon Sr.  was Chicago's ``Bar-B-Q King.''   In the early 1960s, Leon Jr. enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. He  served as a military police officer and criminal investigator. After  the Marines, he returned to Chicago and founded Christ Apostolic Church  in Woodlawn. He served as its pastor for two decades, until that church  merged with Metropolitan Apostolic Community Church--``The Met''--where  he served as senior pastor.   As his longtime friend and fellow activist, Father Michael Pfleger  said: Rev. Finney was ``one of the few pastors who still understood  that just the DNA of the gospel.'' It wasn't enough to preach about  justice on Sunday mornings. Rev. Finney believed that you needed to  work for justice every day.   In 1964 Rev. Finney joined The Woodlawn Organization, or TWO, a  grassroots group founded by the legendary organizer Saul Alinsky. He  joined forces with another South Side civil rights legend, Bishop  Arthur Brazier, who had marched with Dr. King in Chicago. In 1967, he  became TWO's executive director. In 1969, TWO created a nonprofit  development organization, WCDC--the Woodlawn Community Development  Corporation--and named Rev. Finney as its president.   TWO organized Woodlawn residents to stand up to absentee slumlords,  who owned much of the housing in Woodlawn and other low-income  neighborhoods on the South and West sides. It pushed back against plans  by the University of Chicago to expand its campus south, into Woodlawn,  plans that would have driven out longtime Woodlawn residents and  businesses. The group also fought against ``substandard, segregated  housing, high unemployment, poor schools, inadequate public services,  community health concerns and other persistent social problems.''   Over the years, WCDC helped attract more than $300 million in  commercial and residential development in ``uninvestable'' communities.  The organization developed nearly 1,700 apartments and homes for low-  and moderate-income families, mostly in Woodlawn but throughout the  South Side. It managed 9,000 rental apartments in Chicago and Gary, IN.  It employed 400 Black men and women, as many or more than almost any  other employer in Chicago except for government. Many of its early  victories were achieved before the creation of real estate investment  trusts, affordable housing tax credits, enterprise zones, and other  government incentive programs to attract capital to low-income and  minority neighborhoods. TWO and WCDC became national models for  community investment a revitalization.   Rev. Finney forged alliances with elected leaders because he wanted  to have a seat at the table when the interests of his community were  being decided. He was appointed to powerful government boards,  including the Chicago Housing Authority, the Chicago Plan Commission,  the Monitoring Commission for School Desegregation for Chicago Public  Schools, and Chicago State University.   In 1993, he joined the faculty of McCormick Theological Seminary on  the University of Chicago campus. As a professor of African American  Leadership Studies and executive director of the seminary's African  American Leadership Partnership, he helped train scores of new  ministers in the work of the social gospel.   He was not without fault. As he aged and the real estate industry  became increasingly complex, WCDC sometimes struggled to pace with the  changes and missteps occurred. But despite the controversy, the imprint  that Rev. Finney left on the South Side of Chicago and the good he  achieved is profound.   In recent years, he suffered a series of health setbacks, but he  never stopped working for justice. At his funeral, a community  developer who Rev. Finney helped train recalled a recent conversation  they had about today's new movement for racial reckoning.   ``What's the strategy going forward? Is a voter registrar marching  with you  [[Page S5934]]  next time?'' he asked. Like the marine he was, he remained focused and  disciplined to the end.   He was proud and optimistic that a part of Jackson Park would be home  to the new Obama Presidential Library. Not only would the library bring  new investment and opportunities to the South Side, it would remind the  young people, especially the Black and Brown children, who live there  about what is possible for them.   In a 2015 column, Rev. Finney wrote: ``The young among us today, many  of them, will grow up believing anyone can become president, regardless  of race. But some of us can remember when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled  in Brown vs. Board of Education that separate was not equal; some are  old enough to have marched on Washington. Those events signaled the end  of legal segregation in this country. But we never dreamed we would see  a man of African heritage elected president--not in our lifetimes.''  The South Side, the community that was home to Harold Washington,  Richard Wright, Mahalia Jackson, and many other pioneers for racial  justice, was the right home, he said, for the President Obama's  library.   Loretta and I offer our condolences to Rev. Finney's many friends,  colleagues, students, and especially to his family: his son Leon III,  his daughter Kristian Finney-Cooke, his son-in-law Dr. Gerald Cooke,  and his three grandchildren.   Several years ago, McCormick Theological Seminary held a gathering to  honor Rev. Finney. The occasion was the 20th anniversary of the program  he had founded to train African-American ministers. Graduates of the  program, including many community leaders, spoke of the profound  influence Rev. Finney had had on their lives. When it came time for him  to speak, Rev. Finney implored them to always remember to put the  mission of the Gospel before their own egos. He recited one of his  favorite Bible passages; the Gospel of Luke, chapter 4, verse 18: ``The  Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim  good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the  prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed  free.''   Leon Finney remained true to his mission. Martin Luther King and C.T.  Vivian helped sketch a vision for a new Chicago, but Leon Finney worked  for more than 50 years to make that better, fairer Chicago a reality.  The good he achieved will benefit our city, our State, and our Nation  for years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, when Chicago Bears football great Gale  Sayers was on the field, you knew something extraordinary would happen.   The press labeled him the ``Kansas Comet.'' His teammates called him  ``Magic.'' He did things in the NFL that had not been seen before, and  few have come close to matching decades later.   Gale famously said that all he needed was 18 inches of daylight  before he would change a game's dynamic. He was an unmatched running  back, a star receiver, and his kick returning records remain to this  day. But with everything with Gale, there was never enough time. His  legendary career was cut short by injury.   He passed away recently, and today, we pay our respect to an  extraordinary life.   Gale Eugene Sayers was born in Wichita, KS, in 1943. His father was a  mechanic and a car polisher, and his mother was a homemaker. His family  moved to Omaha, NE, in the early fifties, and Gale had his chance to  play sports for the first time there. At the age of 13, he was playing  kids who were 19 and 20 years old. Gale learned early on that he didn't  want to be tackled by larger people, so he made sure he wasn't. In high  school, he was not only a star running back, but he was also a track  star. His record in long jump stood for 44 years.   Dozens of colleges offered Gale scholarships, but he chose Kansas  University because he liked the coach and that it was relatively close  to home. There, he was dubbed the Kansas Comet. He was the first player  in NCAA Division 1A history to record a 99-yard run when he broke loose  against the University of Nebraska in 1963. His two-time All-American  honors led to the Bears picking him as the No. 4 overall pick in the  1965 NFL Draft.   Gale Sayers' NFL career began like lightning. He returned a punt 77  yards in his first preseason game, returned a kickoff 93 yards, and  threw a touchdown pass with his nondominant hand. For the season, he  led the league in all-purpose yards and set the league record at the  time of 22 touchdowns, earning the rookie of the year award.   Wrigley Field is famously the home of the Chicago Cubs, but the  greatest performance on that field was by Gale Sayers. The Chicago  Bears played there from 1921 to 1970. In December 1965, Wrigley Field's  playing surface was terrible. Players of both the Chicago Bears and San  Francisco 49ers were struggling to keep their footing in the rain, but  Gale wasn't one of them. He scored six touchdowns that day. He might  have scored seven or eight, but with a lopsided score, Bears Coach  George Halas sat him down. The 49ers went on to form a special defense  just for Gale Sayers.   Sayers had many brilliant games, but one of the revolutionary moments  his life was off the field when he was roommates with fullback Brian  Piccolo.   Sayers and Piccolo were the NFL's first interracial roommate duo.  When many lines were drawn between Black and White players, Sayers and  Piccolo set a new path for the league. They became best friends.   On November 10, 1968, the Bears faced the 49ers again, and Sayers  took a toss run play like he had done so many times. The 49ers  defensive player put his shoulder into Sayers' knee, and it bent  sideways. Sayers needed to be carted off the field. His knee would  never be the same. The rehabilitation program was difficult, but with  Piccolo's encouragement, Sayers was able to return the following year.   Gale returned to playing in 1969, earning the NFL Comeback Player of  the Year, but Piccolo became ill. Piccolo was coughing for weeks, and  he was diagnosed with embryonic cell carcinoma.   He underwent surgery, but the disease had spread to other organs. In  May, Gale earned the George S. Halas Award, an award recognizing the  league's most courageous player. In his speech for the award, Gale  dedicated it to Brian Piccolo. Piccolo died on June 16, 1970, at the  age of 26. Gale was a pallbearer at the funeral. The chapter on their  friendship in Gale's autobiography, ``I Am Third,'' is the basis of the  1971 movie ``Brian's Song,'' the most-watched TV movie in history at  the time.   In 1971, Gale suffered another knee injury, and it was never right  again. He retired in 1972 at the age of 29. It is a testament to the  extraordinary talent of Gale Sayers, only playing 68 games, that in  1977, he was Ge youngest player ever to be voted into the NFL Hall of  Fame at the age of 34. His statistics still remain competitive and as  records decades later.   After his NFL career, Gale returned to the University of Kansas as an  assistant athletic director and student. He completed his bachelor's  degree in physical education in 1975 and received a master's degree in  educational administration in 1977. He was the athletic director at  Southern Illinois University until 1981. Gale also supported the  Cradle, a Chicago-area adoption agency that launched the Ardythe and  Gale Sayers Center for African American Adoption in 1999. In 2007, Gale  testified in Congress along with several other players that the NFL  needed to improve its disability benefits system for retired players.   Sayers is survived by his wife Ardythe Elaine Bullard, his brothers  Roger and Ron, his sons Timothy and Scott, his daughter Gale Lynne, and  his stepsons Guy, Gaylon, and Gary.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Mark Guethle probably isn't the sort of  person you picture when you hear the word ``feminist.'' Mark is a big  guy: 6-foot-1, strong and muscular. It is easy to imagine him as the  star linebacker he was in high school. He spent decades as a labor  leader in the building trades, one of the toughest, most manhood-driven  segments of the American labor movement. But Mark Guethle has worked  harder to help good women get  [[Page S5935]]  elected to public office in my State of Illinois than almost any man I  know.   At a time when many Americans feel understandably dismayed about the  state of our politics, Mark Guethle has helped to introduce new  candidates, new leaders, new ideas, and a cautious new sense of hope in  government and hope in the future in Kane County, IL, one of the  ``collar counties'' surrounding Chicago. That is what Mark has achieved  in nearly 20 years as chairman of the Kane County Democratic Party. But  that is just one part of Mark's story and his busy life.   In addition, since 2003, Mark has served as a member of his town's  council, the North Aurora Village Board of Trustees. On top of all of  that, for nearly a quarter century, Mark Guethle has been a union  leader with Painters District Council 30, Local Union 97, which covers  most of north-central Illinois outside of Chicago. This past month,  Mark retired from his union job: director of government affairs for of  Painters District Council 30. He leaves with a proud record of  achievement.   Interestingly, he didn't start out to be a labor leader or a painter.  At Proviso West High School in Hillside, IL, he was a star athlete in  three sports: baseball, basketball, and football. It was his  performance as a linebacker that drew the most attention. He was  recruited by coaching legend Bo Schembechler to play for one of the  best college football teams in the Nation, the University of Michigan  Wolverines, but a bad accident during the summer after his high school  graduation set his life on a different course. During a robbery at a  gas station where he was working, Mark's arm was badly injured by a  piece of shattered glass. The University of Michigan said it would wait  for Mark's arm to heal but Mark's dad, a union carpenter, suggested  that Mark try a different path and join his union. Mark agreed, but the  carpenters weren't taking new members at that time.   Mark's uncle, a union painter, suggested he try the painters union.  He was hired as an apprentice at the age of 19. As it turned out, Mark  had just the personal qualities that a good painter needs: attention to  detail, a tenacious work ethic, and an unusual ability to listen to  people and understand what they want. He started as an organizer for  District Council 30 in 1997. Five years later, he was hired as the  district council's governmental affairs director, the position he held  until he retired from the union at the start of this month.   As a labor leader, Mark fought for respect and fair treatment not  only for members of his union but for all working people in the State  of Illinois. The list of State laws that he has helped enact is long  and impressive. It includes increasing Illinois' minimum wage,  protecting overtime pay, strengthening collective bargaining rights and  the prevailing wage in our State, and encouraging better labor- management relations through the use of project-management agreements.  Mark has also taken courageous stands on issues including immigrant  rights, women's rights, and marriage equality.   Mark's commitment to social and economic justice and his nuts-and- bolts understanding of how politics works are qualities he acquired  growing up in a politically active union family. He learned how to  knock on doors and distribute yard signs for candidates when he was  just a kid, and at age 60, he still spends an incredible amount of time  and energy on such tasks. When there is work to be done, whether its  phone banking or neighborhood canvassing, you can be sure that Mark  will be the first to arrive and the last to quit.   When Mark was elected Kane County Democratic chair in 2002, there  were no Democrats in the county serving at the State or Federal level-- none. Today, Democrats hold every congressional seat serving the  county. One of those House members, Lauren Underwood, is the only nurse  now serving in Congress. In the Illinois General Assembly, Kane County  is represented by two Democratic senators and four house members, all  of them women.   ``We run women because we want to win,'' is how Mark once described  his recruitment strategy. I suspect there is a little more to it. You  see, Mark's mother was a brilliant woman who graduated from the  University of Chicago when she was 16 years old, but like so many women  of her generation, her career choices were limited because of her  gender. She died when Mark was 22 years old, but she inspired in Mark  and her other four children a profound belief in what women could  achieve if given a fair chance.   Mark Guethle is the embodiment of grassroots democracy. The people of  Kane County and all Illinois' working families owe a lot to Mark and to  his mom, Loretta. Mark is also respected by Republicans as a man of  principles. One of his close friends, North Aurora mayor Dale Berman,  was a lifelong Republican who Mark actually persuaded, by example, to  become a Democrat.   Stepping down from the union job will leave Mark more time for his  work with his town's board of trustees and the Kane County Democratic  Party. It will mean more time for Mark and Louise, his wife of 31  years, to perform in their church choir. Mark will have more time to  watch his beloved Chicago Cubs--on TV for now, rather than in the  bleachers, which he prefers. He will have more time for playing  keyboards in his cover band and more time to practice on his guitar and  ukulele, and he will have more time to spend with his sons, Marcus and  Brian, and his four grand-daughters, whom he adores.   Lastly, I am certain that Mark will spend even more time listening to  his neighbors in Kane County and finding new ways to make government  work for them, regardless of their political party, because that is  what he cares most about. I am proud to call Mark my friend, and  Loretta and I wish him and Louise all the best as they begin this new  chapter of their lives.
