 Mr. Chairman, let me begin by thanking Chairman Graves as  well as Ranking Member Larsen for the great work that they both did on  this FAA reauthorization.   I rise in support of this en bloc, which includes Carbajal amendment  No. 9, of which I am a cosponsor. I thank both the chairman and the  ranking member for including this amendment in the en bloc.   This amendment creates a pilot program at five airports to deliver  mobile clearances for general aviation and part 135 air carriers. Early  FAA trials of this technology have shown promise, and thus it seems  worthwhile to continue development and testing in hopes of being able  to deploy it more widely.   As a pilot myself, I am excited about something like this down the  road. Voice-based clearances can be difficult to understand, which  leads to delays and misunderstandings. For airports without Towered  Data Link Services, voice-based clearances can take 30 to 40 minutes.  Trials of mobile deliveries have reduced that to 2 minutes.   I thank Mr. Carbajal and Ms. Davids for their partnership on this  amendment, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for their  support.
