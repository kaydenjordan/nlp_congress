 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Kernersville Chamber  of Commerce on celebrating its 50th anniversary this week. This  organization is a steadfast pillar of the strong business community in  Kernersville, North Carolina.   The Teacher Grant Program is among the chamber's many significant  contributions to local education and investments in future business  leaders. Each year, teachers submit proposals for creative ``hands on''  lessons, and with moneys raised over the summer, the chamber awards at  least one $500 grant to each school.   The chamber also supports current community and business leaders  through its Leadership Kernersville Program, which has prepared 200  participants for leadership roles and involvement within the community,  the region, and the State since 1993.   The Kernersville Chamber of Commerce has been an incredible asset to  the community and will continue to be so for many years to come.                            ____________________
