 Madam Speaker, I urge support of this package, which  contains four amendments I have introduced.   My first requires the Secretaries of Defense and State to investigate  the use of social media platforms by foreign terrorists and to report  to Congress on the homeland security threats posed by online  radicalization of violent extremists. Just last week, public reporting  detailed that Facebook accounts linked to ISIS are still on the  platform, letting them spread extremist content online.    My second amendment looks out for our brave National Guard members on  the front lines of COVID-19, including disaster-stricken long-term care  facilities like the State-run New Jersey veterans home at Paramus, by  providing 2 weeks of housing to quarantine safely before returning to  their families and communities.   My third amendment ensures that the Secretary of Defense publicly  reports lead and copper testing of drinking water at K-12 schools on  military bases, because parents and families deserve to know the facts.   Madam Speaker, to ensure we are standing up for military families, my  final amendment requires an annual report to Congress analyzing  nationwide costs of living for members of the Department of Defense,  particularly those in New Jersey who have been whacked by the gutting  of the SALT deduction.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan set of amendments.
