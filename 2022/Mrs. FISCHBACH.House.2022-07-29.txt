 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from the  Committee on Rules for providing the time to speak.   Madam Speaker, my colleagues are proving, yet again, that they want  to strip law-abiding citizens of their Second Amendment rights. The  latest so-called assault weapons ban is unconstitutional and will  impact other aspects of American life.   This bill would end the sale of some of the most popular rifles sold  in America today, impacting the sporting industry and all of those who  rely on it for their livelihoods.   This bill will have an impact in ways even the supporters of the bill  do not understand. For example, under this law, stabilizing braces for  pistols would be outlawed.   Despite what some of my colleagues have said, stabilizing braces are  not bump stocks and will not turn a pistol into an assault rifle.  Stabilizing braces are used by hunters with disabilities, including  many of our disabled veterans, to help them safely hunt with pistols.   Not only is this bill an assault on our constitutional rights, but  the loss of the revenue from the sales of these firearms will also have  a devastating impact on the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund,  which helps States pay for environmental conservation efforts. The bill  provides no alternative  [[Page H7494]]  for how to make up for the severe decrease in conservation funding.   Democrats are no longer disguising their radical agenda to ban guns  and do away with the Constitution's Second Amendment. My colleagues  from the other side have said that they will do everything they can to  ban guns in this country, even to the point of packing the Supreme  Court to make it happen. Anyone who thinks this bill is not a step in  that direction is kidding themselves. This is yet another attempt from  the left to strip law-abiding citizens of their Second Amendment  rights, and I oppose this bill and the rule.
