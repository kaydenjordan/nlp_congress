 Madam President, yesterday we learned that, once again, my  Republican colleagues do not have the votes to pass their latest effort  to repeal the Affordable Care Act, even though the budget  reconciliation process we are currently under requires only 50 votes.  There are not 50 votes.   Many of my colleagues have spoken on this floor about the challenges,  the problems, or the issues with the latest iteration of the Graham- Cassidy bill. We have also heard as a body from many organizations all  over the country that represent Americans in healthcare: the American  Medical Association, which speaks for America's doctors; the American  Hospital Association, which speaks for our hospitals; America's Health  Insurance Plans; the American Cancer Society; many other patient  advocacy groups; and the AARP, which advocates for seniors. All have  weighed in about the challenges with this legislation.   But rather than continuing to bear down on that point, I would like  to quote a colleague and hero of mine. Senator John McCain said on this  floor:         We should not be content to pass healthcare legislation on       a party-line basis. . . . The issue is too important, and too       many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people       guessing from one election to the next whether and how they       will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires       a bipartisan approach.    Senator McCain also said:         I hope that in the months ahead, we can join with       colleagues on both sides of the aisle to arrive at a       compromise solution that is acceptable to most of us, and       serves the interests of Americans as best we can.    Senator McCain is right. Fixing and improving our healthcare system  cannot be done on a partisan basis. When it has been attempted to turn  big bills into law on a narrow party-line basis, the results are often  not sustainable. That is why we have work to do together, because this  issue of providing for America's healthcare is too complex, too big,  and too important for us to do with only one wing or one party.    I was encouraged, as were many colleagues, Republican and Democratic,  when Senators Alexander and Murray, the Republican and Democratic  leaders of the Senate Health and Education Committee, held bipartisan  hearings. They brought in Governors, insurance commissioners,  healthcare experts, physicians, and hospital leaders from across the  country to talk about what we need to do short term and long term to  stabilize healthcare markets and to lay the foundation for improvements  to our healthcare system.   So let's listen to Senator McCain. Let's give that bipartisan effort  another chance. Let's work together and do this the right way.   I ride the train back and forth almost every day from Wilmington to  Washington, and the Delawareans I hear from on that train or at home in  the grocery store or around my State are simply tired of Congress  fighting endless partisan battles with their healthcare. And it is not  just frustrating to hear about on television; we  [[Page S6169]]  know for a fact that uncertainty in the healthcare markets is causing  premiums to go up for Americans all over the country. The CEO of  Highmark, which is the sole provider of individual market health  insurance to the ACA market in Delaware now, conveyed to me that half  of the rate increase for this coming year was due to uncertainty about  whether the Trump administration would continue to enforce the  individual mandate, to make the CSR payments, and other things that are  part of the ACA.   So today, recognizing that the only way this gets fixed in such a  closely divided and partisan Senate is if we work together, I would  like to commit again to my constituents and colleagues that I am  willing to work to find bipartisan solutions to our healthcare  problems.   Let's sit down together, and let's bring in organizations like the  AMA, the AARP, the American Cancer Society, the American Hospital  Association, and let's listen. Let's listen to them, to healthcare  leaders, and to patient advocates, and frankly I think we should listen  to thousands of faith leaders from across the country as well. We have  received letters--all of us as a body--from leaders of the Christian,  Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, and Buddhist communities across our country. They  jointly wrote a letter to Congress urging us to reject the Graham- Cassidy bill and to immediately address urgent matters that are right  in front of us.   The next one is CHIP reauthorization. CHIP--the Children's Health  Insurance Program--serves nearly 9 million American children, 17,000 in  Delaware alone, and it is going to expire. There are a lot of Federal  health programs that expire at the end of this week: the Children's  Health Insurance Program, the Community Health Center Fund, which  provides access to cost-effective primary and preventive care for 26  million patients throughout the country; the teaching health centers  funding; the special diabetes program. There is a whole list of  healthcare-related programs that expire at the end of this week. So I  think we need a sense of urgency. We need a sense of urgency to finding  ways to work together in the short term to stabilize the market, to  extend these programs, such as CHIP, that have long enjoyed bipartisan  support and to begin the steps needed to show flexibility and  compromise by both parties.   First, as I said, we have to stabilize the individual ACA  marketplace. Fortunately, we know how to do that. As I mentioned, there  have already been hearings in which testimony was received from  Governors, insurance commissioners, healthcare experts, and they said  the No. 1 priority was funding the ACA cost-sharing reduction  subsidies, or CSR payments. That is something the Trump administration  can do today. The administration can simply announce that they will  continue to meet the law and make those payments. At least in my State,  that will reduce the rate of increase of individual insurance premiums  by a significant percentage.   We can also work together to establish a reinsurance program, to  support enrollment outreach activities, and to enforce the individual  mandate. All of this would translate to lower premiums. As I said, the  President is already authorized under the ACA to take a few of these  steps and stabilize the marketplace.   From there, we are going to have to find bipartisan ways that we can  make this a more workable system. I have introduced legislation in the  past to make the ACA small business tax credits more appropriately  sized for the small businesses I have heard from in Delaware, many of  which can't afford the increased costs of the Affordable Care Act.   There are ways we can work together to reduce the reporting  requirements so they are less burdensome to employers. I introduced a  bill on that in the last Congress and would welcome a chance to work  with a Republican colleague to introduce and pass that legislation now.   We could also look at ways to make the tax credits--or the way that  subsidies are provided through the ACA--both more affordable and more  sustainable, so that families who qualify aren't caught in a situation  where they qualify for tax credits, but they are nowhere near enough to  afford comprehensive health insurance.   We also have to take a hard, bipartisan look at what is driving up  healthcare costs across this country. We aren't just challenged with  resolving issues around health insurance; we also have to find a  bipartisan path toward addressing healthcare costs.   The bottom line to all of this is that we must work together to  return to regular order and to give these programs the stability and  certainty they need to serve patients across the country and our  constituents at home.   In my view, the Affordable Care Act has helped millions of Americans  live healthier, safer, more secure lives. Repealing it and replacing it  with one of the proposals we have seen in recent months would have been  very harmful to millions of Americans. But that doesn't mean the ACA is  perfect. There is hard work to do. Compromise is needed on both sides.  And I think the call that Senator McCain has issued to this Chamber is  one we should hear.   So let's work together. Let's listen to our constituents. Let's  listen to faith leaders. Let's listen to doctors and healthcare  experts. Let's do the hard work and together improve, not tear down,  our healthcare system.   Thank you.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
