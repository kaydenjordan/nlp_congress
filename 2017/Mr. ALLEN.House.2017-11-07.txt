 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support Congressman Byrne's  important legislation, the Save Local Business Act.   As a small-business owner myself for over 40 years, I know how  difficult it can be to wade through Federal, State, and local red tape.  Sometimes it feels like the government is against growing your  business. The Obama administration expanded the joint employer standard  under the Fair Labor Standards Act, blurring the lines of  responsibility for decisions affecting the daily operations of many  local businesses.   According to the American Action Forum, the joint employer scheme  could have resulted in 1.7 million fewer jobs. Luckily, President Trump  is a job creator, so he knows a job-killing regulation when he sees  one. Earlier this summer, his administration rescinded this terrible  rule.   However, we have to make sure no bureaucrat is empowered to redefine  a joint employer standard again. Small-business owners are already  facing an uphill battle. We should not be threatening the freedoms of  independent businesses, owners, and entrepreneurs, making it even  harder for them to achieve the American Dream. That is why I urge all  of my colleagues to support this legislation.
