 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the appropriations  package we just passed today.   Central Florida is space and technology country. We just launched the  Perseverance rover yesterday, which we could see from my backyard. We  are the busiest spaceport in the world at Cape Canaveral.   I was honored to help boost funds and recognize the important global  competition and for America to be a leader in low-Earth orbit and  commercial spaceflight operations.   We advanced Outer Planet and Ocean Worlds, including the Europa  Clipper mission to advance humankind. We also fought for more funding  for emerging technology like solar energy, artificial intelligence, to  improve blockchain, and for quantum computing investments.   Why is this important? We use quantum computing to identify 12  separate antiviral drugs, one of which ended up being remdesivir,  through quantum computing and artificial intelligence here in the  Federal Government.   We can solve the next generation's problems with cutting-edge  technology. We will continue to do that going forward.                            ____________________
