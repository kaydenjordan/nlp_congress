Thank you, L.F., for this report, and more  importantly, thank you for your thoughtful and exemplary leadership of  this outstanding organization.   The Chair again wishes to thank the former Members of the House for  their presence here today. Before terminating these proceedings, the  Chair would like to invite those former Members who did not earlier  respond when the roll was called to give their names to the Reading  Clerk for inclusion in the roll.   On behalf of the FMC, I thank the congressional staff who have helped  make today's presentation possible.   As always, you have been a terrific resource, and we continue to very  much appreciate all of your service, both here today and, as always,  every day.   The meeting stands adjourned.                            ____________________
