 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bipartisan  amendment that I am leading on with Representative Comstock, along with  many of our colleagues on the STARBASE Caucus. I appreciate it being  included in the en bloc package of amendments.   This amendment would simply increase funding for the Department of  Defense's STARBASE program from 25 to $30 million for the fiscal year  2018, bringing funding back to the fiscal year 2017 enacted level.  Providing science, technology, engineering, and math, STEM education,  to America's  [[Page H6495]]  youth is critical to the global competitiveness of our Nation.   The STARBASE program engages local fifth grade elementary students by  exposing them to STEM subjects through an inquiry-based curriculum.   Serving communities from Los Alamitos, California, to Winchester,  Virginia, and across the Nation, there are now 59 programs in  congressional districts throughout 30 States, including the District of  Columbia and Puerto Rico. Close to 1 million fifth graders across the  Nation have now had the opportunity to participate in hands-on STEM  classes on military bases thanks to STARBASE.   Moreover, the Department of Defense's STARBASE program is one of the  most cost-effective programs across the Federal Government.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of this amendment.
