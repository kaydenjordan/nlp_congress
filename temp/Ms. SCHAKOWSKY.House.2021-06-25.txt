 Mr. Speaker, methane emissions are accelerating  climate change and harming our communities, and we are moving in the  wrong direction.   After the Trump administration repealed limitations on emissions of  methane, we saw the largest yearly increase of methane emissions on  record in 2020. We must get back on track.   It is urgent that we restore regulations to limit methane emissions.  Methane is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide. We cannot move  quickly enough. We have to act now.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the legislation that we will  be considering today, to curb these dangerous emissions and protect our  communities.                            ____________________
