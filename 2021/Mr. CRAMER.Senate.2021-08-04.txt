 Madam President, I want to take some time to share some  of my thoughts on this Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that we  are debating today, and I wasn't intending to speak specifically to the  amendment Senator Cornyn just brought up, but I just can't resist  saying: Man, I wish you well.   I think when--a bipartisan solution, like Senator Cornyn and Senator  Padilla have come up with, to provide flexibility to our Governors and  our communities just makes all the sense in the world.   So I am looking forward to voting yes, and I hope we can get a  resolution that allows at least 59 of my closest friends to do the  same.   I want to start out by thanking Senators Portman and Sinema for  providing such incredible leadership, and to the group of bipartisan  Senators who negotiated and coordinated this incredible effort.   I also want to thank Senator Capito, who is managing, of course, this  floor process, along with Environment and Public Works Committee  Chairman Tom Carper. The progress that they have made on this issue  with the administration earlier this year, paired with the excellent  leadership that they provided the committee, really exemplifies what is  possible when we work together, and it has allowed us to get to this  point.   Reviving America's roads and bridges is a longstanding national  priority of Congress, and is one that has taken us too long to address.  We need reliable, accessible infrastructure to operate locally and to  compete globally; and as it currently stands, the bill before us is  well positioned to meet that exact need.   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act isn't perfect--no bill  ever is--but it makes historic investments in assets that will benefit  every American for many, many years.   I applaud the group for using the surface transportation bill that we  unanimously passed out of the Environment and Public Works Committee as  the foundation for this bill. As the lead Republican on the  Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, I know how much time  and effort both sides of the aisle have put in to surface  transportation reauthorization. The end result reflected the good work  we accomplished, and it was the perfect building block for the package  that is before us.   As you know, I was not an original part of this bipartisan  negotiating group. However, when I was approached for my input, I made  my top priorities clear:   One, keeping the permitting reforms in our bill--permitting reforms  like the one-agency decision that was a rule that President Trump put  into place, that President Biden removed his first day in office. It is  codified in this bill for surface transportation;   Prioritizing dedicating funding to States and to their departments of  transportation as part of the traditional formula for distribution;   Limiting the expansion of urban transit programs; and   Including the bipartisan bill that Senator Lujan and I introduced to  clean up orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells.   I was glad to see these provisions, as well as our committee's  Drinking and Wastewater Infrastructure Act, in the bill.   I also appreciate the use of unspent COVID-19 relief funds to help  pay for these priorities rather than being used for paying people to  not work and adding fuel to the fire of inflation. This does just the  opposite.   I thank my colleagues for asking for my opinion, and I am even more  grateful that they listened and included these provisions in our final  product.   Infrastructure has been a priority for Congress because it is a  priority for our constituents. America cannot succeed without a robust  infrastructure from one coast to the other and all the places, like  North Dakota, in between. We need roads and bridges to go from farm to  town and from town to city, from city to city, and State to State.    We use ports and waterways and railroads to move the products that we  produce to places they could otherwise never get to. We use rail and  air to connect with family and friends and other business associates  around the world. And we use broadband connectivity to facilitate  transactions, both personal and business.   Infrastructure is foundational to our way of life, and it is the  constitutional responsibility of the Federal Government to facilitate  interstate commerce, including the movement of goods and services along  our highways and byways and waterways and railways.   Rural States, like North Dakota, know this better than most. In fact,  Rugby, ND, is literally the geographical center of the North American  continent. We are landlocked, and we rely on our transportation  infrastructure to get where we need to go and, more importantly, to  move the products that we produce to where they need to get.   For example, North Dakota is the top producer of durum wheat, which  gets ground into semolina flour, which becomes the main ingredient in  pasta. The wheat goes from the field to a grain elevator by a farm  road, to a mill by rail, and to a processing plant by both, and then it  goes anywhere from a  [[Page S5808]]  grocery store in California to a restaurant in New York, or perhaps  overseas to a market far away.   And just like every other commodity we produce, it requires a  reliable infrastructure system that is safe and sufficient for every  single mile on the journey.   The United States needs rural America, and rural America needs  infrastructure. The personal needs it fulfills and the economic  benefits it delivers are obvious. Rather than investing trillions of  taxpayer dollars on government handouts to people to not work, we can  spend money on putting people to work, revitalizing a system that  directly benefits all of us, and that is what the plan before us would  help accomplish.   It is not perfect--no bill is, as I said--and there are parts of it  that I don't support, but there are parts, I know, that some of my  colleagues do not support, even though they are top priorities for me.   Our Founding Fathers intended for Congress to collaborate and find  common ground. Those are functions of our system; they are not a side  effect. It is easy to imagine if every Founder had demanded to get  everything they wanted and nothing else, well, then we would have had a  king, and we may not have had the system of cooperative Federalism that  we do today. And if enough of them believed that doing nothing is  better than getting 80 or 90 percent of what they wanted or--then our  more perfect Union would never have gotten started and had a chance to  become that.   The inability to meet in the middle is not an excuse for inaction,  especially when it comes to addressing not just the pressing needs of  the American people here at home, but also protecting our standing as a  country on the world stage.   We understand how important infrastructure is, but so does China, so  does Russia, so do all of our adversaries who would like to see us  continue to fall behind. The Chinese Communist Party would love to see  America's roads and bridges crumble. They would be happy to let  infrastructure get in the way of American production and allow for them  to meet the needs of the global economy in our absence.   The bill that we have before us gives us an opportunity to help stop  that from happening.   Now, while I am all for working across the aisle, that doesn't mean I  will support bills that I fundamentally disagree with, like the $3.5  trillion-plus spending bill that Senate Democrats plan to cobble  together after we finish this bipartisan infrastructure bill.   I oppose the Democrats' reckless tax-and-spend agenda, and I will  join each of my Republican colleagues in opposing it and offering  amendments to change its harmful outcomes.   That bill is completely separate from the bipartisan infrastructure  bill that we are talking about today. They are not tied together,  despite what rhetoric there may be otherwise. Both should be considered  on their own merits separately.   What a shame it would be for Democrats to offer the American public a  glimpse of bipartisanship and cooperation to only do an about-face and  hold it hostage while they jam through a massive tax increase and  growth of the Federal Government, adding to inflation.   I hope my colleagues will choose to build on this bipartisan success  and resist the urge to follow the partisan whims of their political  base.   As it stands, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act would be a  significant win for our country. I know it would be for my State. So  far we have avoided adding poison pills or derailing the process, and I  urge my colleagues to keep it that way.   North Dakota needs safe and sufficient infrastructure. America needs  safe and sufficient infrastructure. And the world needs the United  States to have safe and sufficient infrastructure.   I urge my colleagues to keep the negative parts of the bill in  perspective and to appreciate the opportunity we have today to make a  difference for our constituents.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, it is a great honor for me to recognize a  North Dakota hero who will celebrate his 100th birthday on August 20.  Arnold Postovit of Tioga is one of our State's most treasured residents  who has experienced many great moments in our State's and Nation's  history.   Raised during the Great Depression on a farm near the town of Plaza,  Arnold remembers days where the grasshoppers were so thick they blocked  the sun. In an oral interview in 1999, this World War II veteran shared  details about his military service.   Arnold graduated from Plaza High School and spent a semester at the  University of North Dakota before deciding he wanted to be a pilot.  This led him and a few friends to the Army recruiting center in  Bismarck in the summer of 1940. With no openings in Army Air Corps  units, he enlisted in the infantry and never left the 7th Infantry, 3rd  Division.   He trained with a mortar unit in Washington State, going on manuevers  and practicing boat landings on Puget Sound. In January 1941, he was  transferred to Fort Lewis and was on leave in Tacoma on December 7,  when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. In early 1942, he trained near  San Diego for several months, which included desert maneuvers.  Traveling by train to Virginia, it was in November 1942 when his  battalion boarded the USS Thomas Jefferson and landed in North Africa 3  weeks later. There, he was was among those who conducted night patrols  around Casablanca. Following more training, Arnold and his division  sailed the Mediterranean Sea toward Tunis to prepare for the invasion  of Sicily in July 1943. His landing craft infantry came under heavy  German machinegun fire as they came ashore. He also saw action in  Palermo and Messina, Italy, where he remembers heavy fighting and the  cold weather at Christmastime.   ``We were young and tough,'' Arnold recalled in 1999. ``There was a  lot of rain and we got sick from being wet and from the dysentery that  would break out.''   His life would change after his unit landed behind German lines in  Anzio, Italy, in January 1944. Hitler sent some of his best battle- hardened troops to push back this surprise attack by the Allied Forces.  On February 6, German troops captured Arnold and a dozen other  soldiers. He was transferred to a nearby POW camp that held many other  American and British soldiers.   A few weeks later, trucks took him and other POWs on a 4-day trip to  northern Germany to the Stalag 2B camp. After a few months, he and 16  other soldiers were taken by train to a working farm, where he did  general farm work for nearly a year. In the spring of 1945, as Soviet  troops invaded Germany from the east, Arnold and a thousand other  soldiers were marched west across Germany. They came close to the North  Sea and kept warm in nearby barns during the cold nights. After  marching 600 miles, Arnold and some other soldiers saw an opportunity  to escape to a nearby small town near the Elbe River on April 12. They  hid in abandoned buildings and the next morning flagged down a small  American plane that was flying over. They were told to stay where they  were because American troops would be marching through later that day.  When they connected with the Americans, the first thing the soldiers  did was throw those thin and sick prisoners of war cans of C-rations to  eat. Eventually, they were flown to Le Harve, France, and went to  nearby Camp Lucky Strike, where released prisoners of war were taken to  regain their health. Arnold was among other North Dakota soldiers who  then sailed with thousands of others to Newport News, VA, on a  converted transport ship.   Following his Army discharge, Arnold returned home to farm with his  father, who by then lived near White Earth, ND. He planted the crops  and  [[Page S5824]]  his father took care of the livestock. Married 6 years later, he and  his wife Marjorie raised a family of five children. Although it was  difficult to adjust after his wartime and POW experiences, Arnold made  the best of his opportunities and cherished being an American. ``After  you lose your freedom, then you understand what freedom means,'' he  said. ``Americans are free, even if we sometimes think we aren't.''   In May 2009, Arnold participated with other North Dakota World War II  veterans in an Honor Flight that took them to the World War II Memorial  and other sites in Washington, DC.   Arnold Postovit is one of 60,000 North Dakotans who served in the  U.S. Armed Forces during World War II. Of those, nearly 2,000 gave  their lives for our freedom in this largest and deadliest conflict in  world history. With only some 500 World War II veterans still alive  today in North Dakota, the heroism of every single one of them is  appreciated more than ever.   Throughout his life, Arnold has embodied the best of the Greatest  Generation. He has lived a meaningful life, sharing his story as a  World War II soldier so the rest of us can better understand and  appreciate the selfless service and sacrifice each and every veteran  has made. On behalf of all North Dakotans, I wish Arnold Postovit a  very happy 100th birthday on August 20 and many more years of health  and vitality. As he celebrates with his family and many friends in  Tioga on August 22, I honor him as one of North Dakota's most exemplary  citizens.                            ____________________
