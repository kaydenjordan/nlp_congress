 Madam Speaker, yesterday marked 1 month since the  gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School cut short the lives of  17 students and teachers. These tragedies have become so common that  the response of this Congress is practically routine: thoughts and  prayers are offered, moments of silence held, and then we move on with  no specific action on gun violence.   Madam Speaker, this is not enough. We need to heed the call of  thousands of students across the country who organized walkouts and  events with a simple message for us: It is time to act.   We need to be able to look these students in the eye and say: ``We  are doing everything we can to protect you.'' But for too long, this  institution has refused to do just that. We are not considering  legislation to pass universal background checks. We have not debated  restricting the sale of military assault weapons, bump stocks, and  high-capacity magazines, or even lifting the ban on preventing our  government from researching gun safety solutions.   Yesterday we did pass a bill with important resources for school  safety, including a bipartisan provision I introduced with  Representative  Mike Bost to help schools install panic buttons. That  is an important first step, but really protecting our children is not  possible without concrete measures to reduce gun violence.   I urge my colleagues to listen to the wisdom of the young people in  our districts, and let's all find the courage to pass sensible gun  safety laws and, finally, to save lives.                            ____________________
