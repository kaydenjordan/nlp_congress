 Madam Speaker, earlier this year, President Biden called  on Congress to comprehensively address the effects of toxic exposure in  our veterans.   My bipartisan Honoring our PACT Act is the largest expansion of VA  benefits in a generation.   Now that it is the law, the United States is finally recognizing  toxic exposure as a cost of war.   Earlier this year, VA announced that it will immediately begin  processing PACT Act benefits claims for eligible terminally ill  veterans.   These developments would not have been possible without the work  between Congress, House Democrats, and the Biden-Harris administration,  and for our commitment to follow through on our promise to deliver  healthcare  [[Page H9858]]  and benefits to America's toxic-exposed veterans.   I encourage veterans to visit VA.gov/PACT for more information on  PACT Act benefits.   Madam Speaker, and may I add that Bishop Barber, our guest chaplain  today, along with our Speaker, were instrumental in including Camp  Lejeune as part of the PACT Act, and I know that America is grateful  for this justice to be done.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1518, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1948) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  modify authorities relating to the collective bargaining of employees  in the Veterans Health Administration, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1948, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1948, as amended,  the bipartisan VA Employee Fairness Act. This legislation ensures  important collective bargaining rights for all frontline healthcare  workers who care for our veterans.   As chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have made  veterans' healthcare one of my top priorities. I know my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle strongly support our veterans and the benefits  they earn.   This bill presents an opportunity to match words with action. The VA  Employee Fairness Act will ensure critical protections for the  healthcare workers serving our veterans.   As a Nation, we must invest in these frontline workers at VA  hospitals. Our veterans need modern, well-designed hospital and  clinical buildings equipped with the latest, most advanced medical  devices and equipment and stocked with adequate medical supplies.                                time  1030    However, all this means little without a well-trained workforce ready  to serve our veterans. That is why collective bargaining is vital.   Frontline healthcare workers deserve the right to organize  themselves. They deserve to have a voice. VA nurses or technicians  should be able to point out wrongdoing without fear of losing their job  or other forms of retaliation.   All of this sounds like common sense, and it is, and this is what  collective bargaining is all about.  [[Page H9864]]    My bill will bring parity to the Federal workforce by ensuring full  collective bargaining rights for all VA employees.   Under current law, almost all Federal employees have basic worker  protections through collective bargaining. They can become members of a  labor union. They have a way to raise grievances and seek redress. They  are allowed to have the support of union representatives. This has long  been part of the fabric of the Federal workforce.   But there is one glaring exception. Many of the frontline healthcare  workers within VA hospitals and clinics are barred from collective  bargaining.   Title 38 healthcare professionals, such as registered nurses,  physicians, dentists, and physician assistants, do not have the same  rights as the psychologists, social workers, pharmacists, and licensed  practical nurses who work side by side with them.   I will note that the same professionals at Department of Defense  hospitals have collective bargaining rights. You heard that right. A  registered nurse has collective bargaining rights at DOD but not a  registered nurse at VA. This is the kind of legal contortion that  should be fixed.   This probably sounds arbitrary, and it is. A list was written up by  Congress years ago and depending on your specialty of nursing care or  other occupation, someone taking care of veterans is either able to  have full rights as an employee or not, and this only happens at VA  healthcare facilities.   The bill is cosponsored by 218 of our congressional colleagues, and  it has the support from those who represent frontline VA healthcare  workers, including the American Federation of Labor and Congress of  Industrial Organizations, National Nurses United, National Federation  of Federal Employees, National Association of Government Employees,  Service Employees International Union, the National Veterans Affairs  Council, and a dozen other national labor unions. Further, this bill  has the endorsement of Vietnam Veterans of America and The American  Legion.   I wish to point out what VA said in its testimony when my committee  held a legislative hearing on it last year. ``Secretary McDonough has  stated publicly and to our workforce that a unionized workforce is a  strong workforce. Collective bargaining is a powerful means for a  strong workforce which is VA's number one asset as we work toward  increasing access and outcomes for veterans, their families,  caregivers, and survivors. VA supports organized labor and values in  the collective bargaining process with our labor partners.''   I agree. This is about building and maintaining a strong workforce, a  workforce dedicated to serving our veterans. I will share a real-world  example of the importance of collective bargaining at VA.   In an issue that rose to U.S. District Court, the Central Texas VA  Healthcare System failed to pay nurse practitioners and physician  assistants overtime. When the healthcare workers demanded what was due  to them, VA resisted.   The case was arbitrated in favor of the employees, but VA then used  its authority under title 38 to argue that the grievance should not be  addressed.   There is nothing fair about that.   This outdated provision in Federal law has become an excuse for VA to  deny workers the benefits they have rightfully earned. Stories like  these hardly represent an incentive for nurses to remain in the  Department.   H.R. 1948, as amended, will ensure that VA employees have the ability  to seek redress when VA does not follow its own rules and policies.   Some of my colleagues will argue that this means labor unions will  start making veteran healthcare decisions, but this is, quite simply,  not the case. Under Federal law, VA healthcare workers do not have this  power. No Federal healthcare worker with collective bargaining rights  has this power. Nor do their labor unions.   In fact, the current law stipulates that Federal employees with  collective bargaining rights are limited in what they can bargain for.   Unlike in the private sector, Federal workers who have collective  bargaining rights cannot strike, and they cannot bargain over their  level of pay. Pay levels are set by the civil service pay grades each  year and are not subject to collective bargaining.   Title 38 employees should have the same rights as those governed by  title 5. Title 38 employees should have the same rights as their  colleagues with whom they work side by side serving our veterans. H.R.  1948, as amended, is all about fairness for VA's frontline workers.   VA is going to be ramping up hiring over the next 5 years as it  welcomes 3.5 million more veterans into the VA healthcare system after  the passage of the Honoring our PACT Act. In order to attract the most  qualified workforce to serve our veterans, we need to ensure that VA is  a great place to work.   The employees who are on the front lines of our Nation's veterans'  healthcare deserve and need basic worker protections. A VA nurse needs  to be able to ask that their pay errors will be resolved. A doctor must  feel empowered to raise medical safety concerns without fear of  reprisal or retaliation. Without these protections, VA will continue to  struggle to recruit and retain the best and brightest medical  professionals that our country has to offer, and I fear that veterans'  health and well-being will suffer as a result.   This is about fairness, and I am pleased that the administration  agrees and has issued a statement in support of this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of  Administration Policy.                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 1948--VA Employee Fairness Act of 2022--Rep. Takano, D-CA, and 218                                 cosponsors         The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1948, the       VA Employee Fairness, Act of 2022, to expand collective       bargaining opportunities for covered Federal employees.        The Biden-Harris Administration supports worker organizing       and empowerment as critical tools to grow the middle class       and build an inclusive economy. The Federal government,       consistent with its obligations to serve the public, can be a       model employer in this regard.        The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for       the delivery of safe, effective, and timely patient care for       our veterans, and dedicated VA employees work tirelessly to       support our veterans' health needs, including in combating       COVID-19.        The Administration is committed to continuing to work with       Congress to support hard-working employees while protecting       veterans' access to the care and services that they have       earned through service to the Nation.     Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 1948, as amended, the VA Employee Fairness Act. It  represents the right thing to do for those who care about our Nation's  veterans. I wholeheartedly support this bill, and I urge my colleagues  to vote for its passage. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Before I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), I would like to  rebut some of the points that the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost),  my good friend, has made.   I believe that the gentleman from Illinois is misreading the law.  H.R. 1948 will not allow the types of impacts that he has described.  H.R. 1948 amends section 7422 of title 38. This is true. However, it is  title 5 statutes overall that define the scope of collective bargaining  for Federal workers.    Most importantly, title 5 states that collective bargaining does not  include policies, practices, and matters ``to the extent that such  matters are specifically provided by Federal statute.''   There are many laws which define the scope of collective bargaining.  For example, if H.R. 1948 were enacted, title 38 section 7464 of the  United States Code is still on the books. This law controls  disciplinary appeals boards. I remind my colleagues that H.R. 1948  would only allow unions to grieve items under its contract with the  department, and if it is not in the contract, a grievance cannot occur.   Furthermore, my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Bost) has made the  assertion that doctors and nurses don't have collective bargaining  rights outside of VA, or he pointed out a specific example of the Mayo  Clinic. There are many, many wonderful, great, effective medical  organizations that do have employee unions as part of their workforce,  and so what he is stating is simply not true.   Hundreds of thousands of registered nurses and advanced practice  registered nurses, including nurse practitioners, are represented by  labor unions and have full collective bargaining rights. Full  collective bargaining rights. We are not talking about full collective  bargaining rights in this particular instance of H.R. 1948.   There are whole unions for physicians and dentists that have existed  for more than 50 years, and this includes many hospitals in New York  and California. At UC San Francisco, over 5,000 nurses are represented  by National Nurses United, and doctors are represented by Committee of  Interns and Residents, which is part of SEIU.                                time  1045    Furthermore, DOD healthcare clinicians have collective bargaining  rights, including nurses and physicians.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Green), my good friend and cosponsor of H.R. 1948, a member of the  Committee on Financial Services, chairman of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations. He also serves on the Homeland Security  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I would remind my colleague from the State  of Illinois that this bill more than adequately went through regular  order.   We held a legislative hearing in April of 2021. The bill has garnered  218 cosponsors of our colleagues, each of whom has presumably reviewed  the bill before they joined as cosponsors. We put the bill through a  regular markup, and I have been in regular consultation with the  Secretary of the VA about this bill. And most recently, the White House  has issued a Statement of Administration Policy in support of the bill.   So to say that this bill is being rammed through at the 11th hour is  patently untrue and not accurate.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Higgins), my good friend and cosponsor of this bill. He serves on the  Budget Committee and is a member of the House Committee on Ways and  Means.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, I just remind the gentleman from Illinois that I did  cite an egregious example of the VA ignoring the conclusions of an  arbitrator in a patently unfair way.   Giving our title 38 employees the right to organize and the right to  be represented by unions in such cases where a very legitimate  grievance arises, I think is a basic principle of fairness, in  fairness.   Let us think about what our veterans sacrificed. Let us think about  what they put the uniform of their country on to fight for. They fought  for our freedoms. They fought for our rights. They fought for basic  fairness.   I have often said on this floor, that supporting our veterans is  neither about being red or blue, but red, white, and blue. And I say to  you that it is red, white, and blue to support the very principles that  our veterans fought for. They fought for fairness. They fought for  dignity. If you look at authoritarian countries around the world, they  not only close the churches down, they not only close civil society  down, but they close down real, independent unions, as well.   So if we are faithful to the principles of our Republic, we will  stand up not only for religious institutions, not only for civil  society, not only for your right and my right to say what is on our  mind, but we will also fight for the right and defend the right of  employees to organize and to unionize.   In this case, it is a very limited circumscribed form of collective  bargaining, far more circumscribed than the very union that my  colleague, who is a firefighter, I am willing to bet that his union had  a far more robust ability to exercise collective bargaining than the  very employees that we are trying to empower today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1948, and I stand  squarely behind it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
