 Madam Speaker, I rise today to declare that our calls  for gun violence prevention will not stop until we see real action to  keep our kids and communities safe from senseless shootings plaguing  our Nation.   Madam Speaker, ten years ago, after Sandy Hook, grieving parents came  to this place and called for urgent action.   Five years ago this Friday, student survivors of the shooting at  Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School led millions of fellow students  in the first March for Our Lives calling for urgent action.   Yet still here we are, after Pulse, after Las Vegas, Buffalo, Uvalde,  Highland Park, Monterey Park, and literally countless other shootings  and so many beautiful lives cut short.   This morning, my sister texted me, ``two teachers shot'' at the  Denver school my niece and nephews attend. It was their second shooting  this year, in addition to four other lockdowns.   Enough is enough. Together with March for Our Lives, Moms Demand  Action, Everytown, Sandy Hook Promise, Giffords, and every other  concerned American, we will not stop our calls for action until our  families feel safe in our schools, in our pews, at our stores, at our  Fourth of July parades.                            ____________________
