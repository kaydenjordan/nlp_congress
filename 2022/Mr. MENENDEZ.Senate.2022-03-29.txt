 Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for  the nomination of Dr. Eliot Kang to be Assistant Secretary of State for  International Security and Non-Proliferation, ISN.   At a time of increasing concern about the potential use of chemical  or biological weapons in Ukraine by Russia, it is vital the United  States have a Senate-confirmed official in place to counter these  dangers, as well as other nuclear threats. ISN leads the State  Department's efforts to halt the spread of weapons of mass  destruction--nuclear, chemical, and biological--as well as the means to  deliver them. We need a Senate-confirmed expert at the helm to  coordinate prevention and response with the Ukrainian Government, our  allies, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.   Dr. Kang is eminently qualified to do just that. He has the  substantive expertise to lead ISN and advance U.S. national security  interests. During his 18-year career at the State Department, Dr. Kang  has worked on a wide variety of nonproliferation issues. This includes  the denuclearization of North Korea, international efforts to halt the  spread of chemical weapons, and nuclear safety. He has held senior  positions in ISN, where he currently serves as Acting Assistant  Secretary, and served as the Department's most senior official for Arms  Control and International Security.   But because of Republican delays he has not yet been confirmed,  despite the fact that he was first nominated 341 days ago. Think about  that--that was nearly a year ago--and he has not yet been confirmed.   The delays and obstacles facing nominees on the Senate floor and in  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are hampering our national  security. Each day that goes by without critical national security  posts being filled does a disserving to our country and our national  security interests. Dr. Kang could have and should have been confirmed  long ago.   I strongly support confirming Dr. Kang, and I respectfully urge my  colleagues to join me in advancing his nomination, along with all of  the foreign affairs nominations pending before this body.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       To the Secretary of the Senate:        PN1028, Mr. Leopoldo Martinez Nucete, of Virginia, to be       United States Executive Director of the Inter-American       Development Bank for a term of three years, having been       referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations, the       Committee, with a quorum present, has voted on the nomination       as follows--        (1.) on the question of reporting the nomination favorably       with the recommendation that the nomination be confirmed, 11       ayes to 11 noes; and        (2.) In accordance with section 3, paragraph (1)(A) of S.       Res. 27 of the 117th Congress, I hereby give notice that the       Committee has not reported the nomination because of a tie       vote, and ask that this notice be printed in the Record       pursuant to the resolution.                            ____________________
