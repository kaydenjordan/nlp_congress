 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly support  your bill to protect older Americans against discrimination.   It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, but age discrimination and ageism are  still very common in many American workplaces.   During the worst of this pandemic, older workers and women  experienced many of the demotions and layoffs that we have heard about  so much.   Protections against age discrimination are more important than ever  as we seek to ensure that employers do not use someone's age as a  motivating factor to deny them a promotion, to demote them, or to even  fire them.   When age discrimination occurs, many people do not report it. But  when they do, under current law, it is incredibly difficult to prove  that age was the motivating factor.   Therefore, Congress must ensure that we do not place burdensome  requirements of proof of age discrimination on those who actually bring  age discrimination claims to the forefront.   That is why this bill is so very, very important, and I thank the  chairman for his tireless efforts on this cause.   While this is an excellent bill, there is one provision I wish we had  included that currently is not. In the fight against age  discrimination, we need to clearly protect folks at the very first  opportunity, the hiring process.   That is why I introduced a bill last week, the Protect Older Job  Applicants Act. It simply clarifies that the provisions under the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act also apply to job applicants. Most  people already assume this is the case. However, it is not.   After two recent Federal court cases about age discrimination, there  has been confusion about the applicability of protections to applicants  or employees only.   My bill seeks to provide clarity and ultimately protect older  Americans from the very beginning, at the application.   I know that this is a priority for the chairman also, and I will  continue to work with him to make sure that we continue the  conversation on this shared priority, because nobody should be denied a  job opportunity solely because of their age.    Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a  statement of support for this bill from AARP.                                                           AARP,                                                      June 14, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our nearly 38 million       members and all older Americans nationwide, AARP urges you to       vote in support of H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Workers       Against Discrimination Act (POWADA), important bipartisan       legislation sponsored by Chairman Scott and Rep. Rodney Davis       (R-IL) to restore protections against age discrimination.        Older workers are valuable assets to their employers and       the economy. Despite that, 78 percent of older workers       reported having seen or experienced age discrimination in the       workplace in 2020, up markedly from 61 percent in 2018. More       than half of older workers are forced out of a job before       they intend to retire. Nine out of 10 of those who do find       work never again match their prior earnings. Making matters       worse, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly diminished the       job prospects and future retirement security of older       workers. In April, over half of job seekers ages 55 and older       continued to be long-term unemployed (53.3 percent) compared       with 42.3 percent of job seekers ages 16 to 54. The labor       force participation rates for older women workers, along with       their earning power and future retirement security, have been       particularly hard-hit by COVID.        POWADA is a bipartisan, commonsense bill that would restore       fairness for older workers. The bill reinstates well-      established legal standards on workplace discrimination that       were undermined by the 2009 Supreme Court decision in Gross       v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. and subsequent discrimination       cases. POWADA would help level the playing field for older       workers and restore their legal rights. Older Americans have       waited for over a decade for this legislation to be enacted.        AARP strongly supports POWADA and urges you to enact it as       soon as possible.

Sincerely,                                                   Bill Sweeney,                                              Senior Vice President,                                                Government Affairs.
