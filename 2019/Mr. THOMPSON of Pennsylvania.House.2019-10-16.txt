 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an  issue that is incredibly important to me as a senior member of the  House Agriculture Committee.   My vision for the future of rural America includes rebuilding the  communities that provide much of our food, fiber, and energy, and to  provide support for a robust rural economy. Of course, this is  virtually impossible without reliable, high-speed, 5G broadband  connectivity.   In the late 1800s, Thomas Edison created the first practical  incandescent lightbulb. By 1925, half of all homes in the United States  had electricity. Today, we take electricity for granted. We don't think  twice when we flip a switch.   As we continue to experience today's modern technical revolution, it  is my goal to see 5G broadband just as commonplace. Twenty-four million  Americans still do not have access to broadband, and the vast majority  of these people live in rural areas.   A 2017 study by the United States Department of Agriculture  discovered that 29 percent of American farmers did not have reliable  internet access, despite the fact that agriculture is all about  technology today. Without reliable broadband access, we are leaving  money on the table, and the American economy is failing to meet its  fullest potential.    Connectivity and competition go hand in hand, and we can continue to  invest in rural communities with 5G. Agriculture, healthcare, energy,  education, and so many other industries demand this level of service.   In 2018, we ushered in a new farm bill that underscored the  importance of broadband in rural America. Under broadband guaranteed  lending programs, larger rural communities are permitted to build  infrastructure for telecommunication networks.   The farm bill also supports broadband development where it is most  needed by prioritizing funds to rural communities that are at least 90  percent unserved.   We can also encourage innovation on this front through opportunity  zones. Established by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Mr. Speaker,  opportunity zones incentivize long-term investments--private-sector  investments--in rural, underserved, or economically distressed areas  across the Nation through public-private partnerships.   In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, there are 300 opportunity  zones--there are 18 congressional districts--and I am proud that 31 of  these are in my district.   To tackle broadband development head-on, the FCC has introduced the  idea of gigabit opportunity zones, and the proposal has a promising  future ahead of it. Gigabit opportunity zones are designed specifically  to address underserved areas by incentivizing State and local  governments to foster connectivity, ultimately streamlining  regulations, supporting job creators, and strengthening our  neighborhoods.   Mr. Speaker, with continued investment in 5G broadband development,  the future of rural America looks bright.                            ____________________
