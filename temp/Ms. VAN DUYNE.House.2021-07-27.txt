 Madam Speaker, I wish I could say I was rising in  support of this legislation but, again, we are being asked to vote on a  bill that represents a missed opportunity on the backs of our  constituents.   I am pleased I was able to secure needed improvement for DFW Airport  in the appropriations legislation. These projects would not only  improve my district but the whole region.   I have held roundtables and formed a working group with local leaders  and stakeholders who know what is best for my community and what I  heard from them and fought to include in legislation funding our  government is, sadly, not what we are debating today.   Instead of working to craft bipartisan legislation which Members on  both sides of the aisle can support, the Senate can pass, and the  President can sign into law, we are, instead, debating monstrous  appropriations bills that are based on unrealistic, irresponsible  funding levels and include partisan policy provisions that will only  delay funding and passage.   These political games only serve to impede badly needed  infrastructure projects. No, the Democrats didn't shut down the  government, they just tried to shut down the rest of the country. I  would love to be able to work on legislation that we can work on  together that will actually advance what we are trying to do in this  country. I urge opposition to this rule.
