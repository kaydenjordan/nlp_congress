 Madam Speaker, for the past 2 years, the  American people have been led by a President that has failed to bring  accountability to the executive branch.   This weekend, the House Energy and Commerce Committee uncovered the  embarrassing and disastrous fact that HHS Secretary Becerra failed to  lawfully reappoint key NIH officials before their terms expired.   This failure to reappoint the above NIH directors jeopardizes the  legal validity of more than $25 billion in Federal biomedical research  grants made in 2022 alone. This is yet another example of the Biden  administration's reckless decisionmaking.   Our Republican Commitment to America means creating a government that  is accountable. Since January, House Republicans have fought to expose  the wrongdoing by President Biden and those that he appointed.   It is time to put a stop to the reckless actions that the Biden  administration continues to pursue that has led to 74 percent of  Americans believing that our Nation is on the wrong track.   Madam Speaker, it is time to demand accountability from the  President. It is time, once again, to have a Federal Government that is  worthy, worthy of the American people.    Celebrating 285 Years of Worship at Presbyterian Church of Upper West                               Conococheague     Madam Speaker, this year marks 285 years  of worship at the Presbyterian Church of Upper West Conococheague,  located in Franklin County, Pennsylvania.   Founded in 1738, the Presbyterian Church has been in its current  location since 1794, during President George Washington's second term  as President.   Since that time, the church has grown into a pillar and a major part  of the community that it serves, working tirelessly among so many local  charities and missions. These works include Bountiful Blessings,  Operation Christmas Child, and the Giving Tree, a program the  Presbyterian Church launched in order to ensure that every school  student in local schools has the clothing and the resources that they  need to be fulfilled and successful in their education.   This great Nation was born on the fundamental belief that no  government and no king can tell us what to believe or how to worship.  For the past 285 years, Presbyterian Church of Upper West Conococheague  has stood as a testament to that principle.   On behalf of everyone in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District,  I congratulate them on reaching such a significant milestone and wish  Presbyterian Church and their congregation every continued success.                            ____________________
