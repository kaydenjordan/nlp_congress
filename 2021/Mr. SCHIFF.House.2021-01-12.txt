 Mr. Speaker, 6 days ago, I was standing right here,  fulfilling my constitutional duties to certify the election. And, 6  days ago, Donald Trump was on the Mall, whipping a  [[Page H143]]  mob into a frenzy with false claims of stolen elections and  unconstitutional schemes. It was a big lie, the same big lie he had  been telling for weeks.   He told the mob, ``We are going to the Capitol'' and ``to fight like  hell,'' and they did. Five died. Many more were hurt. And we were  seconds away from something much worse.   My colleagues, upholding our oath, the Constitution, and our  democracy means recognizing that every second that Donald Trump is  President the Nation is at risk. We have the power to do something  about it. Mike Pence must do his duty, invoke the 25th. If he won't, we  will move with urgency to do ours and impeach Donald Trump again.
