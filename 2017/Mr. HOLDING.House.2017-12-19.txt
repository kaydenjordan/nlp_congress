 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here today to support this  much-needed overhaul of our broken Tax Code. The status quo we have  seen over the past decade is unacceptable, and this bill will finally  provide much-needed relief to working families and put our economy back  on the path to stable and sustained growth.   This bill restores the global competitiveness of American businesses  by lowering the corporate rate and moving toward a territorial system.  Further, H.R. 1 provides our small businesses the lowest tax rate in a  generation, ensuring that these job creators are able to reinvest more  of their hard-earned money in our future.   Instead of handing over more of their money to the government, small  businesses can hire that extra employee, open that second location, or  buy that new piece of machinery or lab equipment that they need to take  them to the next level by putting in place a Tax Code that encourages  growth and rewards investment. It is projected there will be over  10,000 new full-time jobs created in my State of North Carolina.   I am proud to support this transformational bill that will bolster  growth and investment here at home, leveling the playing field for U.S.  businesses.   Further, I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to  ensure that Americans across the globe have a similar level playing  field through a system of residence-based taxation.
