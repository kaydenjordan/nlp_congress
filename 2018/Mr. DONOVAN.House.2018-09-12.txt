Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security was created in  response to the September 11th terrorist attacks and the threats to the  homeland posed by al-Qaida and other terrorist groups.   As we pause this week to honor those we lost and the heroic first  responders who answered the call that day, we recognize that the scope  of the threat we face has changed dramatically since that time and has  become much more diverse and diffuse.   We know that the terrorist groups have long strived to employ  chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials in their  attacks. There have been documented reports of ISIS using mustard gas  in Syria, as well as sarin and chlorine gas used by the Syrian  Government.   A plot to release hydrogen sulfide via an improvised chemical  dispersion device was uncovered by the Australian Federal Police. A  laptop, reportedly retrieved from an ISIS hideout in Syria in 2014,  contained plans for bubonic plague and a document that discussed the  advantages of using biological weapons.   The rapid evolution of new biological techniques, such as CRISPR  CAS9, posed potential threats as the new techniques can be used for  good or evil.   As the world of threats continues to evolve and becomes more complex,  it is incumbent upon the Department of Homeland Security to  continuously assess whether or not it is optimally organized to best  confront the variety of threats it is expected to counter.   Last year, former Acting Secretary Elaine Duke determined that the  Department was, in fact, not organized to best address these threats.  As a result, on October 6, she notified the committee of her intent to  use her 872 reorganization authority to establish a Countering Weapons  of Mass Destruction, or CWMD, Office, headed by an Assistant Secretary  for CWMD. This reorganization took effect last December.   However, the Secretary realized that the use of her 872 authority  would only take her so far, and legislative changes are necessary to  fully integrate the CWMD Office.   The bill we are considering today will take the Department the rest  of the way in developing an integrated, effective organization to  counter CBRN threats. The bill seeks to ensure that the Department of  Homeland Security has the structure, authority, and tools it needs to  counter the threat of weapons of mass destruction.   It consolidates the Office of Health Affairs and the Domestic Nuclear  Detection Office into a new Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction  Office to ensure coordination and unity of effort at the Department of  Homeland Security on these threats.   Current DHS Secretary Nielsen has indicated that this bill is one of  her top legislative priorities, noting that it will: ``Provide DHS  crucial, legal authorities to protect the homeland . . . and enable DHS  to more quickly obtain, test, and deploy effective counter-WMD tactics  and technologies.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Secretary Nielsen  in support of this bill.   [[Page H8116]]                                   Department of Homeland Security,                                    Washington, DC, August 30, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: Thank you for your leadership addressing       threats to the homeland and strengthening the Department of       Homeland Security's (DHS) ability to carry out its mission. I       would like to highlight the work being done in Congress to       close identified security gaps and better guard against the       persistent and evolving threat from weapons of mass       destruction (WMD).        As we saw with the Russian chemical weapon incidents in the       United Kingdom, nation-states are using these capabilities       for lethal attacks against civilians. At the same time,       terrorist groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria       (ISIS) are developing and deploying their own WMD       capabilities to use on the battlefield and in external       operations in the West. Unfortunately, the U.S. Government--      including the Department of Homeland Security--lacks the       central focal point and authorities needed to decisively       combat these dangers and adequately defend the U.S. homeland.        That is why I am seeking your assistance in authorizing the       DHS Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office.       This is one of my top legislative priorities for DHS, in       addition to authorizing DHS to counter the threat posed by       the nefarious use of unmanned aircraft systems and       authorization of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure       Security Agency, as well as DHS itself. The CWMD legislation       sponsored by Representative Donovan (R-NY) and cosponsored by       Chairman McCaul (R-TX), H.R. 6198, the Countering Weapons of       Mass Destruction Act of 2018, represents a critical step       towards enabling the Department to mitigate WMD threats.        I strongly support this bill's movement under suspension of       the rules at the earliest possible opportunity. Once enacted,       the legislation will permanently establish the CWMD Office as       the nucleus of DHS efforts to guard the homeland against       chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, and       it will provide DHS crucial legal authorities to protect the       homeland. DHS currently has broad authorities related to the       radiological and nuclear detection mission space, but the       lack of similar authorities for chemical and biological       missions constrains our ability to address threats       comprehensively. This legislation would address that       disparity and will enable DHS to more quickly obtain, test,       and deploy effective counter-WMD tactics and technologies.        Similar bill language has been reported out of the Senate       Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee as part       of the DHS Authorization bill, H.R. 2825, so I am hopeful       that near-term House passage will bring this legislation       closer to reaching the President's desk. Thank you again for       your attention to this important matter, and for your       continued support of the men and women at DHS, who are       committed to protecting this Nation.            Best Regards,                                               Kirstjen M. Nielsen,                                                         Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, the bill we are considering today is  similar in intent to the Department of Homeland Security CBRNE Defense  Act, which passed the House by voice last Congress. Similar legislation  was approved by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs earlier this year, and I am hopeful we will work  together to swiftly get this important bill to the President for his  signature.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Walden of the Energy and  Commerce Committee for working with me to bring this bill to the floor.  I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6198, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, September 10, 2018.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I am writing to notify you that the       Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo action on H.R.       6198 so that it may proceed to the House floor for       consideration. This is done with the understanding that the       Committee's jurisdictional interests over this and similar       legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In addition,       the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees on the       bill and expects your support when such a request is made.        Please include a copy of this letter outlining our mutual       understanding with respect to H.R. 6198 in the Congressional       Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                 Washington, DC, September 11, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 6198, the ``Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act       of 2018.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this       legislation before the House of Representatives, and       accordingly, understand that the Committee on Energy and       Commerce will forego further consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of this bill at       this time, the Committee on Energy and Commerce does not       waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition,       should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would       support your request to have the Committee represented on the       conference committee.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the distinguished chairman of the  Committee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 6198, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sponsor the RAWR Act, Rescuing Animals  With Rewards, H.R. 6197.   The RAWR Act will help ensure that taking down terrorists and  transnational criminal organizations engaged in wildlife trafficking  and poaching will be a top Rewards priority.   Combating terrorism is of the utmost importance, not just to my  constituents, not just to New Yorkers, but to the entire Nation. It is  an issue that transcends party lines.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from the  Wildlife Conservation Society and a letter of  [[Page H8156]]  support and endorsement from the Humane Society of the United States,  the Humane Society Legislative Fund, and Humane Society International.                                  Wildlife Conservation Society,                                      Bronx, NY, September 12, 2018.      Hon. Daniel M. Donovan, Jr.,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Donovan: The Wildlife Conservation Society       writes to express our support for H.R. 6197, the RAWR Act, as       a way to help crack down on the destabilizing criminal       trafficking that threatens both wildlife and U.S. economic       and security interests.        The RAWR Act would allow the U.S. Department of State to       add wildlife trafficking, as defined by the END Wildlife       Trafficking Act, to the list of transnational criminal       activities for which it may provide monetary rewards to       informants and tipsters. As the founders of the 96 Elephants       campaign, dedicated to stopping the killing, trafficking and       demand for illegal wildlife, we would applaud this change.        Wildlife trafficking is a serious national security issue.       The transnational organized criminal groups that profit from       illegal wildlife products are the same ones trafficking in       weapons, narcotics and people. This activity destabilizes       regions important for U.S. economic interests and undermines       the good governance and the rule of law.        Targeting wildlife trafficking is essential if we want       future generations to live in a world that is still home to       our most iconic animals. The demand for ivory, rhino horn,       tiger skins, and other products is causing those endangered       species and many others to rapidly diminish.        WCS works globally to disrupt wildlife trafficking networks       and the criminals that run them, creating and sharing       intelligence products with government enforcement agencies,       and improving communications at the national and       international scale to implement proactive enforcement       activities. The passage of the RAWR Act would add an       effective new tactic to the efforts to stop wildlife       trafficking.        We appreciate all your work on international conservation       issues, from taking part in last year's ivory crush in New       York's Central Park to leading on the push for U.S.       government investments in global anti-trafficking programs,       which has been of invaluable assistance in securing the       world's endangered wildlife.                                   ____                                                 September 11, 2018.      Hon. Dan Donovan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Donovan: We are pleased to offer the       support and endorsement of The Humane Society of the United       States, Humane Society Legislative Fund, and Humane Society       International for the Rescuing Animals With Rewards (RAWR)       Act of 2018, H.R. 6197.        Wildlife trafficking is one of the biggest global threats       to wild animals and one of the most lucrative illicit trades       in the world, generating more than $10 billion a year. It is       a main culprit in the declines of countless species, from       elephants and tigers to pangolins. The underground revenues       of the trade also threaten the rule of law by fueling       international organized crime and terrorism.        The RAWR Act takes a positive step against wildlife       trafficking by building on the success of the Eliminate,       Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016       (P.L. 114-231), authorizing the U.S. Department of State to       use its successful rewards program to target wildlife       traffickers globally and to combat international crime       networks, including known terrorist organizations.        We commend you and Representative Castro for introducing       this bill, and we urge all Members of the U.S. House of       Representatives to support it.            Sincerely,      Kitty Block,        Acting President & CEO, The Humane Society of the United       States.      Sara Amundson,        President, Humane Society Legislative Fund.      Teresa M. Telecky, Ph.D.,        Vice President, Wildlife Humane Society International.     Mr. Speaker, yesterday was the 17th anniversary of  September 11. It was a stark reminder of the danger terrorism poses to  the Nation every single day.   The district I represent, Staten Island and South Brooklyn, which is  home to many of New York's bravest and finest, suffered hundreds of  casualties on September 11. Since then, New York remains the world's  number one target for terrorism.   As a nation, we have become a more resilient and determined nation to  mitigate threats against us; but as we have choked off other resources  of money, terrorists have increasingly turned to wildlife trafficking  as a way to fund their heinous endeavors. Any step that we can take  that will lead to the capture and conviction of anyone engaged in  wildlife trafficking, especially terrorists, is a step in the right  direction.   Reports indicate that crimes related to illegal wildlife trafficking  generate billions of dollars a year. These illicit funds turn into  terrorist financing, fuel instability, and help arm groups in Africa.   The prices that wildlife traffickers can fetch for hunting and  ruthlessly killing animals are staggering. Conservation groups estimate  that a kilogram of raw ivory can be worth as much as $2,100, while a  kilogram of rhino horn can be worth $65,000.   I am confident that the Foreign Affairs Committee and the House of  Representatives will continue to fight against this problem.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my chairman, Chairman Royce, for his  support on this bill and the ranking member and my colleague from New  York, Eliot Engel. I thank my friend, Congressman Castro, for co- leading with me, and I thank the House leadership for bringing this  bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the staff of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, especially Meg Gallagher and Sean O'Neill, who put  much work into this act.
