 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1695.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Woodall). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 275 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1695.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) to preside  over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1356                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 1695) to amend title 17, United States Code, to provide  additional responsibilities for the Register of Copyrights, and for  other purposes, with Mr. Simpson in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Conyers) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Intellectual property is a critical and growing part of our Nation's  economy, and the Register of Copyrights has a crucial role in the  numerous copyright policy issues that impact it.   Four years ago, the Judiciary Committee began considering how to  modernize our Nation's copyright laws, including how the Copyright  Office is structured. Making the Register position subject to the  nomination and consent process with potential candidates identified by  a congressional selection panel was among the many issues considered by  the House Judiciary Committee.   Because the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office, who has an  equally important voice on patent and trademark issues, is already  subject to the nomination and consent process, it provided a precedent  for this approach.   However, unlike the Patent and Trademark Office, the Copyright Office  is part of the legislative branch. Thus, it is appropriate to also  follow the precedent set for other legislative branch agencies, which  gives Congress a greater say in selecting candidates for the heads of  legislative branch entities to ensure those agencies are more  accountable to Congress.   Because the Register position is now vacant, filled on an acting  capacity by a well-regarded Acting Register, Ranking Member Conyers and  I introduced this bipartisan legislation to update the Register  selection process. To mirror a recent change to the Librarian of  Congress position that is now subject to a 10-year term limit, the  legislation also makes the Register of Copyrights position subject to a  10-year term limit.   The selection panel would be bipartisan and would consist of leaders  of the majorities and minorities of the House and Senate, and would  also include the Librarian of Congress.   In the past, the authority of the Register of Copyrights to issue  rulemakings has not been challenged in the courts because the Register  is not subject to the nomination and consent process.                                time  1400    This legislation would remedy that question, once and for all. H.R.  1695 was reported by the House Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan vote  of 27-1. In addition to strong support from traditional copyright  groups, such as the Copyright Alliance, and the publishing, movie,  music, and software industries, the bill has been supported by a wide  range of diverse groups, such as the American Conservative Union; the  AFL-CIO; Heritage Foundation scholars; the Directors Guild of America;  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; MANA, A National Latina Organization;  Americans for Tax Reform; and the Council for Citizens Against  Government Waste.   With such strong support from a wide range of over 70 groups and a  vacancy at the Register of Copyrights that needs to be quickly filled  under the new process created by this legislation, I urge my colleagues  to support H.R. 1695.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: I write to you concerning the       jurisdictional interest of the Committee on House       Administration in H.R. 1695, the Register of Copyrights       Selection and Accountability Act of 2017. The bill, as       reported from the Committee on the Judiciary on March 29,       2017, contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction       of the Committee on House Administration.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House of Representatives in an       expeditious manner, and accordingly, I will waive Committee       consideration of provisions that fall within the Committee's       jurisdiction. However, agreeing to waive jurisdiction over       these provisions should not be construed as waiving,       reducing, or affecting the jurisdiction of the Committee on       House Administration.        Additionally, the Committee on House Administration       expressly reserves its authority to seek conferees on any       provision within its jurisdiction during any House-Senate       conference that may be convened on this, or any similar       legislation. I ask for your commitment to support any request       by the Committee for conferees on H.R. 1695 for provisions       within the Committee's jurisdiction.        I ask a copy of this letter and your response be placed in       the Congressional Record during any floor consideration of       H.R. 1695.        I look forward to working with you on matters of mutual       concern.            Sincerely,                                                      Gregg Harper,                                                          Chairman.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, April 20, 2017.      Hon. Gregg Harper,      Chairman, Committee on House Administration,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Harper: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1695, the ``Register of       Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act,'' so that the       bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 1695 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no speakers remaining, and I am  prepared to close when Ranking Member Conyers concludes.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I thank Ranking Member Conyers and many other Members across the  aisle, as well as the subcommittee chair and the subcommittee vice  chair of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual  Property, and the Internet--Mr. Issa and Mr. Collins--for their hard  work in support of this legislation, which is urgently needed. It is  very straightforward. It has very broad bipartisan support here in the  House.   It is also strongly supported in a bipartisan fashion in the Senate.  A wide array of outside organizations--virtually every copyright  organization in the country--as well as a number of other organizations  concerned about the importance of intellectual property protection and  particularly copyright law want to see the status of the Register of  Copyrights elevated by Presidential appointment with input from six  leaders in the House and the Senate and the Librarian of Congress to  select the next Register of Copyrights and have a 10-year term, which  is compatible with terms of other important legislative branch  positions.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, but I do not oppose the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Virginia is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of the  amendment offered by Mr. Deutch. Mr. Deutch has been a strong supporter  of intellectual property as well as the modernization of the Copyright  Office during the House Judiciary Committee's copyright review.                                time  1445    The needs of a modern copyright registration system require advanced  information technology systems, so it is critical that all future  Registers have a strong base of information technology knowledge within  the Office to lead such efforts. By requiring all future Registers to  have the skills necessary to identify and hire a chief information  officer or other similar official to lead such efforts within the  Office, the Deutch amendment ensures a strong Copyright Office. I want  to thank the gentleman for making this important contribution to the  legislation.   I neglected to mention earlier--I don't see him here now--but I also  want to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Nadler), for the important contributions he has made  to this legislation as well.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will  be postponed.            Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Judy Chu of California    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in House Report 115-95.   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of the bill, add the following new section:       SEC. 3. CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act may be construed to impact the       mandatory deposit requirements in title 17, United States       Code.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 275, the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Judy Chu) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of  H.R. 1695 and the amendment that I offer. This is a simple amendment  that specifies that the mandatory deposit requirement of the Library of  Congress will not be affected in any way by the underlying bill.   Currently, applicants for copyright registration are required to  submit two deposit copies to the Copyright Office. After the Office  reviews the material to determine whether it qualifies for copyright  protection, it makes the copies available for the Library for its use  in its permanent collection.   In fact, that is a large reason that the Copyright Office is located  in the Library of Congress to begin with. In 1870, Librarian Ainsworth  Rand Spofford convinced Congress that placing the Copyright Office in  the Library would help build its collection through deposits of  registered works, which it has done successfully.   In the digital age, many argue that the mandatory deposit requirement  should be modified in some way to better balance the needs of creators  and the Library. My amendment states that H.R. 1695 may not be  construed to impact the mandatory deposit requirement, and it makes  clear that this issue is for another day. Passing this amendment will  allow us to focus instead on the many benefits in turning the Register  into a Presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed position.   The underlying bill is a result of more than 3 years of hearings,  listening tours, and dozens of conversations with a wide range of  stakeholders. The Judiciary Committee Members, led by Chairman  Goodlatte and Ranking Member John Conyers, all sat through hours of  hearings, and even traveled to different cities around the country to  hear from all of our stakeholders who are impacted by our copyright  policies.   As the Judiciary Committee finished its thorough review of the  Copyright Act, there was broad consensus that the Copyright Office  should be modernized and restructured so that it is more accountable to  Congress and to the public.   This is why I, along with Congressman Tom Marino, introduced a  bipartisan bill to carry out these changes. Our bill, the Copyright  Office for the Digital Economy Act, the CODE Act, would also put in  place a system similar to the one in H.R. 1695 to elevate the Register.  We introduced this bill 2 years ago, before the new Librarian was sworn  in and when President Obama was still in office. This has been a  bipartisan issue grounded on sound policy considerations.   I believe the changes proposed in H.R. 1695 will help improve the  functionality of the Copyright Office, which members of the public rely  on to protect their works or properly use copyrighted works. The core  copyright industries are now responsible for $1.2 trillion of our GDP,  which represents 7 percent of the economy. These industries also employ  5.5 million people.   We need to make sure the Copyright Office can modernize to meet the  demands of the growing industries in our country, and its leadership  that is accountable to Congress, which will help it move toward that  direction. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and the  underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, but I do not oppose the amendment.  [[Page H2876]]    The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Virginia is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment  offered by Ms. Judy Chu. She has been a strong advocate for the  protection of intellectual property as well as the modernization of the  Copyright Office during the House Judiciary Committee's copyright  review, and we miss her on the committee.   One of the issues that has been raised while we have discussed  updates to our Nation's copyright laws is the importance of preserving  our mandatory deposit system. The mandatory deposit system that exists  in our Nation's copyright law has resulted in numerous copyrighted  works being added to the collections of the Library of Congress at no  charge to taxpayers. Without the mandatory deposit system, the  Library's collections would be vastly smaller, without a significant  increase in taxpayer funding in order to buy these copyrighted works  that are now provided free to the Library.   Ms. Judy Chu's amendment ensures that this system is not disrupted as  the Register position is made subject to the nomination and consent  process, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the ranking  member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 5- minute vote on passage of the bill will be followed by a 5-minute vote  on the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.
