 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2638) to amend title 49, United States Code, to require small  hub airports to construct areas for nursing mothers, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2638         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Friendly Airports for       Mothers Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. MOTHERS' ROOMS.         Section 47107(w) of title 49, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (1) by striking ``In fiscal year 2021''       and all that follows through ``the Secretary of       Transportation'' and inserting ``The Secretary of       Transportation'';        (2) in paragraph (1)(B) by striking ``one men's and one       women's'' and inserting ``at least one men's and at least one       women's'';        (3) by striking paragraph (2)(A) and inserting the       following:        ``(A) Airport size.--        ``(i) In general.--The requirements in paragraph (1) shall       only apply to applications submitted by the airport sponsor       of--         ``(I) a medium or large hub airport in fiscal year 2021 and       each fiscal year thereafter; and        ``(II) an applicable small hub airport in fiscal year 2023       and each fiscal year thereafter.         ``(ii) Applicable small hub airport defined.--In clause       (i)(II), the term `applicable small hub airport' means an       airport designated as a small hub airport during--         ``(I) the 3-year period consisting of 2020, 2021, and 2022;       or        ``(II) any consecutive 3-year period beginning after       2020.'';         (4) in paragraph (2)(B) by striking ``the date of enactment       of this Act complies with the requirement in paragraph (1)''       and inserting ``October 5, 2018, complies with the       requirement in paragraph (1)(A)''; and        (5) in paragraph (2)(C) by striking ``paragraph (1)'' and       inserting ``paragraph (1)(A)''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 2638.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in support of S. 2638, the Friendly Airports for Mothers  Improvement Act.   Introduced in the Senate by Senator Tammy Duckworth from Illinois,  this is a commonsense bill that requires small hub airports to maintain  lactation areas for nursing mothers and a baby-changing table in men's  and women's restrooms.   As a result of this legislation, small hub airports will begin to  come in line with the medium and large hub airports, which were charged  with meeting the same requirements as the result of the FAA  Reauthorization Act of 2018.   Similar legislation was introduced in the House by Representative  Carol Miller and passed in this Chamber December 2019.   I want to thank both Senator Duckworth and Representative Miller for  their leadership on this issue and urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of S. 2638.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, affording women lactation stations is something that I  was very proud to have done, as we are now doing with small airports.  We did it for all county facilities in county government when I was a  county supervisor.   I am really glad to see this bipartisan bill is moving forward. Mr.  Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4075) to amend the Public Works and Economic Development Act  of 1965 to provide for the release of certain Federal interests in  connection with certain grants under that Act, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4075         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Reinvigorating Lending for       the Future Act'' or the ``RLF Act''.  [[Page H5190]]            SEC. 2. RELEASE OF CERTAIN INTERESTS.         Section 601(d)(2) of the Public Works and Economic       Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3211(d)(2)) is amended--        (1) by striking the paragraph designation and heading and       all that follows through ``The Secretary may'' and inserting       the following:        ``(2) Release.--        ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B),       the Secretary may''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(B) Certain releases.--        ``(i) In general.--On written request from a recipient of a       grant under section 209(d), the Secretary shall release, in       accordance with this subparagraph, any Federal interest in       connection with the grant, if--         ``(I) the request is made not less than 7 years after the       final disbursement of the original grant;        ``(II) the recipient has complied with the terms and       conditions of the grant to the satisfaction of the Secretary;        ``(III) any proceeds realized from the grant will be used       for 1 or more activities that continue to carry out the       economic development purposes of this Act; and        ``(IV) the recipient includes in the written request a       description of how the recipient will use the proceeds of the       grant in accordance with subclause (III).         ``(ii) Deadline.--         ``(I) In general.--Except as provided in subclause (II),       the Secretary shall complete all closeout actions for the       grant by not later than 180 days after receipt and acceptance       of the written request under clause (i).        ``(II) Extension.--The Secretary may extend a deadline       under subclause (I) by an additional 180 days if the       Secretary determines the extension to be necessary.         ``(iii) Savings provision.--Section 602 shall continue to       apply to a project assisted with a grant under section 209(d)       regardless of whether the Secretary releases a Federal       interest under clause (i).''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 4075.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 4075, the Reinvigorating  Lending for the Future Act.   This bipartisan legislation will help cut the red tape and allow  greater levels of local investment in economic development projects by  allowing the Economic Development Administration to waive Federal  interest in certain revolving loan funds.   The EDA supports economic development by providing seed capital to  revolving loan funds that offer low-interest loans to help new  businesses get off the ground. Those loans are repaid with interest to  the RLF manager, which then loans the funds out again to other  businesses. This strategy has been highly effective, and more than 500  RLFs are in operation today.   But unlike other EDA grants, the Federal interest in these funds  remain in perpetuity. RLF managers must report and the EDA must track  these funds, no matter how many times they are lent out and repaid. The  funds can never be repurposed for other economic development projects.   The RLF Act fixes this bureaucratic nightmare by allowing the  Secretary of Commerce to release the Federal interest in these funds  after 7 years, provided that the funds are used for other approved  economic development projects like the development of public  infrastructure or workforce training.   This bill cuts through the red tape and allows for the local control  our regions need to invest in the most beneficial economic development  projects for their communities.   This legislation has broad bipartisan support and is endorsed by the  National Association of Development Organizations and the International  Economic Development Council, two of the largest economic development  advocacy groups in the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5912) to amend title 49, United States Code, to permit the  use of incentive payments to expedite certain federally financed  airport development projects, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5912         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Expedited Delivery of       Airport Infrastructure Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. ALLOWABLE COST STANDARDS FOR AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT                     PROJECTS.         (a) In General.--Section 47110(b)(1) of title 49, United       States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking ``(1) if the cost necessarily'' and       inserting ``(1)(A) if the cost necessarily'';        (2) by striking the semicolon at the end and inserting ``;       or''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(B) if the cost is an incentive payment incurred in       carrying out the project described  [[Page H5191]]       in subparagraph (A) that is to be provided to a contractor       upon early completion of a project, if--        ``(i) such payment does not exceed the lesser of 5 percent       of the initial construction contract amount or $1,000,000;        ``(ii) the level of contractor's control of, or access to,       the worksite necessary to shorten the duration of the project       does not negatively impact the operation of the airport;        ``(iii) the contract specifies application of the incentive       structure in the event of unforeseeable, non-weather delays       beyond the control of the contractor;        ``(iv) nothing in any agreement with the contractor       prevents the airport operator from retaining responsibility       for the safety, efficiency, and capacity of the airport       during the execution of the grant agreement; and        ``(v) the Secretary determines that the use of an incentive       payment is likely to increase airport capacity or efficiency       or result in cost savings as a result of shortening the       project's duration;''.        (b) Technical Correction.--Section 47110(e)(7) of title 49,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``(7) Partnership       Program Airports.--'' and inserting ``(7) Partnership program       airports.--''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5912, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5912, the Expedited Delivery  of Airport Infrastructure Act of 2020, introduced by Representative Sam  Graves, the ranking member of the House Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure. The bill incentivizes the early completion of airport  projects funded by the Federal Aviation Administration's Airport  Improvement Program, AIP.   Although current airline passenger traffic has declined precipitously  due to the coronavirus pandemic, there will come a time when domestic  and global air travel will return to its prepandemic heights and  continue to grow further. Airports will once again have to keep up with  growing passenger demand. This legislation will help to address this  future need by allowing airports to use their AIP funding to offer  incentive payments to contractors for early completion of airport  development projects.   Importantly, H.R. 5912 includes conditions that ensure projects  completed early do not have a negative impact on airport safety,  efficiency, or capacity.   I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4470) to rename the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development  Corporation the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development  Corporation, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4470, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and rise in strong support of H.R. 4470.   This legislation, introduced by the gentlewoman from Ohio,  Representative Marcy Kaptur, is simple in its intent but strong in its  meaning. H.R. 4470 would rename the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development  Corporation as the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development  Corporation.   The binational Saint Lawrence Seaway is a 328-nautical-mile deep- draft waterway between the Port of Montreal and Lake Erie. It connects  the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence  River. The U.S. portion of the Seaway was authorized in 1954 and is  operated by the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation within  the United States Department of Transportation.   This change would more accurately portray the geographical scope of  the agency and would clarify the agency's mission is of benefit to the  Saint Lawrence region, as well as the entire Great Lakes region.   I thank Representative Kaptur for her work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 4470, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 1982, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in full support of S. 1982, important bipartisan legislation  to further improve our national capabilities to respond to the global  problem of marine debris, especially impacts caused by plastic waste on  the ocean environment.   Marine debris is essentially any trash or litter that ends up in the  marine environment or the Great Lakes. It originates from a wide  variety of locations and often travels great distances before ending up  in the ocean.   Marine debris is everywhere. It is found around every major body of  water on the planet and along every shoreline in the world, no matter  how remote.   These materials pose a substantial threat to marine life that might  ingest or get entangled in marine debris or have their habitats  degraded. But equally important, marine debris threatens public health  and safety in the form of degraded water quality, increased exposure to  pathogens and chemicals, and damage to vessels.   The legislation before us this afternoon incorporates the  contributions of no less than six different committees that reviewed  and offered several targeted amendments to improve provisions under  each committee's jurisdiction.   Of note, I want to thank Chair Grijalva, Chair Engel, Chairwoman  Johnson, Chair Pallone, Chair Peterson, and their respective staffs for  their cooperation in refining this noncontroversial legislation so that  it could be considered today.   As amended, this legislation will provide an increase in annual  funding under the Marine Debris Act to $15 million, a 50 percent  increase over existing authorized funding levels.   This funding increase should help to strengthen current programs  administered by NOAA and the U.S. Coast Guard and prioritize efforts to  combat marine debris through innovation and entrepreneurship programs.   Moreover, this legislation authorizes new approaches to address the  international complexity of marine debris, most notably through the  establishment of a charitable nonprofit Marine Debris Foundation.   It also provides specific direction to Federal agencies to maintain  international leadership on marine debris and provides enhanced support  for plastic waste mitigation.   Even though the bill is not perfect, on balance, it is a very  positive addition to the legislation passed last Congress to  reauthorize the Marine Debris Act.                                time  1630    And considering the scale of the marine debris challenge, it stands  to reason that this will not be the last bill Congress enacts to  address this serious environmental problem.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Oregon, Congresswoman Suzanne  Bonamici, for her leadership on this issue and tireless advocacy to get  this bill through the House.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, this is good, bipartisan legislation that  deserves support from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I urge  its passage today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Thank you again, and I look forward to continuing to work       collaboratively with you on this important issue.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A.

Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter confirms our mutual       understanding regarding S. 1982, the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act.       Thank you for collaborating with the Committee on Agriculture       on the matters within our jurisdiction.        The Committee on Agriculture will forego any further       consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. However,       by foregoing consideration at this time, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over any subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation. We request that our Committee be       consulted and involved as this bill moves forward so that we       may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. The       Committee on Agriculture also reserves the right to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation       and ask that you support any such request.        We would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to S. 1982, and request that       a copy of our letters on this matter be published in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration.            Sincerely,                                                Collin C. Peterson,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                Washington, DC, September 29, 2020.      Hon. Collin Peterson,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Peterson: Thank you for your letter regarding       S. 1982, the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act. I appreciate your       decision to waive formal consideration of the bill.        I agree that the Committee on Agriculture has valid       jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this important       legislation, and I further agree that by forgoing formal       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Agriculture is       not waiving any jurisdiction over any relevant subject       matter. Additionally, I will support the appointment of       conferees from the Committee on Agriculture should a House-      Senate conference be convened on this legislation. Finally,       this exchange of letters will be included in the       Congressional Record when the bill is considered on the       floor.        Thank you again, and I look forward to continuing to work       collaboratively with you on this important issue.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,      Chair.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                     Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,                                 Washington, DC, September 28, 2020.      Chairman Peter A. DeFazio,      Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio: I am writing to you concerning S.       1982, the ``Save Our Seas 2.0 Act,'' which was passed by the       Senate and received in the House on January 13, 2020.        In the interest of expedience in the consideration of S.       1982, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will       waive formal consideration of the bill. This is, however, not       a waiver of future jurisdictional claims by the Science       Committee over the subject matter contained in S. 1982 or       similar legislation.        Thank you for agreeing to include our exchange of letters       in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill       in the House. Additionally, I ask that you support the       appointment of Science Committee conferees during any House-      Senate conference convened on this legislation.            Sincerely,                                          Eddie Bernice Johnson,                                   Chairwoman, Committee on Science,      Space, and Technology.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                Washington, DC, September 29, 2020.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: Thank you for your letter       regarding S. 1982, the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act. I appreciate       your decision to waive formal consideration of the bill.        I agree that the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology has valid jurisdictional claims to certain       provisions in this important legislation, and I further agree       that by forgoing formal consideration of the bill, the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology is not waiving       any jurisdiction over any relevant subject matter.

Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio: I am writing to you concerning S.       1982, Save Our Seas 2.0 Act. I recognize that the bill       contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs.        In an effort to work cooperatively and to expedite the       consideration of the bill, the  [[Page H5201]]       Committee on Foreign Affairs will waive referral of S. 1982.       This, however, is not a waiver of future jurisdictional       claims by the Committee on Foreign Affairs over this       legislation or its subject matter.        Thank you for agreeing to include our exchange of letters       in the Congressional Record. Additionally, I ask that you       support the appointment of Committee on Foreign Affairs       conferees during any House-Senate conference convened on this       legislation.
