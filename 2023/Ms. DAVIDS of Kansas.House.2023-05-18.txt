 Mr. Speaker, May is Mental Health Month. When  we think about health in general, we normally think of physical bodies.  When someone is hurt, we can often tell. I did mixed martial arts and I  know a little thing or two about physical hurt.   The thing is, we can't always tell when someone in our lives is  struggling internally. Mental and emotional health is health,  especially after the difficult and isolating years of the pandemic, and  it is absolutely critical that we treat it as such.   This month and every month, I encourage folks to check in on your  families, neighbors, and friends. I know I am going to do the same. If  you or someone you know needs help, we have some amazing local  organizations in Kansas' Third District, like Zero Reasons Why or the  Johnson County Mental Health Center, who are ready to assist you  however they can, or you can call 988 to speak with a trained  counselor.   Finally, to our youth who may be struggling right now--I see you.  Even on the toughest days, please know that you are not alone. Please  don't be afraid to ask for help.    Mr. Speaker, I am going to keep working to improve access to mental  health so folks in Kansas and around the country can have the resources  they need to take better care of themselves and their loved ones.                            ____________________
