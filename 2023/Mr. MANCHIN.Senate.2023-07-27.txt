 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute.    First of all, I want to take time for recognizing a  gentleman who has given 10 years of service being our nuclear expert on  the Senate Energy Committee, Rory Stanley. He is leaving us, but he is  not going far. He is going to the Department of Energy's Department of  Nuclear Energy.   Rory, thank you for the service you have given us. We appreciate it  very much.                                   S. 2226    Next of all, I want to thank everyone for voting for this amendment.  Finally, the United States is going to start taking care of its own and  producing the enriched uranium that we need rather than depending on  Russia. It is long past due, and we, finally, with this amendment, will  get started in the right direction.   I want to thank all of my colleagues for voting for that.   Again, Rory, thank you for your service.
