 Mr. Speaker, I am joyous to be here today on  such a historical day. You see, for the past 7 years, I have practiced  in ObamaCare, I have practiced under ObamaCare, and I have practiced in  that setting; and I can tell you that what it promised, it has not  delivered on.   There has not been increased accessibility, no. Instead of that, we  have got five States in our country that only have one plan to offer.  We have a third of the counties in our country that only have one plan  to offer. We have 16 counties in Tennessee that don't even have a plan,  and now we are going to have the opportunity to have access. Now we are  going to have choice.   We have also been told about affordability. Well, let's talk about  affordability. We see what ObamaCare did. It increased premiums 25  percent this year alone; 50 percent in seven States. That is  unsustainable.   What is our plan going to do?   It is going to give affordability. It is going to give competition.  We are going to have choices.   And what else?   It is going to remove red tape. It is going to remove the barriers  between healthcare professionals and patients. It is going to empower  patients. That is what health care in America is about: people making  healthcare decisions with their healthcare practitioners. That is what  we are going to do. That is what this does.   The two worst things that ObamaCare did to the healthcare system in  America, first of all, is it took the free market out of America. It  took the free market out of health care in America. It also expanded  Medicaid, a safety net program that was intended for the aged, the  blind, the disabled, children, and mothers, and extended it to able- bodied adults--something that it was never intended to do.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to hearing how many people in my district  are going to be empowered now from the gentleman from New Jersey.
