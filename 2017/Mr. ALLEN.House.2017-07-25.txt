 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman Arrington, for  this Special Order and for this opportunity to talk about what makes  America great.   Mr. Speaker, I am a product of rural America. I did learn a lot about  work ethic and about values. I can't think of any other way to grow up,  to be honest with you. Sure it was difficult, and sure I probably had  some times where I thought I would like to be somewhere else. But I  will tell you, there was nothing like it, and I take and cherish those  memories. I have tried to instill those in my children as well.                                time  1745    It is the greatest honor of my life to represent the people of  Georgia's 12th Congressional District, which is largely rural. We have  18 counties. About 15 of those counties would be considered rural. My  district is home to the Masters Tournament and the growing cyber  industry in Augusta, but it is our rural farms that are the true heart  of my district.   Georgia's 12th District is rural, and I am proud to say it is truly  God's country. You won't find more steadfast, faithful Americans than  in rural Georgia.   Agriculture is the number one industry in my home State of Georgia.  It is also the number one industry in my district. Our farmers have  been forgotten by out-of-touch politicians and unelected bureaucrats  here in Washington, particularly over the last 8 years.   Farm income, for example, is down more than 55 percent, largely due  to what our President has talked about, which is our trade policies.  However, as of last November, we are approaching a new day. This is  President Trump's day and President Trump's America. That is why I am  proud to have a President that knows that rural Americans deserve more.   In April, President Trump created the Interagency Task Force on  Agriculture and Rural Prosperity to be led by Secretary of Agriculture  and fellow Georgian, Sonny Perdue. This task force was created with one  goal in mind: to promote economic growth and innovation in rural  America. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I look forward  to working with Secretary Perdue on this mission, as well as the next  farm bill, which is critical to the lifeblood of our farmers.   From looking at cotton to peanuts, to specialty crops and the  programs they are using, I have participated in numerous hearings on  how to make the next farm bill successful for all of our farmers. I am  working hard to make sure the commodities most important to Georgia's  12th District are protected.   We also have a crisis in our community banking system. Community  banks are the lifeblood of the creation of small business. We  continually lose our community banks. That is why I am so proud of  Chairman Jeb Hensarling and his work to pass the CHOICE Act.   The CHOICE Act reduces the regulatory burden on our community banks.  It allows them to thrive and to provide the capital to grow the small  business community in our rural areas. Small business in our rural  communities accounts for about 75 percent of all new job growth.   We also have to fix healthcare. We are losing a number of our  community hospitals. I know in Congressman Arrington's district, in  small towns, the community hospital is the largest employer in that  community, and it is critical that we repurpose those hospitals, that  we fix healthcare and we provide healthcare for our rural areas.   We also need to look at technology. There is a tremendous need for  broadband and expanding our broadband capabilities. I know the  President is talking about a major infrastructure package. Broadband  needs to be a part of that infrastructure package because the 12th  District of Georgia, through technology, could be the new Silicon  Valley of the East Coast. We would like to see that trickle down into  our rural areas, and it can, but we have to have the capability of the  broadband.   As far as the future of rural America, we are seeing tremendous  strides made as far as technology, as far as farming. Last year, I  planted peanuts. I was operating a tractor, which I remember operating  as a child and a teenager and having to pay attention to all the moving  parts. I tell you, I sat on this tractor and I planted 17 inches over  from the year before, and I never touched the steering wheel. The  technology is amazing.   I was with a group of farmers the other day and we were talking about  God is blessing us with a lot of rain and if it continues, we are going  to have a bountiful crop, a great yield. They said: Yeah, we are good 8  inches down, but the other 8 inches we are a little concerned about.  They have these probes that are measuring how much water we are  receiving.  [[Page H6283]]    So we have a got a lot going on in our rural areas. We just, as a  body here, need to provide our farmers, our small business people, with  the tools they need to get the job done, and they will get the job  done.   Again, I want to thank my distinguished colleague from Texas,  Congressman Arrington, for shining the spotlight on rural America  tonight. It is the lifeblood of this country. I want to see rural  America become everything it needs to be.   We are seeing improvement in the economy through many pieces of this  legislation that we are passing. I hear it from the business community  and some of our city centers. It is time for that to trickle down into  rural America.   Again, I thank the gentleman for shining this spotlight.
