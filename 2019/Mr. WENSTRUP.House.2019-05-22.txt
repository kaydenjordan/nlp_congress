 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a member of my staff and a  constituent from Ohio's Second District, Ryan Dierker.   After 4 years in my office, Ryan will be leaving at the end of the  month for a higher calling. He will be going to Officer Candidate  School for the United States Marine Corps.   Ryan will surely be missed in my office, but I could not be prouder  to watch this young man answer the call  [[Page H4075]]  to serve his country. Ryan will be joining the finest 1 percent of our  Nation who have put on the uniform of the United States.   I welcome Ryan to the club, the United States military. It is the  best club I ever joined, and I know he will soon agree.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ryan for his hard work in my office, but more  importantly, I thank him for his service to our great Nation. I salute  him.   Oohrah.                            ____________________
