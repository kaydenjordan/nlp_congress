Mr. President, the United States surpassed 11 million  COVID-19 cases this past week. This comes just 6 days after our Nation  recorded 10 million cases--1 million added to the 10 million in 6  days--making it the fastest transmission of 1 million new cases since  the pandemic began. Nearly a quarter of a million Americans have died.  This runaway crisis is alarming, it is deadly, and it demands action.   The city of Chicago began a stay-at-home advisory to help encourage  people to contain the virus in our communities. Across Illinois, more  than 5,000 patients have been hospitalized with COVID-19 each night for  the past week. We have shattered new infection records nearly every day  this month. Illinois has now experienced more than 597,000 cases, and  we have sadly lost 10,875. My heart goes out to everyone who has lost a  loved one.   In addition to trying to keep ourselves and our loved ones healthy  and safe from the virus, Americans have also been struggling to deal  with economic uncertainty, job loss, food insecurity, childcare--the  list goes on and on and on. Here we are just days before Thanksgiving,  and many of our neighbors are trying to pick the right day to go to the  food bank so they can feed their families on this day of thanks.   Where is the sense of urgency on Capitol Hill when it comes to  providing another round of economic impact payments, enhanced  unemployment benefits, funding for the food stamps--the SNAP program?  Our country is in desperate need of help, and they are counting on us.   You would think a crisis of this scale would be the first order of  business for the Republican-controlled Senate this week. Yet, while  this pandemic continues to rage, too many Republicans in Congress  refuse to even come to the table to negotiate a comprehensive,  bipartisan relief bill. There are those who will, and I commend them.  It takes real courage. Instead, their leader, Senator McConnell, has  scheduled votes this week on six barely qualified judicial nominees.  The average age of this week's judicial nominees is 38.   You see, these are lifetime appointments. If you get somebody with  the right answers to their political questions, then they will give you  20, 30, or more years while you have control of that court, and control  of the court is more important, obviously, than coronavirus.   The youngest one of these nominees is Kathryn Mizelle. She is 33  years old. The American Bar Association took a look at her record and  judged her ``not qualified.'' This is the 10th Trump nominee for a  lifetime appointment to the Federal court who has been judged ``not  qualified'' by the American Bar Association. You might say: I am sure  that happens. Well, it didn't happen at all in the 8 years of the Obama  Presidency. Not a single nominee who was judged ``unqualified'' was  sent to Congress.   Another nominee, Stephen Vaden, who has been nominated for a lifetime  position at the Court of International Trade, has never appeared before  the Court of International Trade. He has never tried a case in any  court. He will be a great judge once he figures it out.   We voted on Dr. Judy Shelton's nomination to the Federal Reserve  Board. She is uniquely unqualified. Her economic views are almost  humorous, they are so out of touch with reality. We are experiencing  the worst recession in 75 years, and Dr. Shelton, by her stated views,  is unprepared to contribute to dealing with this economic crisis.   It is the story of the 116th Congress. The Republican-controlled  Senate spends month after month after month ignoring a raging pandemic  and refusing to even consider the House-passed relief legislation.   Here is a good question for Members of the Senate: How many  amendments has the Senate voted on this calendar year of 2020? Not  counting impeachment--set that aside. But how many amendments to  legislation have we considered in this calendar year? The answer is  27--27 amendments in this calendar year. That is an improvement,  incidentally. In 2019, we considered exactly 22 amendments. Six of them  were forced on us by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who basically said:  I won't let you go home until you vote on this amendment. And, as  Senator Paul has  [[Page S7026]]  said, of course he lost every one of those amendments.   Twenty-seven amendments in 1 year; 22 the previous year. Do you know  why? We don't legislate. We don't debate. We don't offer amendments. We  don't pass bills. We come here with a new set of nominations every week  from the Republican majority. We don't have any legislation on the  pandemic. We have no legislation on economic recovery. We just have to  get these lifetime appointees, some who have been found categorically  unqualified. That is what this Senate is all about.   In this last week before the Thanksgiving recess, is this really all  we are going to do? How about the 28 rural hospitals in Kentucky that  are facing the risk of closure? How about the $1.3 billion of  uncompensated losses for these hospitals across Kentucky? The  Republican proposal a few weeks ago didn't provide any economic relief  for hospitals, clinics, or healthcare providers like those.   Americans need leadership. They need for the Senate to step up and  say: For goodness' sake, whatever the political agenda is here, how can  it be more important than this pandemic?   Isn't there enough talent or will on the floor of the Senate--on the  Republican side and on the Democratic side--to find a way to help  Americans who are struggling, to provide unemployment assistance, to  provide help to small businesses, these restaurants and small  businesses that are facing closure, to give some money to local units  of government that through no fault of their own lost revenue to this  COVID-19 crisis? These are not wild ideas; these address the very  basics that face families, businesses, and governments across this  country. For some reason, that particular issue can't make the agenda.    I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper),  the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), and the Senator from  California (Ms. Harris) are necessarily absent.
