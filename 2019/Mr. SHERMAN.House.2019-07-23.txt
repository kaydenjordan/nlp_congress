 Madam Speaker, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran  Khan, came to Washington this weekend. As chair of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Asia, it is appropriate that I comment upon what has  occurred so far in the bilateral discussions, and I look forward to  meeting the Prime Minister later today.   What is unfortunate is the approach taken by the Trump  administration.   First, as to Afghanistan, the hearts and minds of the Afghan people  are critical to our success in what has been our longest war. Tens of  thousands of Americans have worked to get the hearts and minds of the  Afghan people on our side, building schools and hospitals, under very  dangerous conditions.   Now, the President takes this high-profile opportunity as an  opportunity to say that he might kill 10 million Afghans, or was  thinking about it, or raises the possibility that we would use nuclear  weapons to destroy Afghanistan.   This does untold harm to our efforts in Afghanistan to win the hearts  and minds of the Afghan people.   What the President should have done is talk about the Durand Line and  how Afghanistan should accept this border between Afghanistan and  Pakistan, a border that Afghanistan disputes but that the whole world  accepts.   As to Kashmir, it is not surprising that the Prime Minister of  Pakistan wants America to arbitrate or mediate. That has been the  position of Pakistan for decades. But then, the President said in  Osaka, last month, Prime Minister Modi asked the United States to  arbitrate or mediate the Kashmir dispute.   That is utterly preposterous, and it is embarrassing that we have a  President who wouldn't realize how preposterous that statement is. Of  course, the record has been set straight by Prime Minister Modi.   Third is what the President didn't say. He didn't make a major issue  over Dr. Afridi, the doctor who was critical in helping us find and  kill Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden was hiding a mile away from the  military academy of the Pakistani Army, their West Point.   We have not demanded that the Pakistanis who helped Osama bin Laden  be put in jail, but we do insist that the one Pakistani who helped us  find bin Laden be released from Pakistani jail.   The President barely raised the issue. In fact, he didn't voluntarily  raise it at all.   This is not just a humanitarian concern. It is also a strategic  national security concern because who will help us fight terrorism if  we leave Dr. Afridi behind?   In a news interview, Prime Minister Khan suggested there might be a  trade, where Afridi was released and a terrorist named Dr. Siddiqui  released by the United States.   No friendly country would demand that we release a terrorist in order  for them to release a hero, but we have to be practical, and we have to  get Dr. Afridi released.   Finally, the President failed to mention with the Prime Minister of  Pakistan the situation as to human rights. Hundreds of individuals in  Sindh have been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani authorities.   A prime example of that I should highlight today is a 17-year-old boy  from Sindh, Aqib Chandio. He was abducted 14 months ago, in broad  daylight. He is still missing.   It is time for the Prime Minister of Pakistan to provide information  about Aqib Chandio. Where is he? Produce him in court or release him.  What is his fate?   Of course, we need information about hundreds of others who have  disappeared, including Murtaza Junejo, Shahid Junejo, Ayoub Kandhro,  and Insaf Dayo.   I want to mention Dr. Anwar Laghari, a friend of mine who was shot  dead in Sindh in 2015 while working with the Sindh United Party, a  party of which he was one of the leaders. Pakistan has not adequately  investigated that brutal murder, and it is time for Pakistan to do so.   Finally, we focus on the issue of forced conversions in Sindh, young  Hindu and Christian girls forced to convert to Islam and forced to  marry men many decades their senior. The Pakistani Government needs to  stop this pernicious practice. They need to do more. That is why nine  of my colleagues joined with me in sending a letter to the President,  urging a focus on human rights in Sindh in these bilateral discussions.                            ____________________
