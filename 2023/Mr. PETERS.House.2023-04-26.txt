 Mr. Speaker, due to a long-standing family obligation,  planned well before the congressional schedule was available, I could  not be present for votes today. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 195, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 196, ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 197, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 198, ``nay'' on rollcall No.  199, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 200.                            ____________________
