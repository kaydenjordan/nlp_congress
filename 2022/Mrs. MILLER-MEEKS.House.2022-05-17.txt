 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, following the pandemic, the Nation's workforce needs  have drastically changed, and we need a workforce development system  that helps prepare American workers for the job opportunities of today  and tomorrow, not those of the past.   The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is intended to help  unemployed and underemployed workers get the necessary skills to  succeed in America's modern economy.   Unfortunately, the majority's proposed reauthorization lacks the  necessary reforms to help America's workers.   Our Republican proposal, on the other hand, would modernize the  program to make sure it is employer-driven, which will help America's  economy become stronger for decades to come.   Our plan puts taxpayer dollars to work where they need it most:  helping jobseekers get the skills they need to close the skills gap and  get back to work.                                time  1545    It does this by bringing more competition into the provider  marketplace, which expands the pool of skills development providers  that meet employers' needs and gives more choice to American workers,  ensuring States and localities can use WIOA funds to survey employers  to get a better understanding of the skills that are most in demand and  respond accordingly.   Additionally, the Republican proposal adapts WIOA to the changing  economic landscape. America has just come through a pandemic. During  that time, businesses, employers, and workers shifted to remote work  and changing circumstances. Our skills development and education  programs should adapt to changing circumstances as well. Our plan  encourages workforce boards to provide services virtually, which  streamlines WIOA and eliminates administrative costs and overhead.   Republicans also ensure online skills development providers can be  included in skills development services, expanding the number of  providers who can address the needs that American workers face.   The Republican alternative also levels the playing field and  encourages innovation by ensuring that WIOA does not favor registered  apprenticeships over more innovative apprenticeship models that can  address the needs of more employers. This will keep America's labor  force at the cutting edge of global competition.   Competition drives better results. Through pay-for-performance  funding, our substitute encourages programs with a proven track record  of successfully helping American workers succeed. Our proposal measures  programs based on real outcomes and gives States and localities more  flexibility in how they can improve those outcomes.   We also increase transparency by making the process for creating job  performance metrics available to the American public.   Finally, the Republican plan brings greater accountability to the  Department of Labor's Job Corps program and its Reentry Employment  Opportunities program.   Let's start with Job Corps. Job Corps is a popular program, and for  many students, Job Corps is their last hope. There are important  reforms we can enact to ensure that Job Corps is working better for  students who need it most. Our bill would help Job Corps-eligible  students get technical and career education from community colleges,  which would give this program much-needed innovation and better  outcomes.   The Job Corps program in Ottumwa, Iowa, in my district, is a  wonderful example of how to do exactly this and is the right way to  perform that program.   It would also do more to keep Job Corps participants safe. Centers  would be required to report whenever any concerning incidents occur,  ensuring proper oversight of this program.   We also bring greater accountability to the Reentry Employment  Opportunities program so we can build on President Trump's historic  criminal justice reform and use this program to help formerly  incarcerated Americans establish firm economic foundations for their  new lives.   These are commonsense reforms that will help American employers and  jobseekers. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Speaker, we have had an opportunity to work together on WIOA,  but unfortunately, my colleagues in the majority are more concerned  about maintaining the status quo and placating favored stakeholders.   What American workers and employers need is a workforce system that  prioritizes them over special interests, and the Republican alternative  would do that.   I urge my colleagues to help us pass an alternative proposal that  works for America, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
