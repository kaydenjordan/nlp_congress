 Madam President, across the country, parents and  caregivers are bending over backward to try to get their children in  early education. They are paying tens of thousands of dollars out of  pocket, relying on family, friends, and neighbors, or are simply giving  up work or their own educations because they can't find a childcare  program with an opening. At the same time, overworked and underpaid  providers are struggling to prop up childcare programs, burning  themselves out, and leaving empty, shuttered classrooms behind them.   The system is broken, and if we leave it broken, we are failing  multiple generations of people who are relying upon us to fix it--to  fix the broken system.   As Marian Wright Edelman said, investing in children is not a  national luxury or a national choice; it is a national necessity--a  national necessity for our future.   If we want the 21st century to be better than the 20th century, we  don't have a choice--it is a necessity.   When the pandemic began, Congress stepped up and provided the largest  ever onetime investment in the childcare sector through the American  Rescue Plan, and it worked. In Massachusetts, childcare providers  received higher pay; programs stayed safe and open in more places and  for more hours through the day. We kept classrooms open and prevented  families from trying to decide how to continue working and finding a  safe place for their children to learn, to grow, and to thrive.   But the pandemic-era money is drying up, and those cracks that  ruptured in 2020 were from years of underinvestment long before we had  ever heard of COVID-19. If we fail to maintain this investment--if we  fail 3.2 million children who would lose their care and the 232,000  childcare workers who would lose their jobs--then it would be a tragedy  for our country. It would ultimately be an economic catastrophe for our  country that we did not invest in those children in the same way that  we were invested in by preceding generations.   One of the reasons that they called an earlier generation the  ``greatest generation,'' they weren't as wealthy as us, but they were  wiser than us. They knew that every child had to be invested in. And  that is why we are the country that we are today.   The challenge for this generation is, are we as wise as preceding  generations? Do we understand that it is only out of selfishness that  we would not make the same decision that those earlier generations made  in children to whom they were not related either, who did not come from  the same ethnic group as they did either, but they did it because it  would help our country?   I am so proud that Massachusetts is a leader in childcare. State- level investments have saved almost 1,000 programs and 18,000 seats  across the State from closure. But we can't expect States to keep  plugging the holes of a failing system. We can't keep letting early  educators and childcare providers bear the weight of underinvestment.  We can't let generations of families fall behind because of a broken  system. And we cannot let our childcare system--and all of the  children, all of the families, all of the workers and providers in it-- fall off a cliff because there isn't enough funding for the children in  our country to get the care that they need.   We need to give States the financial freedom to invest, to improve  quality, to reduce costs, and to expand access. We need to guarantee  children and families have high-quality childcare. We need a national,  permanent solution to the childcare crisis.   If we want kids to thrive when they start school, if we want families  to move out of poverty, we need to fund stabilization, support children  and families, and build a childcare system that works.   So I thank Senator Murray for her great historic leadership on this  issue, for fighting for all of those children in our country to make  sure they get the help that they deserve, because they are the ones who  are going to make America better in the 21st century.   Young people are only 20 percent of our population, but they are 100  percent of our future. That is all Senator Murray is talking about. Let  us invest in them in the same way that we were invested in by previous  generations.    With that, I yield the floor.

Bryan, of Minnesota, to be United States  District Judge for the District of Minnesota.   I was necessarily absent, but had I been present, I would have voted  yes on rollcall vote No. 315, confirmation of Jeffrey M.

Garnett, of New York, to be United States District Judge for the  Southern District of New York.   I was necessarily absent, but had I been present, I would have voted  yes on rollcall vote No. 317, confirmation of Margaret M. Garnett, of  New York, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District  of New York.   I was necessarily absent, but had I been present, I would have voted  yes on rollcall vote No. 318, the Motion to Invoke Cloture on Jose  Javier Rodriguez to be an Assistant Secretary of Labor.                            ____________________
