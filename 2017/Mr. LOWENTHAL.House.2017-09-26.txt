 Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago today, 43 students from  Ayotzinapa, Mexico, disappeared.   I recently traveled to Mexico where I spoke with many of their  parents and the family members of the students who disappeared. I was  humbled by the strength that they show. After a 3-year struggle, they  have asked for answers to two simple questions: What happened that  night when their children were taken; and where are they now?   On this third anniversary of their loss, I am repeating my past calls  for the Mexican Government to prioritize their search for the students,  to bring justice to those responsible for their disappearance, and to  investigate any obstruction of justice.   If the Mexican Government cannot do this, I urge them to allow the  independent panel of experts to expand on their initial investigation.  The students, their parents, and the Mexican people deserve answers.                            ____________________
