 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the glorious  Thunderbirds of Nellis Air Force Base, who are celebrating 65 years in  Las Vegas this month.   Since their establishment, the Thunderbirds, America's Ambassadors in  Blue, have performed in front of millions worldwide, defying gravity  with stunning aerobatics that showcase our military power and might.   Their mission is to recruit, retain, and inspire. With each dazzling  performance, they rouse America's future heroes to serve our Nation.   Congratulations on 65 years, Thunderbirds. You are the pride of  Nevada's Fourth District and the pride of our Nation.                            ____________________
