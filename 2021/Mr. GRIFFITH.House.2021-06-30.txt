 Madam Speaker, the Hyde amendment respects the deeply  held beliefs of pro-life people like me by not spending our tax dollars  to pay for abortions.   But support for the Hyde amendment goes beyond the pro-life  community. It has enjoyed broad bipartisan support during most of its  45-year history, previously including the current Democrat in the Oval  Office.  [[Page H3312]]    That is because it respects a cherished American value, freedom of  conscience regarding our deepest religious beliefs. Now, that freedom  is under attack by radicals running this country. Their assault on the  Hyde amendment threatens to undo this important protection for the  lives of millions and the consciences of millions more.   That is why we need H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion  Act.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
