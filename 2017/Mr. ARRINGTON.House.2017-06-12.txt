 Mr. Speaker, I love everything about west Texas. I  love the beautiful sunsets and the starry nights. I love that our  farmers and ranchers feed and clothe the American people. I love that  we produce more fossil and renewable energy than any other region in  the United States.   People from all over the country rely on west Texas to make America  great, but the greatest contribution from our region is our people. The  people of west Texas have a distinct friendliness, a can-do spirit, a  humble demeanor, a unique sense of humor; and on April 10, 2017, we  lost one of our very own who embodied these attributes like no one  else.   Former head football coach at Texas Tech and favorite son of west  Texas, Spike Dykes carved his legacy into the bedrock of our region and  into the hearts of hundreds of student athletes and thousands of fans  across this country.   A small town kid from Ballinger, Texas, who achieved his wildest  dreams of becoming a Division I head football coach, Coach Dykes went  on to lead the Red Raiders to seven straight bowl seasons and was later  inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame.   I had the honor of calling Spike Dykes ``Coach'' for a short time  when I walked on the Texas Tech football team, and later I had the  honor of calling him my friend.   We are all saddened by his passing, and our prayers are with his  children and my friends, Rick, BeBe, Sonny, and their families.   Thank you, Coach, for your colorful wit and country wisdom. Thank you  for leaving a legacy of love for people and all things west Texas.  Thank you for teaching us that in life, like the game of football, it  is not whether you win or lose; it is who you are; it is how you play  the game.   God doesn't make them any better than you, Coach. God bless.
