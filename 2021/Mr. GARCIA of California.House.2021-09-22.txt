 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on an  important facet of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2022. While I am pleased that the NDAA bill delivers good top-line  and procurement financial support for our Nation's defense  capabilities, the bill is not perfect.   Specifically, I want to share my frustration with the bill's failure  to properly increase our Nation's military pay, specifically for our  enlisted personnel. The 2.7 percent pay increase for our military  servicemembers is simply not enough. Throughout today, during the  debate over the NDAA, we will hear Members from both sides of the aisle  talk about the 2.7 percent, almost touting this.   I want to put this in perspective. For the average junior enlisted  personnel member, this translates to roughly $1.80 a day more for their  service. This  [[Page H4872]]  is unsatisfactory, especially given the gap between military pay and  their civilian counterparts is currently at an all-time high.   The reality is that many of our U.S. servicemembers and their  families must serve 3 years and gain the rank of E4 before they can be  at or above most States' minimum wage. This is also based on the  assumption that they are working only 40 hours a week, which we all  know is not true. Most servicemembers are actually working 50 to 60  hours per week, given the current operational tempo worldwide.   We should never have to discuss food insecurities for those  protecting our security, but the reality is that we have a significant  percentage of servicemembers and their families who actually qualify  for food stamps. This is unacceptable. We should start by paying them  an adequate amount of base pay and avoid the burden of food stamps for  our military.   Earlier this year, during committee markup of the FY22 Defense  appropriations bill, I offered an amendment that would ensure that all  servicemembers make the equivalent of $15 an hour, or $31,200 a year,  in base pay. These are not seismic numbers. These are not numbers we,  as a Nation, cannot afford.                                time  1045    When considering the 2.7 percent pay increase included in the FY22  NDAA, we must realize that this would still leave many servicemembers  below that $15 minimum that I advocated for in July. Not to mention,  the 2.7 percent pay increase actually falls below the current inflation  rate, so they are actually losing ground relative to current prices. It  also fails to keep pace with servicemembers' pay relative to their  civilian counterparts.   If we want to attract and retain the requisite skill sets and  warriors needed in a complex battle space against a threat like China,  we need to be willing to pay our troops a living wage. In the grand  scheme of things, this pay raise for our enlisted ranks is extremely  affordable. It not only pays for our servicemembers and their families,  but also deepens and solidifies our Nation's security. This is a  priceless return on a relatively small investment.   While the amendment I offered to the FY22 NDAA bill was not included  in the final bill, I secured a commitment from Defense Subcommittee  Chairwoman Betty McCollum that she would create a working group to find  a way to address the necessary military pay raise in conference  negotiations with the Senate, and I appreciate the Chairwoman's  willingness to work with me on this issue.   Let me be clear: While the FY22 NDAA is not perfect and it does not  properly raise our military's pay, I plan to support the overall bill  as it does make important strides to provide a large majority of the  necessary funding and, frankly, the initiatives that our Nation's  military needs. I also promise to continue to work on ensuring our  servicemembers receive the pay raises that they actually deserve.   After 20 years of unprecedented deployment cycles during the global  war on terror, now is the time to invest in our precious servicemembers  and their families who provide our beautiful nation its security  blanket on a daily basis. $15 an hour or $31,000 a year is a reasonable  minimum base salary for our troops.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would  have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 270.       MEMBERS RECORDED PURSUANT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 8, 117TH CONGRESS       Cardenas (Gomez)      Carter (TX) (Calvert)      DeSaulnier (Matsui)      Frankel, Lois (Clark (MA))      Fulcher (Johnson (OH))      Gonzalez (OH)      (Reschenthaler)      Grijalva (Garcia (IL))      Kirkpatrick (Levin (CA))      Latta (Walberg)      Lawson (FL) (Evans)      McEachin (Wexton)      Meng (Jeffries)      Morelle (Tonko)      Napolitano (Correa)      Payne (Wasserman Schultz)      Rice (SC) (Wilson (SC))      Rush (Underwood)      Ryan (Kildee)      Stanton (Levin (CA))      Stefanik      (Reschenthaler)      Strickland (Torres (NY))      Swalwell (Veasey)      Wagner (Walorski)      Wilson (FL) (Hayes)      Young (Mast)                    Amendment No. 11 Offered by Ms. Tlaib     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my  critical, bipartisan, bicameral bill, the Military Spouse Licensing  Relief Act, which was included as an amendment in this en bloc package.   My amendment would support military families by allowing military  spouses with valid professional licenses in one State reciprocity in  another State where their spouse is stationed on military orders. This  effectively allows the spouse to cross-deck their professional license  to another State while their spouse is on Active Duty.   More than 30 percent of our military spouses work in a field  requiring professional licensing, and when these families receive move  orders to a new State, military spouses often must spend time and money  to reapply for a professional license that they already have. On  average, military families lose thousands of dollars per move in lost  wages and fees caused by relicensing barriers, and in many cases the  spouse ends up not even applying for the license because it takes too  long or is too costly to do so.   The struggle often threatens the economic security and quality of  life for these families, as their loved ones serve our Nation. No  military spouse should have to decide between job security and being  with their family. Military families already sacrifice so much in  service to our great country, and we must work to protect these  families.   At a time in which our communities are also facing critical shortages  of skilled professionals, like nurses and teachers, I urge my  colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that will drastically  improve the quality of life for our military families as well as our  communities.
