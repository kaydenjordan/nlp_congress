 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent,  Neil Norman of Richland, Washington, for receiving the National Society  of Professional Engineers Award in honor of his extraordinary  contributions to the engineering profession.   Mr. Norman is one of only 65 engineers to receive this award since  1949, and his substantial career demonstrates that he has earned this  achievement. He has worked on several state-of-the-art projects since  he began his work in 1952, including the plant design and construction  for the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository. In central Washington,  he designed the Fast Flux Test Facility, which is the Hanford nuclear  site's former research reactor.   Neil has received several local, State, and national awards over the  years. In retirement, he continues to serve his community. He gives  lectures to engineering students in colleges across the State of  Washington to promote professionalism, ethics, public health, and  safety. His outstanding career is one to be admired.   Please join me in congratulating Neil Norman for his contributions to  the engineering profession and to our community.                            ____________________
