 Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the incredible  legacy of Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont.   In his eight terms in the U.S. Senate, he racked up some incredible  accomplishments. He established himself as Congress' most prolific  photographer. He appeared in more Batman films than any of our other  colleagues. And on one amusing occasion, he became the only politician  to ever get a call from the President of the United States while on  stage at a Grateful Dead concert.   But when Senator Leahy wasn't on screen or onstage, he could always  be found working behind the scenes, standing up for Vermonters. You  can't drive around Vermont without seeing Senator Leahy's impact. I  mean that literally. There is the ECHO Leahy Center for Lake Champlain,  The Leahy Center for Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity, Leahy Way,  Leahy Road, the other Leahy Road--just to name a few.   Those examples represent just a small fraction of what he has done  for Vermont. He has gotten critical Federal investments in the iconic  Lake Champlain. He successfully fought for resources to help Vermonters  rebuild and restore their lives after Hurricane Irene. He got funding  to revitalize downtowns, fund opioid treatment programs, support dairy  farmers, and add more than 140,000 acres to the Green Mountain National  Forest. Senator Leahy made it his priority to give Vermont a seat at  the table, and that is just what he did.   And on the national stage, he was always looking out for people, even  and especially in the face of heartbreaking circumstances. He stood up  for Alan Gross, the U.S. citizen who spent years withering away in a  Cuban prison cell surrounded by rats and roaches. Senator Leahy played  a key role in getting him released and back home with his family.   During his decades of service on the Senate Judiciary Committee, he  championed funding for law enforcement and led the creation of the  Patrick Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership to stop preventable  tragedies. As a result, we have been able to provide more than 1.5  million bulletproof vests for law enforcement. He also successfully  spearheaded the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in  2013, providing crucial protections to countless women throughout the  country.   Senator Leahy has been a clear and consistent voice on human rights,  especially on landmines. In 1989, he started a fund to get medical aid  to landmine victims, and he later single-handedly got the first  legislation in the world to stop the export of landmines through the  U.S. Senate. He is an internationally recognized leader on this issue.   In all his time in Washington, Senator Leahy never lost his sense of  purpose or his fundamental belief in the power of our government to  make life better for people. As a leader, that is what he has always  done.   Senator Leahy has a legacy that anyone would be proud of--and I am  proud to call him a friend. I wish him and Marcelle all the best in  this next chapter.    Madam President, I first want to thank Senator Portman  for his incredible work on Ukraine. He has given dozens and dozens of  talks on this floor, but what is equally important is all the work he  has done behind the scenes, working across the aisle, making sure the  funding is there for the weapons, and meeting directly with President  Zelenskyy. I just want to thank him for his incredible leadership, and  we will continue his work. I have a feeling he will be calling us from  Ohio or wherever he is to make sure we are doing it right. I thank him  for that.                                  Democracy    Madam President, we are here today to speak about democracy. Of  course, that is on the line in Ukraine. President Zelenskyy reminds us  about it every day when he says these simple words: ``We are here.''  That is what he said the day of the Russian invasion. He went to the  street corner and said, ``We are here.'' That is what we are here to  say today, is that there are people who are carrying the torch for  democracy in our own country.   I am glad to be joined with my colleague today, Senator Whitehouse,  who has been such a leader when it comes to the DISCLOSE Act and that  part of our democracy, as well as voting, to make sure we keep our  democracy and make the case that our democracy does not work if we do  not have campaign finance and things that are transparent and know  where that money is coming from, because it drowns out the voices of  everyday people.   Senator King is with us today on the floor. He is a member of the  Rules Committee. He introduced, with Senator Durbin and myself, the  original reform to the Electoral Count Act and has been a true leader  when it comes to voting reform.   The Presiding Officer herself will be addressing this from the great  State of New Hampshire, where they understand a little bit about a  democracy and freedom and what that means.   Then Senator Merkley, the original sponsor of the For the People Act,  which really set the table for the discussions we have been having on  voting rights and the close vote we had when it came to finally passing  the Freedom to Vote Act--that was built on the work that Senator  Merkley and many others did on the For the People Act.   Nearly 2 years ago, a violent mob of insurrectionists stormed into  this Chamber right here. We are looking at the desks they were opening  up. We are looking at the presiding dais, which they invaded. They  desecrated our Capitol. They interrupted the hallmark of our democracy,  the peaceful transfer of power.   Just this last week, we gave the Capitol Police and the DC Metro  Police--the police who protected us that day--the Congressional Medal  of Honor. So many brave officers were there for us, and democracy  prevailed that day.   But what we have learned is that what the insurrectionists didn't  finish with bear spray and flag poles in the U.S. Capitol, others have  tried to do with voter suppression laws, nonsense lawsuits, and threats  of violence. They have literally attempted to shut down the rule of  law, to shutter our voting laws, and they literally have mocked and  made fun of political acts of violence.   Simply put, we know that Federal action was and is needed. That is  why we introduced the Freedom to Vote Act to protect every American's  right to vote in the way that works best for them. Through a summer of  intense negotiations, we got all 50 Democratic Senators on board.  Sadly, our efforts were halted by the filibuster. But we did not give  up and we have not given up on that bill, as well as the John Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Still, we are making progress in other places. A number of State  voter suppression laws have been thrown out by courts, including by  conservative judges. A number of State legislatures have taken action  to protect the right to vote.   Finally, just this week, as part of this omnibus bill before us, we  are on the verge of getting the bipartisan Electoral Count Reform Act  signed into law. We thank Senator Manchin and Senator Collins for their  leadership, as well as so many other Senators who were part of that  effort.   I thank the members of the Rules Committee. We were able to get the  bill, with some changes that Senator Blunt and I worked on together  that were supported on a bipartisan basis, through the Rules Committee  on a 14-to-1 vote.   This year, it became clear that our democracy itself is on the  ballot. The American people could be moved to act, and opponents of  democracy, as we know, tried to put election deniers on the ballot. But  whether it was Democrats, moderate Republicans, or Independents, they  rallied around people who would stand up for our democracy. In many  States across the country, when it came to election day, the highest  vote-getters were not the most famous politicians; they were the  secretaries of state who in many cases were not household names but  were running against people who were election deniers. They ended up,  including in my own State, having the highest vote percentages, highest  vote totals of anyone in the State.   So what about the Electoral Count Act? This is an antiquated law  passed in the 1800s which was never meant to be a trigger point for an  insurrection.   What we have done with this bill that I believe we will pass this  week, is we have made it absolutely clear that the Vice President does  not have the power to reject electoral votes.   We all remember the words, the horrific words, ``Hang Mike Pence,''  uttered just a few yards away from the Vice President in this very  building.   We need to also raise the threshold for objecting to electoral votes,  so that it takes more than two of the 535 elected Members to gum up the  counting.   Even before the insurrection, when Senator Blunt and I looked at the  objections that were going to be made, in many cases by one, two, three  Senators, we realized it would take at least 24 hours to get through  them. In fact, there was nothing stopping under this antiquated law a  single Senator and a single House Member from objecting to every single  State, including  [[Page S9597]]  the States that perhaps their candidate had won, just to gum up the  works. That is why we have pushed for the Electoral Count Act.   Moving forward, we must address the root causes, not only of these  antiquated laws, not only of voter suppression, but also disinformation  and misinformation that allows lies that undermine our elections to go  viral and violent.   On January 6, we saw the cost of these lies up close. That is why we  have to address the impact of disinformation online on our democracy.  We can start by looking at the liability protections that we have put  in place. Back when, yes, internet companies were starting in garages,  back at the beginning. We have a legal provision, section 230, that  protects social media companies from liability for the posting and  spreading of dangerous content on their platforms.   We know people are going to post things that are hateful, that aren't  true. But the question is, when companies' algorithms are designed, in  fact, to make money off of repeating those lies and expanding them,  and, despite some efforts to reduce them, it keeps coming and coming  and coming, I don't know why we would put in liability protection for  that.   If someone were to yell ``fire'' in a crowded theater, that person  would be liable. That is not protected speech. But if the theater had  in rules that protected its patrons, they wouldn't be held liable for  that. But what if the theater was a multiplex and it decided that they  would broadcast the words of the person yelling ``fire'' in all of its  theaters. Would we think that was OK?   Well, that is exactly what is going on with disinformation and hate  speech on the internet right now. Companies are allowed to repeat  hateful disinformation, and they actually can profit from it. And that  is why many of us believe it is time to look at section 230 and the  immunity that this Congress has given them.   In addition, Americans should know who is behind the political ads  they see online. We need to put in place the same rules for social  media platforms that currently apply to political ads sold on TV,  radio, and in print. That is a bill I had with Senator McCain and now  with Senator Graham. It is time to bring that bill up for a vote.   Even though the FEC has made some changes, they are not nearly what  we need to have in place to allow Americans to have the information  that they need. Finally, we have to talk about protecting people's  right to vote. In the 2020 election, in the middle of a global  pandemic, more than 160 million Americans voted--more than ever  before--in what the then-Trump Department of Homeland Security called  the most secure election in American history.   A big reason turnout was so high in 2020 was that States went out of  their way to make it easier for people to vote because of the pandemic.   In the wake of that record voting, we saw a coordinated effort by  State legislatures to make it harder to vote. In 2021, 18 States passed  34 restrictive voting laws, but the people of this country pushed back.   Look at what happened in Georgia. There were concerted efforts to  limit voting during the runoff and make voting by mail more confusing.  Still, Georgians found a way to make their voices heard. Some observers  will look at the result and decide that, oh, this was a threat, it was  overplayed.   But to paraphrase my friend Senator Warnock, this outcome does not  mean that voter suppression does not exist, it simply means that the  people have decided their votes will not be silenced. That is what we  are dealing with right now. And we should be making an effort to make  it easier for people to vote, and the best way to do that is to set  some minimal Federal standard for voting.   The last thing I would like to say is to thank Senator Blunt, who has  been my cochair of the Rules Committee. He has been ranking, I have  been chair; I have been chair, he has been ranking. And we have worked  together, especially on the issue of protecting election workers and  making sure that Federal funding was allowed to go for that purpose.   It was Senator Blunt and I who were the last Senators here at 4 in  the morning on the night of January 6 with Vice President Pence. We  made that walk through the broken glass, by the spray-painted pillars,  with the three pairs of pages holding the mahogany boxes with the last  of the ballots up through Wyoming. We got to the House Chamber, and  democracy prevailed.   And after that, Senator Blunt and I went downstairs--the sun was  coming out--and visited the Parliamentarian's office. As I look at our  valiant staff, right now, sitting there, what I remember is the chaos  and destruction in their own office which had been targeted by the  insurrectionists.   I remember the broken picture on the floor. I remember all the papers  all over the place. That is what we saw that day, and that was forever,  ever marked in my memory of how close we were that this antiquated law  was being used as a reason for these insurrectionists to come into our  very offices.   Senator Blunt and I walked out of the Parliamentarian's office that  day, sun coming in, and I still remember, he looked at me and he said,  Well, I will see you tomorrow then. We have got a lot of work to do.   I am proud of the work we have done since then. And one of the most  important things we have done is to reform this law. And I want to  thank my colleagues that understand that that is just the beginning and  not the end.   And with that, I will turn it over to Senator Whitehouse. Thank you,  Senator Whitehouse, for your incredible leadership on campaign finance.    Madam President, I want to thank the Senators who did  such a tremendous job today really going through all the arguments for  why our democracy is still fragile, why we must stand up for a  democracy--so many good ideas.   I especially want to thank Senator Whitehouse for never giving up  hope when it comes to campaign finance reform.   I think of John McCain, if he were sitting in here right now--we miss  him very much, a friend of both Senator Whitehouse's and mine--and how  he stood up for campaign finance reform because he knew it wasn't a  Democratic or Republican issue; it was all of our issues.   I think of Senator Merkley's incredible diligence and his incredible  command of the rules of the Senate and how we can make this place work  better, and then Senator King's very Maine-like independent take on all  this, and then, Madam President, your incredible remarks, tying it  into--I hadn't thought about that fact, that on Veterans Day, which is  always after the election--and your dad's words that an election is  just a war of words and it is something you go through in a democracy  and it could be really tough, but it is nothing like a real war when  people are putting their lives on the line. So thank you for that.                                  Dream Act    Madam President, I wanted to turn to two other issues that are still  on our plates in such a big, big way--still integral, actually, to our  own democracy and what we stand for.   The first one--and I am going to be putting later into the Record  some remarks of Senator Durbin, who has been such a big supporter of  the Electoral Count Act and the like. This is another area--another  important, major, major moment for democracy that Senator Durbin has  been leading on, and that is the urgent need to ensure Dreamers can  remain here.   I was proud to support and cosponsor his efforts in the past on not  just the comprehensive immigration reform, which we know included  protections for Dreamers that we passed and which I strongly supported  out of the Judiciary Committee--when I first got to the Senate, Senator  Kennedy asked Senator Whitehouse and myself to be the first new  Senators involved in the immigration effort, which included protecting  Dreamers that President Bush supported. Each time, sadly, we have been  stymied in getting this into law. President Obama moved on his own with  Executive orders to protect Dreamers, and now their status continues-- continues--to be in limbo.   There is an urgent need right now to ensure Dreamers can remain here  in the only country that they have ever called home.   We know them in our community as teachers and healthcare workers,  builders and firefighters, reporters and entrepreneurs. Like  generations of immigrants before them, they have made our country  better; but for too long, their livelihoods have been subject to the  whims of court decisions and partisan politics.   They are incredibly sad and frustrated that Congress has not been  able to come together to make progress. Comprehensive immigration  reform should include a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, or at  least right now in this Chamber, we should pass the Dream Act.   I have been working on this for years. We have, many times, come  razor-thin close to getting it done. We passed a bill in the Senate,  then the House doesn't act; we are close to getting a deal, even during  the Trump administration, then the Trump administration gut punches us.  You, Madam President, were part of that agreement that would have  guaranteed a place in our country that is already in our hearts for our  Dreamers.   We cannot wait another day to pass the American Dream and Promise Act  and provide these Dreamers with the stability and security that they  deserve. They know no other country. Many of them, for decades, have  been here working.   I know that Democrats support this bill, and I know that there are a  number of Republicans who do, but we are never able to overcome the  opposition on the other side of the aisle that is there to bring it  forward. The time is long overdue, and we must pass the Dream Act.                            Afghan Adjustment Act    Madam President, the second issue on my mind tonight is the work that  we must do with the Afghan Adjustment Act.   This is a bill that I have been working on for the past year. I want  to thank Senator Coons, and I want to thank Senator Lindsey Graham for  working with me on this bill. I also want to thank our other cosponsors  who include Senator Blunt, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Murkowski,  Senator Shaheen, Senator Moran--who has joined the bill after we made  some changes to strengthen the vetting process; his support is very  important--Senator Leahy, Senator Wicker has joined us on this bill  now, the incoming ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. Why  is that? Because this bill is so important to our military.   So many of these Afghans have worked with our military. They had the  backs of our military. They were their translators. They did all kinds  of very, very difficult jobs to help our military and freedom in  Afghanistan. And when they came to this country, so many of them  thought we would be there for them.   Right now, their situation is tenuous, at best. They are in limbo. I  can't tell you how many members of our military have come up and said:  I don't understand. The Chief of Mission has verified their status.   Half of the Afghans--roughly half of them--who are here right now  have been vouched for by our own military.   We have put together the Afghan Adjustment Act based on instructions  from the past. We saw what happened to the Vietnamese and the Hmong--I  know in my own State we have the second biggest population of Hmong in  the country--that they came here and our country knew that we owed them  something because they had stood with us. We put them on a path that  involved green cards, which is what we are doing here.    All we are trying to do here is actually more intense than what we  did back then. I just ask the other Senators to look at the Hmong and  Vietnamese in their own communities. They are now many generations  ahead. They are police officers. They are serving in the State  legislature. They are pillars of their community. And in the Afghans,  we have the same possibility.   I remind my colleagues: They are already here. That is why Senator  Wicker has now joined us, because there is the belief--and Senator  Graham. I am hoping that we will have a group come together tomorrow to  talk about this.   Senator Graham understands as well as from his own service, when  people have your back overseas in the hardest of times, you do not  abandon them when they are in a hard time. That is going to get around  the world if we just let them sit in limbo. So this is truly our moment  to at least start this process.  [[Page S9603]]    What does it mean? Well, it means, according to this bill, that we  will be doing a vetting of the Afghans who, I note to my colleagues,  are already here. They will submit to additional vetting, including in- person interviews. It makes the process much more orderly and much more  thorough, which is why you see conservatives joining this bill.   This bill has earned the support of some of our Nation's most revered  military leaders, including Admirals Mike Mullen, William McRaven,  James Stavridis, and Generals Richard Myers, Joseph Dunford, Stan  McChrystal. They support this bill.   The Veterans of Foreign Wars--the VFW--supports this bill. The  American Legion supports this bill. Their members have been here in  Members' offices asking them to support it.   I cannot tell you how important it was to Senator Coons and myself to  make sure that this bill was bipartisan in nature. We worked very hard  all summer to strengthen the bill, to get at the concerns of our  colleagues. That is why we have such a strong group of Senators  supporting the bill.   This is our moment to get this done. If we are unable to finish it at  the end of the year, I consider this not an end but a beginning. We are  so close to getting--as I know from my discussions with my colleagues-- more and more Republicans on this bill. I think that is because they  understand that if we leave these people who helped us in limbo, what  will people think the next time when they ask for our help in another  country, in another war, in another conflict?   I implore my colleagues to join us in this effort. I am looking  forward to tomorrow when we will have a bipartisan group of Senators  take the floor. But I didn't want to let another day go by without  mentioning how important it is to get this done.   I yield the floor. I know we have been joined by Senator Lee.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following notice be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       Senate Procurement Regulations    (Adopted by the Committee on Rules and Administration on December 19,                                   2022)         Pursuant to jurisdiction over the payment of money from the       contingent fund of the Senate, as set forth in 2 U.S.C.       Sec. 6503 and Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration hereby       establishes the following Senate Procurement Regulations.       These Regulations govern the procurement of personal property       and non-personal services with appropriated and revolving       account funds in the Senate. These Regulations replace and       supersede the Senate Procurement Regulations approved by the       Rules Committee on December 31, 1998, as amended on September       13, 1999.                                   Part 1                              GENERAL PROVISIONS       1.1 Definitions        Unless a different definition is prescribed for a specific       portion of these Regulations or the context clearly requires       a different meaning, the following definitions apply:        ``Approval authority'' means a person who is authorized to       approve a procurement within the limits specified in these       Regulations. Approval authorities include Senators, chairs of       Senate committees, and officers of the Senate.        ``Acquisition'' means the acquiring by contract of supplies       or services by and for the use of the Senate through purchase       or lease, whether the supplies or services are already in       existence or must be created, developed, demonstrated, and       evaluated. Acquisition begins at the point when needs are       established and includes the description of requirements to       satisfy needs, solicitation and selection of sources, award       of contracts, contract financing, contract performance,       contract administration, and those technical and management       functions directly related to the process of fulfilling       Senate needs by contract.        ``Business day'' excludes Saturdays, Sundays and Federal       holidays.        ``Chair'' means the Chair of the Senate Committee on Rules       and Administration.        ``Commercial item'' means an item customarily used by the       general public or for nongovernmental purposes that (1) has       been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public; (2) has       been offered for sale, lease, or license to the general       public; or (3) has evolved from a commercial item through       advances in technology or performance and that is not yet       available to the general public, but will be available in the       commercial marketplace in time to satisfy the delivery       requirements under a Senate solicitation. The term includes       services associated with supporting commercial items and       services of a type offered or sold competitively in       substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace on the       basis of established catalog or market prices for specific       tasks performed under standard commercial terms and       conditions.        ``Contract'' means a mutually binding legal relationship       obligating the seller to furnish supplies or services and the       buyer to pay for such supplies or services. It includes all       types of commitments that obligate the Senate to an       expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as       otherwise authorized, are made in writing. In addition to       bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited       to) awards and notices of awards; orders issued under basic       ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as       purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective       by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract       modifications.        ``Contract modification'' means any written change to the       terms of the contract through one of the following types of       contract actions:        (a) Bilateral. A bilateral modification (supplemental       agreement) is a contract modification that is signed by the       contractor and the contracting officer. Bilateral       modifications are used to:        (1) Make negotiated equitable adjustments resulting from       the issuance of a change order; and        (2) Reflect other agreements of the parties modifying the       terms of contracts.        (b) Unilateral. A unilateral modification is a contract       modification that is signed only by the contracting officer.       Unilateral modifications are used, for example, to:        (1) Make administrative changes;        (2) Issue change orders;        (3) Make changes authorized by clauses other than a changes       clause; and        (4) Issue termination notices.        ``Contracting officer'' means a person delegated authority       by the Senate Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the       Senate, to enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts       and make related determinations and findings on behalf of the       Senate.        ``Contracting officer representative'' means an individual       designated and authorized in writing by the contracting       officer to perform specific technical or administrative       functions to assist in the technical monitoring or       administration of a contract. A contracting officer       representative is nominated by the approval authority and       appointed by a contracting officer.        ``Cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost contract'' means contracts       under which a contractor receives reimbursement of its actual       costs, plus payment of a percentage of those actual costs as       profit.        ``Day'' means, unless otherwise specified, a calendar day.        ``Governmentwide acquisition contract'' (GWAC) means a       task-order or delivery-order contract for information       technology established by one agency for governmentwide use.        ``Governmentwide point of entry'' (GPE) means the single       point where government business opportunities, including       synopses of  [[Page S9620]]       proposed contract actions, solicitations, and associated       information, can be accessed electronically by the public.       The GPE is located at https://sam.gov/.        ``GSA eBuy'' is an electronic Request for Quotation system       designed to allow ordering activities to post requirements,       obtain quotes, and issue orders for services and products       offered through the U.S. General Services Administration's       (GSA) multiple award schedule and GSA technology contracts.        ``Indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract'' (IDIQ)       means a type of contract that provides for an indefinite       quantity of supply or services during a fixed period of time.       These contracts are used when the Senate cannot determine the       exact time, or the precise quantities of products or services       that it will need. These contracts are awarded for a base       year and option years and allow the Senate to place delivery       orders or task orders against the base contract for       individual requirements. An IDIQ contract may specify a       minimum quantity that should not exceed an amount that the       Senate is fairly certain to order; a maximum quantity under       each task or delivery order and for all orders during       specific periods of time (base year, option year, total       contract period of performance); and ordering procedures       that, in a multi-award IDIQ contract, provide an opportunity       for all contract holders to respond to task order requests.        ``Interested party'' means an actual or prospective bidder       or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected       by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a       contract. After the submission of proposals, an interested       party must be an actual bidder or offeror with a direct       economic interest.        ``Lowest price technically acceptable'' means a source       selection process in which award is made on the basis of the       lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the       acceptability standards for non-cost factors.        ``Micro-purchase'' means an acquisition the aggregate       amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold       which is established at $10,000.        ``Multiple year contract'' means a contract having a term       of more than one (1) year separated by option periods not to       exceed one year each.        ``Multi-year contract'' means a contract for the purchase       of supplies or services for more than one (1), but not more       than five (5), program years. A multi-year contract may       provide that performance under the contract during the second       and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the       appropriation of funds, and, if it does so provide, may       provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the       contractor if appropriations are not made. The key       distinguishing difference between multi-year contracts and       multiple year contracts is that multi-year contracts buy more       than one (1) year's requirement of a product or service       without establishing and having to exercise an option for       each program year after the first.        ``Option'' means a unilateral right in a contract by which,       for a specified time, the Senate may elect to purchase       additional supplies or services called for by the contract,       or may elect to extend the term of the contract.        ``Personal services contract'' means a contract that, by       its express terms or as administered, makes the contractor       personnel appear to be, in effect, Senate employees.        ``Procurement(s)''. See ``Acquisition.''        ``Procurement Procedures'' mean those procedures issued by       the Senate Sergeant at Arms, in consultation with the       Secretary of the Senate, subject to the approval of the Chair       acting on behalf of the Rules Committee, governing the       acquisition of supplies or services processed by the Senate       Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the Senate.        ``Property'' means personal property, as opposed to real       property.        ``Ratification'' means the act of approving an unauthorized       commitment by an official who has the authority to do so.        ``Rules Committee'' means the Senate Committee on Rules and       Administration.        ``Services'' means non-personal services; personal service       contracts are prohibited unless specifically authorized by       the Senate. See 2 U.S.C. 6505.        ``Shall'' means the imperative.        ``Small purchase'' means an acquisition in an aggregate       amount that exceeds $10,000, but does not exceed $100,000.        ``Simplified acquisition'' is a contracting method for       acquisitions in an aggregate amount that exceeds $100,000 but       does not exceed $250,000 or, in the case of commercial items,       does not exceed $7,500,000, which reduces the amount of       paperwork associated with solicitation and evaluation of       offers.        (a) When soliciting proposals or quotations in a simplified       acquisition procurement, the contracting office may publish a       single synopsis/solicitation, and shall provide a reasonable       response period that may be less than thirty (30) days.        (b) When selecting a contractor in a simplified acquisition       procurement, there is no requirement for a formal evaluation       plan, establishing a competitive range, or conducting       discussions. The contracting officer has broad discretion to       establish suitable evaluation procedures, which shall be       disclosed in the combined synopsis/solicitation.        (c) The contracting officer may choose the successful       offeror.        (d) Documentation may be kept to a minimum. The contracting       officer shall record a determination of price reasonableness,       supporting documentation such as abstracts of prices and, if       other than price-related factors were considered, and a       narrative statement reflecting the basis for the award       decision.        ``Unauthorized commitment'' means an agreement that is not       binding upon the Senate solely because the representative who       made it lacked the authority to enter into that agreement on       behalf of the Senate.        ``Unauthorized contract award'' means a contract award made       without the approvals required by these Regulations, but that       would otherwise have been proper if all necessary approvals       were obtained prior to contract award.      1.2 Authority        (a) Pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 6503 and Rule XXV of the Standing       Rules of the Senate, the Chair, acting on behalf of the Rules       Committee, approves all vouchers that will be charged to the       contingent fund of the Senate. To facilitate the approval of       vouchers, all expenses to be approved by the Chair must be       incurred in accordance with these Regulations.        (b) The Senate Sergeant at Arms shall be responsible for       processing procurements, including procurements initiated by       Senate committees of more than $100,000, through the Senate       Sergeant at Arms Acquisition Office, as set forth in these       Regulations. The Secretary of the Senate shall be responsible       for procurements initiated by the Secretary of the Senate,       but may utilize the Sergeant at Arms Acquisitions Office to       assist with processing such procurements.        (c) All additional procedures to be issued by the Senate       Sergeant at Arms, in consultation with the Secretary of the       Senate, pursuant to these Regulations, must be approved by       the Rules Committee before taking effect.      1.3 Exceptions        These Regulations apply to all Senate procurements except--        (a) Procurement of consultant services by the Majority and       Minority Conference Committees of the Senate pursuant to 2       U.S.C. 6157; by the Standing Committees of the Senate       pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 4301; by the Majority Leader, Minority       Leader, Secretary of the Senate, or Legislative Counsel of       the Senate pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 6501; or by the Senate       Sergeant at Arms pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 6599;        (b) Procurements by the Secretary of the Senate for       supplies pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 4102-4106, 6572; or for the       operation of the Senate Gift Shop pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 6576;       or for substitute or temporary reporters of debates or expert       transcribers pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 6544;        (c) Procurements that involve funds in a Senator's official       personnel and office expense account;        (d) Procurements of $100,000 or less that involve funds in       a Senate committee account;        (e) Procurements of access to digital or print       subscriptions to news media services;        (f) Procurements of access to digital or print       subscriptions to research databases or related services;        (g) Procurements of utility services (including but not       limited to internet, frame relay, cellular,       telecommunication, or satellite services, and related devices       bundled with such services) that are recurring in nature or       are reimbursed to the Senate Sergeant at Arms from office or       other official expense accounts over which they have general       authority to expend funds;        (h) Procurements of utility services (including, but not       limited to internet, frame relay, cellular,       telecommunications, or satellite services and related devices       bundled with such services) for the Senate Sergeant at Arms;        (i) Leases for Senators' home state offices space pursuant       to 2 U.S.C. 6317 and funded by the Senate Sergeant at Arms       and signed for by a Senator directly;        (j) Reimbursement of the Department of Homeland Security,       Federal Protective Service, for security services for       Senators' state offices located in GSA facilities;        (k) Acquisition of furniture, equipment, and office       furnishings provided by GSA pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 6317, in       addition to any space alteration performed by the GSA; and        (l) When the exigencies of the Senate require deviation       from these Regulations, as evidenced by written authorization       from the Chair, acting on behalf of the Rules Committee.      1.4 Rules Committee Approval        (a) The following procurements may be processed without the       prior approval of the Chair.

(b) All other procurements, including multi-year contracts       of any amount, that are not otherwise exempt from these       Regulations, must be approved in advance by the Chair, acting       on behalf of the Rules Committee.      1.5 Delegation of Authority        With the approval of the Chair, acting on behalf of the       Rules Committee, the Secretary of the Senate and Senate       Sergeant at Arms may delegate procurement authority. Such       delegations shall be in writing and shall state the limits of       the procurement authority to be delegated.      1.6 Required Procedures        (a) Procurements by Senate Personal Offices are exempt from       these Regulations. However, for procurements exceeding       $10,000, Senate Personal Offices are encouraged to seek the       assistance of the Acquisition Office of the Senate Sergeant       at Arms.        (b) Procurements by Senate committees in the amount of       $100,000 or less are exempt from these Regulations. However,       for procurements exceeding $10,000, Senate committees are       encouraged to seek the assistance of the Acquisition Office       of the Senate Sergeant at Arms.        (c) The Senate Sergeant at Arms shall issue the Sergeant at       Arms Procurement Procedures, in consultation with the       Secretary of the Senate, subject to the approval of the       Chair, acting on behalf of the Rules Committee, governing the       acquisition of supplies or services processed by the Senate       Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the Senate, as follows--        (1) Micro-purchase procedures governing procurements of       $10,000 or less, in accordance with the policies set forth in       paragraph 2.2(a);        (2) Small purchase procedures governing procurements that       exceed $10,000 but do not exceed $100,000, in accordance with       the policies set forth in paragraph 2.2(b); and        (3) Simplified acquisition procedures governing       procurements that exceed $100,000 but do not exceed $250,000       or, in the case of commercial items, does not exceed       $7,500,000, in accordance with the policies set forth in       paragraph 2.2(c).      1.7 Waiver of These Regulations        The Chair, acting on behalf of the Rules Committee, may       grant a waiver to any provision of these Regulations, as       required to meet the needs of the Senate, consistent with       applicable law, Standing Rules of the Senate, and Standing       Orders of the Senate.      1.8 Prohibition on Splitting Procurements        Requirements shall not be split into multiple smaller       procurements in order to keep the value within any approval       limits or required regulation limits set forth in these       Regulations. During acquisition planning, every reasonable       effort shall be made to anticipate and include within a       procurement all subsequent requirements for the same products       or services within the same fiscal year.      1.9 Personal Services Contracts Prohibited        Contracts for personal services are not permitted under       these Regulations, unless specifically authorized by the       Senate, pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 6505 or other applicable law.      1.10 Ratification of Unauthorized Contract Awards        All contracts shall be entered into with appropriate       authorization. An unauthorized contract award, if otherwise       proper, may be ratified in writing by an approval authority       with the authority to award the contract pursuant to these       Regulations.      1.11 Conflict of Interest        Transactions relating to the expenditure of public funds       require the highest degree of public trust. In dealing with       contractors, Senate personnel are subject to the Senate Code       of Official Conduct and applicable law, and should make every       effort to avoid even the appearance of impropriety or of a       conflict of interest. Their official conduct should be such       that they would have no reluctance to make a full public       disclosure of their actions.      1.12 Contracts with Business Concerns Substantially Owned or           Controlled by Senate Employees        Contracts between the Senate and employees of the Senate or       business concerns or organizations substantially owned or       controlled by Senate employees shall be avoided. Exceptions       may be made only with the approval of the Chair, acting on       behalf of the Rules Committee, consistent with applicable       laws and the Senate Code of Official Conduct. In addition,       Senate employees shall not participate in any decision,       recommendation, award, or other activity regarding a contract       with a business concern or organization in which they have a       financial interest and are prohibited from such activity if       their financial interest represents a substantial portion of       the holdings or assets of the Senate employee.      1.13 Protection of Sensitive Information        Personal, proprietary, or Senate procurement information       are considered ``sensitive'' information and shall not be       released to the public.      1.14 Firms or Individuals Ineligible for Federal Contracts        The governmentwide point of entry provides access to active       exclusion records for organizations and individuals       indicating if they are debarred, suspended, or otherwise       ineligible for the award of contracts above the micro-      purchase threshold by the Senate. Contracts above the micro-      purchase threshold shall not knowingly be awarded to a firm       or individual that are debarred, suspended, or otherwise       ineligible for award. Inquiries may be directed to the       Acquisition Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms.      1.15 Small Businesses        Procurement of Senate requirements from small business       concerns and small business development programs is       encouraged but not mandated. Small business concerns may be       identified through the Dynamic Small Business Search tool,       available through the Small Business Administration.      1.16 Responsible Prospective Contractors        Contracts shall be awarded only to prospective contractors       that have demonstrated a satisfactory record of past       performance and the capacity, capability, and financial means       to complete the contract.      1.17 Prohibition on Cost-Plus-a-Percentage-of-Cost Contracts        Contracts under which a contractor receives reimbursement       of its actual costs, plus payment of profit as a specified       percentage of the contractor's actual cost of accomplishing       the work, are prohibited. Any fee or profit to be paid to a       contractor shall be negotiated separately and not be computed       as a percentage of actual cost. Contracts shall avoid       computations of fees or profits that may create an incentive       to increase a contractor's reimbursable costs.                                   Part 2                                   POLICIES       2.1 Competition        (a) All purchases and contracts shall be made on a       competitive basis to the maximum extent practicable,       consistent with the best interests of the Senate.       Procurements shall be structured to provide an equitable       opportunity to all prospective, qualified contractors to the       maximum extent practicable.        (b) Reasonable acquisition planning and appropriate market       research shall be conducted prior to efforts to compete       Senate procurements.        (c) It is the policy of the Senate that specifications       should be performance-based and should not include features       available from only one vendor, or requirements able to be       met by only one vendor, unless those features or requirements       represent a mandatory requirement of the Senate.      2.2 Micro-purchases, Small Purchases, and Simplified           Acquisition Procedures        (a) Micro-purchases        (1) For Senate procurements of $10,000 or less, the       purchase card should be used to the maximum extent       practicable and require no more than one quote if the       purchase card holder determines that the price is reasonable       and that the procurement has not been split to avoid a       requirement for competition.        (b) Small Purchases        (1) Senate procurements that exceed $10,000 but do not       exceed $100,000 shall be conducted as follows:        (i) The procedures may permit awards on the basis of       documented comparison of at least three competitive       quotations, if available, with or without advertisement on       the GPE or another authorized location for posting       procurement notices.        (c) Simplified Acquisition Procedures        (1) Senate procurements within the simplified acquisition       threshold, that exceed $100,000 but do not exceed $250,000       or, in the case of commercial items, does not exceed       $7,500,000, shall be conducted consistent with the definition       of ``simplified acquisition procedures'' set forth in this       Regulation and as follows:        (i) The procedures may require advertisement, if required       by the Rules Committee, of procurement opportunities on the       GPE or another authorized location for posting procurement       notices (e.g. GSA eBuy), which may be in the form of a       combined synopsis/solicitation or special notice, and may       provide for any reasonable response time, which may be fewer       than thirty (30) days.        (ii) The procedures shall provide for the use of simplified       acquisition procedures for purchases of commercial items up       to $7,500,000.        (iii) If a lowest price technically acceptable source       selection process is used, a request for quotations can be       issued in writing to a minimum of three vendors.      2.3 Procurements Exceeding the Simplified Acquisition           Threshold        (a) Senate procurements in amounts that exceed the       simplified acquisition threshold set forth in section 2.2,       shall be conducted on the basis of full and open competition,       to the extent practicable, and the Rules Committee may       require that the procurement be advertised on the GPE for a       period of not less than thirty (30) days, unless an exception       to this requirement applies. If a lowest price technically       acceptable source selection process is  [[Page S9622]]       used, a request for quotation can be issued in writing to a       minimum of three vendors.        (b) Negotiated Procurements        (1) In conducting negotiated procurements, the Senate       Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the Senate, as       appropriate, may issue a request for proposal that contains       necessary contractual provisions and describes the Senate's       requirements and the basis upon which the successful offeror       will be selected, and soliciting proposals.        (2) Alternatively, the Senate Sergeant at Arms or the       Secretary of the Senate, as appropriate, may publish a       sources sought notice or a request for information (RFI) in       order to identify firms or individuals from whom proposals       may be solicited. The notice or RFI shall summarize the       Senate's requirements and solicit abbreviated descriptions of       contractor capabilities and experience and may include other       information including sample pricing, the Senate Sergeant at       Arms or Secretary of the Senate, as appropriate, deems       necessary. The notice or RFI may advise that requests for       proposals be issued only to those respondents determined to       be the best qualified in accordance with the criteria set       forth in the notice or RFI.        (3) Competitive Range and Discussions        (i) After receipt and evaluation of initial proposals from       a Senate Sergeant at Arms or Secretary of the Senate, as       appropriate, issued request for proposal, the Senate Sergeant       at Arms or Secretary of the Senate, as appropriate, may       establish a competitive range consisting of only the highest-      rated proposals, and may conduct exchanges limited to those       offerors whose proposals are within the competitive range.        (ii) Offerors whose proposals are not selected for the       competitive range shall be given prompt notice.        (c) Requests for Quotations        (RFQ) and Invitations for Bids        (1) If the Senate Sergeant at Arms or Secretary of the       Senate, as appropriate, concludes, during acquisition       planning, that discussions with the offerors will not be       required, the Senate Sergeant at Arms or Secretary of the       Senate, as appropriate, may issue a RFQ or invitation for       bids.        (d) GSA Schedules        (1) The Senate Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the       Senate, as appropriate, may, without prior publication of a       procurement notice, procure supplies and services from the       GSA Schedules if the proposed contract or order will be       issued to the schedule vendor representing the best value to       the Senate, price and other factors considered.        (2) The Senate Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the       Senate, as appropriate, may order products or services from       the GSA Schedules, in accordance with prescribed GSA       procedures which shall be considered to meet the requirements       of full and open competition under these Regulations.        (3) The Senate Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the       Senate, as appropriate, shall seek competitive pricing to the       degree practicable, in accordance with GSA procedures.       Evidence of compliance with GSA procedures when using GSA       eBuy and the basis for any best-value tradeoff determination       shall be recorded in the contract file.        (e) Senate IDIQ Contracts and Agreements, and other       Agency's GWACs        (1) The Senate Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the       Senate, as appropriate, may, without prior publication of a       procurement notice, procure supplies and services from Senate       single-award; multiple-award IDIQ contracts or blanket       purchase agreements; or other agencies' GWACs in accordance       with terms and conditions of those contracts.        (2) The Senate Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the       Senate, as appropriate, shall ensure that all holders of       multiple-award contracts are considered for the issuance of       the task order, and that competitive pricing is obtained.        (3) The Senate Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the       Senate, as appropriate, shall record the basis for any best-      value tradeoff determination in the contract file.        (f) Unsuccessful Offerors        (1) The Senate Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the       Senate, as appropriate, shall give unsuccessful offerors       prompt notice that their quotations or proposals were not       accepted, normally within five (5) business days of the       contract award.

To the maximum extent       practicable, the brief explanation should be furnished within       ten (10) business days after receipt of the written request.      2.4 Records of Contract Actions        All actions taken with respect to a contract, including       final disposition, shall be documented in a contract file. To       the extent that existing documents do not reflect all actions       taken, a signed and dated contemporaneous memoranda or       summary statement describing such contract actions shall be       prepared and retained in the contract file.      2.5 Contract Clauses        The contracting officers shall ensure that all Senate       contracts include all clauses necessary to comply with       applicable Federal law.                                   Part 3                                   PROTESTS       3.1 General        (a) Senate procurement actions may be protested by any       interested party on the basis that the procurement action is       improper or in violation of applicable federal law, Senate       rule or Senate Regulation.        (b) No protest under paragraph 3.1(a) is authorized in       connection with the award of a contract or the issuance of a       task order, except:        (1) A protest of a contract award valued in excess of       $100,000.        (2) A protest of a task order valued in excess of       $10,000,000.        (c) Protests of procurement actions shall be addressed to       the Senate Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the Senate,       as appropriate, within the time limits prescribed in       paragraph 3.2(b). The Senate Sergeant at Arms or the       Secretary of the Senate, as appropriate, shall respond to all       protests, and take appropriate action to remedy improprieties       to include termination of an awarded contract.        (d) Reimbursement of bid and proposal costs or any fees       associated with a bid protest proceeding as well as payment       for any products or services not provided to the Senate are       not authorized.      3.2 Protest Procedures        (a) Filing a Protest        (1) An interested party protesting a Senate procurement       action as permitted by section 3.1 shall submit such protest,       by email to SAAA[email protected]. A copy of the       protest shall be furnished to the Chair.        (2) Protests shall be concise and logically presented to       facilitate review. Failure to substantially comply with any       of the requirements of paragraph 3.2(a)(3) may be grounds for       dismissal of the protest.        (3) Protests shall include the following information:        (i) Name, address, email, and fax and telephone numbers of       the protester.        (ii) Senate solicitation or contract number.        (iii) Detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds       for the protest, to include a description of resulting       prejudice to the protester.        (iv) Copies of relevant documents.        (v) Request for a ruling by the Senate Sergeant at Arms or       by the Secretary of the Senate, as appropriate.        (vi) Statement as to the form of relief requested.        (vii) All information establishing that the protester is an       interested party for the purpose of filing a protest.        (viii) All information establishing the timeliness of the       protest.        (b) Time for Filing        (1) Protests challenging the propriety of the solicitation       must be filed before the closing date for receipt of initial       proposals. In the case of a negotiated procurement, alleged       improprieties that do not exist in the initial solicitation       but are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation, must       be protested no later than the next closing date for receipt       of proposals following the incorporation.        (2) In cases other than those covered in paragraph       3.2(b)(1), protests must be filed not later than ten (10)       days after the basis for protest is known or should have been       known, whichever is earlier.        (3) Failure to timely file shall be grounds for dismissal       of the protest.        (4) The term ``filed'' as used in this section means       received by the Senate Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of       the Senate, by email, at the address identified in paragraph       3.2(a). Protests must be filed before 5:00 p.m. (ET), unless       otherwise stated. Protests received after the time limits       prescribed in this section, or by other than email to the       identified email address for filing, will not be considered.        (5) If the end of a filing period measured in days does not       fall on a business day, the next business day shall be the       last day of the period.        (c) Response and Comment        (1) Upon receiving a protest, the Secretary of the Senate       or the Senate Sergeant at Arms, as appropriate, shall       determine whether the protester is an interested party.        (2) The Secretary of the Senate or the Senate Sergeant at       Arms, as appropriate, shall attempt to resolve protests       informally. If this effort is unsuccessful, notice of the       protest shall be made to the successful offeror if award has       been made or, if no award has been made, to all offerors that       appear to have a substantial and reasonable prospect of       receiving an award. Informal resolution shall generally       conclude fifteen (15) days from the filing of the protest.        (3) Following the unsuccessful informal resolution to the       protest, the Secretary of the Senate or the Senate Sergeant       at Arms, as appropriate, shall provide copies of all relevant       and material information submitted by a protestor in support       of the protest to the contractor if the award has been made,       or, if no award has been made, to interested parties, who       appear to have a substantial prospect of receiving an award,       for comment, unless withholding of the information is       required by applicable law or regulation or because the       information is proprietary or solely personal in nature. The       protester shall have the opportunity to redact all       confidential and proprietary information. Allegedly       proprietary or confidential information must be specifically       identified as such wherever it appears, and the statement       must specifically  [[Page S9623]]       address which parties should not be given access to the       information, as well as the basis for restricting the access.        (4) The Secretary of the Senate or the Senate Sergeant at       Arms, as appropriate, shall prepare a response to the protest       as expeditiously as possible following the unsuccessful       informal resolution to the protest. The response shall       generally be finalized within thirty (30) days following the       unsuccessful informal resolution to the protest. A copy of       the response shall be furnished to the protestor and other       interested parties that appear to have a substantial prospect       of receiving an award, who shall be provided an equitable       opportunity for comment, not more than fifteen (15) days       following the issuance of the response noted in paragraph       3.2(c)(4).        (5) Comments must be filed before 5:00 p.m. (ET), unless       otherwise stated. Failure of a protestor or any interested       party to comply with the time limits set in accordance with       this section may result in resolution of the protest without       consideration of comments untimely filed.        (6) If the end of a filing period measured in days does not       fall on a business day, the next business day shall be the       last day of the period.        (d) Withholding of Award        (1) When a protest has been filed before award, the       Secretary of the Senate or Senate Sergeant at Arms, as       appropriate, should not make an award before the protest is       resolved unless the Secretary of the Senate or the Senate       Sergeant at Arms, as appropriate, determines that the item       being procured is urgently needed or other compelling       circumstances exist.        (e) Time for Decision        (1) Every effort should be made to issue a decision on a       protest expeditiously after receipt of all information       submitted by all interested parties. The Secretary of the       Senate or the Senate Sergeant at Arms shall make their best       efforts to resolve protests within one hundred (100) days       after the protest is filed.        (f) Appeals        (1) Any interested party that submitted comments during       consideration of the protest may appeal a decision on the       protest. The appeal shall contain a detailed statement of the       factual and legal grounds upon which reversal or modification       is sought, specifying any errors of law, and shall be       submitted to the Chair, by email to A[email protected].       A copy of the appeal shall be furnished to the Senate       Sergeant at Arms or the Secretary of the Senate, as       appropriate, by email to SAAA[email protected].        (2) Appeals shall be filed no later than ten (10) business       days after the basis for reconsideration is known or should       have been known, whichever is earlier. The term ``filed'' as       used in this section means received by the Rules Committee,       in accordance with paragraph 3.2(f)(1). Appeals must be filed       before 5:00 p.m. (EST), unless otherwise stated. Failure to       comply with the time limits set in accordance with this       section may result in dismissal of the appeal.        (3) The Chair, acting on behalf of the Rules Committee, is       the final decision authority on protests involving a Senate       procurement. At their discretion, the Chair, acting on behalf       of the Rules Committee, may ask the Comptroller General for       an advisory opinion.        (g) Basis for Sustaining a Protest After Award        (1) A protest will not be sustained after contract award       unless it is demonstrated that the protester was prejudiced;       that is, that the protester would have been awarded a       contract but for an impropriety or violation of law,       regulation, or Senate rule, that was identified by the       protest.        (h) Remedies        (1) The Chair, acting on behalf of the Rules Committee,       may, in their discretion, order any appropriate remedy in the       event of a successful bid protest, including:        (i) The solicitation may be modified and procurement       activity resumed.        (ii) An awarded contract may be terminated and procurement       activity resumed.        (iii) An awarded contract may be terminated, and award may       be made to the protestor, if appropriate.        (2) Nothing in these Regulations precludes the termination       or modification of the procurement if such action is deemed       to be in the Senate's best interest.                                   Part 4                                   DISPUTES       4.1 General        I. is inevitable that, from time to time, disagreements or       disputes regarding the terms or performance of a contract       will arise between the Senate and its contractors. The prompt       and fair resolution of these matters is in the best interests       of the Senate. Informal resolution of disagreements or       disputes through negotiated agreement is preferred.      4.2 Dispute Procedures        (a) All disputes shall be submitted to       SAAA[email protected].        (b) For contracts up to $100,000, the original approval       authority shall issue a final determination on all unresolved       disputes provided that the determination does not have the       effect of increasing the contract cost beyond the approval       authority's procurement authority plus twenty (20) percent of       the original contract price. Approval authorities may       recommend to the Chair approval of a contractor's claim       exceeding their authority.        (c) For contracts exceeding $100,000, the Secretary of the       Senate or the Senate Sergeant at Arms, as appropriate, shall       issue a final determination on all unresolved disputes       provided that the determination does not have the effect of       increasing the contract cost beyond the approval authorities       set forth in paragraph 1.4(a)(4)(ii). The Secretary of the       Senate or the Senate Sergeant at Arms may recommend to the       Chair, approval of a contractor's claim that exceeds this       authority.        (d) All final determinations from the Secretary of the       Senate or the Senate Sergeant at Arms may be appealed to the       Chair.        (e) Approval authorities shall notify the Secretary of the       Senate or the Senate Sergeant at Arms, as appropriate,       whenever it appears that a significant disagreement or       dispute is incapable of resolution by negotiation and that it       will be necessary to invoke the formal dispute procedures.        (f) All final determinations shall include the following       language:        ``This determination is made in accordance with the       disputes clause and shall be final unless, within thirty (30)       business days from the date of its receipt, a written notice       of appeal is filed with the Chair of the Senate Committee on       Rules and Administration and furnished to the approval       authority. The notice of appeal, which must be signed by you       as the contractor or by an attorney acting on your behalf,       and which may be in letter form, shall indicate that an       appeal is intended and shall refer to this document and       identify the contract by number. The notice of appeal shall       include a statement of the reasons why the determination       decision is considered to be erroneous. The Chair of the       Committee on Rules and Administration, acting on behalf of       the Committee, may ask the Comptroller General for a       recommendation on the appeal.''      4.3 Time for Filing a Claim        Claims must be filed within ninety (90) days of the date       the claim accrued.      4.4 Negotiated Resolutions        Approval authorities may negotiate resolutions involving       contract modifications only to the extent such modifications       are within their authority.      4.5 Appeal Authority        The Chair, acting on behalf of the Rules Committee, is the       final authority for review of final decisions regarding       contract disputes and shall be designated as such in all       contracts when the determination has the effect of increasing       the contract cost beyond the approval authorities set forth       in paragraph 1.4(a)(4)(ii). The Chair, acting on behalf of       the Rules Committee, may ask the Comptroller General for an       advisory opinion.      4.6 Time for Appeals        (a) Appeals from a final determination must be filed with       the Chair within thirty (30) business days of the appellant's       receipt of the determination in order to be considered by the       Chair. For the purposes of this section, ``filed'' means       received by the Rules Committee. Appeals must be filed before       5:00 p.m. (ET), unless otherwise stated.        (b) If the end of a filing period measured in days does not       fall on a business day, the next business day shall be the       last day of the period.        (c) Failure to comply with the time limits set in       accordance with this section may result in dismissal of the       appeal.                            ____________________
