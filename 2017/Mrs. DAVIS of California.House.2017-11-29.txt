 Mr. Speaker, in a year where we are dealing  with healthcare, immigration, and, yes,  [[Page H9478]]  taxes, I am very pleased by the volume of mail that I have gotten from  my constituents on all of those issues. But I have to tell you the one  issue that my constituents have contacted me most on is net neutrality.   I hear from young people and college students, many who have been  calling for the first time about wanting an internet that is free from  the meddling of a few large internet providers.   As we know, the internet is perhaps one of the most important  advances of our time. It is a tool that allows citizens to connect from  all over the country and even the world and improves the quality of  life.   From elementary to graduate level students, all would be affected if  the title II regulations were changed. From the student finishing  homework to military families keeping in touch, we need a free and open  internet.   So why attack an institution that benefits millions for the gain of a  few big cable companies?   Please join me in contacting the FCC to tell them net neutrality  matters to our constituents and it certainly matters to all of us.                            ____________________
