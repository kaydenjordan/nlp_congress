 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Murphy- Paul-Franken resolution of disapproval and to outline my concerns about  the unfettered sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. The Saudi-led war in Yemen  has created a humanitarian disaster in one of the region's poorest  countries. Many thousands of civilians have been killed, many more made  homeless, and millions are at risk of starvation, according to the  United Nations refugee agency. The chaos in Yemen has also been  strategically disastrous for the United States, providing fertile  ground for extremist groups like al-Qaida and ISIS and creating new  opportunities for Iranian intervention.   In addition to being morally indefensible and strategically  shortsighted, the Trump administration's unconditional support for the  Saudi coalition, including billions of dollars in arms sales, risks  dragging the United States into yet another war in the Middle East.   These are the reasons I strongly support the resolution of  disapproval offered by my colleagues and their effort to block some of  these arms sales to Saudi Arabia.   I also think it is long past time that we begin to take a very hard  look at our relationship with Saudi Arabia. This is a country that is  run by a hereditary monarchy in which women are treated as third-class  citizens.   I would like to mention for a moment the case of Loujain Alhathloul,  a Saudi Arabian human rights activist who was arrested at King Fahd  International Airport on June 4. She has been an advocate for women's  rights in Saudi Arabia.   In 2014, she was arrested for defying the country's ban--are you  ready for this--on women drivers and imprisoned for 73 days.   In 2015, she ran as a candidate in a local council election--the  third in the nation's modern history and the first in which women were  allowed to both  [[Page S3424]]  vote and run--even though her name was never added to the ballot.   More recently, Alhathloul criticized a Saudi Government-sponsored  women's empowerment summit, which was attended by Ivanka Trump, for its  lack of inclusiveness.   While she has now been released from jail--and I am very glad to hear  that--this is no way to treat a peaceful dissident. The human rights  organization Amnesty International reported that during her detention,  Alhathloul was not allowed access to an attorney, nor was allowed to  speak to her family.   Finally and perhaps more significantly, it is important that here on  the floor of the Senate, we begin to discuss the decades-long effort by  Saudi Arabia to export an ultra-reactionary form of Islam throughout  the world.   A recent piece in the Boston Globe by Stephen Kinzer, a journalist  who has covered the Middle East for many years--Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent to have his article printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Boston Globe, June 11, 2017]                  Saudi Arabia Is Destabilizing the World                            (By Stephen Kinzer)         Just a few months ago, the governor of Indonesia's largest       city, Jakarta, seemed headed for easy reelection despite the       fact that he is a Christian in a mostly Muslim country.       Suddenly everything went violently wrong. Using the pretext       of an offhand remark the governor made about the Koran,       masses of enraged Muslims took to the streets to denounce       him. In short order he lost the election, was arrested,       charged with blasphemy, and sentenced to two years in prison.        This episode is especially alarming because Indonesia, the       world's largest Muslim country, has long been one of its most       tolerant. Indonesian Islam, like most belief systems on that       vast archipelago, is syncretic, gentle, and open-minded. The       stunning fall of Jakarta's governor reflects the opposite:       intolerance, sectarian hatred, and contempt for democracy.       Fundamentalism is surging in Indonesia. This did not happen       naturally.        Saudi Arabia has been working for decades to pull Indonesia       away from moderate Islam and toward the austere Wahhabi form       that is state religion in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis' campaign       has been patient, multi-faceted, and lavishly financed. It       mirrors others they have waged in Muslim countries across       Asia and Africa.        Successive American presidents have assured us that Saudi       Arabia is our friend and wishes us well. Yet we know that       Osama bin Laden and most of his 9/11 hijackers were Saudis,       and that, as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote in a       diplomatic cable eight years ago, ``Donors in Saudi Arabia       constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni       terrorist groups worldwide.''        Recent events in Indonesia shine a light on a Saudi project       that is even more pernicious than financing terrorists. Saudi       Arabia has used its wealth, much of which comes from the       United States, to turn entire nations into hotbeds of radical       Islam. By refusing to protest or even officially acknowledge       this far-reaching project, we finance our own assassins--and       global terror.        The center of Saudi Arabia's campaign to convert       Indonesians to Wahhabi Islam is a tuition-free university in       Jakarta known by the acronym LIPIA. All instruction is in       Arabic, given mainly by preachers from Saudi Arabia and       nearby countries. Genders are kept apart; strict dress codes       are enforced; and music, television, and ``loud laughter''       are forbidden. Students learn an ultraconservative form of       Islam that favors hand amputation for thieves, stoning for       adulterers, and death for gays and blasphemers.        Many of the students come from the more than 100 boarding       schools Saudi Arabia supports in Indonesia, or have attended       one of the 150 mosques that Saudis have built there. The most       promising are given scholarships to study in Saudi Arabia,       from which they return fully prepared to wreak social,       political, and religious havoc in their homeland. Some       promote terror groups like Hamas Indonesia and the Islamic       Defenders Front, which did not exist before the Saudis       arrived.        Eager to press his advantage, King Salman of Saudi Arabia       made a nine-day trip to Indonesia in March, accompanied by an       entourage of 1,500. The Saudis agreed to allow more than       200,000 Indonesians to make the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca each       year--more than come from any other country--and sought       permission to open new branches of their LIPIA university.       Some Indonesians are pushing back against the Saudi assault       on their traditional values, but it is difficult to deny       permission for new religious schools when the state is not       able to provide decent secular alternatives. In Indonesia, as       in other countries where the Saudis are actively promoting       Wahhabism--including Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bosnia--the       weakness and corruption of central governments create pools       of rootless unemployed who are easily seduced by the promises       of free food and a place in God's army.        The surging fundamentalism that is transforming Indonesia       teaches several lessons. First is one that we should already       have learned, about the nature of the Saudi government. It is       an absolute monarchy supported by one of the world's most       reactionary religious sects. It gives clerics large sums to       promote their anti-Western, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic       brand of religious militancy abroad. In exchange, the clerics       refrain from criticizing the Saudi monarchy or its thousands       of high-living princes. Saudis with close ties to the ruling       family give crucial support to groups like Al Qaeda, the       Taliban, and ISIS. This fact should be at the front of our       minds whenever we consider our policy toward the Middle       East--including when we decide whether to side with the       Saudis in their new dispute with neighboring Qatar.        Saudi Arabia's success in reshaping Indonesia shows the       importance of the global battle over ideas. Many in       Washington consider spending for cultural and other ``soft       power'' projects to be wasteful. The Saudis feel differently.       They pour money and resources into promoting their world       view. We should do the same.        The third lesson that today's Indonesia teaches is about       the vulnerability of democracy. In 1998 Indonesia's       repressive military dictatorship gave way to a new system,       based on free elections, that promised civil and political       rights for all. Radical preachers who would previously have       been imprisoned for whipping up religious hatred found       themselves free spread their poison. Democracy enables them       to forge giant mobs that demand death for apostates. Their       political parties campaign in democratic elections for the       right to come to power and crush democracy. This is a       sobering reality for those who believe that one political       system is best for all countries under all circumstances.        The Saudi campaign to radicalize global Islam also shows       that earth-shaking events often happen slowly and quietly.       The press, focused intently on reporting today's news, often       misses deeper and more important stories. Historians of       journalism sometimes point to the northward ``great       migration'' of African-Americans after World War II as an       epochal story that few journalists noticed because it was a       slow process rather than one-day news event.        The same is true of Saudi Arabia's long campaign to pull       the world's 1.8 billion Muslims back to the 7th century. We       barely notice it, but every day, from Mumbai to Manchester,       we feel its effects.     Mr. President, this article by Mr. Kinzer used the  example--this is just one example--of Indonesia to demonstrate the  incredibly negative impact Saudi financing has had in many places  around the world.   I will quote from his article:         Saudi Arabia has been working for decades to pull Indonesia       away from moderate Islam and toward the austere Wahhabi form       that is state religion in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis' campaign       has been patient, multi-faceted, and lavishly financed. It       mirrors others they have waged in Muslim countries across       Asia and Africa.        Successive American presidents have assured us that Saudi       Arabia is our friend and wishes us well. Yet we know that       Osama bin Laden and most of his 9/11 hijackers were Saudis,       and that, as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote in a       diplomatic cable eight years ago, ``Donors in Saudi Arabia       constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni       terrorist groups worldwide.''        Recent events in Indonesia shine a light on a Saudi project       that is even more pernicious than financing terrorists. Saudi       Arabia has used its wealth, much of which comes from the       United States, to turn entire nations into hotbeds of radical       Islam. By refusing to protest or even officially acknowledge       this far-reaching project, we finance our own assassins--and       global terror.    That is the end of a quote from that excellent article from the  Boston Globe.   We all understand that there are times when we must work with  problematic governments in order to advance our security goals, but for  far too long, we have been giving a pass to a government in Saudi  Arabia that supports ideas and policies that are fundamentally at odds  with American values and that have led to extremely negative  consequences for American security.   I think the time has come for the Congress to take a very hard look  at this relationship and assess whether it is actually serving the  interests and values of the American people.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
