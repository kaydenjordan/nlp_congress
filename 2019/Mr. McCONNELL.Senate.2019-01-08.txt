 Mr. President, I understand that there are three bills  at the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc.    Mr. President, for years America's vital interests in  the Middle East have been jeopardized by regional chaos. The security  of our ally Israel continues to be challenged by the long reach of the  Iranian regime and its affiliates. In Syria, the Assad regime has made  its own nation a graveyard for hundreds of thousands of innocent  civilians, and the resulting chaos continues to provide Iran and Russia  opportunities to expand their malign influence throughout the region.  That is why the Senate is going to vote later today to take up pressing  legislation that tackles all of this head on.   The bill at hand would reaffirm the United States' commitment to  Israel's security and authorize military assistance, cooperative  missile defense, and loan guarantees. It would counter an aggressive  and hostile attempt to delegitimize the State of Israel through  economic boycotts. It would also reauthorize efforts to strengthen  defense cooperation with our ally Jordan, as its people and government  grapple with the security and humanitarian ramifications of the Syrian  crisis.   Importantly, the legislation also includes the Caesar Syria Civilian  Protection Act. This provision would hold accountable individuals  responsible for the senseless evils of the Assad regime and impose  severe penalties on the entities that support them.   We will vote later today on whether or not Members of this body  believe these issues should be addressed. It is my sincere hope that  the Senate will approve these bipartisan proposals and send the strong  message of support that our friends and partners in the Middle East  deserve.   During the last Congress there was broad agreement on both sides of  the aisle on the need for action. I expected today's action to be a big  bipartisan vote, not some partisan showdown, but over the last few days  something seems to have happened. The Democratic leader and several of  his colleagues have stood up and said they want to block the Senate  from even considering this legislation--never mind that it includes  legislation cosponsored by the Senate Democrats last Congress and never  mind that Senate Democrats mentioned the Syria crisis literally dozens  of times last month here on the Senate floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in spite of all of that, some Democrats  have now threatened to block us from even taking this legislation up  later today. We would have to ask why. It is because we are 18 days  into the partial government shutdown caused by Democrats' total  unwillingness to negotiate with the White House over border security.   Democrat intransigence has made sure that a quarter of the Federal  Government has been shut down for more  [[Page S36]]  than 2 weeks--2 weeks. Now they are threatening to shut the Senate down  too. They have shut down the government for 2 weeks, and now they want  to shut the Senate down. They are threatening to shut down efforts to  protect our allies and strengthen our relationship with Israel-- something they all recently claim to support.   Let's remember what we are talking about. In light of the urgent  humanitarian and security crisis on our border, the President is  requesting $5.7 billion for physical barriers and border security. For  some context, that is just about one-tenth of 1 percent of Federal  spending--one-tenth of 1 percent--for physical barriers like fences and  barriers that already exist, which Democrats have previously voted for  with enthusiasm.   Back in 2006, then-Senators Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden,  and our colleague, the current Democratic leader, all voted for more  than $1 billion to construct about 700 miles of physical barriers.   Then-Senator Obama called it ``badly needed funding for better fences  and better security . . . that should help stem some of the tide of  illegal immigration.'' That is what Senator Barack Obama said.   Senator Schumer later described his vote proudly as ``miles of border  fence that create a significant barrier to illegal immigration.''   As recently as 2015, Secretary Clinton boasted: ``I voted numerous  times . . . to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal  immigrants from coming in.'' That is what Hillary Clinton said.   Obviously, that was then, and today the new Speaker of the House is  trying to argue that a physical barrier is ``immoral''--``immoral.''   Today, my friend the Democratic leader is proposing to add a Senate  shutdown to the partial Federal Government shutdown and block even more  of the people's business, all--all--to avoid more of what he already  voted for. Maybe the Democratic Party was for secure borders before  they were against it, maybe they are just making it up as they go  along, or maybe they are dead set on opposing this particular President  on any issue, for any reason, just for the sake of opposing him.   Walls and barriers are not immoral--how silly. Enforcing our laws  wasn't immoral back in 2006 when then-Senator Clinton, then-Senator  Obama, and our friend the Democratic leader were proud--proud--to vote  for physical barriers. The only things that have changed between then  and now are the political whims and, of course, the occupant of the  White House.   This is no newfound, principled objection. It is just political  spite--a partisan tantrum being prioritized over the public interest.  For more than 2 weeks, they have indulged in that partisan tantrum  rather than negotiate in good faith over border security funding-- hardly something that should be a partisan subject in the first place.  They have put that partisan tantrum ahead of keeping a quarter of the  government open. Now they are saying their partisan tantrum is more  urgent than pressing legislation that concerns our alliance with Israel  and the Syrian civil war.   I hope that isn't the case. I hope our Democratic colleagues don't  pile on even more pointless obstruction. I hope they don't block the  Senate from turning to this important legislation--legislation, by the  way, they support. We will find out later today.   We all know what is necessary to move past the funding impasse: a  negotiated solution that can pass the House, earn 60 votes in the  Senate, and get the President's signature. That is what it takes to  make a law.   As I have stated clearly, the Senate will not waste floor time on  show votes, messaging votes, or any other proposals that fail to check  those boxes regarding the funding bills.   The Democratic leader actually shared that opinion earlier. Here is a  fairly recent quote from the Democratic leader. He said: ``The  President must publicly support and say he will sign an agreement  before it gets a vote in either Chamber.'' That is a fairly recent  quote.   I am glad we seem to agree on that--no wasted floor time on  appropriations bills that fail to clear the President's reasonable  threshold.   For the sake of the humanitarian crisis on our border--as the  President will describe in his address to the Nation this evening--for  the sake of our national security, and for the sake of all the  Americans who need all of their Federal Government reopened, I would  urge our Democratic colleagues to get past these harmful political  games and get serious about negotiating with the President.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  vote.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk on  the motion to proceed.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Mr. President, on February 1, the Kentucky Supreme  [[Page S62]]  Court will bid farewell to a towering figure in our State's judiciary,  Justice Bill Cunningham. A Lyon County native, Bill announced he would  retire from the high court at the beginning of next month, bringing to  a close a career of public service that has spanned more than half of  his life. I would like to take a moment to join his colleagues, his  family, and his community in western Kentucky in congratulating Bill on  this remarkable milestone and to thank him for his service to the  Commonwealth.   Bill first answered the call to service early in his life. Once he  graduated from Murray State University and the University of Kentucky  College of Law, Bill enlisted in the Army, nobly serving our Nation in  uniform in Vietnam, Korea, and Germany. Upon his return to Kentucky,  Bill decided to put his legal education to work for the men and women  of his community. For the last 45 years, he has done just that.   Working in various courtrooms as the Eddyville City attorney, public  defender for the Kentucky State Penitentiary, and the 56th judicial  district's Commonwealth's attorney, Bill earned the esteem of his  colleagues. In fact, his peers voted him the ``Outstanding  Commonwealth's Attorney for Kentucky.''   Beginning in 1991, Bill moved to the other side of the bench when he  was first elected as a circuit court judge in western Kentucky, serving  in Caldwell, Livingston, Lyon, and Trigg Counties. He was then elected  to the Kentucky Supreme Court in 2006. On the high court, Bill  represents 24 counties in western Kentucky. His constituents rewarded  Bill's accomplished service by reelecting him to a second term in 2014.   In addition to his dedicated leadership in our Commonwealth's legal  system, Bill has written six books on Kentucky history and is a  frequent contributor to local newspapers. He is also known as a  captivating speaker, and I hope he will continue to share his  perspective with audiences even in retirement.   As Bill's tenure on the Kentucky Supreme Court comes to a close, I  would like to express my sincere gratitude for his lifetime of service  to his community, our Commonwealth, and our country. In retirement,  Bill said he looks forward to spending more time with his wife Paula,  their five children, and their 15 grandchildren. I extend my best  wishes to the entire Cunningham family, and I ask my Senate colleagues  to help me congratulate Justice Bill Cunningham for his service to  Kentucky.   Mr. President, the Paducah Sun recently published a column  congratulating Bill on his retirement. I ask unanimous consent that the  article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Paducah Sun, Dec. 30, 2018]                               Justice Served                             (By Joshua Robert)         Often loquacious and poignant, Kentucky Supreme Court       Justice Bill Cunningham struggled Thursday to find the right       words summarizing the coming sunset to his career, emotion       seeping through his typically laid-back demeanor.        ``I'm just very grateful--I'm trying to say this without       getting choked up here--to the Almighty for giving me the       strength to (serve the public),'' the justice told a Sun       reporter. ``I'm so grateful for the people of west Kentucky       for giving me this wonderful opportunity.''        That Cunningham, a state Supreme Court justice for 12       years, paired his deity with the residents of his native and       beloved western Kentucky is not surprising, nor is the       affection one-way.        The judge, folksy and often dressed in his trademark       seersucker suit, cuts a popular figure. An accomplished       jurist, engaging orator and celebrated author, Cunningham is       as Kentucky as they come, though in our opinion, uncommon in       the commonwealth.        Cunningham, 74, of Kuttawa, announced Thursday that he'll       be leaving the Supreme Court on Feb. 1, ending a career in       public service that's spanned more than half his life. He       considered his exit from the high court for more than a year       and was unsettled by the prospect of leaving halfway through       his second term.        But the ``constant bombardment of human woe and suffering''       he's seen and heard from the bench proved too much to       continue. The judge, who felt compelled by duty, did what       good judges are supposed to--he cast aside personal feelings       to make the wisest decision possible, his self-assessment       unsparing that he's not at his best.        ``You've got to be emotionally strong to continue,''       Cunningham said, ``and I'm just worn out with it.''        The judge said he doesn't know what he'll do next, but       it'll be something of service to the people of western       Kentucky.        ``I'm going to stay engaged,'' he said. ``I'm going to take       a couple of months off to get my perspective, then I'm going       to do what other people do when they're out of a job--I'm       going to look for one.''        ``I'd like to be able to serve in some capacity. I just       don't know what that is right now.''        Running again for public office, like for a state       legislative seat, is unlikely. ``I'm a dinosaur, and much of       the political mainstream today has passed me by,'' he said in       his self-effacing manner.        We've gotten to know Cunningham over the years, covering       the justice's speeches and appearances and publishing his       thoughtful, well-written guest opinion pieces from time to       time. If we're coming off as an admirer, it's because we are,       unapologetically so.        We've found Justice Cunningham has admirable traits like       modesty, kindness, intelligence, fairness and loyalty, rare       virtues among today's public servants. His replacement will       come from one of the 24 counties within the First Supreme       Court District, but in truth, it'll be impossible to replace       Cunningham and all he has meant to our communities.        ``There's some great timber out there, so they'll probably       get a better justice than what they have now,'' he said of       the judicial nominating process. With respect to the judge,       that's a dubious claim.        Cunningham is slated to be the guest speaker Feb. 5 during       a Paducah Lions Club meeting at Walker Hall.        ``I'll be a former judge by then, so that's if they don't       cancel the invitation,'' he joked.        We have no doubt the invitation's still good and his speech       will be captivating, as always. After all, jobs and titles       may change, but character doesn't.                                   ____________________     Mr. President, last month marked the end of a  distinguished career for Laurel County clerk Dean Johnson. Dean  recently retired after 37 years of public service to his community, our  Commonwealth, and this country. Today I would like to take a moment to  reflect on my friend's many contributions to Laurel County and to thank  him for his dedication to Kentucky.   First drawn to public service at a young age through organizations  like the Key Club and the Future Farmers of America, Dean spent his  career focused on integrity and efficiency. After serving in the Armed  Forces and for 4 years as the county's treasurer, Dean was elected  Laurel County clerk in 1985. His leadership has brought substantial  innovation and development to this eastern Kentucky community.   In my State, a county clerk is responsible for providing a broad  range of services to Kentuckians, including everything from voter  registration and election management to licensing and recordkeeping.  During Dean's tenure, the Laurel County clerk's office introduced new  infrastructure and implemented new procedures to better serve a growing  population. Running an election has changed quite a bit in Laurel  County since Dean entered office, but his dedication has helped promote  access to the ballot box for more than 44,000 registered voters.   In addition to his work in Laurel County, Dean collaborated with his  peers to share best practices in the Kentucky County Clerks'  Association. Earning both their trust and respect, he served a term as  the organization's president, helping deliver essential services across  Kentucky. Like other county clerks, Dean supported his fellow veterans  by repurposing license plates into birdhouses. The products are sold  with proceeds benefiting our Commonwealth's veterans.   Over the years, I have enjoyed working with Dean on behalf of our  constituents, and I am proud to salute this man of great  accomplishment. In his retirement, Dean plans to do more of what he  loves most: spending time with his daughter, Teresa, and his  granddaughter, Rebecca. He will also continue to oversee his 175-acre  cattle farm. As he begins this next chapter, I would like to wish him  the very best, and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking  Laurel County clerk Dean Johnson for his decades-long service of our  State.   Mr. President, the Sentinel-Echo in London recently published a  profile of Dean's accomplished career. I ask unanimous consent that the  article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S63]]                       [From the Sentinel-Echo, Dec. 26, 2018]                  Johnson Reflects on 37 Years of Service                             (By Nita Johnson)         Society has changed drastically in the last 30 years--with       technology being one of the major advancements.        As Laurel County Clerk Dean Johnson fills his final days in       the position he has held for 33 years, he credits technology       as the most advantageous developments for his office       operations.        When Johnson took office as clerk in 1986, he came from a       four-year term as county treasurer. In both offices, most       paperwork was done on typewriters--a business machine that is       now nearly obsolete. But when the technology craze hit full       force, the first aspect of the clerk's office was to have       computerized vehicle tag registrations.        Another huge change came in the voter registration       processes--due to technological advancements and the growth       in population over the years.        ``When I came in, there were only 26 precincts,'' Johnson       said. ``We had those big voting machines that were the size       of a refrigerator.''        Within a couple of years, however, the use of Microvote was       created--the small blue ``suitcase'' style machine used to       cast votes.        ``We've moved to the self contained machines now because of       the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) because all the       machines have to be compliant with that,'' he said. ``The       other machines were hard for people to use if they were in a       wheelchair. With that, we had to relocate some of the       precincts because some didn't have handicapped access.''        Laurel County now boasts 45 precincts, all ADA compliant.        While Johnson said he hasn't seen a huge increase in voter       registration or turnout, he said the division from 26       precincts in the mid-1980s to the current 45 precincts does       reflect on the county's increased population.        ``The precincts divisions are done by the population in the       areas, not the number of registered voters in an area,'' he       explained. ``And the population is always determined by the       latest Census.''        He feels that the Laurel County Clerk's office has always       maintained a high level of integrity and efficiency dealing       with the public for motor vehicle registrations, transfers,       voter registration and election procedures, and maintaining       the massive load of deeds, mortgages, and other legal       documents that fall under the scope of that office. And       Laurel County has excelled in being some of the first       counties in the state to utilize technology to better serve       the public.        ``We were among the first counties in the state to create a       computerized absentee ballot form. I worked with a guy to       simulate the state forms,'' he said. ``Right now we have       44,000 registered voters in the county.''        The clerk's office was also one of the first offices in the       county to receive and use a FAX machine, he said, adding that       the Laurel County Public Library was one of the first to       offer the FAX service.        The growth in the county's population over the past 30       years has massively increased the work load for those who       serve in that office.        ``When I came here in 1986, it was the 160th year of Laurel       County being established,'' Johnson added. ``There were fewer       than 200 mortgage books. Now we have approximately 1,200.''        While the workload of the deputy clerks in the office has       increased to huge proportions over the past three decades,       Johnson said the application of technological advancements       has not caused a large increase in the employees needed in       his office.        ``When I started, there were 10 employees and now we have       18, so we haven't had a big increase in the employees because       of the computer systems,'' he explained. ``This office has       come from a gross intake of $8 million to $15.5 million and       we've never had a non-compliant comment in the 37 years I've       worked for the county.''        Being the Laurel County Clerk required Johnson to interact       with other clerks across the state over the years--some       associations for which he said will remain dear to his heart.        ``I built a rapport with other clerks and I was active in       the Kentucky County Clerks' Association,'' he said. ``I       served one term as president.''        He has many other accomplishments for which he is proud--      one of which is the efficiency of tabulating the votes on       election night. With that process, the election officers       returning their precincts totals are met at the back entrance       of the Laurel County Courthouse and their equipment unloaded       by persons approved by the local election commission members.       The officers then carry in the case containing the printouts       of the votes and sign in for their particular precinct, which       are processed in the lobby in the ground floor near the Broad       Street entrance. The printouts are then taken to the clerk's       office on the second floor where the employees of the clerk's       office then separate the documents and record the votes.       Although the polls close at 6 p.m., most precincts have       submitted their results and the final count is completed and       reported by 7:30 p.m.        ``I'm very proud of the efficiency we have on election       night,'' Johnson said. ``That goes to the employees in this       office and the state associations of elections for the       efficient way we process the votes and the accuracy we       have.''        As an example, Johnson reflected on the 2016 Gubernatorial       race in which Republican candidate James Comer lost to now       Governor Matt Bevin by a mere 83 votes.        ``We had to do a re-canvas,'' Johnson said. ``That       (statewide) re-canvas was completed on Thursday, with the       result coming out the same, of course. We aren't like Florida       and Georgia, that took weeks to do a re-canvas. In fact, in       national elections, Kentucky is nearly always the first to       report their results.''        Johnson has also served as chair of the Laurel County       Republican party, stepping down this year after four years in       that position. He also has been involved with KACo (Kentucky       Association of Counties) for 12 years, is a veteran, is a       Shriner and member of the local masonic lodges.        His interest in being a public servant came early in his       teens, being a President of his school's Key Club and FFA       (Future Farmers of America). He learned early on about       working hard, and said he always had a drawing toward       political issues.        ``As a kid I liked to be active in things and I always       liked being involved in politics,'' he said. ``There were two       people in politics that I always admired--Boyd Boggs who was       a county judge executive and later the sheriff, and Dwight       Eisenhower. Those two had given a lot and I wanted to be able       to help people. As the clerk, you are in the position to help       people and I've tried to do that, not just with questions       about elections or vehicle registered. Other people just come       in and ask about different things and I always tried to help       them the best I could. I leave here with a good feeling       because I think I've done that.''        His political interests also brought him another       accomplishment for which he is very proud.        ``I was the Laurel County campaign chair and we brought       George H.W. Bush to the Bush community,'' he said. ``I was       also the chair when George W. Bush and (former Governor)       Ernie Fletcher came here.''        In fact, the shelves that line a section of Johnson's       office have a picture of the late president, George H.W.       Bush, with Johnson when Bush visited the Bush Fire       Department. Johnson laughs when looking at the picture now,       saying, ``My hair was a different color then.''        Johnson is also proud of his home county and of the many       advancements that have come to the residents of this       community.        ``This county has been aggressive in growing and using its       natural resources,'' he said. ``We've had good leadership and       that continues on today. I hope we keep on and keep our best       and brightest here and supply them with jobs so they can make       a decent living and stay here.''        Johnson is also very dedicated in his church, Calvary       Baptist, where he has served as the adult Sunday School       teacher for several years. He stands true to his beliefs--      even when that belief is not the most popular or       ``progressive.''        But his greatest accomplishment--and joy--comes from his       daughter, Teresa, and his only grandchild, Rebecca. He looks       forward to spending more time with them and his son-in-law       while he continues to oversee the 175-acre farm where he       raises cattle.        ``I'm retiring as of December 31,'' he said. ``I'm going to       go home and relax.''                                   ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.
