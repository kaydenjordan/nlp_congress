 Mr. Speaker, Democrats keep forcing taxpayers to bail out  failing and mismanaged union-run multiemployer pension plans, and it  needs to stop.   The Committee on Education and Labor has dedicated considerable time  and held countless hearings on the problems posed by multiemployer  pension plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's, PBGC's,  multiemployer insurance program.   Unfortunately, unlike previous bipartisan legislation to address the  failing system, our Democrat colleagues decided to go it alone by  enacting the deceitful American Rescue Plan Act, ARPA.   Under the guise of COVID relief, ARPA included an irresponsible and  uncapped taxpayer bailout of failing and insolvent multiemployer  pension plans. Let me repeat, there is no cap on the amount of taxpayer  dollars that PBGC may send to multiemployer plans.   This is especially concerning given that multiemployer plans are  currently underfunded by $756 billion.   Unsurprisingly, the cost of ARPA's pension bailout program continues  to grow. The Congressional Budget Office originally estimated it would  cost taxpayers $86 billion. Five months later, PBGC estimated it would  likely distribute $94.2 billion. After 2 more months, PBGC estimated it  would likely distribute $97.2 billion and, in one scenario, could  distribute upward of $147 billion.   To date, PBGC has disbursed $6.7 billion to 26 plans, and this is  just the beginning.   In April, the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension  Plan  [[Page H5490]]  requested a staggering $35 billion from taxpayers. PBGC is reviewing an  additional eight applications requesting a total of $1.1 billion. In  all, PBGC is expected to send money to over 250 pension plans.   PBGC has confirmed what we knew to be true, but others refused to  admit: ARPA's taxpayer-funded bailout will not fix a thing.   In September, the agency stated the massive influx of taxpayer  dollars will only delay the immediate insolvency of the multiemployer  insurance program, and insolvency is still likely. Simply throwing  money at plans will not solve the problem.   ARPA failed to address the underlying structural issues in the  multiemployer system that contributed to the crisis, thus ensuring that  plan mismanagement and underfunding will persist. In fact, ARPA  includes a galling provision that explicitly bars PBGC from reforming  plan governance or altering plan-funding rules of plans receiving a  bailout.    It is clear to me that the mismanagement of multiemployer plans and  the risks they pose to workers, retirees, and the taxpayer cannot be  ignored. Congress must require multiemployer plans to measure their  liabilities accurately and collect adequate contributions to fund  benefits.   Failing and insolvent plans must stop making promises that they are  unable and unwilling to keep. It is common practice for insolvent  plans, which do not have enough funds to pay current retirees, to  continue allowing active participants to accrue benefits and enroll new  workers into the plan. This is deceptive. This is wrong. This must  stop.   Congress should increase multiemployer insurance premiums to account  for the risk that underfunded plans pose to PBGC.   Multiemployer plans pay a meager flat-rate premium of $31 per  participant. In contrast, the single-employer program requires plans to  pay an $88 flat-rate premium in addition to a variable rate premium  based on a plan's level of underfunding.   Decades of chronic underfunding and false promises have put millions  of workers and retirees at risk. By propping up this clearly  unsustainable system without enacting reforms, ARPA continues to enable  and encourage the irresponsible behaviors that caused this crisis.   Taxpayers saving for their own retirements should not be on the hook  to pay for the broken promises of union-run multiemployer pension  plans.   There must be accountability for this gross mismanagement and real  reform to ensure the multiemployer pension system does not continue to  deceive workers and the American people.                            ____________________
