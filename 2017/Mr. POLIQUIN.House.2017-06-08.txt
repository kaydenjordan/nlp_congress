 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I represent the most honest, hardworking families in  this country, in the great State of Maine. I also represent tens of  thousands of small-business owners in our State that create thousands  of jobs for our families.   In the State of Maine, Mr. Chairman, we know the difference between  right and wrong, and it is wrong to force taxpayers to bail out huge  Wall Street banks that take too much risk when it goes wrong. Now, the  small community banks and credit unions that dot our landscape in Maine  did not cause the most recent recession.   These reforms that we are passing today in the Financial CHOICE Act  reduce unnecessary paperwork and costs that will help our small  community banks and credit unions lend money to small businesses and  our families so they can live better lives with more freedom and have  better job opportunities.   Also, I am proud to say that the Financial CHOICE Act keeps in place  very strong protections, Mr. Chairman, for consumers of financial  services while at the same time imposing the toughest penalties ever  for fraud and inside dealings for folks that participate in this  industry.   It is no wonder, Mr. Chairman, that huge money center banks and Wall  Street are not for the Financial CHOICE Act. But I am, and I encourage  everybody to vote for this Financial CHOICE Act. It is a great bill for  rural America.
