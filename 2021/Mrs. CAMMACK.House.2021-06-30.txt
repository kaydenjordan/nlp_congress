 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer a bipartisan  amendment to give needed flexibility to our livestock haulers and  producers. My amendment would exempt livestock haulers from hours-of- service requirements for the last 150 air miles to their final  destination.   Mr. Speaker, since last year, livestock haulers have been temporarily  exempted from hours-of-service requirements. However, a permanent  solution for our livestock haulers and cattle producers is urgently  needed.   Speaking as a Floridian, cattle is one of Florida's most important  exports. It is typically an 8-hour journey just to transport cattle  from our producers in south Florida all the way to the north end of the  State, before continuing onward to destinations in the Midwest or  elsewhere.   For the health and welfare of the cattle in transit, livestock  haulers need flexibility on both the front and back end of their  journey to get the cattle safely and efficiently transported to their  final destinations.   Hauling live animals is simply not the same as hauling a trailer full  of toilet paper; however, we saw that both were vital during the  pandemic.   Although I and many other Members on both sides of the aisle support  this measure wholeheartedly, I will reluctantly withdraw my amendment  today. I remain hopeful that as we move forward, we can work to fix  these hours-of-service rules to provide greater flexibility for the  success of our Nation's producers and livestock haulers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw the  amendment.
