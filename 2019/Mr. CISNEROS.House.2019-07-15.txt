 Mr. Speaker, last week, we passed a National Defense  Authorization Act for fiscal year 2020. Working with my colleagues for  over 20 hours on the House Armed Services Committee to mark up this  bill in the late hours of the night and the early hours of the next day  was all worth it.   Mr. Speaker, with the passage of this year's NDAA, we have fulfilled  our duties to ensure our military's readiness, strengthened our  national security, and eased our servicemembers' transition to civilian  life.   I am proud to have helped secure 17 floor amendments for the NDAA,  with more than half of those offered on a bipartisan basis. These  provisions supported programs that are critical to servicemembers  living in the 39th Congressional District.   A major priority of mine is ensuring that our servicemembers have the  support they need when they transition back to civilian life. I was  proud to colead the bipartisan Work for Warriors provision with my  colleagues, Representatives Paul Cook, Elissa Slotkin, and Mark Takano.   The Work for Warriors model has a proven track record of helping our  veterans find jobs, providing job placement assistance to unemployed  Guardsmen, Reservists, military spouses, and veterans to not only help  them provide for their families, but also facilitate their successful  transition back to civilian life.   Another priority of mine was to improve the quality of healthcare for  servicemembers, especially mental health programs and women's  healthcare services. I am proud to have secured a number of provisions  that take care of military families by expanding military housing and  improving access to healthcare services.   Specifically, I was proud to work with Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan  to expand transition assistance for women servicemembers. This will  ensure our servicewomen are better equipped with the healthcare  resources they need as they leave military service.   Also, I am hopeful that the amendment my colleagues and I included to  address sexual assault at all levels of our military will help our  servicemembers and veterans receive the respect and justice they  deserve. The high rate of sexual assault in the military is  unacceptable and needs to be addressed immediately.   Even though DOD spends millions on sexual assault prevention  programs, the number of assaults has jumped dramatically since 2010. We  owe it to our servicemembers and veterans to determine why the current  programs have been failing, and we need to create a new, effective  approach to this problem.   Because, in exchange for their service, our Nation took on the  responsibility to care for each servicemember's health, both physical  and mental, that is why I prioritized provisions to address the suicide  epidemic currently facing our servicemembers and veterans. We are  losing servicemembers and veterans to addiction and suicide at alarming  rates. It is unacceptable that this epidemic is only getting worse.   I worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to secure  language that will help prevent servicemembers from reaching at-risk  status and ensure that at-risk servicemembers are identified and able  to receive the care they deserve.   Also, I am proud to have supported an amendment with Congresswoman  Jackie Speier to protect our transgender servicemembers. As a Navy  veteran, I was saddened by our government's willingness to discriminate  against individuals who had the courage, spirit, and commitment to  serve our country in uniform.   Anyone who has the bravery to serve our country should be allowed to  do so, and I stand firmly against the administration's ban on  transgender servicemembers. I will continue to fight against this  hateful and bigoted policy until the President and his administration  understand that transgender servicemembers have the right to their  dignity, and they have the right to serve.   Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the NDAA  reaffirms our constitutional authority over the use of military force.  With this provision, Congress reasserts our congressional authority and  its duty to our country and our servicemembers, and it makes clear to  the President that there is no current authorization to use military  force against Iran. We understand how Iran destabilizes the region, and  it is our responsibility in Congress to ensure that the U.S. does not  enter into a conflict without a strategy.   In closing, while I have said much on what this House has  accomplished with this bill, I would like to end with this: I thank our  servicemembers, civilian military personnel, and all the national  security professionals who support our Armed Services in my district,  in our country, and around the world. It is an honor to represent them  in Congress to ensure the promises made here are kept for our  servicemembers and our veterans.                            ____________________
