 Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to be here this evening to  commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day and, this year, the  75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.   I would like to recognize all of my colleagues and fellow members of  the Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism for participating  in this Special Order Hour; especially my friends, Congressman Ted  Deutch, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Congressman Lee  Zeldin, for their excellent leadership.   Mr. Speaker, today we remember the six million Jews, and millions  more murdered in the Shoah. We must always remember the Holocaust and  recommit to learning the lessons of the attempt to eliminate European  Jewry. We all have an obligation to teach future generations about this  evil, and to pledge ``Never Again.''   This day is deeply significant to my family and to me. I am the  grandson of a World War II veteran who fought the Nazis, and my wife's  grandparents lost their entire family in the Holocaust.   It is critically important that we have come together to commemorate  this solemn day, not just to remember the victims of the Holocaust  killed by the Nazis in gas chambers and concentration camps simply for  being Jews; but also because our history teaches us that we have a  responsibility to confront bigotry, hatred, and intolerance wherever it  can be found.   Therefore, we cannot, and must not, ignore the stunning rise in anti- Semitism and Holocaust denial across Europe, around the world and,  increasingly, here at home in the United States, including the violent  anti-Semitic attacks we have experienced in New York and New Jersey in  recent months.   Furthermore, the mounting evidence that knowledge about the Holocaust  is beginning to fade should alarm us. As Elie Wiesel said:  ``Indifference, after all, is more dangerous than anger or hatred.''   According to a recent survey by Pew Research Center, too many  Americans know too little about the Holocaust. For instance, less than  half of all adult respondents knew that approximately six million Jews  were killed during the Holocaust; and just 43 percent knew that Adolf  Hitler became chancellor of Germany through a democratic political  process.   Unfortunately, these findings echo a series of surveys conducted in  the United States, Canada, Austria, and France in recent years, which  also found significant gaps in knowledge about the Holocaust.   We know how critical education, visiting a Holocaust museum, and  meeting with survivors can be. That is why I am very proud to cosponsor  H.R. 943, the Never Again Education Act, bipartisan legislation  introduced by Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney and Congresswoman  Stefanik, to help support Holocaust education across the country.   This legislation was endorsed last year by the bipartisan Problem  Solvers Caucus and has been cosponsored by nearly 300 Members of  Congress. And I am very pleased that the House voted to pass this  legislation earlier this evening.   I also believe it is more important than ever for our government to  commemorate the Holocaust and educate citizens about its history. That  is why I worked with my colleagues, Representatives Ted Deutch and Brad  Schneider, to ensure that our country properly remembers the horrors of  the Holocaust as part of the United States' commemoration of the 75th  anniversary of World War II.   Additionally, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the TIME for Holocaust  Survivors Act, which would provide better care to approximately 80,000  survivors currently living in the United States.   Finally, I am deeply grateful for, and very proud to support the  critical, ongoing work of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,  the U.S. State Department's Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues and for  Combating Anti-Semitism, and the Holocaust Survivor Assistance Program.   This past fall, a bipartisan group of Members of Congress visited the  United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to tour the permanent  exhibition.   As President Clinton observed at the opening of the museum: ``One of  the eternal lessons to which this museum bears strong witness is that  the struggle against darkness will never end and the need for vigilance  will never fade away.''   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle who have gathered here today to commemorate this very solemn day.  Given the rise of anti-Semitism here at home and around the world, we  need leaders willing to stand up now, and to stand together against  anti-Semitism, and all forms of bigotry, hatred, and intolerance, which  have no place in our country or world.   Together, as we talk to our families, when I talk to my children, we  should always remember the victims of the Holocaust and take care of  the survivors and their descendants.   May God continue to bless the United States of America, watch over  them; and let us always remember.  [[Page H560]]                                     time  2000
