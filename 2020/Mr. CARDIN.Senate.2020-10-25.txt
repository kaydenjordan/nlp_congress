 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the pending  confirmation vote of Amy Coney Barrett to be an Associate Justice of  the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom we lost in September of this year. Justice  Ginsburg was a champion of women's rights and civil rights, and she is  going to be sorely missed on that Court.   Article II, section 2 of the Constitution provides that the  ``President shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of  the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the Supreme Court.'' One of a  Senator's most solemn responsibility is to evaluate the nominee's  qualifications as well as the process the Senate uses to provide their  advice and consent for a lifetime appointment to our highest Court. I  believe, on both substance and process, this nomination should be  rejected.   First, on process. Let's talk about fairness. Let's talk about the  integrity of the Senate. Let's talk about living up to your own words.  Let's talk about using the same rules for Republicans that you use for  Democrats.   Let me remind my colleagues what happened in 2016 in the Senate  during President Obama's final year of a term in office in a  Presidential election year. Justice Scalia died in February of 2016.  Within just a few hours after the death of Justice Scalia, Leader  McConnell unilaterally announced that the Senate would not consider a  replacement for Justice Scalia until after the November 2016  Presidential election, which established a yearlong vacant Supreme  Court seat.   The Republican leader's action, backed by his caucus, set a very  clear precedent: Under no circumstances do Senate Republicans consider  a Supreme Court nominee in a Presidential election year.   It did not matter that in March 2016, President Obama appointed  Merrick Garland, a respected DC Circuit judge, with bipartisan support.  They would not meet with Judge Garland, hold a hearing, or allow a vote  on him for 293 days.   In 2016, the Presidential election was nearly 9 months away. Four  years ago, our Republican colleagues said: 9 months was not time  enough. Leave it up to the voters. We will do this whether it is a  Democrat or Republican in the White House.   The Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said:         Mr. President, the next Justice could fundamentally alter       the direction of the Supreme Court and have a profound impact       on our country, so of course--of course the American people       should have a say in the Court's direction. . . . The       American people may well elect a President who decides to       nominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration. The next       President may also nominate somebody very different. Either       way, our view is this: Give the people a voice in filling       this vacancy. . . . The American people are perfectly capable       of having their say on this issue, so [let's give] them a       voice. Let's let the American people decide. . . . The       American people should have a voice in selection of the next       Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be       filled until we have a new President.    That was the Republican leader.   Several Judiciary Committee members made similar statements after the  death of Justice Scalia. Senators Grassley, Graham, Cornyn, Lee, and  Cruz signed a letter to Leader McConnell, which read, in part as  follows:         [W]e are in the midst of a great national debate over the       course our country will take in the coming years. The       Presidential election is well underway. Americans have       already begun to cast their votes. As we mourn the tragic       loss of Justice . . . Scalia and celebrate his life's work,       the American people are presented with an exceedingly rare       opportunity to decide, in a very real and concrete way, the       direction the Court will take over the next generation.    The letter from my Republican colleagues concluded:         We believe The People should have the opportunity. . . .       Because our decision is based on constitutional principle and       born of a necessity to protect the will of the American       people, this Committee will not hold hearings on any Supreme       Court nominee until after our next President is sworn in on       January 20, 2017.    Current Judiciary Committee Chairman Graham explicitly addressed this  point in 2016. In March 2016, Senator Graham, then a member of the  Judiciary Committee, said:         I want you to use my words against me. If there is a       Republican President in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last       year of the first term, you can say, Lindsey Graham said let       the next president, whoever it might be, make that       nomination. You can use my words against me, and you'd be       absolutely right.    We are setting precedent here today--Republicans are--that in the  last year of a Presidential term, you are not going to fill a vacancy  on the Supreme Court based on what we are doing here today. That is  going to be the new rule.   I have repeatedly stated that the election cycle is well underway,  and the precedent of the Senate is not to confirm a nominee at this  stage of the process. By the way, Senator Graham reaffirmed that in  2018.   In the case of Justice Ginsburg's death and vacancy in 2020, we are  about 40 days away from a general election--not 9 months. Mail-in  voting in record numbers has already begun in several States. And, of  course, early voting has started in many States also. We are proceeding  to a final vote on this nominee for a lifetime appointment just days  before election day. Americans, millions of Americans, have already  cast their ballots.   Once again, within hours of Justice Ginsburg's death, Leader  McConnell unilaterally decreed that the Senate would fill the vacancy  before the election. Leader McConnell said that ``President Trump's  nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the Senate.''   So I implore my Republican colleagues to stop this blatant hypocrisy  now. Let's follow the McConnell rule and let the American people pick  the next President and Senate so they can weigh in on this decision,  just as Senator McConnell argued in 2016, when President Obama  nominated Merrick Garland for Justice Scalia's seat.   Let the Senate honor Justice Ginsburg's legacy by continuing to fight  for the rights she fought for her entire career, both as a litigator, a  circuit judge, and, finally, as a Supreme Court Justice. Let us honor  Justice Ginsburg's dying wish: ``My most fervent wish is that I will  not be replaced until a new President is installed.''   President Trump's agenda is quite clear when it comes to a tragedy  for the Supreme Court. President Trump has repeatedly said he would  appoint Justices in the mold of Justice Scalia. As President Trump said  on the campaign trail, when asked what kind of Justice he would  nominate, ``We're going to have a very strong test. We want . . .  strong conservative people that are extremely smart. Scalia is a  terrific judge. Clarence Thomas, you look at him, he's been a stalwart,  he's been terrific, and we have others.''   President Trump also talked about the type of Justices he did not  like when on the campaign trail. He said:         I'm disappointed in Roberts because he gave us Obamacare.       He had two chances to end Obamacare, he should have ended it       by every single measurement and he didn't do it, so that was       a disappointing one. Everybody thought he was good, he was a       Bush appointee, he was somebody that should have, frankly,       ended Obamacare, and he didn't.    When President Trump announced Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination  to the Supreme Court, Barrett herself highlighted the ideological  parallels between her and her mentor, Justice Scalia. She said about  Justice Scalia: ``His judicial philosophy is mine, too.''   Judge Barrett was a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Scalia. Justice  Scalia was one of the most staunchly conservative members of the  Supreme Court.  [[Page S6562]]  Justice Scalia voted to strike down key parts of the Affordable Care  Act. He frequently called for overturning Roe v. Wade. He opposed  marriage equality. He voted to gut the protections for voting rights in  the Shelby case. He voted to gut our campaign finance laws in the  Citizens United case.   He made it harder for workers discriminated against by their  employers to seek justice in court and further stacked the deck in  favor of wealthy business owners and corporations over working-class  individuals.   By nominating Judge Barrett, President Trump is attempting to bring  Justice Scalia's judicial philosophy back to the mainstream in our  Nation's highest Court. Placing Judge Barrett on the Supreme Court puts  at risk so many of the rights and protections Americans have fought for  and gained.   So let's look at how the law could change if Judge Barrett is  confirmed. That is the second reason to oppose this nomination--her  judicial philosophy--in addition to the flawed process.   You cannot always predict how a Supreme Court Justice will act after  her confirmation, but Judge Barrett has given us clear views on her  philosophy. So many American rights are on the line, but let me start  by talking about the Affordable Care Act.   Judge Barrett has made her views quite clear about the Affordable  Care Act. In a 2017 law review article, she concluded that the ACA is  unconstitutional. She wrote: ``Chief Justice Roberts pushed the  Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.''   Judge Barrett argued that Chief Justice Roberts' approach to NFIB v.  Sebelius, which was joined by Justice Ginsburg, ``express[ed] a  commitment to judicial restraint by creatively interpreting ostensibly  clear statutory language'' and that ``its approach is at odds with the  statutory textualism to which most originalists subscribe.''   In another Supreme Court case, King v. Burwell, the Supreme Court, in  the 6-3 decision joined by Justice Ginsburg, affirmed health insurance  tax credits for millions of families. Nearly 9 million Americans depend  on these tax credits for coverage.   Barrett criticized the decision, stating:         I think the dissent has the better of the legal arguments.    Elsewhere, she wrote:         Justice Scalia, criticizing the majority's construction of       the Affordable Care Act in NFIB v. Sebelius and King v.       Burwell, protested that the statute known as ObamaCare should       be renamed ``SCOTUScare'' in honor of the Court's willingness       to ``rewrite'' the statute in order to keep it afloat. . . .       By this measure, it is illegitimate for the Court to distort       either the Constitution or a statute to achieve what it deems       a preferable result.    It is clear to me--and it should be clear to all of us--that Judge  Barrett has a clear bias against the Affordable Care Act. President  Trump has repeatedly stated that he would appoint judges who would  overturn the ACA and has consistently done so in terms of his appellate  and trial court nominations. Judge Barrett appears to meet President  Trump's litmus test.   I mention these cases to underscore the importance of the Supreme  Court Justice in the lives of all Americans. So much is at stake in the  filling of Justice Ginsburg's vacancy. Your healthcare is literally on  the line.   The Affordable Care Act that President Trump has tried to repeal and  that Republicans tried to repeal in this body but have failed, they are  now going to take it to the Supreme Court. A hearing is scheduled this  November 10 in the case of California v. Texas, just 1 week after the  general election.   This is a real risk for tens of millions of Americans who depend on  the law for their healthcare coverage and other benefits. Twenty  million Americans could lose their healthcare, and people with  preexisting conditions could lose those protections. That is 133  million Americans, during the coronavirus pandemic. That is what is at  stake.   We are talking about pregnancy, cancer, diabetes, high blood  pressure, behavioral health disorders, high cholesterol, asthma,  chronic lung disease, heart disease, and numerous others that have been  held to be preexisting conditions before the protection in the  Affordable Care Act. And you can now add COVID to those preexisting  conditions for 8 million Americans and counting. That protection is in  the Affordable Care Act. This is on the line before the Supreme Court  this November.   If the Affordable Care Act is struck down, insurers could bring back  annual lifetime limits on coverage. Adults covered by Medicare  expansion would lose vital health services. Young people would be  kicked off of their parents' insurance. And insurers could sell skimpy  plans that don't even cover essential health benefits like prescription  drugs, emergency room visits, mental health, substance use, and  maternity care.   The Affordable Care Act increased access to care for millions who  were previously uninsured or underinsured. Through Medicaid expansion,  13 million low-income Americans now have dependable, comprehensive  health coverage. In Maryland alone, over 1.3 million low-income  individuals depend on Medicaid, including 512,000 low-income children,  107,000 seniors, and 152,000 individuals with disabilities. That is  just in Maryland.   We must protect the Medicaid expansion population and other uninsured  and underinsured populations from the Trump administration's effort to  eliminate their access to affordable care. It is at risk.   I have similar concerns about women's healthcare issues. Judge  Barrett has already gone on record in opposition to reproductive rights  and freedoms. So it is clear to me that she would try to roll back the  clock on those rights as a Supreme Court Justice.   In a 2013 speech she entitled ``Roe at 40,'' Judge Barrett explained  that ``Republicans are heavily invested in getting judges who will  overturn Roe.'' She wrote that the ``framework of Roe has essentially  permitted abortion on demand, and Roe recognizes no state interest in  the life of a fetus.'' In a 2003 article, Judge Barrett suggested that  Roe v. Wade was ``an erroneous decision.''   Recall that President Trump has already said he would only nominate  justices who would ``automatically'' overturn Roe v. Wade. Judge       Barrett appears to have met this litmus test as well.   Indeed, Judge Barrett may hold an even more extreme record when it  comes to reproductive rights than I have already stated. She refused to  say at her confirmation hearing whether Griswold v. Connecticut was  rightly decided, in which the Court held that the Constitution  guarantees a right to marital privacy and that a law criminalizing the  use of contraception violated that right.   Now, note that Justices Roberts, Alito, Kagan, and Kavanaugh all  discussed the Griswold case at their confirmation hearing. Yet Judge  Barrett said that Griswold's correctness ``is something I cannot opine  on.''   Judge Barrett's views on immigration also raise concerns. Our most  vulnerable individuals are at risk as well with the naming of a new  Justice to the Supreme Court. Let me talk about one specific group.   On June 18 of this year, in a 5-4 decision written by Chief Justice  Roberts and joined by Justice Ginsburg, the Supreme Court held that the  Department of Homeland Security violated law when it rescinded the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, or DACA, Program.   There are approximately 643,000 DACA recipients--these are our  Dreamers--in the United States, and approximately 29,000 are healthcare  workers and essential workers who are serving us during the COVID-19  pandemic, who have saved lives and eased suffering.   But for the 5-4 decision, those individuals' lives could have been  totally disrupted, and they could have been ordered to leave our  country. These are individuals who know no other home but the United  States of America. They are our neighbors and friends. The next Justice  could very well determine the fate of the Dreamers.   Unfortunately, Judge Barrett already has demonstrated a judicial  track record which is hostile to immigration. In Cook County v. Wolf,  Judge Barrett authored the dissenting opinion from a ruling that struck  down the Trump administration's cruel ``public charge'' rule. The rule  basically penalized immigrants for exercising their legal rights to use  benefits that Congress has made available.  [[Page S6563]]    And in the case of Yafai v. Pompeo, Judge Barrett wrote the majority  opinion and held that U.S. consular officials have virtually unchecked  authority to deny visa applications to those seeking entrance to the  United States. It was pointed out in the minority opinion that the  majority has created a constant ``dangerous abdication of judicial  responsibility'' that would lead immigration officials to deny visas on  the basis of ``impermissible bias.''   So let me turn to the rights of the LGBTQ community. In the  Obergefell v. Hodges case joined by Justice Ginsburg, the Supreme Court  held that the Constitution guarantees same-sex couples the right to  marry, in a 5-4 decision. Unfortunately, Judge Barrett has demonstrated  hostility to marriage equality and to LGBTQ rights more generally. In  speeches, Judge Barrett seemed to be critical of the Supreme Court's  decisions in Obergefell, indicating that she was worried about the  ``who decides'' question when it comes to the courts or legislatures  deciding who can marry and start a new family.   But fundamental rights under the Constitution should not be up for  debate. Every American should have the same rights, benefits, and  obligations of marriage regardless of their gender or who they love.  Notably, Judge Barrett referred to sexual orientation as ``sexual  preference'' in her testimony, implying that sexual orientation is a  choice instead of an immutable characteristic.   As Justice Kennedy concluded in Obergefell:         No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies       the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,       and family. In forming a marital union, two people become       something greater than once they were. As some of the       petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a       love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand       these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of       marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it       so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for       themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in       loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest       institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the       law. The Constitution grants them that right.    I would hope that we agree with Justice Ginsburg, but I am afraid  that is a view that is not shared by Judge Barrett. Judge Barrett was  critical, as well, of the extension of civil rights laws to protect  transgender people, saying at an event that ``it does seem to strain  the text of the statute to say that Title IX demands it.'' However, the  Supreme Court held otherwise in Bostock v. Clayton County, where  Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Ginsburg, held for the Court in a 6- 3 decision that the prohibition of employment discrimination on the  basis of ``sex'' should be read to include gender identity and sexual  orientation.   Judge Barrett has issued several disturbing findings that indicate a  cramped and narrowed view of civil rights laws designated to protect  American workers from discrimination based on race or age.   In EEOC v. AutoZone, Judge Barrett voted against rehearing a panel  decision that ruled against an African-American employee whose company  involuntarily transferred him to another store based on race. The EEOC  had charged that AutoZone had an unlawful practice of segregating  employees by race when it assigned African-American employees to stores  in African-American neighborhoods and Latino employees to Latino  neighborhoods.   The dissent argued that the court upheld a ``separate but equal''  arrangement that is contrary to the Supreme Court's decision in Brown  v. Board of Education when the court interpreted the equal protection  clause of the 14th Amendment to find that separate facilities can't  really be equal.   The dissent wrote:         This case presents a straightforward question under Title       VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: Does a business's policy       of segregating employees and intentionally assigning members       of different races to different stores ``tend to deprive any       individual of employment opportunities'' on the basis of       race? The panel answered this question ``not necessarily.'' I       cannot agree with that conclusion.    Once again, Judge Barrett was on the side of denying protection  against racial discrimination.   In Kleber v. Care Fusion Corporation, Judge Barrett sided with the  majority that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act only protects  current employees from discrimination due to disparate impact and not  outside job applicants--a very narrow view.   Then there are Judge Barrett's views on gun safety, which I find  deeply concerning. Judge Barrett's record strongly suggests that she  would strike down commonsense gun safety laws, even as Congress and the  States continue to try to combat gun violence, which kills nearly  40,000 Americans every year.   According to the Center for American Progress, from 2008 to 2017,  over 6,200 people were killed with guns in Maryland, and from 2014  through 2018, there were 42 mass shootings in Maryland, killing a total  of 45 people and injuring 156. That is just in one State.   That is just in one State. The next Supreme Court Justice could hold  the decisive vote should Congress or the States adopt commonsense gun  safety laws to curb gun violence, such as requiring universal  background checks, banning assault weapons, or banning high-capacity  magazine clips.   In Kanter v. Barr, the Seventh Circuit held that a law barring felons  from possessing a firearm did not violate the Second Amendment. The  Supreme Court previously held in the District of Columbia v. Heller  that the Second Amendment conveyed an individual right to bear arms,  separate from the right of the militia to do so.   But even Justice Scalia--Judge Barrett's mentor and President Trump's  role model for an ideal Justice--wrote in his majority opinion for the  Court in Heller that ``nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast  doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by  felons.'' Yet Judge Barrett dissented in Kanter and concluded that the  bar on gun possession should apply only to violent felons. She argued  that the majority was treating the Second Amendment like a second-class  right. She went on to note that the government could deny nonviolent  felons the right to vote but not the right to bear arms because  ``history does show that felons can be disqualified from exercising  certain rights--like the rights to vote and serve on juries--because  these rights belonged only to virtuous citizens.'' So ultimately Judge  Barrett bizarrely seems to treat voting rights as a second-class right  compared to gun ownership. That is pretty extreme.   I have always expected that in America, we could move forward in  protecting individual rights under our Constitution; that in each  Congress, in each session, the Supreme Court would advance those rights  for individual protection under the Constitution of the United States.  The filling of this Supreme Court vacancy could very well reverse a  trend of protecting rights and deny many in our community their rights.   The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights has sent a letter  to the Senate, signed by a diverse group of 150 organizations, in  opposition to the confirmation of Judge Barrett. The letter urges the  Senate to ``oppose the confirmation of Judge Barrett and allow the  president duly chosen in the 2020 general election to fill the existing  Supreme Court vacancy.''   Groups opposing the nomination include the Alliance for Justice,  Human Rights Campaign, NAACP, NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland, National  Council of Jewish Women, National Employment Law Project, National  Organization for Women, People for the American Way, SEIU, United We  Dream, and the Violence Policy Center. The list goes on and on.   On October 15, 2020, the Leadership Conference reiterated its  opposition to the Barrett nomination with a letter from over 400 State  and local officials asking the Senate not to confirm a new Justice  until after Inauguration Day. The Leadership Conference ends their  letter by saying: ``It is shameful that, instead, the U.S. Senate is  rushing through a nominee who is likely to eviscerate the Affordable  Care Act and deprive millions of people of access to health care,  destroy reproductive freedom by gutting Roe v. Wade, and suppress our  right to vote, making it harder for Americans to have their voices  heard in our democracy.''   I am gravely concerned that the rushed and sham process the Senate is  using here will undermine the public's faith in the independence and  legitimacy of the Supreme Court as a fair and impartial body.   A group of former Federal judges recently wrote to the Senate:   [[Page S6564]]              Our citizenry is sharply polarized--a foreboding sign for       the health of any democracy. The judicial confirmation       process has increasingly become dangerously politicized.       Injecting a Supreme Court confirmation fight into this       noxious mix will ultimately change and diminish the public's       faith in this vital institution.    Public opinion polling does indeed show that a supermajority of  Americans want the winner of the upcoming election to fill the current  Supreme Court vacancy.   I again reference the Leadership Conference letter opposing Judge  Barrett, which states ``Judge Barrett's extreme record on the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, along with her ideologically  driven writings and speeches, demonstrate that she is incapable of  rendering equal justice under the law.''   After reviewing Judge Barrett's full record, statements, and  committee testimony, I am not convinced that Judge Barrett would  administer impartial justice and guarantee equal protection of the law  and equal justice of the law; so therefore I must vote against her  nomination. She is certainly not a mainstream jurist.   Let's follow the McConnell rule and let the American people pick the  next President and Senate so that they can weigh in on the decision,  just as Senator McConnell argued in 2016 with President Obama's nominee  of Merrick Garland for Justice Scalia's seat. Let the Senate honor  Justice Ginsburg's legacy by continuing to fight for the rights she  fought for her entire career, both as litigator, circuit judge, and  finally as a Supreme Court Justice. Let's honor Justice Ginsburg's  dying words: ``My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced  until a new president is installed.''   With that, I yield the floor.
