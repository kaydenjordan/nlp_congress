 Mr. Speaker, as of today, in my State alone,  6,800 people have been tested positive, with 81 deaths; and, in one  family alone, four members of the family have died.   Containing the pandemic and developing and deploying reliable  therapeutics and a safe and effective vaccine must be our highest  priority no matter the cost. People, especially those on the front  lines in healthcare, first responders, are heroically meeting the  challenge offered, at great personal cost.   The $2.2 trillion CARES Act is comprehensive and absolutely needed.  It provides unprecedented support for taxpayers, small businesses, and  grants to hospitals; it helps State and local governments; and it  boosts unemployment and food security.   Special thanks to all of those on the House and Senate side for their  leadership, for their cooperation on this bill, and to President Trump,  the Vice President, Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, and many others who have  brought their expertise to confronting this huge challenge.
