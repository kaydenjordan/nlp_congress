 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to spotlight Kinetic  Kids, an organization in my hometown that helps more than 2,800  children with special needs in San Antonio, Schertz, and New Braunfels.   A few weeks ago, I joined over 470 Texans in the cold and the wet to  support these local children with special needs.   In 2001, Kinetic Kids was founded by Tracey Fontenot and Kacey  Wernli, pediatric physical therapists who saw that children with  special needs needed more exercise. They needed motivation; they needed  camaraderie; they needed the joy that comes from being part of a team.   I am proud to be part of their team, and I will always be here to  cheer them on.   Congratulations on a great event, and thank you for the important  work you do in the community.                           Fighting the Bureaucracy     Mr. Speaker, my team and I are committed to  fighting the bureaucracy for folks I represent across the 23rd  Congressional District of Texas who can't battle it on their own.   Recently, my team helped Kinney County in south Texas cut through  Federal red tape to secure $4 million in funding and spare the county  from financial ruin. The county was being punished simply for following  orders, but due to conflicting information from Washington bureaucrats  regarding how much to pay employees at the county detention center,  they were told they owed the Federal Government $4 million.   Once my office heard about this issue, we worked relentlessly with  the U.S. Marshals Service to ensure these costs were covered.   I thank Kinney County Judge Tully Shahan for informing me of this  issue and the Department of Justice for working with my office to  resolve this situation.                            Women's History Month     Mr. Speaker, Joyce Meyer once said that ``teachers  can change lives with just the right mix of chalk and challenges.''   For Amistad National Recreation Area Education Specialist Lisa  Nielsen, her chalk is a trail, a shoreline, and a pair of binoculars.  The 28-year National Park Service veteran has created several  innovative and interactive programs that have educated tens of  thousands of Texans I represent of all ages on the importance of  conservation and maintaining our south and west Texas natural treasures  for future generations to come.   I am proud to rise today to honor Lisa and all of the women who are  making an impact each day across the 23rd Congressional District of  Texas as we continue to celebrate Women's History Month.                            ____________________
