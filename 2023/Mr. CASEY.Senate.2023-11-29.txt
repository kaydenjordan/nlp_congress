 Madam President, I rise today to recognize the month of  November as Pancreatic Disease Awareness Month on behalf of Americans  across the country suffering from pancreatic diseases.   Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, a large gland behind  the stomach. The pancreas has two main functions, to make insulin and  to make enzymes that help you digest food. Pancreatitis occurs when  enzymes damage the pancreas. It can be acute or chronic, and either  form can lead to pain, organ failure, diabetes, disability, and  sometimes death.   There remains a troubling lack of awareness about conditions of the  pancreas, such as knowing the signs and symptoms and proper treatment.  This can lead to years of misdiagnosis and increasing severity of the  disease.   While scientific progress has been made because of investment in  medical research through the National Institutes of Health and the  Department of Defense, treatment options for pancreatitis are limited.  Chronic or severe cases may require organ removal or significant  surgical procedures. I am proud to work with my colleagues on an annual  basis to support and increase funding for Federal medical research  programs to sustain progress toward innovative treatment options and  better patient care.   In addition to limited treatment options, people affected by  pancreatic diseases face challenges with health coverage and access to  specialty care. Progress has been made with the enactment of  legislation like the No Surprises Act and adoption of an out-of-pocket  cap in Medicare part D through the Inflation Reduction Act, but more  can be done to lower out-of-pocket costs.   As a member of the HELP, Finance, and Aging Committees, the three  committees in the Senate that handle healthcare issues, I will continue  to work with my colleagues to address coverage, access, and health  equity issues impacting individuals affected by conditions of the  pancreas, as well as patients across the country.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing November as National  Pancreatic Disease Awareness Month.                            ____________________
