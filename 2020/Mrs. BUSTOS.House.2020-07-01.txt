 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Moving  Forward Act.   I represent a district where 85 percent of the towns are 5,000 people  or fewer, and 60 percent of the towns are 1,000 people or fewer.   Earlier this year, I reached out to every mayor and city  administrator and county administrator and village president, 151  leaders, representing towns and counties in the 7,000 square miles in  the congressional district that I serve. I listened to their needs, and  the Moving Forward Act reflects many of their priorities.   Now, the administration has said this package is biased against rural  America, to which I say: What?   The President has failed to bring forward any plan that prioritizes  rural America. This bill expands broadband. It strengthens water  systems. It provides $250 million for our rural roads and our  communities, rebuilding our rural schools, and prioritizing buying  American in all that we build.   Today, for the district I represent, and for all rural communities, I  will be proud to cast my vote in favor of this important legislation.                            ____________________
