 Mr. Speaker, Cory Slifko was a father of two, a husband,  and an accomplished veteran of the South St. Paul Police Department. He  spent 20 years on the force, eventually working his way up to serve as  a sergeant.   But Cory also spent 20 years witnessing the unthinkable and  unimaginable and was ultimately diagnosed with PTSD. On November 5,  2019, Cory lost his life to completed suicide, leaving behind his wife,  Katie, and their children.   Now, there is not a doubt in my mind that Cory's death occurred as a  result of his service in the line of duty. But today, Katie's family  has not been able to access the benefits that Cory earned in service to  our community.   It is vital that these programs don't just protect our law  enforcement officers from physical harm but also from mental injuries  they endure in service to our communities.   We can change that today. It is time we right this wrong and offer  some long-overdue support to Katie, who has honored Cory through her  advocacy. I urge all of you to join me in voting ``yes'' on this bill.
