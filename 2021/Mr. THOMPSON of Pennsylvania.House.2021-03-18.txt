 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  March as National Red Cross Month.   While Red Cross Month has been celebrated since 1943, the Red Cross  itself has been making an impact on community health since 1881.   In 1889, Clara Barton led one of the first mobilizations to a  national disaster following the Johnstown Flood. This site is in the  process of being preserved today and is known as the Clara Barton  House.   Perhaps the organization's best-known program, the American Red  Cross, established the first nationwide civilian blood donation program  in the 1940s.   According to the organization, someone in the United States needs  blood every 2 seconds. Less than 38 percent of the U.S. population is  eligible to give blood, and only 3 percent of those individuals donate  annually. The critical need for blood and the lifesaving potential that  comes with a donation cannot be overstated.   The American Red Cross has always been a leader in this effort, and,  today, they still provide more than 40 percent of the blood products in  the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage all healthy Americans to  donate blood and plasma. In the wake of the pandemic, it is needed now  more than ever.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, as Republican leader of  the House Committee on Agriculture, I have the opportunity to speak  with producers nationwide, and, overwhelmingly, they say the number one  issue facing the industry is the lack of a reliable, legal workforce.   When it comes to farm labor, our immigration system is broken and in  desperate need of repair.   The Farm Workforce Modernization Act is a step in the right  direction. I will vote ``yes'' today, but to be clear, the bill is  imperfect and must be improved before becoming law.   It will not fully address the shortage of legal agricultural workers  and may leave our farmers, ranchers, and especially our dairies, with  critical unmet needs.   I filed an amendment that would have addressed these deficiencies  that was endorsed by the American Farm Bureau Federation. Though not  made in order, I hope that amendment will serve as a starting point in  the Senate for necessary improvements.   Americans are blessed with a safe, abundant, and affordable food  supply. But how long will that food supply last if we do not have an  adequate agricultural workforce?   This may be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform our  immigration laws. Therefore, we must get it right.   Madam Speaker, if we fail to address the agricultural workforce, we  will have food insecurity, and that will lead to national insecurity.
