 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2389) to reauthorize the West Valley demonstration project,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2389         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. WEST VALLEY DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.         (a) Reauthorization.--Section 3(a) of the West Valley       Demonstration Project Act (Public Law 96-368; 42 U.S.C. 2021a       note) is amended by striking ``$5,000,000 for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 1981'' and inserting ``$75,000,000 for       each of fiscal years 2019 through 2025''.        (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit       to Congress a report that describes--        (1) the volumes, origins, and types of radioactive waste at       the Western New York Service Center in West Valley, New York;        (2) what options have been identified for disposal of each       such type of radioactive waste;        (3) what is known about the costs of, and timeframes for,       each such option;        (4) the benefits and challenges of each such option,       according to the State of New York and the Department of       Energy; and        (5) as of the date of enactment of this Act--        (A) how much has been spent on the disposal of radioactive       waste associated with the demonstration project prescribed by       section 2(a) of the West Valley Demonstration Project Act;       and        (B) what volumes and types of radioactive waste have been       disposed of from the Western New York Service Center.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2389 is a bill to reauthorize the West Valley  demonstration project, which was introduced in May of 2017 by our New  York colleague,  Tom Reed.   The bipartisan legislation moved through the Energy and Commerce  Committee by regular order, including legislative hearings and markups,  as part of our broad nuclear waste management agenda. It was reported  to the full committee, with a bipartisan amendment, by a voice vote.   Let me thank the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the  Environment, Mr. Tonko, for working closely with us on this  legislation.   H.R. 2389, as amended, authorizes appropriations to support the  Department of Energy's environmental remediation at its West Valley  cleanup site in New York through 2025. It also directs a study to help  Congress determine the final disposition of the radioactive waste that  DOE is cleaning up at the site.   H.R. 2389 also continues the work of this Congress to address the  Federal Government's obligation for treatment and disposal of the  legacy waste produced during the Cold War and through the Federal  Government's early efforts to develop a civilian nuclear energy  industry.   The Department of Energy has successfully remediated 92 sites of this  waste, but the most technologically challenging projects remain in  place at 17 locations, one of which is the West Valley site.   In 1980, Congress passed the West Valley demonstration project to  direct DOE to address legacy environmental issues and authorized the  appropriations, however, only through fiscal year 1981. The project has  not been reauthorized since that time, despite Congress funding DOE's  work at the site for the past 37 years. H.R. 2389 corrects this  situation and provides a path to answering important questions  concerning waste disposition and ensures spending at the site is  subject to an active authorization.   I urge all Members to support this important legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Reed).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2278) to extend the authorization of the Uranium Mill  Tailing Radiation Control Act of 1978 relating to the disposal site in  Mesa County, Colorado, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2278         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Responsible Disposal       Reauthorization Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION.         Section 112(a)(1)(B) of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation       Control Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 7922(a)(1)(B)) is amended by       striking ``September 30, 2023'' and inserting ``September 30,       2030''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2278 was introduced by my Colorado colleague, Scott  Tipton, and cosponsored by my Energy and Commerce colleague from  Colorado, Diana DeGette.   H.R. 2278 extends the authorization of the Uranium Mill Tailing  Radiation Control Act of 1978 as it relates to the disposal site in  Mesa County, Colorado.   The legislation was considered by the Subcommittee on Environment and  marked up through regular order. It was reported by the full committee  with a bipartisan amendment and passed on a voice vote.   Mining and processing uranium generates a byproduct known as uranium  mill tailings. Congress passed the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation  Control Act 40 years ago to establish the framework for DOE to dispose  of mill tailings, which are left over from the nuclear defense  activities and the development of our nuclear commercial industry.   The act also authorizes the Grand Junction, Colorado, site to serve  as a disposal location.                                time  1645    This is the only DOE uranium mill tailing disposal site remaining  open in the Nation, and so it is necessary for the final disposition of  mill tailings discovered throughout this country.  [[Page H8802]]    H.R. 2278 extends the site's current authorization until 2030. The  extension will enable the site to plan long-term operations to protect  the public health and the environment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), who is the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, again, this is the last  remaining disposal site that we need to keep open.   I appreciate the support, and I applaud the work of my colleague from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton) for his efforts and Diana DeGette and the  bipartisan nature of that cooperation between the two of them to get  this done.   Mr. Speaker, I call upon the Members to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
