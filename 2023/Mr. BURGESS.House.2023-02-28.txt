 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 166 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 166         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 347) to require the Executive Office of the       President to provide an inflation estimate with respect to       Executive orders with a significant effect on the annual       gross budget, and for other purposes. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Oversight and Accountability or       their respective designees. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. No amendment to       the bill shall be in order except those printed in the report       of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each       such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in       the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such amendments are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 30) providing for congressional disapproval under       chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule       submitted by the Department of Labor relating to ``Prudence       and Loyalty in Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising       Shareholder Rights''. All points of order against       consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint       resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint       resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Education and the       Workforce or their respective designees; and (2) one motion       to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   House Resolution 166 provides for the consideration of two measures,  H.R. 347 and H.J. Res. 30. The rule provides for H.R. 347, the REIN IN  Act, to be considered under a structured rule with 1 hour of debate  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Oversight and Accountability or their designees and  provides for one motion to recommit. The rule makes in order 15  amendments.   Additionally, the rule provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 30, a  resolution of congressional disapproval of the rule submitted by the  Department of Labor relating to ``Prudence and Loyalty in Selecting  Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights'' under a closed  rule with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and the  Workforce or their designees and provides for one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and in support of  the underlying bills.   Today, the Republican majority is holding the Biden administration  accountable. The American people sent the Republican majority to  Washington to exercise a moderating influence on the executive branch  and as a  [[Page H925]]  check against President Biden and the Democrats' worst policy impulses.   Mr. Speaker, over the past 2 years, the American people have been at  the mercy of President Biden's and the Democrats' reckless tax-and- spend agenda. Having survived those 2 long years, the American public  could not stomach 2 more years of unified Democratic control in  Washington, so this past November, American voters elected a Republican  majority in the people's House to address the people's business.   Instead of devoting all of their time and effort to service  industries and projects favored by Democratic consultants, the green  lobby, and woke political activists, Republicans are working at  breakneck pace to address the issues that the American people actually  care about: protecting the retirement savings of hardworking Americans  from Green New Deal radicals. The House GOP is the last line of defense  between the American people and President Biden's inflationary agenda.   Mr. Speaker, I also commend Mr. Barr for introducing H.J. Res. 30 so  we can bring this important piece of legislation to the floor today.  Without his leadership on this issue, pensioners and retirees would be  defenseless against the designs and machinations of a loud but vocal  minority planning to conscript the retirement savings of retirees and  American workers to pursue an investment agenda that is not founded on  a fiduciary responsibility to maximize a return on investment.   Democrats understand that their Green New Deal agenda is politically  toxic as far as the American public is concerned. They know that their  radical energy agenda has been exposed and laid bare to the American  people. For that reason, they have orchestrated and overseen a  coordinated campaign to capture the boardrooms and the pension funds,  seeking to implement the change that they simply could not achieve at  the ballot box.   What Democrats are trying to achieve would be more intellectually and  morally defensible if they had the courage to bring these measures to  the floor for a vote in the people's House. In fact, the Democrats  could not take that risk, Mr. Speaker. It would be a highly  embarrassing spectacle exposing their woke, ESG agenda as toxic to the  American public. Instead, Democrats and their radical environmental NGO  allies will continue to work in the shadows, strong-arming and  intimidating corporations and investors alike, using any means  necessary to conscript the life savings of pensioners and retirees to  implement a dangerous and illiberal investment strategy centered not on  the welfare of retirees but on their favorite pet political projects.   In addition to this being an unwise and undemocratic investment  strategy, Mr. Speaker, if this investment strategy is allowed to  metastasize, the traditional energy sources that heat our homes, clean  our drinking water, and power our electrical grid will be seriously  placed in jeopardy.   This isn't hypothetical, Mr. Speaker. Democratic policies are pushing  our electrical grid to the brink. Reliable baseload generation sources  are being phased out at a dizzying pace. The traditional energy  projects that make the comforts of modern life possible are being  prematurely marked for closure, not because they are uneconomical but  because they run counter to the Democrats' crusade against fossil  fuels.                                time  1215    In my native Texas, Mr. Speaker, I am in communication with capital  market professionals who inform me that their firms will no longer  invest in energy projects that provide dispatchable and reliable power  to the electrical grid; not because these projects are undeserving or  won't deliver a return on investment, but for fear of being named by  Democrats and their corporate allies for being insufficiently committed  to their radical environmental agenda.   I am reminded of the passage from the Gospel of Matthew, Mr. Speaker:  ``You will know them by their fruits.''   Democrats are once again looking to conscript the life savings of  pensioners and retirees in this Green New Deal agenda.   Mr. Speaker, this is the deleterious downstream effect of the  Democrats' Green New Deal and their moral panic. It is jeopardizing the  health and well-being of American citizens in pursuit of a disturbing,  dogmatic energy agenda that is myopically focused on potential  environmental impacts rather than the flourishing and prosperity of all  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, the conventional wisdom would suggest that President  Biden and his Democrat allies in the House would step back and reassess  their policies after having lost their majority in November.   One could be forgiven for thinking that having been humbled at the  ballot box, Democrats would benefit from reflection and introspection  to try to understand why American voters rejected their policies so  thoroughly in the midterm elections.   Unfortunately for the American people, President Biden and House  Democrats have doubled down on their inflationary and unpopular agenda  all in the wake of November's election.   Instead of triangulating and trying to better align themselves with  the priorities of everyday Americans, the Biden administration has  continued this barrage of unpopular executive orders. From trying to  cancel student loan debt to increasing household costs for American  families through increased energy and food costs, Democrats and  President Biden have demonstrated once again they are simply out of  step with the American public.   This is why Republicans are united in holding the Biden  administration accountable for their reckless economic policies that  seek to supercharge and further embed inflation into the American  economy. The Republican majority is proud to bring to the floor H.R.  347, the REIN IN Act, which would mandate that the Biden administration  undertake and produce a report for any major executive order that it  issues that would detail the inflationary impact of said executive  action.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   You know, driving to the airport early Monday morning on the way back  up here for another week in Washington, the price of gas was $3 a  gallon in Texas in February.   Now, that is bad news because by the time you get to Memorial Day,  the peak of the summer driving season, gasoline is always a dollar more  than it is in February.   So, look. The President was able to bring the price of gas down  artificially by depleting our emergency reserve, and who does that? Who  does that?   Who spends all of their emergency funds and says, ``Good on me. I  brought the prices down,'' when you didn't do anything to increase the  supply?   Now, here is the good news. One of the reasons we aren't surrounded  by a lot of our colleagues right now on the floor of the House debating  this rule is because Members, both Democrats and Republicans, are in  committees, in the committees of jurisdiction, doing the actual work.   I left a markup from the Energy and Commerce Committee, the  Subcommittee on Energy, looking at ways to increase our supply of  energy to do what? To bring down the cost of energy for consumers.   That seems like a logical thing to do. We see what the  administration's response was. It was to sign an executive order to  say, we are going to cut off a pipeline so you can't bring any more  product into the United States.   You can't ship that product from Canada down to Port Arthur, Texas,  and refine it with Texas jobs. No. They cut that off. As a consequence,  it has to be made up somewhere else.   The good news is we didn't run out, and there is additional supply.  There is additional energy to be pumped, harvested certainly in the  Permian Basin and the Delaware Basin of Texas.   The good news is that producers, a lot of small and independent  producers, are doing just that.   So rather than having to go hat in hand to OPEC or OPEC+--I guess,  now because they added Russia to OPEC--rather than having to go to a  dictator in Venezuela, you can buy your oil and gas from the United  States of America.   Who is doing that? Well, Germany is doing that. They hastened the  development of several LNG offshoring plants so that they could bring  in that Texas product to heat the homes of Germans who have been cut  off by Vladimir Putin in an attempt to starve Europe for energy during  the Ukraine war.   You know, one of these bills that we are debating, the rule that we  are debating will allow a bill to come to the floor for debate on  looking into the cost of executive orders.   I already referenced one of those executive orders; one done on the  very first day of the Biden administration, which was to negate the  Keystone pipeline, but there were others.   The Committee for Responsible Budget actually has calculated a total  of $1.1 trillion in executive orders in the last 2 years and 2 months  since this President has taken office.   Digging into the numbers--and, of course, it will be a big story over  at the Supreme Court later this week--but the President wants to cancel  student loan debt; that is $750 billion.   Shouldn't that be a consequence that is argued in Congress? It is not  done just through an executive order.   Look, we wisely rejected a monarchy, and we said we want government  with the consent of the governed. That means that all of the decisions  do not flow from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.   By virtue of the fact that we have a divided government, the people's  House is supposed to weigh in on these decisions.   They are not made unilaterally by the President of the United States,  which, by definition, is what an executive order is.   So we have $185 billion in increased staff benefits. Maybe good;  maybe not. The gentleman from Massachusetts and I agree on programs  that tackle hunger in this country, but shouldn't we as Members of the  people's House have the opportunity to debate that rather than the  decision simply made by one individual down at the other end of  Pennsylvania Avenue?   We already talked about the Keystone pipeline. Canceling ANWR.  Canceling ANWR, the exploration and development of oil in that plain in  Alaska, which has been--honest Injun.   If Clinton had not prevented that, if President Clinton had not  prevented that in 1997, that would be a producing field today that  would reduce our trade deficit, to be sure.   So we would be able to produce American energy but also would have  had a profound effect on the budget because, in fact, Mr. Speaker, you  will recall it was a budget bill that year where President Clinton then  blocked the development in the ANWR.   What about repealing President Trump's rules on the waters of the  United States and the NEPA streamlining rules?   All of these things have been done as executive orders since this  President took office, and the consequence, the fiscal consequence, the  downstream consequence has been profound.   So, look. I want to encourage everyone in the House today to support  these measures when they come to the floor.   If you want to remake financial markets, you can't do that by  congressional fiat. You have to have the courage to bring that measure  to the floor for a vote.   I would encourage Members additionally to support the REIN IN Act,  and this measure will act as an important check on the Biden  administration, forcing President Biden to grapple with the harm that  his executive orders are inflicting on the long-suffering American  people.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans remain united in pursuing legislative  policies that put the American people at the forefront, put them ahead  of the special interests, put them ahead of the army of lawyers and  lobbyists that occupy this town. Let's put the people of America first.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 166         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and  move the previous question on the resolution.
