 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to rule IX, I rise to a question of  the privileges of the House, and I send to the desk a privileged  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I do.    Mr. Speaker, the House and Senate Democrats and  Republicans of the Appropriations Committee have worked hard and long  to come up with bipartisan legislation to meet the needs of the  American people.   Right now, we are in the midst of Congress delaying. The market is  down almost 5 points for this and other reasons. This is not the time  for us to shut down the government.   We have a product developed in a bipartisan way for the reasons  described by the Clerk, who read it, and it is privileged because of  the time of the year, because of the extent of the concern that the  American people have, and because of the harm that will be done to them  if the government shuts down. It would be totally irresponsible.   That is why I consider it a privilege to rise to say: Let's keep the  government open by passing this bipartisan legislation first introduced  by Congresswoman Lowey, our distinguished Democratic leader on the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 187,  noes 170, not voting 75, as follows:                               [Roll No. 467]                                 AYES--187       Abraham      Aderholt      Amash      Amodei      Babin      Bacon      Balderson      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Bucshon      Budd      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Cloud      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Cook      Costello (PA)      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Curtis      Davidson      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (TN)      Emmer      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Frelinghuysen      Gallagher      Garrett      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hern      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
