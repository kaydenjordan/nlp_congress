 Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous  question, we will amend the rule to immediately bring up the bill  establishing a bipartisan national commission on the domestic terror  attack of the United States Capitol.   This has been a devastating week for our Nation. Just last week, we  stood right here in this very Chamber while a violent mob laid siege to  the seat of American democracy. It is vital we get the facts on what  went wrong last week, why the security apparatus failed, and how we can  ensure it never--it never--happens again.   Mr. Speaker, less than 50 feet from where we stand in this room, a  young lady lost her life through those doors--through those doors. I  was in this Chamber when those gunshots rang. That is real stuff. That  should never happen in the people's House.   For the first time, can the House Democrats and the Speaker of the  House put the people before politics?   Please put the people before politics. At a time when our Nation is  more divided than ever before, let's put people before politics.   President Trump will be leaving in 7 days. Let's try to heal this  Nation. Let's listen to the American people. This is the people's  House. Let's operate for the people.   This country is hurting. The people are hurting. Our colleagues are  hurting.   This is a reckless impeachment. This will only bring up the hate and  fire more than ever before.   Have a conscience. Put the people before politics. Unify this  country.                                time  1000
