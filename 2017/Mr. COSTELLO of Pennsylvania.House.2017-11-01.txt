 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that I may hereafter be considered as the primary sponsor of H. Res.  428, a resolution originally introduced by Representative Murphy of  Pennsylvania, for the purpose of adding cosponsors and requesting  reprintings under clause 7 of rule XII.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
