 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Savannah attorney Takeita Tollman for her placement on the Georgia  Trend 40 Under 40 list.   Takeita is a very impressive young woman who has dedicated her life  to public service. She began her career as a certified nurse assistant  in high school, intending to become a doctor upon graduation.   Once she reached college, she realized that her passion was in  writing and turned to a career in the legal profession.   Takeita attended law school at the University of Akron in Akron,  Ohio. Takeita's legal specialties are Social Security disability,  workers' compensation, and personal injury.   Takeita is serving some of the most vulnerable within our community.  She is dedicated to helping people not just in the office but after  hours, too.   She is a member of the Port City Bar Association and offers job  shadowing to members of 100 Black Men of America. She also organized a  sock drive for Savannah's homeless population.   I am proud to say that stories like Takeita's aren't uncommon in  Savannah, though this makes them no less impressive. It just shows the  kind of city we are.   I take this opportunity to thank Georgia Trend for recognizing  Takeita's excellent work today and congratulate her on making the 40  Under 40 list.                            ____________________
