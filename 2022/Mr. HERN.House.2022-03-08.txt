 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  hosting this Special Order tonight.   The price of gas has been rising for the last 14 months. Yes, we are  experiencing some added pressure thanks to Putin's evil attack on  Ukraine, but our energy problems go much farther back than that.   They started on the very day that President Biden was inaugurated as  President. When he left the inauguration, President Biden immediately  signed multiple executive orders handcuffing domestic oil production.  He proudly told supporters on the campaign trail that his goal was to  end fossil fuels entirely.   Now, he is saying that his administration and his rhetoric have no  impact on the energy crisis. I call B.S. on that. He is intentionally  destroying traditional energy while begging the world's worst actors to  make up for it.   We simply cannot rely on foreign dictators for oil that we can  produce here in America. An energy dominant U.S. helps not only our  people, but our allies around the world.
