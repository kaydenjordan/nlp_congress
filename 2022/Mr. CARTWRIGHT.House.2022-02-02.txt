 Madam Speaker, over the last 2 months since we passed  the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  [[Page H347]]  Act, House Democrats have been spreading the good news.   In fact, we have had over 1,000 events across this Nation where House  Democrats bring home to Americans what we have done with the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, strengthening our water systems  and sewer systems, rebuilding our roads and our bridges.   We just had a catastrophic bridge failure in Pittsburgh that brings  home the need to do these things.   Expanding broadband internet into the rural places that need them the  most, this is a wonderful thing that is highlighting the fact that  Democrats delivered with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   That is not the wonder, Madam Speaker. The wonder in all of this is  that we had 200 House Republicans voting no, voting against investing  in America and helping our companies and our country compete with  China, Europe, and places abroad.   They voted no. They voted against infrastructure, and they need to  explain why.                            ____________________
