 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, the Honorable Susan  Wild, be permitted to take the oath of office today.   Her certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to her election.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as dean of the  Pennsylvania congressional delegation, it is my great pleasure to  welcome our newest colleague.
