 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  the first en bloc amendment, which stipulates that nothing in this act  shall limit the ability of the Secretary of the Interior or the  Secretary of Agriculture to manage forest fires, insects, and diseases  in designated wilderness areas under the Wilderness Act.   Land conservation is an investment in our future, but it is equally  important that we continue to manage our wilderness areas responsibly.  Over the past several years, my district and others across our great  country have been hit hard by historically damaging wildfires.   To protect countless communities, the Federal Government must ensure  wilderness areas are adequately managed to minimize the impacts of  wildfires.   I want to thank Chairman Grijalva and Representatives Panetta and  Lofgren for being champions of public lands and responsible land  management.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join them on this amendment, and I  strongly urge an ``aye'' vote on the first en bloc amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  this legislation. The American people are hurting, half a million  people are dead, tens of millions have gotten sick. Millions have lost  their jobs, businesses have shut down, many closed forever, and kids  can't go to school. Families are without food and behind on their rent.   This bill provides direct payments to Americans and helps small  businesses and restaurants. It provides crucial funding for State and  local governments, funding for vaccines, childcare, and critical funds  to get our kids back safely to school.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote for this bill, the American  people are counting on us.
