 Mr. Speaker, born in Lavaca County, Texas, Arthur Etzler  is a native of the 27th Congressional District of Texas. July 2, 2020,  is his 100th birthday, but that is not the only thing remarkable about  Arthur.   On September 22, 1942, Mr. Etzler pledged his service to the Army's  88th Division, 149th Infantry Regiment, Company H, otherwise known as  the Blue Devils, to fight in World War II.   Arthur's service took him across the world. He defended freedom in  Morocco, North Africa, Rome. He completed his tour in Germany, where he  shared a brief and joyful reunion with his brother, Hubert.   Private Etzler's service did not go unnoticed. His courageous fight  in the Po River Valley earned him three Bronze Stars. General George C.  Marshall once stated that Mr. Etzler's first division ``fought like  wildcats.''   After his service, Arthur returned stateside to Hallettsville, Texas.  There, he found the love of his life, Rosemary, his sweetheart of now  nearly 73 years. Together, they built their home in Hallettsville and  raised six children.   Arthur's service to others never ceased. His life is marked with  decency and strength. Mr. and Mrs. Etzler remain active members of  their church and community, where they are known for their dedication  and kindheartedness.   Arthur has lived a life that reflects the spirit of this Nation, and  for that, we thank him.   Happy birthday, Arthur. God bless.                            ____________________
