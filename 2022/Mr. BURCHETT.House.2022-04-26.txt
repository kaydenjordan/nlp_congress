 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Corporal Ray Sims, an  American hero who served during the Korean war. Corporal Sims enlisted  in the United States Army and was sent to South Korea following his  initial training.   On January 31, 1951, his company was attempting to drive the enemy  from an excellent defensive position on Hill 592. During the mission,  Corporal Sims noticed a hostile emplacement containing an automatic  weapons crew. Corporal Sims realized that the attention of the enemy  gunners needed to be distracted so another element could flank and  destroy the bunker.   He moved forward with his rocket launcher and fired upon the enemy.  Corporal Sims successfully distracted the enemy but was wounded during  his efforts. He kept firing on the position despite his injuries, which  allowed his company to flank and capture the position.   It took 18 months of surgeries and rehabilitation for Corporal Sims  to fully recover from the wounds he received that day. For his bravery,  Corporal Sims was awarded the Bronze Star with valor, Purple Heart,  National Defense Service Medal, United Nations Service Medal, and  Korean War Service Medal.   Our country's heroes are the men and women of our Armed Forces, Madam  Speaker--not the ones who throw the football or catch the baseball or  shoot the basket--like Ray Sims, who served and sacrificed for our  freedom. He is a real hero.   It is my honor to recognize Corporal Ray Sims as Tennessee's Second  District April 2022 Veteran of the Month.
