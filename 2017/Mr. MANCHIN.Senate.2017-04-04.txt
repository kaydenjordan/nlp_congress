 Mr. President, I rise today, as I have risen so many  times, basically for all of us to understand that we have the greatest  country on Earth, a superpower of the world.   If you want to know the backbone of the United States of America,  look up in the stands. These are the United Mine Workers of America,  who made us the country we are today. They gave us the life we have and  our freedom, and for people not to understand that makes no sense to me  at all.   All I am asking is for my colleagues to understand that the miners  protection simply is this: Keep your promise, the promise that we made  basically to all the miners who have given their lives. They have given  everything they have--their blood, sweat, and tears basically for us to  have energy for this country of ours. Now all they are asking is: Can't  we at least keep our healthcare? Can't we at least keep our pensions?  We have worked for that. We have negotiated for that. Every contract  they negotiated basically was a give-and-take proposition so that they  would be able to continue to have this after they retire.   For a lot of our colleagues and comrades who have passed away, the  widows and families they leave behind are still dependent on this  healthcare.   We have been fighting for this. On April 28, we are going to lose it  again--April 28. I know the way things work around here. Someone will  come down and say: Well, we have negotiated a little extension.   I want to make sure everyone is on notice: We will use every vehicle  we can, absolutely every pathway that we can to make sure we will not  leave here until we have our miners protected. Our miners will be  protected with their healthcare and their pensions.   All 48 Democrats are united. Many of our colleagues on the Republican  side have joined us or are willing to join us. All we are asking for is  that vote.   I want to make it very clear: We will do anything and everything that  we must. We have been very patient, but I am not going to have another  notice sent out to our retired miners, to their families, to their  widows saying: Well, we have given you another 90-day or 120-day  extension. That is not going to happen this time. That is my commitment  to them and their families. That is my commitment, basically, to the  people who have depended on them.   Really, each and every one of us in this great country of ours should  say thank you to them for the job that they have done.   We will fight this and we will continue to fight this onslaught, and  I can't figure out why.   In October, 16,300 of our Nation's coal miners and their families  were told that they would lose their healthcare on December 31. Then we  extended it.   Can you imagine an elderly person receiving a notice the first of  February, the end of January that says: Guess what, in 90 days, you are  going to lose it again because we gave an extension until April of this  year.   I can't understand it at all. I don't know how anybody could be that  inhumane.   The cosponsors are working with us. We have held firm. The White  House knows that we are serious about this. The President himself has  given me his verbal support. I need him now to either tweet or call  Senator Mitch McConnell, our majority leader, and tell him it is time  to act. It is time for Mr. McConnell, the Senator from Kentucky, our  friend from my neighboring State, to act. That is all we are saying.   President Trump, if you are listening to me, if you are watching,  please tweet out: Mitch, help us. We need you.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.                     Welcoming West Virginia Coal Miners
