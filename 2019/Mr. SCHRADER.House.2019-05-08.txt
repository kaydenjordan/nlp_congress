 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today  to recognize and remember a dear friend and devoted, lifelong public  servant, my former executive assistant Anne Marie Feeney.   Anne Marie began her more than four decades in Congress in the 1970s  with Senator Robert Byrd and retired her career in my office in 2014.   Across the Capitol, Anne Marie was a force to be reckoned with,  having served through eight Presidencies and more than 20 Congresses.  She knew her stuff.   Beginning her career at a time when few women were hired as  congressional staff, she spearheaded the charge to bring full-time  childcare to Congress for both Members and staff.   When I was first elected to Congress in 2008, it was Anne Marie who  helped me set up my office and guided me through the ins and outs of  Congress. I credit her with building the close-knit family culture my  office is fortunate to have.   My thoughts this past 2 weeks have been with her daughter, Marybeth;  son-in-law, Jamie; grandson, Kyle; sister, Mollie; and brother-in-law,  John, as we mourn a great loss and remember the incredibly strong and  caring woman that was Anne Marie Feeney.                            ____________________
