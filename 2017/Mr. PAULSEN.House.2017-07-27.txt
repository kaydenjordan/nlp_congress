 Mr. Speaker, the fourth line in the Warrior Ethos reads:  ``I will never leave a fallen comrade.'' Every soldier who passes  through Army basic training knows this motto, and truly it is the  spirit of our entire military.   Currently, more than 75,000 Americans are unaccounted for from  conflicts ranging from World War II to the war on terror. We must  continue to vindicate the spirit of the Warrior Ethos and aid our  military to make sure that we never leave any servicemembers behind,  which is why I am cosponsoring a resolution for the creation of a  Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs in the House.   This select committee will be responsible for investigating these  unaccounted for servicemembers and finally bring peace of mind and  closure to their families.   So, Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that we not abandon this  obligation and that we help our brave servicemembers never leave behind  a fallen comrade.                       Ending Unnecessary Shark Finning     Mr. Speaker, sharks are being killed 30 percent faster  than they are able to reproduce, which is having a serious impact on  our ocean's ecosytem. One contributor to this decline is an inhumane  practice that is known as ``finning.''   Finning is the removal of the fins from a shark and, often times, is  done while the shark is still alive. These fins are mostly used for  shark fin soup, which is a traditional soup seen in many Asian  countries. After harvesting the fins, these sharks are thrown back into  the ocean, where they are left to die from suffocation, blood loss, or  be killed by other predators, since they have no way of having an  opportunity to defend themselves.   That is why I am cosponsoring the Shark Fins Elimination Act, which  will make it illegal to possess, buy, or sell shark fins, unless the  shark was lawfully taken with a license or permit. This bipartisan  effort will protect the fragility of our ocean wildlife and prevent  these cruel practices.                            ____________________
