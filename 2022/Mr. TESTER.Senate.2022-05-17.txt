 Madam President, I would like to share a few words  today to honor an outstanding leader and friend of mine who recently  passed away.   Mark Sweeney was a State senator for Montana's 39th District and a  candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives. Mark was the face of  public service in Montana, with an unyielding commitment to make our  State better for all of our kids and grandkids.   Born in Butte, raised in Miles City, and a longtime resident of  Anaconda, Mark was a Montanan through and through. Mark worked for  Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks for 32 years until he retired as a  fisheries manager.   He started his political career as a commissioner in Anaconda-Deer  Lodge and later successfully ran for a seat in Montana's State  Legislature as a representative. He was elected to the State senate in  2020.   During his career, Mark was a tireless advocate for public lands and  public access, working with sportsmen and women around Montana to  protect our greatest treasures for future generations. When Mark talked  about running for office, he focused on how he would improve the lives  of his fellow citizens, and he worked with anyone and everyone,  regardless of whether they agreed or disagreed with him.   Mark was a fierce advocate for working families across Montana. He  believed in the power of public education to lift folks up and  prioritized the creation of good-paying jobs, especially for young  people, that would keep them living and working in Montana.   Mark was an effective policy-maker who made it a priority to balance  conservation and responsible development in our communities. Mark's  lifelong commitment to bettering our State and preserving our public  lands for generations wasn't something he preached; it was something he  lived every day.   I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mark's wife, Sue, his  children, Shannon and Jordan, stepchildren, Carly and Brandi Johnson,  and grandchildren, Wes and Brooks, as well as the rest of the Sweeney  family. Those who knew Mark will remember him as not only a dedicated  public servant, but as a family man and a dear friend. His friendly  demeanor and sense of humor will be sorely missed.   Mark has left a lasting legacy on us all, but especially his family  and friends, his colleagues in the State legislature, and those he  represented in the State of Montana. He will not be forgotten.                            ____________________
