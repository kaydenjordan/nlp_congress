 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4920) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for  an exception to certain small business contracting requirements  applicable to the Department of Veterans Affairs procurement of certain  goods and services covered under the Ability One program, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4920         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Veterans       Affairs Contracting Preference Consistency Act''.       SEC. 2. EXCEPTION TO DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SMALL                     BUSINESS CONTRACTING REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN                     GOODS AND SERVICES COVERED UNDER ABILITY ONE                     PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--Subsection (d) of section 8127 of title       38, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking ``Except'' and inserting ``(1) Except'';        (2) by inserting ``in paragraph (2) and'' before ``in       subsections (b) and (c)''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(2)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), with respect to the       procurement of a covered product or service, a contracting       officer of the Department shall procure such product or       service from a source designated under chapter 85 of title       41, and in accordance with the regulations prescribed under       such chapter.        ``(B) In this paragraph, the term `covered product or       service' means--        ``(i) a product or service that--        ``(I) is included on the procurement list under section       8503(a) of title 41; and        ``(II) was included on such procurement list on or before       December 22, 2006; or        ``(ii) a product or service that--        ``(I) is a replacement for a product or service described       under clause (i);        ``(II) is essentially the same and meeting the same       requirement as the product or service being replaced; and        ``(III) a contracting officer determines meets the quality       standards and delivery schedule of the Department.''.        (b) Conforming Amendments.--Such section is further amended       in each of subsections (b) and (c), by striking ``For'' and       inserting ``Except as provided in subsection (d)(2), for''.        (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall apply with respect to a contract entered into on or       after the date of the enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4920.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this bipartisan legislation sponsored by Ranking  Member Roe and me, and 17 other cosponsors, would provide critically  needed relief for nonprofit companies that employ blind and disabled  workers under the AbilityOne Program.   Approximately 2,000 blind and disabled Americans, including many  veterans, are employed under VA's AbilityOne contracts. Without this  legislation, these nonprofit companies will likely lose their VA  contracts because they will lose their award preference. This bill  would only exempt or grandfather the existing AbilityOne VA contracts  from losing their preference so these employees would keep their jobs.  It will not expand the program.   VA expends approximately $27 billion on contracts and government  purchase cards for goods and services. Of this spending, only about  $100 million is spent on contracts with AbilityOne nonprofit  businesses. Approximately $5 billion is spent on contracts with  veteran-owned small businesses, many owned by disabled veterans.   In other words, VA's AbilityOne contracts are a very small percentage  of the Department's spending. However, the program is vital for the  2,000 blind and otherwise disabled individuals employed through  AbilityOne.   This committee has long championed the Veterans First Contracting  Program and providing more opportunities for veteran-owned small  businesses to do business with the Federal Government.   This legislation means we can support both the Veterans First and  AbilityOne programs that employ and increase economic opportunities for  veterans and individuals with disabilities.   This bill was approved unanimously by the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs and is supported by the Blinded Veterans Association, National  Federation of the Blind, American Council of the Blind, National  Industries for the Blind, National Association for the Employment of  People Who Are Blind, SourceAmerica, and National Council of  SourceAmerica Employers.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this very important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared  to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 4920, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4183) to direct the Comptroller General of the United States  to conduct a study on disability and pension benefits provided to  members of the National Guard and members of reserve components of the  Armed Forces by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4183         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Identifying Barriers and       Best Practices Study Act''.       SEC. 2. COMPTROLLER GENERAL STUDY ON DISABILITY AND PENSION                     BENEFITS PROVIDED TO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL                     GUARD AND MEMBERS OF RESERVE COMPONENTS OF THE                     ARMED FORCES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 36 months after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the       United States shall complete a study on disability and       pension benefits provided to members of the National Guard       and members of reserve components of the Armed Forces by the       Department of Veterans Affairs. In conducting such study, the       Comptroller General shall review, for the period beginning on       January 1, 2008, and ending on December 31, 2018, each of the       following:        (1) The number of members of the National Guard and the       number of members of reserve components of the Armed Forces       who received disability compensation or pension provided by       the Department of Veterans Affairs.        (2) A comparison of each of the following between veterans       who served only in the National Guard or reserve components       and veterans who served in the regular components of the       Armed Forces:        (A) The percentage of each group of such veterans with       service-connected disabilities.        (B) The number of veterans in each group with each       disability rating.        (C) The number of veterans in each group with a service-      connected disability, including the number of each of the       following types of such veterans in each group:        (i) Pilots.        (ii) Veterans who served in the special forces.        (iii) Veterans who participated in the Personnel       Reliability Program.        (iv) Veterans who underwent diving or flight physicals as a       regular component of their service in the Armed Forces and       who have a muscular-skeletal or mental health condition.        (D) The number of total claims for disability compensation       and pension submitted, approved, and disapproved for each       group of veterans.        (3) An identification of common barriers for members of the       National Guard and members of reserve components in obtaining       disability benefits under the laws administered by the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs, including barriers relating to       documentation of injuries incurred while serving, such as       line of duty letters.        (b) Reports.--        (1) Preliminary report.--Not later than 18 months after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       Senate and House of Representatives a preliminary report on       the findings of the study required by subsection (a).        (2) Final report.--Upon completion of the study, the       Comptroller General shall submit to such Committees a final       report on such study.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4183, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4183, as amended, the  Identifying Barriers and Best Practices Study Act, introduced by  Representative Khanna of California.   I support this legislation that requests a multiyear study on VA  disability and pension benefits for members of the Reserve components  and  [[Page H10272]]  National Guard. Any veteran injured during their time in service should  have access to care for lingering disabilities and compensation for  loss of earning power.   Since September 11, members of the Reserve component and National  Guard have increasingly answered the call to service to meet our  Nation's national security needs. Yet, despite greater demands and  commitments, Reserve and National Guard veterans and their families do  not always have easy access to benefits.   We have heard from our VSO partners that Guard and Reservists, like  those who served in special missions, often have difficulty documenting  injuries. Their medical records tend to be scattered and are often  incomplete. This lack of in-service documentation of injury  disproportionately affects Guard and Reservists.   The additional burden of obtaining a line-of-duty determination,  which provides clear documentation of injury, rests on their shoulders.  This can prevent receipt of compensation from VA down the road.   The study requested by this bill will compare Reserve and National  Guard veterans and special operators, such as pilots and divers, to  Active-Duty veterans and provide Congress with a report on the barriers  they face when receiving their benefits through VA. The findings in the  report will best inform Congress on next steps toward providing Reserve  and National Guard veterans the compensation and benefits that they  have earned.   I urge all Members to support H.R. 4183, as amended, and take the  first steps to removing barriers to benefits for Guard, Reserve, and  special operators.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared  to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I just want to take this moment to just reflect on how much our  reservists and National Guard have contributed to our national defense  in these past 18 years.   Some of us may recall the role of the Guard and Reserve during the  Vietnam war era, where that was often a refuge for servicemembers who  were not expecting to be called into Active Duty or called into  service.   But gone are those days. The National Guard and Reserve are called up  frequently, often on multiple deployments, and they have served our  country with vigor, with tremendous patriotism.   So I have to say that I am very pleased that we are moving forward  with this study. I think it is a travesty if our reservists and  guardsmen cannot document their service-connected injuries and not be  able to collect the benefits that they deserve down the road.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 4183, as  amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3530) to amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enforce the licensure requirement for  medical providers of the Department of Veterans Affairs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3530         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I request unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 3530, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3530, as amended, the  Improving Confidence in Veterans' Care Act, introduced by  Representative Cloud of Texas.   This legislation requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to  conduct better oversight of its hospitals' compliance with existing  policies on patient safety and quality of care. Specifically, the bill  directs VA to conduct annual audits and to report to Congress on its  ability to uphold or failure to follow standards for reviewing the  clinical competency of its healthcare professionals.   This bill mandates that VA examine whether its hospitals are  appropriately assessing the qualifications and clinical abilities of VA  healthcare professionals, both before they are hired and while they are  caring for veterans. It also requires VA to ensure employees and  contractors hold active Drug Enforcement Administration registrations  if they are required to prescribe, dispense, administer, or conduct  research with controlled substances.   If concerns arise related to the clinical competence of VA healthcare  professionals, this bill requires VA to ensure its officials conduct  prompt reviews. And when quality of care or patient safety concerns are  substantiated, it requires VA to ensure its hospital leaders promptly  report those concerns to the National Practitioner Data Bank and State  licensing boards.   In addition, this measure requires VA to provide mandatory biannual  training for hospital employees charged with reviewing VA clinician  credentials and monitoring their clinical practice.   The Veterans Affairs' Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations  held a hearing related to these issues on October 16. At the hearing,  my colleagues and I discussed several concerning cases of clinical  incompetency and misconduct among VA clinicians that were widely  reported in the media in recent months. We also explored the very real  risks of patient harm that arise from VA medical centers' noncompliance  with departmental policies and a lack of oversight on the part of  leaders who are higher up in VA's chain of command.   For example, in August 2019, a former VA pathologist in Arkansas was  charged with involuntary manslaughter, fraud, and making false  statements in an attempt to conceal  [[Page H10274]]  years of substance abuse. Over his 11-year tenure with VA, he is  believed to have botched diagnoses for an estimated 3,000 veterans,  some of whom died.   The VA facility that employed this physician either did not catch or  ignored his previous DUI convictions when they hired him. Despite  numerous complaints from colleagues, it took years for leadership at  the facility to investigate allegations that the doctor was showing up  drunk at work.   In addition, in September 2019, the VA OIG reported that multiple  leadership failures and poor oversight of clinical competency at a VA  facility in the Midwest allowed an ophthalmologist to perform  substandard surgery and clinic laser procedures for 2 years. This  doctor regularly took hours to complete cataract surgeries that should  have taken less than 30 minutes.   The facility director and chief of staff repeatedly dismissed  concerns that were raised by other staff, and facility leaders never  called on experts to directly observe this doctor's surgeries until  long after concerns were raised. VA's regional leaders also failed to  carry out related oversight responsibilities.   Both the VA Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Government  Accountability Office have identified longstanding concerns with  whether VA is doing enough to ensure its medical facilities only employ  and contract with highly qualified, highly competent healthcare  professionals.   H.R. 3530, as amended, will require VA to implement a number of GAO  recommendations that were discussed at the October 16 hearing. Both the  Federation of State Medical Boards and the National Council of State  Boards of Nursing support this legislation. I urge all Members to join  me in approving this important bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me say that it was with bipartisan shock and horror that we heard  of the revelations in Arkansas. Certainly, our bipartisan hearts go out  to the families of those veterans in Arkansas. Rest assured, this  committee, on a bipartisan basis, will do everything that we can to  make sure that these sorts of hiring mistakes do not happen again and  that the tragedy we saw in the facilities in Arkansas do not happen  again.   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3530, as amended, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
