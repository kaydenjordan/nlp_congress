 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Sheriff Ronnie  Sprinkle, who began his service as the sheriff of Botetourt County  nearly two decades ago. When Ronnie was just 6 months, his father was  elected as Botetourt County sheriff and held the position for 30 years,  retiring in 1991. Eight years later, the junior Sprinkle followed in  his dad's footsteps and was elected to the same post, which he held  until retirement last month.   Save the 8 years between his father's retirement and Ronnie's  election, 2020 will mark the first time since the heart of the Vietnam  war that a Sprinkle has not led the Botetourt Sheriff's Office.   I want to thank Sheriff Ronnie for his years of service to our  community and congratulate him on all he has accomplished during his  tenure. His tireless work to secure funding for a new public safety  building and jail will not be forgotten.   The risks and responsibilities that come with being a law enforcement  officer are many, and I want to express my sincere gratitude to Ronnie  Sprinkle for his unwavering commitment to Botetourt County and all our  men and women in blue.                            ____________________
