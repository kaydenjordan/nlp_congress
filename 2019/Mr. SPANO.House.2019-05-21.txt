 Madam Speaker, this country was built by great leaders on  the bedrock of even greater ideals. The idea that all are created equal  and endowed with those certain inalienable rights.   The idea that democracy was instituted not to bestow rights given to  us by God, but to safeguard them from tyranny. The conviction that a  government's power to protect our rights comes solely by consent of the  governed. But as we are a country of imperfect leaders, we often fall  far short of these perfect ideals.   And 100 years ago today, great women brought this country into a new  age; an age where women are endowed with that inalienable right to  vote; an age where women can safeguard their rights at the ballot box;  an age where the power of our democracy comes from the consent of all  the governed.   And at a time when a woman serves as Speaker of the House and there  are more Congresswomen with us today than at any other point in our  history.   We are in this age because of great women. And I am honored to share  this House with so many of you.                            ____________________
