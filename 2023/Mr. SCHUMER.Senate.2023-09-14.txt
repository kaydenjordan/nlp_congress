 Mr. President, yesterday, Senators from both sides of  the aisle participated in one of the most informative and historic  discussions ever held in the Congress.   Many of us came out of our first AI Insight Forum exhilarated. The  debate was illuminating; the discussions, candid and unvarnished, and  direct.   I want to thank Senators Rounds, Heinrich, and Young for joining me  in leading the discussion. They helped make yesterday an all-out  success.   I want to thank every Senator who attended. We had great turnout. I  am told about 70 Senators from both parties attended, and I think we  all left with a greater understanding and appreciation of AI's  importance and complexity.   By the end of the day, everyone in the room did reach a consensus on  a few important points.   First, Congress must play a role--must play a role--in regulating AI.  One of the most striking moments at the forum was when I asked all of  the participants--the critics, the experts, the developers alike--to  raise their hands if they agreed that government had to be involved,  and we had universal support. Not one person had their hand down.   Second, most everyone agreed that the government must also play a  role promoting what we call transformational innovation. Bill Gates  talked about AI's potential for combating hunger worldwide. Eric  Schmidt talked about the way AI could help doctors do their job.  Senator Rounds, in a touching moment, talked about losing his wife to  cancer, which hit home to a lot of people in the room, as it does with  millions and millions of Americans. And it led to a conversation about  how AI can be used one day to model never-before-seen drugs to do the  unthinkable: cure cancer.   But at the same time and with equal vehemence--maybe even more--we  had a consensus on the need for guardrails for a sustainable  innovation, because just as AI can be used to design cancer cures, it  could also, if things went wrong, be used to make terrible bioweapons  or other dangers.  [[Page S4502]]    I think everyone at the forum agreed that if we don't do anything on  AI, then the lowest common denominator can occur: Racial bias that is  in our society would be enshrined in AI; massive job displacement and  even more unthinkable doomsday scenarios. So we talked about the need  for not only transformational innovation that does the positive but for  sustainable innovation, where the government installs guardrails to  minimize these risks.   It is called sustainable because AI won't be able to go forward if we  don't have guardrails to prevent the very serious downsides. And we  agreed that only the government can fill the hole of creating and  enforcing these guardrails, because even if a good number of private  companies do the responsible thing and regulate themselves, there will  always be outlier companies that don't, and that brings the lowest  common denominator way down.   Finally, there was a consensus that we need to find balance between  innovation and guardrails. This won't be easy, but it is essential. You  can't go too far in either direction. We want to both maximize the  benefits and minimize the risks, and if you go too far on one side, you  may hurt the other. So Congress must pay attention to both. That ain't  easy. This is going to be one of the toughest jobs the Congress has  ever undertaken but one of the most important and one of the most  necessary.   To be sure, we didn't cover everything in today's forum. We are just  at the beginning. The conversation that began yesterday will continue  into the fall and beyond when we host even more AI Insight Forums. Our  committees, which will have to do the work--the real work--of crafting  legislation, have already held a dozen hearings and are going to hold a  lot more, using what we learn at the forums to help craft legislation.   Well, we have a lot of work in front of us, but yesterday's  conversation gave the Senate a strong sense of where to begin, and it  was a decided blow to the ostriches around here who might put their  heads in the sand and say: It is too complicated. It is too difficult.  Let's do nothing.   Thanks to all of our participants who came to yesterday's AI forum.  Thanks to Senators Rounds and Young and Heinrich for hosting with me,  and thanks to all of my colleagues who joined. Let's now look ahead to  our second day AI Insight Forum, which will happen very soon.                          Business Before the Senate    Now, Mr. President, on Senate business, today, the Senate will take  the next step in our bipartisan appropriations process. Later this  morning, we will hold a vote on the motion to proceed to the minibus,  which contains three spending bills: MILCON-VA, Agriculture, and  Transportation-Housing, affectionately known around here as T-HUD.   Earlier this week, the first vote on this bill got an overwhelming  85-to-12 vote. That is yet another example of the bipartisan nature of  our work here in the Senate to date, and I hope both sides come out in  strong support of the vote in a few minutes. We should not slow this  process down because once we are on the bill, I look forward to a  constructive debate where both sides can secure votes on amendments.   Off the floor, the work of advancing the President's highly qualified  nominees also continues. Today, the Judiciary Committee will hold a  markup on another seven district judges, two U.S. attorneys, and other  nominees.   I thank Chairman Durbin and my colleagues on the Judiciary for their  work. They have helped the U.S. Senate confirm over 140 judges,  including 36 circuit judges, 104 district court judges, and, of course,  Ketanji Brown Jackson, the historic nomination to the U.S. Supreme  Court.                              Republican Agenda    Mr. President, on Republican extremism, a lot has changed since I  first arrived in Congress but nothing more so than the seismic shift in  the Republican Party's support for the members of our great Armed  Forces.   When I arrived in the House, Republican Representatives used to fall  over each other to give speeches expressing support for those in  uniform--the same when I arrived in the Senate. Their policies didn't  always match the rhetoric, but the support truly seemed real and  genuine. It no longer does. Oh, some of them may still use the  rhetoric, but these days, the actions we see on the other side say more  than all of the patriotic rhetoric on Earth.   Look at where we are. In the House, the Republicans can't even agree  to debate a bill to fund the Defense Department and the intelligence  community, and they balk at providing emergency aid to a democratic  partner fighting off a Russian invasion. In the Senate, our Republican  colleagues are more supportive of our Ukrainian friends, to their  credit, but extremists in their ranks are blocking the promotion of  hundreds of military leaders. And what does the Republican leadership  do? Nothing--tacit approval of this nakedly cynical tactic. They are  shrugging their shoulders and letting it go forward. The result? Real  lives--real lives, families--trapped in limbo because a select few want  to push the MAGA hard line on women's choice.   To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, these  servicemembers--the finest our military has to offer--are seemingly  just numbers on the Senate calendar. The Senator from Alabama claims  that no one is being harmed by his obstruction and that the leadership  of his conference supports him.   Well, I say to my friends: These are not just numbers. Our armed  services members are real people who have dedicated their lives to  serving and defending our great country. They are real families,  spouses, children whose lives have been put in limbo by the callous  calculation of the Senator from Alabama; officers who cannot assume  their new assignments, spouses who cannot find jobs in new locations,  families who cannot get settled in their new homes; kids who have to go  to a new school can't start.   The bottom line is this: This is a Republican problem. It was created  by the Senator from Alabama--no one else--and it is up to Republicans  to put pressure on him to back off, plain and simple.   We already see that pressure mount. Last week, one of the major  Republican Presidential candidates said that the Senator from Alabama  ought to back off. Just a few days ago, the House chairman of the  Foreign Relations Committee--one of the most respected, conservative  Members of the House--said the same thing. But Senate Republican  leaders need to step up. Yet here we are with extremists--extremists-- of one party choosing to upend the lives of hundreds of dedicated and  honorable military families.   I will continue to find a way to break this logjam and get these  lives back on track.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I call up substitute amendment, No.  1092, and ask that it be reported by number.    Madam President, I ask to dispense with further reading  of the amendment.    Madam President, I move to commit H.R. 4366 to the  Appropriations Committee, with instructions to report back forthwith  with an amendment.    I ask to dispense with further reading.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 265.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 37.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, September 14, be  waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session, to be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of S. Res. 345, which is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until  3 p.m. on Monday, September 18; that following the prayer and pledge,  the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use  later in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of  Calendar No. 198, H.R. 4366; further, that at 5 p.m., the Senate  proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the Oliver  nomination and that the cloture motions filed during today's session  ripen at 5:30 p.m.  [[Page S4542]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.
