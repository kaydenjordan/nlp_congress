 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on H.R. 4863 and to insert extraneous materials thereon.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4863, the United  States Export Finance Agency Act of 2019.   H.R. 4863 reauthorizes and makes key improvements to the job-creating  Export-Import Bank. Let me begin by describing why the Ex-Im Bank is so  important.   The Ex-Im Bank was established 85 years ago and is the official  export credit agency of the United States. Its mission is to promote  the export of U.S. goods and services in order to help create and  sustain jobs in the United States.   Over the last 10 years, the Ex-Im Bank has supported more than 1.5  million American jobs at no cost to the taxpayer, financed more than  $255 billion in U.S. exports, and remitted more than $3.4 billion in  deficit-reducing receipts to the Treasury.   In my district, the Ex-Im Bank is currently financing $269 million  worth of exports from 13 different exporters, including 10 small  businesses.   Ex-Im does not compete with the private sector but, instead, fills in  gaps when the private sector lacks the capacity or willingness to  provide the financing required by U.S. exporters.   During the financial crisis, the Ex-Im Bank was an important source  of financing when private capital was simply unavailable to many  businesses. Ex-Im estimates that during fiscal year 2010, in the depths  of the financial crisis, it supported 227,000 jobs at more than 3,300  companies.   The Bank also plays a key role in leveling the international playing  field by offsetting the financing offered by foreign export credit  agencies. The Ex-Im Bank is one of more than 100 export credit agencies  around the world that help their home-country exporters compete in the  global markets.   If we fail to reauthorize the Bank, American businesses will be  harmed, and thousands of jobs will be lost.   Unfortunately, in 2015, the Republican leadership in the House  allowed the Bank's charter to expire for the first time in the Bank's  history. At that time, a number of countries, including China,  celebrated the Bank's closure because of the competitive advantage it  gave them over U.S. businesses and workers.   Later, Republicans in the Senate hobbled Ex-Im for 4 years by  refusing to confirm board directors, which prevented them from having a  quorum. Ex-Im reported that it was unable to approve $40 billion worth  of transactions during this period, which would  [[Page H8846]]  have supported an estimated 250,000 jobs.                                time  1415    H.R. 4863 is intended to renew the confidence of U.S. exporters in  the Ex-Im Bank while also sending a message to the world that the U.S.  is ready and is prepared to aggressively compete in overseas export  markets.   H.R. 4863 reauthorizes the Ex-Im Bank for 10 years and increases the  Bank's lending authority from $135 billion to $175 billion. The bill  strengthens support for small businesses, which are the engine of  growth in our economy, and it creates an Office of Minority and Women  Inclusion as well as an Office of Territorial Exporting to support  exporters in Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and other U.S.  territories.   The bill also focuses the Bank's attention on protecting the  environment by creating an office for renewable energy exports,  strengthening the Bank's environmental policies and procedures, and  encouraging greater accountability with respect to local communities  that could be negatively affected by Bank-supported projects.   Importantly, H.R. 4863 also includes procedures to avoid a lapse in  the Board's quorum so that the Bank can maintain its full operational  capacity even when the Senate is unable to confirm Board directors.   The bill includes a number of provisions to ensure that Ex-Im  financing does not inadvertently support bad actors. For example, the  bill prohibits financing for the Chinese military, the Chinese  intelligence services, and any other bad actors, including anyone who  has criminally violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or has  violated U.S. intellectual property laws.   Moreover, H.R. 4863 would require the parties to an Ex-Im transaction  to certify that neither they nor any of their subsidiaries engage in  activities in violation of U.S.-sanctioned laws.   So, Mr. Chairman, it is imperative that we reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank  so that our businesses, U.S. businesses large and small, will have the  financing support they need to compete in the global markets while  preserving and creating American jobs at home.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to remind this body that  Mr. McHenry is one of the ones responsible for the nonreauthorization  of the Ex-Im Bank before. He didn't support it then, and he doesn't  support it now, and he never will because he is opposed to Ex-Im Bank  reauthorization, period.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Heck), a key sponsor of this legislation and a major supporter of Ex- Im.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I would like to remind the House that the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) has 16 total exporters in his  district, would support a value of $52 million. I would hope that as he  opposes this bill, he is reminded that between 2014 and 2020, his  district received substantial support.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green),  a strong supporter of the Bank and the chair of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Financial Services.    Mr. Chair, I would like to again remind Mr. Barr that  between 2014 and 2020, his State received $10 million in total export  value.   I would also like to remind this body that he did not support  reauthorization in the past. He does not do it now. I don't know if  there will ever be a good enough bill to have him and the ranking  member support Export-Import.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Garcia).    Mr. Chair, this is another Member on the opposite side of  the aisle, the gentleman from Arkansas, who, when we were trying to get  the Bank up and running, he voted against reauthorization. He is voting  against it again today. I don't know what it would take to make these  Members who have consistently opposed reauthorization to ever support  Ex-Im.   I would like to remind him there are 10 exporters in his district for  a total of $43 million--that is a total value of export--between 2014  and 2020.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Stanton).    Mr. Chair, I am pleased that the gentleman from Arizona  just talked about the kind of support he has in his district. Let me  remind the House that we have support from the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, Aerospace Industries Association, International Association  of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, International Federation  of Professional and Technical Engineers, National Association of  Manufacturers, Boeing, and Air Tractor, Inc. What you have here is  business and labor have come together to support this most important  bill.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record letters of support.                                                Chamber of Commerce                                 of the United States of America,                                   Washington, DC, October 28, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry: The U.S.       Chamber of Commerce thanks the committee for considering       legislation to provide for long-term reauthorizations of the       Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (``TRIA'') program and the       Export-Import Bank of the United States (``Ex-Im''). The       Chamber strongly supports the substitute amendment to H.R.       4634, the ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization       Act of 2019.'' The Chamber also strongly supports the       ``United States Export Finance Agency Act of 2019,'' and       opposes all amendments that are intended to serve as ``poison       pills'' which would prevent this legislation from viable       consideration on the House floor or in the Senate.    H.R. 4634, the ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act                                 of 2019''         Since its initial enactment in 2002, TRlA has served as a       vital public-private risk sharing mechanism, ensuring that       private terrorism risk insurance coverage remains       commercially available and that the U.S. economy would more       swiftly recover in the event of a terrorist attack.        The Chamber strongly supports the substitute amendment to       H.R. 4634, the ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Program       Reauthorization Act of 2019,'' and applauds the leadership of       Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry in reaching this       bipartisan deal which would provide a seven-year       reauthorization of this important program while providing for       a study on the evolving risks in cyberterrorism and the       affordability and availability of TRIA coverage for places of       worship.           The ``United States Export Finance Agency Act of 2019''         As the official U.S. export credit agency (``ECA''), Ex-      lm's mission is to support domestic jobs by facilitating the       export of goods or services when private sector lenders are       unable or unwilling to provide financing. Foreign governments       have established 113 ECAs of their own around the world. In       2018, China's two ECAs alone provided 130 times as much       medium- and long-term export credit support as the Ex-Im       Bank. Due to the extensive competition in this space, it is       vital that Ex-Im be reauthorized to ensure that U.S.       businesses and workers are not deprived of a basic tool       enjoyed by their competitors in every other country.        The Chamber strongly supports the ``United States Export       Finance Agency Act of 2019.'' This legislation builds off of       S. 2293, the ``Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of       2019,'' which was introduced earlier this year with the       bipartisan support of Senators Kevin Cramer and Kyrsten       Sinema, and cosponsored by Senators Thom Tillis, Maria       Cantwell, Roy Blunt, Patty Murray, Lindsey Graham, Chris       Coons, Susan Collins and Maggie Hassan. This legislation       would provide exporters with 10 years of much-needed       certainty.        In May, the Senate confirmed three of Ex-Im's board       members, establishing a quorum for the first time since 2015       and finally making the Bank fully functional after several       years of being limited to only supporting transactions less       than $10 million. This bill would also establish an       alternative procedure during any future lapses in the board's       quorum to ensure that Ex-Im can continue to serve its vital       role in supporting U.S. jobs.        U.S. exporters and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that       they support need long-term certainty--simply extending the       life of Ex-Im through short-term continuing resolutions is       not enough. The Chamber strongly urges members of the       Committee to vote in support of this long-term legislation       and urges members to oppose the adoption of any ``poison       pill'' amendments that are intended to prevent this       legislation from viable consideration on the House floor or       in the U.S. Senate.        The Chamber thanks you for your attention on these       important issues and looks forward to working with you to       ensure long-term reauthorizations of both of these important       programs.            Sincerely,                                                   Neil L. Bradley,      Executive Vice President & Chief Policy Officer.                                   ____                                           U.S. Chamber of Commerce,                                  Congressional & Public Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, November 11, 2019.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports H.R. 4863, the       ``United States Export Finance Agency Act of 2019,'' which       would provide for a long-term reauthorization of the Export-      Import Bank (``Ex-Im''). The Chamber will consider including       votes on this legislation--including votes on amendments--in       our annual How They Voted scorecard.        As the official U.S. export credit agency (``ECA''), Ex-      Im's mission is to support domestic jobs by facilitating the       export of goods or services when private sector lenders are       unable or unwilling to provide financing. Foreign governments       have established 113 ECAs of their own around the world. In       2018, China's two ECAs alone provided 130 times as much       medium- and long-term export credit support as the Ex-Im       Bank. Due to the extensive competition in this space, it is       vital that Ex-Im be reauthorized to ensure that U.S.       businesses and workers are not deprived of a basic tool       enjoyed by their competitors in every other country.        H.R. 4863 builds off of S. 2293, the ``Export-Import Bank       Reauthorization Act of 2019,'' which was introduced earlier       this year with the bipartisan support of Senators Kevin       Cramer and Kyrsten Sinema, and cosponsored by Senators Thom       Tillis, Maria Cantwell, Roy Blunt, Patty Murray, Lindsey       Graham, Chris Coons, Susan Collins and Maggie Hassan. Both of       these pieces of legislation would provide 10 years of much       needed certainty, establish an alternative procedure during       any future lapses in the board's  [[Page H8851]]       quorum, and raise Ex-Im's lending authority to ensure that it       can compete globally.        H.R. 4863 includes several additional provisions, including       restrictions that would ensure that Ex-Im financing follows       strict new rules to prevent financing for the Chinese army       and intelligence services, sanctioned entities, and known       violators of anti-bribery and intellectual property laws.        U.S. exporters and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that       they support need long-term certainty--simply extending the       life of Ex-Im through short-term continuing resolutions is       not enough. The Chamber urges you to support H.R. 4863.            Sincerely,      Jack Howard.                                   ____                                 Aerospace Industries Association,                                    Arlington, VA, October 29, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, House Committee on Financial Services,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Financial Services,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry: On       behalf of the nearly 340 member companies of the Aerospace       Industries Association (AIA), we urge you to reauthorize the       Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank before the November 21 deadline. A       fully functioning Ex-Im Bank is vital to aerospace and other       industries.        The U.S. aerospace and defense industry supports more than       2.5 million American jobs, thousands of which have been       supported by Ex-Im Bank financing solutions that facilitate       the export of American goods and services. Moreover, the Bank       is essential for businesses of all sizes, as more than 90       percent of the Bank's transactions in FY2019 directly       supported American small businesses. This is done at no cost       to the U.S. taxpayer. In fact, in 2014 (the last entire year       the Bank was fully operational), the Bank paid $1 billion       into the U.S. Treasury, generated from the interest paid on       loans and the fees from the Bank's foreign customers.        Ultimately, the Ex-Im Bank levels the playing field against       foreign competitors in increasingly competitive international       markets. Key competing nations view aerospace as critical for       their economic growth and security interests and are       increasing investments in their respective domestic aerospace       industries. These countries are using their export credit       agencies (ECAs) to increase foreign sales and thus gain       advantage in the market. U.S. industries are up against more       than 110 foreign ECAs in an increasingly competitive export       market. Without the Bank, we're giving foreign powers the       advantage--the Bank is a necessary equalizer.        We overwhelmingly support moving forward with Ex-Im       legislation that will pass both the House and Senate. This       legislation must include key principles, including long-term       reauthorization, an increase in the authorization ceiling,       and a quorum fix.        We look forward to working with you on Ex-Im       reauthorization and ensuring that our industry remains       economically competitive globally.            Sincerely,      Tim McClees,        Vice President, Legislative Affairs, Aerospace Industries       Association.                                   ____                                           International Association                             of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,                               Upper Marlboro, MD, October 28, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the International       Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), the       largest aerospace manufacturing union in North America, I       strongly urge you as a member of the House Financial Services       Committee to support this vital legislation and vote ``Yes''       to advance the United States Export Finance Agency Act of       2019. This legislation would create and sustain U.S. jobs in       manufacturing and other strategic industries and improve the       balance of trade between the U.S. and high export nations by       reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank for the next ten years.        The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) is one of the few U.S.       institutions that actually supports U.S. exports and jobs by       providing vital loan guarantees for the sale of U.S. goods       and services to international markets. This legislation would       rename the Ex-IM Bank to the United States Export Finance       Agency, but its mission would remain the same, ``to assist in       financing the export of U.S. goods and services'', enabling       ``large and small companies to turn export opportunities into       real sales that help to maintain and create U.S. jobs and       contribute to a stronger national economy.'' With the banks       authorizing charter set to expire in November 2019, it is       imperative that Congress work expeditiously to pass this Ex-      IM Bank reauthorization legislation before the bank's charter       lapses.        American jobs depend upon a fully functioning Ex-Im Bank       with a fully staffed board of directors to provide vital       financing for the export of U.S. made products. Under the       Bank's current charter projects which require more than $10       million in financing must be approved by the Ex-IM Bank board       of directors. However, the lack of a quorum on the board in       recent years has crippled the Ex-Im Bank's ability to support       U.S. manufacturers and workers, particularly in the aerospace       industry, one of the last sectors in which the U.S. enjoys a       positive balance of trade with the rest of the world.       According to the bank's most recent annual report, the Ex-Im       Bank authorized only $3.3 billion in export credit in FY       2018. This is down from $20 billion in authorized export       credit in FY 2014, which was the last year the bank was fully       operational with a fully staffed board. Consequently, the       bank estimates that it supported a mere 33,000 U.S. jobs in       FY 2018, a fraction of the 164,000 American jobs that the       bank supported in FY 2014 when it operated with a full       quorum. Meanwhile, job producing export projects are being       taken by foreign competitors. Our international competitors       continue to support their companies through comprehensive       industrial policies in addition to robust export financing       agencies. China alone has three export credit agencies that       dwarf what our Ex-Im Bank provides.        The proposed legislation not only reauthorizes the Ex-IM       bank over the next ten years, but it includes important       provisions to reform the bank's quorum rules which have       severely limited the banks effectiveness in recent years. The       bill provides for a process to seat a temporary board if a       quorum cannot be reached over a 90 day period. In addition to       these needed reforms to the quorum rules, this legislation       would gradually increase the Ex-Im Bank's lending authority       from $135 billion to $175 billion, allowing the bank to       expand its portfolio of projects, increase U.S. exports,       create additional U.S. jobs, and drive economic growth.        For all of these reasons, I urge all members of the House       Financial Services Committee to support this vitally       important legislation and vote ``Yes'' in favor of passage of       The United States Export Finance Agency Act of 2019.        For more information, please contact IAM Legislative       Director.            Thank you,                                              Robert Martinez, Jr.,      International President.                                   ____                                                          AFL-CIO,                                  Washington, DC, November 13, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I write to       express our strong support for the ``United States Export       Finance Agency Act of 2019'' (H.R. 4863) scheduled for floor       consideration this week.        A healthy Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) is pivotal to the       creation and sustainability of U.S. jobs in manufacturing, as       well as increasing U.S. exports, thereby improving the       balance of trade between the U.S. and high export countries.        H.R. 4863 reauthorizes the Ex-Im Bank for the next ten       years and would gradually increase the bank's lending       authority by $40 billion, resulting in an expansion of       projects. Although the bill would rename the Ex-Im Bank as       the ``United States Export Finance Agency,'' its intended       mission ``to assist in financing the export of U.S. goods and       services'' would remain unchanged. The legislation also       includes provisions that reform the Bank's quorum rules that       have severely limited the Bank's viability in recent years.        The creation of U.S. jobs is essential to a strong economy,       and with the Bank's authorizing charter set to expire in       later this month, now is the time to pass this important       piece of legislation. For the reasons stated above, we urge       you to vote for the immediate passage of H.R. 4863.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,                                                          Director,      Government Affairs.                                   ____           International Federation of Professional & Technical             Engineers,                                 Washington, DC, November 12, 2019.        Dear Representative: As the executive officers of the       International Federation of Professional & Technical       Engineers (IFPTE), representing upwards of 90,000 workers, we       urge you to vote to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank by       passing H.R. 4863. ``United States Export Finance Agency Act       of 2019.'' This legislation supports American jobs in       strategic industries and sectors of the U.S. economy, helps       domestic manufacturing compete with manufacturers in high       export nations. and takes steps to maintain the Export-Import       Bank's (EXIM) operations over the next ten years.        EXIM is a critical tool that promotes U.S. manufacturing       exports, from the primary exporter down through the domestic       supply chain and requires at least 85% domestic content for       full financing support. Among the U.S. workers that have       benefited from EXIM are IFPTE members working at Boeing.       Spirit AeroSystems. and Triumph Composite Systems. EXIM's       financing for commercial airplane exports not only supports       high-paying jobs and strategic sectors of the economy but       also helps reduce the U.S. trade deficit. and provides       financing for diverse industries, including small- and       medium-sized business. consumable and durable goods       exporters, and services exporters. The ExportImport Bank also       results in a reduction of our national debt. as it has proven       itself to be a federal agency that added $9.6 billion in       revenue to our national budget since 1992.        Emerging national economies have aggressively expanded       their export financing agencies and Organization for Economic       Cooperation & Development (OECD) nations continue their       export credit support, making it critically important for       Congress to respond by reauthorizing EXIM before its current       authorization expires after November 21. China's two export       credit agencies totaled $39 billion in new medium- to long-      term export credits in 2018, an amount greater than the next       three countries' (Italy, German, and  [[Page H8852]]       South Korea) combined authorizations. By comparison, EXIM       committed just $300 million in medium- to long-term export       credits for 2018 with all financial authorizations for the       year totaling $3.3 billion. EXIM's financial authorizations       have ranked near the bottom of OECD nations and emerging       national economies over the last three years due to EXIM       lacking a quorum for its Board from mid-2015 to May 2019,       leaving it unable to approve transactions exceeding $10       million during that time. The three-year backlog of       transactions in the EXIM pipeline totals $40 billion and is       estimated by EXIM to support 240,000 jobs.        IFPTE supports this legislation as well as the Senate bill       sponsored by Senator Kevin Cramer, S. 2293, because it       includes straightforward measures to reform EXIM's quorum       rules so that EXIM's ability to support American exports and       jobs cannot be limited by political gridlock, reauthorizes       EXIM for ten years. and gradually increases EXIM's exposure       cap from $135 billion to $175 billion over seven years. These       provisions will create stability and room for EXIM's       financing ability to grow its portfolio of projects, support       U.S. exports and jobs. and drive economic growth.        For these reasons, we urge you to vote for the ``United       States Export Finance Agency Act of 2019.'' Thank you for       your consideration. Should you have any questions. please       feel free to contact either of us or IFPTE legislative       representative.            Sincerely.      Paul Shearon,        President.      Matthew Biggs,        Secretary-Treasurer/Legislative Director.                                   ____                              National Association of Manufacturers,                                                 November 14, 2019.        Dear Representative: Following strong growth and job       creation over the past several years, manufacturers in       America are now facing global economic headwinds and       grappling with uncertainty in trade policy. If this       uncertainty is allowed to persist, America will feel the       consequences of reduced demand, production and employment in       the manufacturing industry. That is why the National       Association of Manufacturers urges you to act now to help       reverse this trend by supporting H.R. 4863, the United States       Export Finance Agency Act, which provides a long-term       reauthorization of the U.S. Export-Import Bank that will       enable manufacturers to export more of our products, invest       more in our communities and hire more American workers.        H.R. 4863 will provide the tools that manufacturers need to       compete in the global economy. More than 100 foreign export       credit agencies around the world are actively helping their       manufacturers win sales and jobs. Failing to reauthorize the       bank is akin to unilateral disarmament. The Ex-Im Bank fills       the gaps when the private sector is unable or unwilling to       finance or provide other tools needed to participate in       foreign projects or make export sales. Since 2000, the Ex-Im       Bank has facilitated nearly $450 billion in exports from       thousands of U.S. companies-with more than 90% of its       transactions directly supporting small businesses-and       supported more than 2.5 million American jobs.        In the decade following the Great Recession, countries have       prioritized exports, leading to a substantial increase in       global export credit financing. China is the most aggressive       nation, using export credit to expand its influence around       the globe. Chinese programs are opaque and unregulated, with       estimates that China provided more than $500 billion in       export credit in 2018, more support than all G7 export credit       agencies combined.        To counter China and remain competitive, manufacturers in       the United States need H.R. 4863. It includes a 10-year       reauthorization, an increase in the authorization ceiling and       measures to ensure that the agency's board of directors will       remain fully functioning for the length of the       reauthorization. The USEFAA also includes important reforms       to prevent the misuse of Ex-Im Bank financing by entities       connected to the Chinese People's Liberation Army or other       sanctioned entities involved in corruption, intellectual       property theft and other activities that threaten U.S.       security. At the same time, this legislation will enable       manufacturers in the United States to compete with China       everywhere, outside and inside China.        The USEFAA is a win for American manufacturing workers. It       will level the playing field, help manufacturers win sales       and set an example of the values we are proud to represent on       the global stage. Manufacturers urge your support for H.R.       4863 and ask that you reject amendments that would undermine       this robust reauthorization and the ability of the agency to       enable manufacturers to compete effectively around the world.            Sincerely,      Jay Timmons.                                   ____                                               The Boeing Company,                                    Arlington, VA, October 28, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, House Committee on Financial Services,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters, The Boeing Company values your       commitment to American manufacturing and job growth. As you       know well, American workers create some of the best products       and services in the world. When we are able to compete on a       level playing field, we are able to create good-paying jobs       by selling those products around the globe.        We write today to express our strong support for your       legislation, the United States Export Finance Agency Act of       2019, which would provide a long-term reauthorization for the       Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im).        A full, long-term reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank is       critical to stabilizing and strengthening America's economic       capability in this current, unstable global market.       Manufacturers and businesses that invest in equipment and       other building materials would be greatly empowered by the       stability brought by your legislation's 10 year       reauthorization of the Ex-Im charter.        We also strongly support the permanent fix to the quorum       requirements for larger deals. as well as the increase in cap       thresholds, bringing the policies of Ex-Im in line with the       modern challenges our American workers and businesses face in       the global marketplace today.        During the last eight years, Ex-Im has supported more than       1.4 million U.S. jobs. In 2018 alone, the Ex-Im Bank helped       more than 2,100 small businesses export their products. These       impressive data points don't include the countless other       supply chain companies who do business with larger U.S.       exporters who also use Ex-Im financing.        Ex-Im is a tremendous asset to American businesses. We       support your leadership in authoring the United States Export       Finance Agency Act and urge all members of the House       Financial Services Committee to vote in favor of its passage.            Sincerely,      Tim Keating,        Executive Vice President, Government Operations, The Boeing       Company.                                   ____                                                 Air Tractor Inc.,                                        Olney, TX, October 28, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters, Chair,      Hon. Patrick McHenry, Ranking Minority Member,      House Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry: It is my       understanding that your committee will consider mark up       tomorrow of which one consideration is reauthorization of the       Export-Import Bank (United States Export Finance Agency of       2019). I have communicated to you before on how important the       Export-Import Bank (``Ex-Im'') is to Air Tractor, a small       business manufacturer and exporter. Ex-Im allows us to create       and sustain jobs in rural north Texas. There is no substitute       for Ex-Im and its products. Ex-Im is very important to small       business and in my opinion, to all exporters large and small.       Ex-Im means U.S. jobs.        I would urge swift and bipartisan action tomorrow to       advance this legislation as currently proposed. The U.S.       needs a robust and long-term reauthorization of Ex-Im.        If you have any questions of me, please contact me.            Sincerely,                                                      David Ickert,                                                 Treasurer and CFO.     Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Mr. Chair, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader  and a longtime supporter of Ex-Im.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader, to respond to anything he  would like to respond to.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the majority  leader.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Heck).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Earlier this year when the Ex-Im reauthorization was still in  committee, we entered into good-faith negotiations with Ranking Member  McHenry. Unfortunately, the China state-owned enterprise provision  insisted on by the ranking member came up short and prevented us from  reaching broad bipartisan support for the bill.   In fact, his China provision was roundly rejected in seven different  votes in committee. This provision was voted down during markup because  my colleagues realized that it would do more to harm U.S. exporters and  U.S. jobs than help to counter against the very real problems faced by  U.S. exporters competing with China.   There are a number of other provisions in Mr. McHenry's bill that are  unnecessary, even burdensome, and aimed at diminishing the bank's  ability to function. In fact, in many ways, rather than seeking to  strengthen and improve the flexibility of the bank to meet the  challenges faced by U.S. industry today, the provisions in this bill  put forward by the ranking member consistently sought to further  constrain the bank with unnecessary and, in many cases, new limits and  restrictions.   What the Republicans don't say is that a bipartisan bill in the  Senate was introduced that had none of Mr. McHenry's problematic  provisions. Then, last week, the President similarly said that he also  supported a 10-year clean reauthorization, which is odd since the  Republicans claimed he supported Mr. McHenry's hurdles for the Ex-Im  Bank.   I continue to believe that this provision will hamper Ex-Im's ability  to support U.S. exporters and American jobs.   Let me just wrap this up by saying that this is a significant bill  that we have before this House. This is a bill that will correct the  harm that has been done to our export agency. This is a bill that will  create more jobs.   This is a bill that has the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  GE, Boeing, the AFL-CIO, the International Association of Machinists  and Aerospace Workers, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers,  the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the International  Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, the Business  Roundtable, and North America's Building Trades Unions.   So, here we have a bill where we have people who oppose each other  all the time and have come together because they know that it is in the  best interests of our country. They know that they have put us in a  position--those who have been voting against reauthorization--of being  noncompetitive with China and other countries who like to see us in  that weakened position.   This bill is going to bring us out of that weakened position. This is  a bill that improves upon our ability to provide export financing. This  is a bill that will create jobs.   This is a bill that recognizes that we are not manufacturing at the  rate that we should be in this country. And we are not going to be in  that position any more.   This is a bill that creates jobs in all of our districts. This is a  bill that I would ask my Members to please support, and let's keep  America moving forward with the export-import bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I strongly oppose this amendment. This amendment undermines a  carefully crafted compromise on environmental reforms, both in the  underlying bill and developed by my good friend from Illinois.    It undermines U.S. leadership on growing more jobs in renewable  energy, eliminates accountability at Ex-Im, and ends efforts to have  Ex-Im consult with local communities on projects it supports.   I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for offering this important amendment.   This amendment builds on the important work of the gentleman from New  York on combating illegal opioids in this country. It ensures that  those who are sanctioned because of their involvement in the illegal  trade of opioids do not get access to Ex-Im assistance, including any  sanctions imposed pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation  Act.   I strongly support the gentleman's amendment to strengthen this bill  with respect to preventing the illegal trafficking of synthetic opioids  and urge all my colleagues to do so.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment demonstrates a fundamental  misunderstanding about what Ex-Im does and whom it benefits.   The beneficiaries of Ex-Im's assistance are U.S. exporters and the  American workers they employ. It is in America's interest to have a  fully functioning Ex-Im because it allows U.S. companies to compete in  the global markets.   Mr. Davidson's amendment would effectively ban using the Ex-Im Bank  in China or Mexico to try to put pressure on Governments of Mexico and  China to cooperate with the U.S. to stop the trafficking of synthetic  opioids.   No one wants to support the trafficking of opioids, but Ex-Im is  precisely the wrong agency to use to achieve foreign policy outcomes.  If Mexico or China do not cooperate, those countries will not be harmed  by this amendment; American companies and workers will be. The Mexican  or Chinese Governments will simply buy products from another country  that is more than willing to sell them exports.   If the goal is to fight the opioid crisis, we need to support  programs like Ex-Im that are going to be creating good, well-paying  jobs in every district all over the country and support small  businesses that are the drivers of community investment and  development.   And if we really want to put pressure on foreign governments to  cooperate with the U.S. in preventing the trafficking of opioids, then  we need to bolster our sanctions program, which can deny the bad actor  to the largest economy in the world.   I understand Mr. Davidson's strongly held desire to do something to  address this opioid epidemic and to protect Ex-Im from being improperly  accessed by criminal networks trafficking in synthetic opioids. That is  why I strongly support Mr. McAdams' and Mr. Rose's amendment to  directly cut off Ex-Im financing from those criminal entities that  violate sanctions dealing with illegal opioids, including violations of  the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. Mr. Rose also has  legislation pending that would further broaden those who are sanctioned  under U.S. law for illegal opioids.   Mr. Davidson's concerns are understandable, but in practice, this  amendment would limit the ability of Ex-Im to support U.S. jobs and  small businesses, further exacerbating the conditions that have  contributed to this opioid epidemic.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Heck)    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, this misguided amendment is going to hurt American  workers and American businesspersons. This is not the way to get at the  issue the gentleman from Ohio is concerned about. He should be  supporting the McAdams-Rose amendment if he wants to do that.   I urge all my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Veasey) having assumed the chair, Mr. Rouda, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4863) to  promote the competitiveness of the United States, to reform and  reauthorize the United States Export Finance Agency, and for other  purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
