 Madam President, I am very grateful to be joined by  the senior Senator from Louisiana on the floor today. I think this is  about 240 in my series of ``Time to Wake Up'' speeches, and this is the  first time we have a bipartisan presentation on the floor, which is  significant to me.   I had the great pleasure of visiting Louisiana last month to see  firsthand how a combination of decreased sedimentation, erosion,  subsidence, habitat degradation, and rising seas are threatening  Louisiana's coastline. I was joined by Congressman Garret Graves,  former Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority chairman,  and I thank the Congressman for sharing his time and expertise of  Louisiana's coastal issues. I have also enjoyed working with  Louisiana's junior Senator on coastal resiliency efforts, and I look  forward to continuing that work.  [[Page S2507]]    Senator Cassidy and I share home States that are lively, diverse,  coastal, proud, and a little bit eccentric and that have great food.  There is a lot in common between Louisiana and Rhode Island. Like Rhode  Island, Louisiana's coast drives the State's economy and has shaped the  State's history and culture. Coastal Louisiana is home to around 2  million people and is responsible for over a quarter of the continental  United States' fisheries landings. According to the U.S. Geological  Survey, Louisiana's wetlands today represent about 40 percent of the  wetlands of the continental United States and about 80 percent of the  losses.   Coastal wetlands are critical habitat and nurseries for commercially  important fisheries and other wildlife. They also improve coastal water  quality and buffer against storm surge, flooding, and other storm  effects. Across the United States, we have lost ground. About half of  our original wetlands in the past 200 years are gone. That is  significant, and the scale and speed of wetland loss in coastal  Louisiana is almost impossible to comprehend. From 1932 until 2010, the  State lost nearly 1,900 square miles, or 25 percent, of its coastal  land. All the red is land lost from 1932 to 2010. Between 1985 and  2010, the State was losing ground, about a football field's worth,  every hour. Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike caused the loss  of more than 300 square miles of wetlands.   I saw firsthand what Louisiana's shredded coastline looks like from  the air. The Mississippi River is one of the most heavily managed  rivers in the world and is certainly one of the most important rivers  in the world. A combination of flood prevention and irrigation  interventions upriver have cut off the tap of sediment that used to  flow naturally to Louisiana's wetlands. Now erosion outpaces natural  rebuilding.   Though erosion is a natural phenomenon, oil and gas development  exacerbates the problem. The dredged tracks left in the marsh by  exploration and pipelines accelerate erosion, and here you see photos  we took from our little airplane of some of those dredged channels.  Strong storms, ratcheting up in strength on warmer ocean waters, thanks  to climate change, also take a heavy toll on these vulnerable marshes,  and you can see how these have been just washed out by the sea down  here as well, again, looking out from our little aircraft.   Thank you, by the way, to SouthWings for sharing their aircraft with  us so we could fly and see this.   On top of sediment loss, the Louisiana coastline is also sinking at  around one-third of an inch each year due to the natural movement of  the Earth's surface, and oil and gas development probably accelerates  that process.   Then, there is sea level rise. Louisiana's Coastal Planning and  Restoration Authority estimates as much as 2.7 feet of sea level rise  by 2050. Tulane University researchers concluded that current sea level  rise estimates for Louisiana are actually probably too conservative, as  the tide gauges used to track sea level rise don't accurately account  for the fact that coastal marshes are sinking at the same time. So  these current sea level rise projections don't fully express what the  relative sea level rise is expected to be.   Following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Louisiana undertook the  daunting task of assembling a Coastal Master Plan. This 50-year, $50  billion plan identifies 124 projects aimed at maintaining 800 square  miles of land over time. Experts there hope to reduce over $150 billion  in damage by 2067 through a combination of hard infrastructure,  restoring shoreline and barrier islands, diverting sediment, and  protecting structures by doing things like flood-proofing and elevating  them.   The Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, which led the  development of this master plan, looked at three potential scenarios  for the next 50 years. It considered changes in precipitation, sea  level rise, subsidence, and storm frequency and intensity.   We will look at the medium scenario. Under the medium scenario, the  Coastal Authority expects more precipitation, over 2 feet of sea level  rise, stronger though less frequent storms, and a continued slowing of  subsidence. The agency then modeled what the coastline would look like  50 years out under these medium conditions with and without this $50  billion investment. Without the $50 billion investment, all that is red  is lost to the sea. With the investment, there is still a lot of red  lost, but these green areas show areas that are saved, and if you live  in one of these green areas, hunt in one of these green areas, and have  a business in one of these green areas, it is pretty darn important to  you to see that they are saved.   Louisiana is at a point of no return, where the forward march of sea  level rise and stronger storms will continue to erode the State's  shore. Although Louisianians are faced with this discouraging future, I  was very impressed by the optimism of the Louisianians I met. I spoke  with Governor John Bel Edwards, with CPRA Chairman Chip Kline, CPRA  Director Bren Haase, and Deputy for Coastal Activities Megan Terrell  and had dinner together with many of them and Senator Cassidy to  discuss implementation of this Coastal Master Plan.   The Governor, who has said that ``climate change is real; I do not  deny it,'' is committed to implementing the Coastal Master Plan. The  price tag is hefty, but the potential losses to Louisiana are much  greater. I also went to Baton Rouge and met with Mayor-President Sharon  Weston Broome. While I was there in Baton Rouge, the Mississippi was  steadily climbing the levees that protect the city. These are the  handrails for the steps down to the Mississippi River, and, as you can  see, it was high enough that it was not only over the steps but over  the handrails.   By March 21 of this year, the number of days at or above flood stage  in Baton Rouge was on track to set new records. The mayor pointed out  that getting the help communities need to prepare for severe but  unnamed storms can be difficult, which is why I so appreciate working  with Senator Cassidy on ways to improve our response to coastal  resilience, both of ours being Coastal States.   Following the release of the fifth National Climate Assessment back  in November, Mayor-President Broome said:         After the 1,000-year rain event of 2016 in my city, I have       been paying close attention to credible projections for       future events. . . . the combined impacts of sea level rise       and storm surge in the southeast have the potential to cost       up to $60 billion each year in 2050 and up to $99 billion in       2090; that level of impact cannot be dismissed or put off for       the next generation to deal with.    Baton Rouge is home to Louisiana State University, the LSU Tigers,  and the impressive Center for River Studies. This is the main room at  the Center for River Studies. This is an enormous physical model of the  Mississippi River through which actual water runs and through which  they can put small, sort of simulated sediment to model sediment flow,  and these projectors on the roof can project down onto the surface to  show various models and to provide all this color. So that is actually  like a flat movie screen with projectors on the surface, which is  three-dimensional in the sense that they built a model of the  Mississippi River through it. It is an amazing educational tool, and it  lets researchers at LSU and at the Army Corps of Engineers and others  better understand the sediment dynamics in the Mississippi River.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a terrific  article by the legendary Louisiana Pulitzer prize-winning outdoor  columnist Bob Marshall.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                               [Apr. 7, 2019]      Our Coast Isn't Disappearing or Vanishing; It's Being Violently                                 Destroyed                             (By Bob Marshall)         Today's tip for Louisiana's coastal survival: Ban the terms       ``vanishing'' and ``disappearing'' from being used in       connection with the words ``Louisiana coast.''        You see, in the world of addiction recovery, practitioners       know words are important. Until the addict admits to having a       problem, they will never find a cure.        For example, the abuser who says, ``I just get a little       high now and then'' will never kick the habit until he says,       ``I am an addict.''        So it has occurred to me one of the reasons for the       inability of Louisiana residents and politicians to take some       necessary steps to save what's left of our coast is that       we've been taught to use gentle euphemisms for a major cause       of our demise: We say our wetlands and coast have been       ``vanishing'' or ``disappearing.''        Nothing could be further from the truth.  [[Page S2508]]         Those descriptions evoke a gentle passage, a slow, almost       comforting process of fading into history. And the term       ``lost coast'' is equally off target. It's like saying we       misplaced a treasured item, or it was taken by an act of God.        None of those gentle things caused 2,000 square miles of       marsh, swamp and uplands to become open water since the       1930s.        They were destroyed. By us.        And anyone who has spent time on the wet side of our       levees--or has driven across the wetlands on elevated       roadways--could see it wasn't a gentle act.        This was a brutal assault, a battery, a vicious mugging. We       used machines to dig up and toss aside marshes and cypress       tupelo swamps to turn more than 10,000 miles (at last count)       of our coastal zone into canals for barges to float drilling       rigs, to lay tens of thousands of miles of pipelines for oil       and gas, and to carve out shipping channels to make it easier       and faster for boats to assist in the destruction. This was       no gentle, whispering vanishing act; it was a noisy, diesel-      fumed mauling of a pristine ecosystem we claim to love.        It was as violent and ugly to our homeland as the way       companies eviscerated Western desert landscapes to strip mine       for copper, or the way others dynamited entire Appalachian       mountaintops--throwing their waste into adjacent streams--to       make it easiest to harvest coal profits.        No one in Nevada or West Virginia says those deserts and       mountains ``disappeared'' or ``vanished.'' They admit they       were willfully destroyed.        Our ongoing embrace of these misleading euphemisms for what       we did hides an even uglier aspect of this disaster: our       silence. In many ways, this has been the Kitty Genovese of       environmental crimes--because most of us stood by and did       nothing even as the crime was being committed in front of us,       then just walked silently away. We chose not to get involved       because we were told it could cost us money.        Yes, levees on the rivers presaged the crimes, but those       were unavoidable if we intended to live here. And 36 to 60       percent of what was destroyed--the portion researchers tie to       oil and gas work--might still be here today if we had chosen       another way.        Maybe we didn't truly understand the systemic damage we       were doing until the 1960s. But even then--even when the       crime reports came out and the perpetrators were identified--      we chose to look the other way.        Worse, we have taught the rest of the nation to join us in       that deception. Google ``Louisiana coast and disappearing,''       and you'll get 3.1 million hits. We have been so successful       in this dissembling that our denial is now repeated regularly       by journalists. The latest example is an in-depth New Yorker       piece entitled ``Louisiana's Disappearing Coast''--which gave       one sentence to the impact of those 10,000 miles of canals.        Indeed, our penchant for avoiding responsibility for our       self-destruction extends to other another crime against our       landscape and our children's futures. Many of our politicians       and residents now are ignoring or denying the mugging of the       atmosphere by the emissions many of us help produce,       emissions that are pushing the sea level rise acceleration       that will send us to even earlier watery grave.        The only way to kick this deadly habit is to finally admit       we have a problem.        So, let's take the first step. Let's look in the mirror and       say to the people we see staring back that our coast isn't       disappearing or vanishing. It has been, and continues to be,       willfully destroyed by our inaction--and we have no future       here unless we kick that habit.     Madam President, after Baton Rouge, I went to the  legendary city of New Orleans where I met with Mayor LaToya Cantrell.  Around half of that city lives below sea level. Strong partnerships  between the public and private sectors help make the city a national  leader in resiliency planning.   In 2017, the city's ``Climate Action for a Resilient New Orleans''  plan pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030. In  March, New Orleans sued 11 oil, gas, and pipeline companies for damage  to the wetlands that protect the city from storm surge and flooding.   Mayor Cantrell spoke to me about ``learning to live with water'' in  the post-Katrina city. I visited community leaders in the recovering  Lower Ninth Ward who are turning wetlands restoration projects in the  area into education, community engagement, tourism, and other  opportunities to rebuild a healthy connection between the city and the  water that surrounds it.   I also met with a number of community leaders to discuss how  businesses, nonprofits, researchers, and government agencies work  together to save Louisiana's working coastline. I heard from a business  owner about a property he was having difficulty insuring due to  anticipated flood risks.   I learned about the changes fishermen see in the gulf and how some of  them have switched to nontraditional fisheries or changed careers  completely. Hunters and recreational fishermen also notice worrying  changes in their sportsmen's paradise.   Though the evidence of climate change is everywhere in Louisiana and  is reshaping the lives of Louisianans, the phrase ``climate change''  still brings apprehension in some circles.   Let me go back. This is us in the Ninth Ward, and here we are with  some of the boats down at the fishing pier off of the Mississippi. I  will describe a little bit more. This is the inlet that flows to Davis  Pond, and it has brought water and sediment to the Davis Pond area.   You can't see this very clearly, but these are white pelicans. I had  never seen so many together in my life. It is rare for a Rhode Islander  to see a white pelican. Here they pile in thick because the fish get  drawn in coming off the river, and it makes a wonderful chow line. So  there is a big population of white pelicans that have learned to show  up this time of year and enjoy the chow line at this particular entry  point.   I do want to say that although there is some hesitancy in talking  about climate change in some quarters, some people are not hesitant,  and I refer to the legendary Bob Marshall, who has described this as  the ``mugging of the atmosphere'' by our emissions.   Having spoken with resiliency experts and seen Louisiana by both sky  and in that terrific LSU model, I then took to the water to visit this  restoration work in action. This is Davis Pond here, and it was  conceived as a freshwater diversion to push back saltwater intrusion  into the marshes with counterpressure from added saltwater, but it  turned out that it grew marshland, and it is now teaming with coastal  wildlife and dozens of different bird species.   Here we are. We traveled in an airboat to get down there. I also  visited hunter and fisherman Ryan Lambert at his lodge in Buras. He  showed me some of his personal efforts to restore the delta and its  wetlands. I am out here on his boat driving around the area that he has  been working, pointing out how quickly, if you give nature a chance,  she can rebound. A scientist with the National Wildlife Federation  counted over 30 species of birds just while we were waiting to board  the boat, and he spotted over 40 species while we were out on the  water.   The sights and sounds of a healthy marsh were encouraging and a  reminder of nature's God-blessed ability to find a way to not only  survive but flourish, given the chance.   Louisiana faces challenges ahead, but Louisianans are united in a  David versus Goliath-scale battle to protect their State. To achieve  that goal, I believe Louisiana must urge its fossil fuel tenants to  accept responsibility for the climate crisis and commit to being part  of the solution. Louisiana can be the crucible of compromise between  the environment and the industry.   So thank you to all the wonderful advocates, researchers and  community and State leaders I met in my visit to Louisiana. Thank you  to Senator Cassidy for his hospitality to me while I was down there.  The dedication of the Louisianans I met to their coast is admirable and  inspiring, and Louisiana's coastal plan is a model for other coastal  States.   I would also like to thank the senior Senator from Louisiana for  welcoming me the way he did and for joining me here today. This is a  big moment for me to have this be the first bipartisan ``Time to Wake  Up.'' We share a commitment to giving our coast the respect, attention,  and support they are due. I look forward to working together with  Senator Cassidy to find opportunities for our government to play its  role in supporting our coastal resiliency and restoration.   Thank you, my friend.   I yield the floor.
