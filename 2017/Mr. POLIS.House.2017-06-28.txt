 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Al Green of Texas, for  bringing forward a resolution simply acknowledging the importance of  this month to the millions of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender  Americans across the country.   Al Green's resolution stands in stark contrast to the silence of the  Trump administration. For the first time in nearly a decade, there was  no White House proclamation to celebrate Pride. And, you know what, Mr.  Speaker, we are all proud of being Americans, and we all are proud of  our heritage, and we are proud of who we are. Just as people are proud  of their Irish-American heritage, or their Catholic heritage, or they  are proud to be women or proud to be men, people who are LGBT in our  country no longer need to stay in the closet.   They can be fully authentic with who they are, and they can celebrate  in a spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood with their allies, and other  LGBT Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I got to participate in the Pride festivities in Denver  this year, and I am looking forward next week to, for the very first  time, being the grand marshal of a parade, the Colorado Springs Pride  Parade. I have never had the opportunity to be a grand marshal before.   But I am glad that Al Green and his cosponsors, including myself, are  lending their voice, to say that this body, the House of  Representatives, wants to, of course, honor and respect the full  diversity of our country, and in the inclusive spirit, celebrate the  civil rights accomplishments of the LGBT movement as well as recognize  the work ahead to make sure that LGBT Americans are fully equal under  the law.
