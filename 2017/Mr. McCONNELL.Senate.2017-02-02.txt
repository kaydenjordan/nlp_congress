 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, I was surprised by a statement my  friend the Democratic leader made right here yesterday. I am glad he  came back to the floor to correct himself, though. I think we all  appreciated the Democratic leader making clear that Republicans did  not--let me repeat, did not--insist on 60-vote thresholds for either of  President Obama's two first-term Supreme Court nominees. Did not. We  thank the Democratic leader for clearing that up. His statement also  reminds us that both of the Supreme Court Justices President Clinton  nominated got straight up-or-down votes as well. There is no reason  someone like Judge Gorsuch, who has received widespread acclaim from  both sides of the aisle, should be treated differently now.   When he was nominated to his current seat on the court of appeals,  Judge Gorsuch received the American Bar Association's highest possible  rating--unanimously ``well qualified.'' At his confirmation hearing, no  one had a single negative word to say about him--not a single negative  word. At his confirmation vote, no one cast a negative vote against  him--not then-Senator Obama, not then-Senators Clinton, Biden, or  Kennedy, and not my good friend Senator Schumer, either. Judge Gorsuch  was confirmed in exceptionally fast time for a court of appeals  nominee--just 2 months. So you have to wonder, if this nominee was so  noncontroversial in 2006 that a rollcall vote was not even required,  what could possibly have changed since to justify threats of  extraordinary treatment now? What has happened in the last 10 years? If  the Democratic leader or anyone else in his conference did not raise a  concern in committee or cast a single negative vote then, let alone  even ask for a rollcall vote, what could possibly justify these so- called grave concerns--grave concerns--he claims to have now?   Professor Laurence Tribe, President Obama's law school mentor, called  Judge Gorsuch a ``brilliant, terrific guy who would do the Court's work  with distinction.'' This is Laurence Tribe, the President's  constitutional law professor, one of the best-known liberal professors  in the country.   Neal Katyal, President Obama's top Supreme Court lawyer, lauded Judge  [[Page S610]]  Gorsuch as ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have  served our nation over the last century.'' Over the last century. That  is President Obama's Supreme Court lawyer.   The left-leaning Denver Post recently highlighted Judge Gorsuch's  reputation as a ``brilliant legal mind'' who applies the law ``fairly  and consistently.''   I am happy to report that we have even been assured by liberal talk  show host Rachel Maddow that Gorsuch is ``a relatively mainstream  choice.'' Rachel Maddow.   Turns out, in the years since Judge Gorsuch's unopposed Senate  confirmation, he has shown himself to be the very kind of judge  everyone hoped he would be, one who demonstrates a ``sense of fairness  and impartiality'' that Democratic then-Senator Salazar lauded him for  in 2006, which Salazar called a ``keystone for being a judge.'' That  was the Democratic Senator from Colorado when he was confirmed in 2006.   That was Judge Neil Gorsuch's reputation back then, and it is his  richly deserved reputation still, as those in both parties who have  known and worked with him continue to tell us. As one Democrat and  Denver attorney put it, Judge Gorsuch is ``smart [and] he's  independent.'' The things we have heard from so many about Judge  Gorsuch--smart and independent, fair and impartial, thoughtful and  brilliant--are just the qualities we should expect in our next Supreme  Court Justice. They are the same qualities I am confident Judge Gorsuch  will bring to the Court.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this Republican-led Congress is  committed to fulfilling our promises to the American people. That work  continues now as we consider legislation to push back against the  harmful regulations from the Obama administration. On its way out the  door, the Obama administration forced nearly 40--40--major and very  costly regulations on the American people. Fortunately, we now have the  opportunity to work with a new President to begin bringing relief from  those burdensome regulations.   Last night, the House sent us two resolutions under the Congressional  Review Act--one of the best tools at our disposal to undo these  heavyhanded regulations.   This afternoon, the Senate will have the opportunity to pass the  first of these resolutions, a measure to overturn the stream buffer  rule. The resolution before us now is identical to the one I introduced  earlier this week, and it aims to put a stop to the former  administration's blatant attack on coal miners. In my home State of  Kentucky and others across the Nation, the stream buffer rule will  cause major damage to communities and threaten coal jobs. One study  actually estimated that this regulation would put as many as one-third  of coal-related jobs at risk. That is why the Kentucky Coal Association  called it ``a regulation in search of a problem.'' They joined with the  United Mine Workers of American and the attorneys general of 14 States  on both sides of the aisle urging Congress to act. We should heed their  call now and begin bringing relief to coal country. Today's vote on  this resolution represents a good step in that direction.   Once our work is complete on this legislation, we will turn to  another House-passed resolution that will protect American companies  from being at a disadvantage when doing business overseas. Although the  Securities and Exchange Commission may have had good intentions, the  resource extraction rule costs American public companies up to nearly  $600 million annually and gives foreign-owned businesses in Russia and  China an advantage over American workers. We all want to increase  transparency, but we should not raise costs on American businesses,  only to benefit their international competition. Let's send the SEC  back to the drawing board to promote transparency without the high  costs or negative impacts on American businesses.   These CRA resolutions keep the interests of American families and  workers in mind. Today, we will continue to chip away at the regulation  legacy of the Obama years, with more CRA resolutions in the coming days  as well.   Let's pass these two resolutions without delay so we can send them to  the President's desk and continue giving the power back to the people.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider Calendar No. 14, Jeff Sessions to be  Attorney General.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 13, Thomas Price to be Secretary of Health and  Human Services.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 12, Steven Mnuchin to be Secretary of the  Treasury.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 41.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I wish to lay out the schedule for  everyone. I know they are interested in knowing the way forward. I have  discussed with the Democratic leader where we go from here.   The Senate is going to debate the pending joint resolution tonight  for as long as there is interest in debate. Tomorrow the Senate will  convene at 6:30 a.m. and immediately proceed to two rollcall votes:  passage of the joint resolution of disapproval and cloture on the  nomination of Betsy DeVos.   Restating that, debate tonight as long as our friends on the other  side would like to debate, and tomorrow we will convene at 6:30 a.m.  and immediately turn to two rollcall votes: passage of the joint  resolution of disapproval and cloture on the nomination of Betsy DeVos.    Yes.
