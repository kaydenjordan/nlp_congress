 Mr. Speaker, last weekend more than 20,000  illegal immigrants crossed the U.S. southern border. President Biden's  only solution to historically massive border numbers is to warn  migrants not to come and to claim our border is secure.   Meanwhile, the cities that migrants end up in are forced to figure  out where to house them and how to care for them, and the American  taxpayer is footing that bill.   So far this year, over $200 million of Chicago's $500 million budget  deficit has gone to migrant care costs.   New York City Mayor Eric Adams, recently warned citizens that the  cost of migrant care could mean cuts to city services due to a  financial tsunami.   The Governor of Massachusetts has declared a state of emergency due  to the onslaught.   Leaders in sanctuary cities might have asked for this crisis by  offering themselves up, but the American people did not. The United  States is nearly $33 trillion in debt. Bidenomics has caused a 17  percent inflation on the American people, and 70 percent of them are  now saying they are feeling financially stressed, but Biden still seems  to think that taxpayers have millions to spend.   Let me say this to the administration: You can either close our  border or we will close the government.  [[Page H4392]]                                ____________________
