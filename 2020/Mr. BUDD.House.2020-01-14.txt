 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the increasing anti- Semitic violence that has spread in recent months, including the recent  stabbing that happened last month in New York.   Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitic and anti-Israel attitudes often emerge  because  [[Page H215]]  of a lack of understanding of the painful history directed at the  Jewish people and the horrors of the Holocaust.   For this reason, I introduced H. Res. 782 alongside Representatives  Zeldin and Kustoff that encourages public schools to design and teach a  curriculum about the history of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust and it  calls on Federal law enforcement to hold the perpetrators of these  attacks accountable.   Our Jewish community is feeling rattled, frightened, and unsafe. We  cannot allow these feelings to fester. So in support of this community,  I am proud to lead a resolution that will help increase understanding  and rid our country of all anti-Semitic hatred.                            ____________________
