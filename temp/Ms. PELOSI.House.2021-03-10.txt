 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his extraordinary leadership in putting nearly a trillion  dollars into the pockets of the American people. I thank him and Mr.  Yarmuth, the chair of the Budget Committee, for their leadership on  this legislation and, of course, on this debate this afternoon. It was  dazzling to see them and the Democratic chairs and Members speak up  about this important legislation.   I thank the chairman for pointing out the inconsistency on the part  of our colleagues across the aisle in complaining about money helping  the poorest of poor children in our country while they didn't hesitate  to give large amounts of money to the richest people in America in  their Republican tax scam. The chairman's charts were very eloquent.   Mr. Speaker, to hear our Members speak about the terms of this bill,  the values that are in it, the plan that it has, why they were voting  ``yes'' on the bill, and to hear Republicans talk about why they would  vote ``no,'' it is typical that they vote ``no'' and take the dough.   This bill has bipartisan support across the country, not only among  the general public, but in mayors, selectmen, city councilpersons, and  county executives--who are Republican--eagerly awaiting the passage of  this bill because they know at their level what a difference it will  make in the lives of their constituents, the American people.   Mr. Speaker, this is a critical moment in our country's history.  Tomorrow, the world will mark 1 year since COVID-19 was officially  declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. At that  time, just over 1,000 Americans had contracted the disease, and 38 had  died.   Since that day 1 year ago from tomorrow, nearly 30 million Americans  have become infected. Over half a million Americans have died, more  lives than were lost in combat in all of America's wars against foreign  enemies combined.   Each of those lives is precious to us. We feel each loss profoundly  and pray for their families and for the families of those who have  contracted the virus and are still affected by it. And through it all,  a historic economic crisis has raged.   A full year later, 18 million Americans are still out of work,  according to the statistics at the end of last week, and nearly 10  million jobs may have been lost. We hope to stop that.   The most vulnerable among us have been disproportionately affected:  moms  [[Page H1280]]  pushed out of the labor market, women and minority-owned businesses  forced to shudder, communities of color facing rising disparities.   Mr. Speaker, today, we have a real opportunity for change. As we  serve in Congress with each other, we learn about each other's  districts, each other's priorities, and the rest. And we learn about  each other's why. Why did you come to Congress? Why are you here?   Each of us has come to Congress with a purpose. My purpose, my why,  are the children. As a mother of five raising my kids, seeing all the  attention and all that they needed, I was horrified by the fact that  one in five children in America lives in poverty and goes to sleep  hungry in America at night.   That is my why. That is why I went from homemaker to the House of  Representatives.                                time  1315    That is why when people ask me, ``What do you think the three most  important issues are facing the Congress?'' I always say the same  thing: Our children, our children, our children--their health; their  education; the economic security of their families; a safe, healthy  environment in which they can thrive; and a nation at peace in which  they can reach their fulfillment.   Several of those priorities are addressed in this legislation.   Again, this legislation, which has bipartisan support throughout the  country, the Biden--and let me sing praises on President Biden for the  values, for the vision, the strategic thinking, for the knowledge that  he has brought to what, as you said earlier, we had in the works for a  while, but we freshened up by current events, the vaccine, and what  those possibilities are.   The Biden American Rescue Plan is about the children, their health,  their education, the economic security of their families, again. Our  children's health is greatly protected by crushing the virus and by  expanding access to healthcare through the Affordable Care Act  expansions in here, Medicaid through FMAP, and in other ways as well.   Our children's education is advanced with a $170 billion to open  schools safely, including $130 billion for K-12. This funding will help  address the social and emotional challenges that children face, as well  as learning loss, as well as opening the schools safely. We know what  that requires. It requires ventilation, space, more teachers, more  space, to name a few things.   In terms of the economic security of children's families, this  legislation, as I said earlier to Mr. Neal, puts nearly $1 trillion in  the pockets of the American people. Republicans did not seem to object  when they put that much money in the pockets of 83 percent of their tax  scam into the top 1 percent, but they seem to have a discomfort level  when it reaches the poorest of the poor and those in the middle class  who are struggling. So this legislation does that.   It includes the refundable tax credit, which will lift 50 percent of  children out of poverty.   How do you say ``no'' to lifting 50 percent of impoverished children  in America out of poverty?   Children also benefit from the earned income tax credit, direct  payments, and enhanced unemployment insurance benefits for their  families. And the economic security of children is also enhanced by  pension security of their grandparents, which is historically secured  in this bill.   Sometimes I have young people come to my office--it is all about the  children, it is all about the future--high school students, college  students--and they talk about the security of their grandparents as  important because, to the extent that their parents can focus on them  rather than worry about the financial security of their grandparents,  it is very important to the family across the board.   For the children, the American Rescue Plan also includes $12 billion  in nutrition assistance to help the estimated 11 million children still  going hungry.   When I talk about this with my family, I say to my kids: You know,  the millions of children who are food insecure in our country, that is  horrible.   They will say: Mom, just say it another way. They are hungry. They  are hungry. Some of them get their food at school. They go to sleep  hungry. If you call that food insecurity, okay, but understand this,  these little children are hungry.   Again, $12 billion in nutrition assistance.   $43 billion in rental, homeowner, and other housing assistance so  that children of families who are on the verge of eviction can have the  comfort of knowing that that won't happen. They will have the comfort  of home.   $45 billion of childcare to keep children learning and parents  earning. That is always necessary, but even more so with the 2.3  million women losing their jobs, many of them moms.   Now, everything that I mentioned here is related to the coronavirus.  We have hunger issues in our country bigger than even this. We have  housing issues. We have childcare issues, and the rest. It is very  important in our country. But this is coronavirus-centered.   Childcare, and I will say it again, $45 billion. Most of it is for  childcare and a little bit of it is for Head Start. Children learning,  parents earning. This is important and central to how families get  through this coronavirus crisis.   All of these provisions in the bill are enhanced by strengthening the  support for our heroes at the State and local level. Hence, our bill  was called the Heroes Act. Much of that is contained in this  legislation. Heroes, because our workers at the State, county, and  local level, our healthcare workers, our first responders, police and  fire, our sanitation, transportation, our food workers, our teachers-- our teachers, our teachers--make our lives possible, and make the  existence of our children better.   Whatever we spend on education in this bill is a small percentage of  what State and local government spend on education. More than 90  percent of it comes from the State and local. So in this legislation we  are ensuring that State and local government keep them in their jobs as  heroes, as we talked about, and will help fight the fiscal pressure  that they have because of the cost of addressing the coronavirus  crisis, as well as revenue lost because of shutdowns and the rest.   I was raised in a mayor's household as a daughter and sister of the  mayor of Baltimore. The recognition of the role that local government  plays is very important to me, local and State. But the local  government is the first line of defense, and we are determined to fight  any attempts to weaken what was in this legislation for local  government.   One of the values respected in this legislation is our commitment to  communities of color, including Native Americans, especially, who  continue to face serious health and economic disparities. This  legislation will, among other steps, address 8 in 10 minority- owned businesses on the brink of closure--8 in 10 minority-owned  businesses.    The American Rescue Plan, Mr. Speaker, is a force for fairness and  justice in America. This legislation is one of the most transformative  and historic bills any of us will ever have the opportunity to support.  It is one of the most transformative that I have seen in my over 30  years in the Congress. It is as consequential as the Affordable Care  Act, which expanded healthcare to more than 20 million people and made  benefits much better for over 150 million families.   Today, we have a decision to make of tremendous consequence, a  decision that will make a difference for millions of Americans, saving  lives and livelihoods. And as with all decisions, it is a decision that  we will have to answer for. We will give the American Rescue Plan a  resounding and, hopefully, bipartisan vote to reflect the bipartisan  support that it has in the country. And we will get to work immediately  to deliver lifesaving resources springing from this bill as soon as it  is passed and signed, as we join President Biden in his promise that  help is on the way. For the people, for the children, I urge a ``yes''  vote.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his great leadership of the Judiciary Committee. Thank you for bringing  this important legislation to the floor, Mr. Nadler.   And, again, as an authority on the Constitution, you and I know that  we do respect the right of the gentleman to have a gun. We just want to  make sure that we are keeping people safe.   Mr. Speaker, the gun violence crisis in America is a challenge to the  conscience of our country, one that demands that we act. We know what  must be done. The solutions are clear. They have overwhelming  bipartisan support across the country. These solutions will save lives.   That is why I am so pleased to rise on the floor to support Mr.  Clyburn's legislation, H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act to  ensure that universal background checks do save lives. He explained so  clearly the purpose of his legislation. I associate myself with his  remarks. I know how painful it is because he had friends in that church  whom we have met families of since then.   I also rise to support H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act  of Mr.   Mike Thompson. Mr. Thompson is a gun owner. He is a veteran.  He respects the Second Amendment, and he is the chair of the Gun  Violence Prevention Task Force. I thank him for his decades of  leadership on background checks and for the perspective he brings,  again, as a gun owner and a veteran and a hunter.   We all salute the extraordinary work of Mr. Clyburn, the leader of  the Enhanced Background Checks Act, to close the Charleston loophole,  and we respect him for the work he has done in his community to turn  their agony into action, their pain into saving other people's lives.   I thank all the Members who have helped raise a drumbeat on these  priorities, including our colleague, Representative Lucy McBath, who  has been such an inspiration to all of us, bringing her great  generosity of spirit in telling her story, sharing that story of Jordan  with us.   Now, we also have a debt of gratitude to our former colleague, Gabby  Giffords, who when she was having a neighborhood meeting, there was an  attempt on her life. Her courage is an inspiration to the country. Her  leadership to end gun violence is something that is so remarkable.  Under her leadership and that of the Bradys, we were able to meet with  survivors over time to try to pass legislation to make gun laws clear  and better and really adjusting to the realities of technology.   Another colleague,   Bobby Rush, lost his son to gun violence as  well. So, again, we hear about the big events that take place, and they  are horrible, but every day people lose their lives.   In fact, let me just see what the statistics are. Since 1994, when  background checks were first created, I had the privilege of being here  at that time and actually serving as a whip for the legislation. Our  leader on the bill was Senator Schumer. Well, right then he was a  Member of Congress, Chuck Schumer, on this legislation. Since 1994,  when background checks were first created, the system has stopped more  than 3 million dangerous people from getting firearms.   Every day, when background checks are used, they stop an estimated  170 felons, 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a  gun. Every day, Mr. Speaker.                                time  1615    Yet, over the years, people have exploited and circumvented the  system. Today, someone with a violent criminal record or a history of  abuse can go to a gun show or go online or even to a stranger in person  to purchase a firearm. No background check, no questions asked, all  perfectly legal. It might be legal, but it is not perfect.   Even when a background check has been initiated, it is not always  completed. That is what this legislation before us, Mr. Clyburn's bill,  is about; the horrific case that enabled a hate crime at Mother Emanuel  Church in Charleston in which nine innocent people were murdered while  peacefully worshipping.   Eighty percent of firearms--because of gun shows, online sales and  the rest--80 percent of firearms are sold or transferred without  completed background checks.   So it is in that spirit that I come to the floor, but when I come to  the floor, I bring with me the thoughts of the survivors who we meet  with regularly. We have said to them, We are not stopping until the job  is done.   We respect our Constitution, but we also say that the Constitution  talks about well-regulated.   Again, these bills that we are talking about have bipartisan support  by a vast majority of the American people; over 90 percent of the  public, including more than 90 percent of gun-owning households. Most  of these folks who own guns have passed background checks, they support  background checks, and they are supported by dozens of leading law  enforcement, veterans, local government, public health, and other  groups.   For example, Mr. Speaker, the Major Cities Chiefs Association,  representing the Nation's largest metropolitan law enforcement agencies  writes: ``The lack of a background check for private sales and gun  shows completely contradicts the purpose for which NICS was  established--to keep guns out of the hands of those who do harm.''   For the benefit of those who don't know what NICS is, it is an  important program. Mr. Thompson has been a champion in the funding of  NICS. NICS is the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.   Next, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys states: ``H.R. 8 will  help the background check system catch up with changes in technology  and ensure that individuals who are prohibited from purchasing or  possessing a gun cannot easily buy guns online.''   And the U.S. Conference of Mayors writes that H.R. 8 will ``make our  cities safer and in no way compromise gun owners' rights.''   H.R. 8 is very important to us, and it is legislation that has broad  support. It is called the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. That is Mr.  Thompson's bill.   And this bill, H.R. 1446, Mr. Clyburn's bill is the Enhanced  Background Checks Act. So everything I say about one bill applies to  the other in terms of its purpose, in terms of its urgency, and in  terms of its honoring our promise to the survivors and the families who  have lost their loved ones to gun violence, that we are not going away  until this legislation passes and that we will meet the challenge of  the conscience of the country when it comes to the gun violence crisis  in our country.   And I say that with gratitude to Representative   Mike Thompson and  our distinguished whip Mr. Clyburn for their leadership, their  determination, their persistence, and soon, hopefully, their success in  turning their legislation into law, so that we can keep our promises to  the survivors, and also, that we can make the world safer for all  children and all people in our country and throughout the world, as we  are an example to the world.   I urge an ``aye'' vote on both of these bills.
