 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Chairman, today, I stand for the American people and the voters  of South Carolina's Sixth Congressional District who spoke loud and  clear last November, demanding that Congress defend and uphold the  right to have access to affordable care.   This is an effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, and we stand  ready to defend every aspect of this legislation.   We will not stop our efforts to hold this administration and my  Republican colleagues accountable as they continue misrepresenting and  undermining the Affordable Care Act.   The work of this body, a coequal branch of our government, to conduct  legitimate and lawful oversight in order to protect Americans' access  to healthcare will not be deterred.   Today, this House will vote on a package of seven bills that will  halt the administration's sabotage of the Affordable Care Act, improve  the act's implementation, and lower the cost of prescription drugs.   This legislative package, titled the Strengthening Health Care and  Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act, prevents the substitution of junk  policies that take advantage of unsuspecting citizens, and it protects  against discrimination for preexisting conditions.    Mr. Chairman, this legislation takes meaningful steps to  control prescription drug costs by expanding access to generic drugs so  patients don't have to choose between  [[Page H3856]]  lifesaving medications and other necessities, like rent or food.   Mr. Chairman, Democrats are addressing crucial healthcare needs. We  stand to protect the healthcare of American citizens.
