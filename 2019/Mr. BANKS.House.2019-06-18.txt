 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the most recent  pattern of malicious behavior coming from Iran.   Recently, Speaker Pelosi said that President Trump: ``. . . inflames  the U.S.-Iran issue.'' Respectfully, I couldn't disagree more. The  Iranians are the ones inflaming the relationship by attacking  commercial vessels, designating U.S. troops in the Middle East as  terrorists, challenging the freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf,  and intending to surpass uranium stockpile limits in just days.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot turn a blind eye to the hostile actions of  Iran. The President is right to end the failed Obama-era strategy of  appeasement toward Iran, and to call for our allies to stand up to this  regime's threatening behavior.   I stand with the President and urge my colleagues to do the same, to  protect Americans' security and economic interest in the region.                            ____________________     I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chairwoman, in total, the Energy and Water  Development division cost the American taxpayers $46.4 billion.   That is a 4 percent increase above the fiscal year 2019-enacted  level. Specifically, the division includes $23.3 billion for nondefense  activities, which is an increase of $1.1 billion above the fiscal year  2019-enacted level.   My amendment would apply a 14 percent reduction across the board to  the nondefense activities included in this division. Without it, we are  on track toward sequestration, which would have devastating effects on  our national security.   This amendment is necessary because we are at a $22 trillion national  debt. That is trillion, with a T. Even before my friends across the  aisle offered this reckless spending package, the Congressional Budget  Office estimated that we were on track to spend $1 trillion on interest  payments in 2029. That means one-fifth of the entire budget would go to  paying off previous years of irresponsible spending.   Madam Chairwoman, we simply cannot continue down this path. We must  balance our books before writing new checks for this fiscal year.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I was proud this year to lead the  Republican Study Committee's effort in creating and drafting our own  budget as part of the Budget and Spending Task Force.   I gathered together with several of my colleagues, coming from  different States and different views, and we worked tirelessly for  months to produce a budget that would cut wasteful government spending  by $12.6 trillion over a 6-year time period.   This is not just the only budget offered in this body that balances.  It is the only budget that has been offered at all. The fact that my  friends on the other side of the aisle refuse to even offer a budget  shows a stunning lack of leadership.   This is my third amendment to cut across the board 14 percent in each  of the divisions of these minibuses.                                time  2115    My amendment reflects the values of the RSC budget and is a necessary  first step toward eventually achieving a balanced budget.   Madam Chair, I will continue to come back to this floor and offer  this amendment time and time again because I refuse to condemn my  daughters to a less prosperous America than the one that every Member  of this Chamber has been blessed to know.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
