 Madam Speaker, this is Damon Clayton, the son of my dear  friend, Dearborn Heights City Councilwoman Lisa Hicks-Clayton. Today, I  rise in honor of his precious life.   Thirteenth District Strong lost Damon to suicide last week at the  young age of 28.   One friend wrote: ``This man was a friend and a brother to me. We may  not have shared DNA, but we shared a common desire to protect.'' He was  a U.S. Army paratrooper in Afghanistan and a firefighter/EMT for the  city of Ecorse. ``When we lost Damon, we lost a very special blessing  from God. This special soul spent his life protecting us.''   He said: ``I finish my EMT school in 3 weeks. I would like to finish  in honor of him. Damon was a factor in my choice to pursue public  safety. I want him to always be remembered.''   For me, Damon was dearly loved by so many people, including his  parents and his siblings.   Death by suicide among veterans represents a public health crisis in  our country. In 2005, over 5,700 veterans died by suicide, a number  that rose to over 6,100 in 2017.   In Damon's memory, I promise to do everything in my power to get our  veterans the healthcare and help that they deserve.                            ____________________
