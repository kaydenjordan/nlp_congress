 Mr. President, in a few minutes, I am going to ask  unanimous consent for the passage of the bill. In the interim, I would  like to yield some time to my good friend Senator Wicker.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Mississippi.   There are going to be some who say this is unprecedented by the  Congress. In fact, under the Railway Labor Act, Congress is allowed to  intervene. In fact, Congress has intervened 18 times in the past,  imposing PEB recommendations in whole or in part 4 times.   If we don't do it, if we do not force this issue, at 12:01 tomorrow  night, the railroads will shut down, and the economic impact on the  American people is $2 billion a day--$2 billion.   The Senator from Mississippi and I have introduced a bill that will  adopt the Biden administration recommendations--recommendations that  include a 24-percent increase in pay, paid retroactively to 2020;  annual bonuses of $1,000; and additional paid leave. This is what has  been negotiated by the PEB board, but, as Senator Wicker said, there  are holdouts from a standpoint of some of the major unions even though  eight have agreed to it.   Now, as I said, Congress has taken this action 18 times to intervene  in 12 different rail disputes. It spans back to 1982, and the latest  was in 1991. So I dare say there are only a few that are in this body  who were here when that happened.   Now, Senator Sanders is on the floor, and I know he is going to  object. I know he is going to object because I read his tweet this  week. It said this:         Congress shouldn't stand in the way of railroad workers       going on strike. The rail companies have avoided bargaining,       abused their workers, and allied with the same forces who       killed the Biden agenda in 2021. Now they want Congress to       support their greed. Don't.    It sounds similar to the argument he was just making to Senator Scott  about student loans. It sounds very similar to every argument he uses.  It is that there is this thing in America where nobody is speaking up  for something.   Listen, this is the President's bipartisan emergency Board that he  set up that came back with a recommendation to the Biden administration  and said: Here is the solution to this. It should be adopted.   This is really weird that Senator Wicker and I were on the floor  introducing legislation that supports the President's position and  supports the position of the Presidential Emergency Board.   Now, here is the key thing. This is the takeaway. We don't have to be  here. Senator Schumer at any point can place this legislation on the  floor. Clearly, Senator Sanders would object then. But let me make a  promise. If Senator Schumer needs votes, I can deliver 48 Republican  votes to implement the PEB recommendation and the Biden-endorsed  position.   Let me say that again because I want to make sure Senator Schumer's  staff understands. This is about how you get to 60. I don't want to  give a 101 of the U.S. Senate, but 60 votes, as the President knows, is  required. I am offering him 48. He only needs to get 12 on his side to  have 60 votes, take this up, pass it, to have this over with. And there  is no interruption.   Not only is it $2 billion a day in economic impact; this is 160,000  trainloads of agricultural product at a time of harvest to cross this  country.  [[Page S4603]]    There are some who say: Well, this isn't going to affect me. They  haul coal. They haul gas. They haul petroleum. They haul gases like  helium that are required for manufacturing businesses. They haul auto  parts, which means you are going to see auto assembly plants that shut  down not because of China but because we let the railroad workers go on  strike and did not support the President's position.   This is not political. This is Republicans supporting the President's  position and only asking 12 Democrats to support this action.   I ask my colleagues: Drop this concern that you are representing one  side or the other. Ask yourself what is best for America.   We just got a report that inflation is 8.3--8.3; food up 7; housing  up 6; gasoline was down, and I think everybody expected inflation  numbers to go way down. So 8.3 percent--wages aren't keeping up with  that.   Every American family is losing money every month. And now you are  going to tell them you are going to be paying more because food is  going to be scarce. Commodities are going to be scarce. Some things  aren't going to be delivered.   If we thought that the port chaos that we saw last year was bad, we  are going to see a complete shutdown of rail, and we are just a matter  of months away from Christmas, when most retailers are counting on that  product to come in.   There are ports like Seattle and L.A., what are they going to do with  the containers? You talk about ships staying out at ocean. Amtrak  canceled their east-west rail coverage today going forward. Carriers  have already stopped hauling hazardous waste because they didn't want  to get halfway down a line and not be able to secure the hazardous  waste.   We are at a real tipping point on this. And this can all be solved by  either no objection to the unanimous consent request or by Senator  Schumer bringing this to the floor, knowing that he has 48 Republicans,  and he only needs to produce 12 to get to 60. This is a really easy  thing. It is an easy lift.   Well, my hope is that we will take one of the two paths. But do  understand that in less than 48 hours, at 12:01 Friday morning, the  likelihood is that without action by Congress, there will be a strike,  and rail traffic will stop. Period, end of sentence.   At this time, Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions be discharged from further consideration of S.J. Res. 61 and  the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; further, that the  joint resolution be considered read a third time and passed and that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, it is clearly apparent by listening to  this debate, if Senator Sanders had been on the PEB board, the PEB  board wouldn't be making a recommendation and the President wouldn't be  behind it. But that is where we are, short of a breakthrough in the  negotiations that are occurring and going on.   I grew up listening to Paul Harvey. Paul Harvey had a show, the rest  of the  [[Page S4605]]  news, the stuff you didn't hear. Let me do Paul Harvey on Senator  Sanders.   The railroad workers today get 3 weeks paid leave on average, plus 11  paid vacation days. PEB made a recommendation that they get 1  additional paid leave day. We will add that in. That is almost a month  of paid leave. Regardless of what you call it, there is a month there.   You now mentioned this wasn't as lucrative as Germany and UK. I was  home all of August. Nobody was asking: Geez, can you pass legislation  that makes us look more like the UK or Germany or the rest of Europe?  And I would be willing to bet that 27 paid leave days probably is more  than some of the European countries.    I will turn to you when I finish, how about that? I gave  you a gracious amount of time.   The PEB board determined this was a good solution. And Senator  Sanders says he is here looking out for the middle class because nobody  does that. Tell me this: How are you looking out for the middle class  when you are risking losing $2 billion a day in economic activity? Some  of those people that you are talking about standing up for, if this  rail strike continues, they are going to lose their job because of you.  They are going to lose their job because the President took a position  and you didn't support him.   I have been amazed with this administration. I find it pretty  difficult sitting up here taking the President's position because the  CDC today, 78 percent of the CDC workforce does not show up at the  office more than 2 days a month. We are in the middle of COVID. We have  a monkeypox national medical emergency, and 78 percent of CDC  employees--Centers for Disease Control--do not go to the office in  Atlanta. As a matter of fact, by, I think, the New York Times report,  even the Secretary doesn't go into the office. At a time where you  ought to have leadership, the leadership is gone.   Let's give the President a little bit of credit. He is showing some  leadership. He realizes this is not good for every American. It doesn't  matter whether you are rich or poor or in the middle. Having $2 billion  a day of negative economic impact is not good. It will ruin people's  lives, just like COVID, just like monkeypox has done to some Americans.   I am not sure how in good conscience you can roll the dice and say:  Boy, 24-percent increase in pay retroactive to 2020--not 2022, 2020-- $1,000 bonus, and 27 paid leave days per year, somehow we are cheating  them. It is beyond me.   But an objection has been heard, and now it means this is in Senator  Schumer's hands. He is the majority leader. He can bring this  legislation up on the floor. All he needs is 60 votes because I am  convinced, after hearing Senator Sanders, he is not going to have an  epiphany tonight and wake up tomorrow and say: I was wrong, I am for  this.   But here is the promise I will make to Senator Schumer. If he will  bring it to the floor, I will produce 48 Republican votes for it. That  means Democrats only need to produce 12 people to support it to keep  the American people from having a $2 billion-a-day economic impact  negatively impacting them. It will keep the flow of goods from the east  coast to the west coast, and Amtrak will open up again. Christmas that  comes in from overseas will hit L.A., Seattle, everywhere, and it will  make it to its retail location where my wife can buy it. You could  probably squeeze 12 Democratic votes just out of coastal communities  that have ports that are going to be the real loser in this.   Remember, not long ago we had a port problem. We had ships that were  sitting off L.A. that couldn't unload, and we felt the impact of it.  Well, if you thought that was bad, wait until there are no trains  because then they will be unloading no ships. They are all going to sit  off the shore. When they back up like that, that backs up further and  further when these goods are going to come in because once they unload  here, they are going to go back and get more.   It also means that what we export in this country, there are no  containers and no ships coming in to export those goods. If you are in  agricultural territory at harvest time, this is going to be devastating  to you. There are 160 million freight cars of agriculture transported  every year, and it happens in this period.    So I say to my colleagues, let's all hope that Senator Schumer will  bring this up, that he will take Republicans up on their position of  supporting the President and a solution to this problem, and that all  he needs to do is produce 12 folks, and at any point, we can pass this  legislation.   I yield the floor.
