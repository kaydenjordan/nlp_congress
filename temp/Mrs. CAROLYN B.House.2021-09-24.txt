 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, our  constitutional rights are under attack. We must pass the Women's Health  Protection Act to firmly establish a statutory right to abortion care  in every community across our country.   Our rights are no longer being chipped away. They are being bulldozed  into the ground. We must act now before it is too late.   Madam Speaker, I thank our chairman for his extraordinary leadership  on this issue, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.    MALONEY of New York,  Mses. CLARK of Massachusetts, HOULAHAN, Messrs. GOMEZ, TRONE, Ms.  KUSTER, Mr. DELGADO, Mses. JAYAPAL and SPANBERGER changed their vote  from ``yea'' to ``nay.''   Mrs. GREENE of Georgia and Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois changed their  vote from ``nay'' to ``yea.''   So the motion to recommit was rejected.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.       members recorded pursuant to house resolution 8, 117th congress       Babin (Nehls)      Boyle, Brendan F.
