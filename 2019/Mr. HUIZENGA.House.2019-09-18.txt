 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the village of  Spring Lake on its 150th birthday.   This past weekend, friends and residents of the small village in west  Michigan gathered together to celebrate and share memories of the  community's rich and storied history.   The village of Spring Lake first began as a lumber town in 1838 when  Captain Benjamin Hopkins and his family arrived from Canada. Soon  after, other settlers arrived and constructed additional sawmills,  leading to the village officially incorporating in 1869. As the village  developed, railroads, resorts, and telephone lines all helped the  village grow into a bustling community.   Today, the village is situated on the beautiful shores of both Spring  Lake and the Grand River right next to Lake Michigan, offering endless  recreational opportunities and a wide variety of shops and services.   While the village has changed much throughout the last 150 years, one  thing has remained constant, the close-knit and welcoming community  continues to make the village a special place to live and raise a  family.
