 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the importance and impact  of mentoring in our society.   I recently heard from a constituent, Karissa, who works with the Boys  & Girls Club in my district in Bryant, Arkansas.   One of her mentees was struggling, having trouble in school, finding  it difficult to build friendships with her fellow students. Karissa's  guidance and encouragement helped build confidence, which led to  participation in the school's JROTC program and improving her  camaraderie with her fellow cadets.   At-risk youth face many difficult challenges, and life is infinitely  more challenging without the support of caring adults.   With mentors, at-risk youth are less likely than their peers to skip  school or use drugs and are more likely to go to college, play sports,  and volunteer in our communities.   Whether it is through a mentoring organization like Scouting or the  Boys & Girls Clubs, a nonprofit, a religious institution, or school,  being a positive influence for our young people goes a long way in  strengthening our communities and serving the best interest of our  children.                            ____________________
