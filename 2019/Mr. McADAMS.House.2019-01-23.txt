 Mr. Speaker, working families in Utah are now facing  another lost pay period. Through no fault of their own, they are  suffering from the last Congress' failure to pass bills to fund  government operations and our inability now to get an agreement to end  the shutdown.   This weekend, I heard stories firsthand. Family members are facing  medical issues due to the stress of wondering when a spouse will be  paid. IRS workers worry about missing the training they need to be  ready for processing tax returns. Air traffic controllers are working  hard to keep airplanes in proper airspace over the Salt Lake Valley but  are going without normal staff backup and equipment maintenance.   One individual who has been in government service for 30 years as a  member of the military and as a civilian has applied for other jobs,  knowing that he is likely not going to get hired. Employers see too  much uncertainty.   Small businesses are hurting because their customers don't have money  to eat at local restaurants or shop in local stores. The shutdown is  harming the entire American economy and every American.   As one worker said to me: Our jobs have nothing to do with the  border.   They have had enough of political games. I support border security,  and I support Dreamers, but we need to end the shutdown so that they  can get back to work.                            ____________________
