 Madam Speaker, the America COMPETES Act is a historic  package. It makes strategic investments to strengthen supply chains,  protect our national security, and bolster our economic  competitiveness. It gives us the tools to fight for jobs here at home,  protect our critical supply chains, while addressing key trade  challenges that we face.   It recognizes the need to bring back American manufacturing and  fights for good-paying jobs that cannot be outsourced. It appropriates  billions for critically needed semiconductors and billions to address  broken supply chains; doubling down on our commitment for American-made  innovation to prevent future shortages and disruptions.   We need to be a nation once again that builds and not a nation that  just consumes. We need to create our own supply chains and not be  dependent on others.   It protects American workers from foreign countries with unfair  practices by including a robust renewal of the Trade Adjustment  Assistance program that supports American workers who have lost their  jobs because of trade practices by other countries.                                time  1315    Madam Speaker, it puts an end to China's export of goods to us valued  below $800 to avoid paying import duties and often to avoid screening  to determine whether those goods are made with forced labor.   It includes the National Critical Capabilities Defense Act that I  introduced last year. That establishes a screening process that  protects critical supply chains and our manufacturing capacity. It is a  process that reviews our overseas investments to make sure that we are  not giving up or offshoring critical capabilities, safeguarding our  workers, detecting supply chain vulnerabilities, and ensuring that they  stay here in America.   It includes provisions I have championed for years, language from my  bipartisan Civics Secures Democracy Act that will foster our next  generation of leaders.   The bill gives the FDA the mandatory recall authority it needs to  protect families from the risks posed by unsafe drugs.   It includes a bipartisan amendment that I have to end the factory  farming of mink that threatens public health as we continue fighting  against COVID-19.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to voting in favor of this bill. I urge  my colleagues to do the same. It is time that America takes that  leadership again, produces what it needs, and protects our workers, our  society, and all the industry that is attuned to that as well.
