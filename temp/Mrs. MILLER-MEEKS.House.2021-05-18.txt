 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a  young woman from my district for her appointment to fill an important  seat in the State of Iowa.   On April 16, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds appointed Abby Crow, a native  of  [[Page H2432]]  Tiffin, Iowa, and a sophomore human physiology major at the University  of Iowa, to fill the student seat on the State Board of Regents.   The Board of Regents, which governs five public educational  institutions across Iowa, first established a student regent position  in 1973 to give students a say in decisionmaking. Since then, five  University of Iowa students have served in this position.   On April 28, Abby was unanimously confirmed to serve on the board,  six years since the last Hawkeye student filled the seat.   The student regent seat is incredibly important, and I have  tremendous faith that Abby will be an excellent representative for the  university and for her fellow students.                            ____________________
