 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Frankel for her  leadership on the Women's Caucus. The Women's Caucus is a bipartisan  women's committee. I was honored when I was given the opportunity to  serve on this committee because I know for a fact in America, for all  of the strides and accomplishments that we have had as women, that we  still have so many issues and challenges that we must address.   Whenever there is an issue that disrespects or an issue that is a  barrier for a woman, it is incumbent upon us to step up and to speak  out because silence or turning our head is condoning the behavior.   Now, we stand here today as women, but there will be men joining us  and have joined us because the behavior that we have learned about in  the Marines, one of our military branches, is unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the issue of nonconsensual  activities in the U.S. military. It has been revealed that  nonconsensual nude photos of servicemembers were posted to social  media, and it was even enhanced by disturbing comments that were  unacceptable and really disrespectful.   This offensive behavior strikes at the very heart of the Marines. The  Marines, who we trust and admire and know that they go out and serve  this country in so many ways, and we have such honor and respect for  them--but this behavior, Mr. Speaker, undermines the trust and the  confidence that the marines have in each other. The Marines stand up  and, as a team and as a body and as a military, take a code that they  will protect each other, and it compromises the respect that the  American people have for our military.   Our servicemembers must have the confidence that their brothers and  their sisters in uniform always have each other's back. There is simply  no room in the military or in our society for behavior that humiliates  and degrades women servicemembers. Women who are in the Marines have  earned the respect of their brothers and sisters, and they deserve the  trust. Many victims, just like in the civilian workforce, are afraid to  report the assault. We want to encourage them to file their complaints.   I had, at one time, served my country as an EEO investigator in the  private sector. As an equal employment opportunity investigator and  having cases of sexual harassment, I would sit in a private counseling  session with a victim as she relived it to tell me what happened and  how so often they struggle with: Should I tell someone? I am  embarrassed. Maybe I should have done more. Or why did I accept it?   And then some will say: I will just quit. I just don't want to go  through the humiliation of telling my story. Because when you file a  complaint, for it to be processed, it becomes public.   I want to say to every woman that if you really understand how  inappropriate, how much you do not deserve to be treated that way, and  you want to make sure that no other woman ever is treated that way, I  want you to know that we as Congress will stand with you to support  your right to report it, to make sure we hold those accountable who did  it.   I want to say to everybody that I stand here today as a Member of  Congress and as a Member of the Women's Caucus to say that you have  support.   In 2015, the latest year for which military assault data is  available, more than 6,000 sexual assault cases were reported. Only 10  percent of men report their sexual assaults in the military. Only 40  percent of women do the same.   Sexual assault is wrong, whether it is for a man or a woman.  According to the Human Rights Watch report released in 2015, the rate  of retaliation for reporting a sexual assault in the military is 12  times higher than the rate of report resulting in a conviction for the  predator. We understand the problem, and we want to be a part of the  solution.    Mr. Speaker, I will close with this. We stand here today knowing that  we have a problem. But I am confident in my belief and trust in our  military, and I am confident that the women and men in this Congress  will stand together and we will fix this problem so we can continue to  have our military brothers and sisters serve together without being  attacked by their own.   Ms FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative  Lawrence for her excellent advocacy today.   Mr. Speaker, I now want to yield the floor to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), my very good friend. She is the ranking  member on the Veterans Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,  and chair of the bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here  tonight for this Special Order on the Marines photo sharing scandal.   I am pleased to be with you but disturbed about the underlying  incident. I don't think there is anyone in this country who is watching  this evening who doesn't share our sentiment. This is shocking. It is  disturbing. And most importantly, it is degrading to the women in the  Marines.   I have to just imagine what it would take to become a marine and to  be a woman in the Marine Corps. The training, the dedication, the  commitment that these people have set their lives toward serving our  country.   I am very pleased to join my colleagues today to express my  disappointment and, indeed, outrage at the conduct of literally  thousands of marines who violated the standards of the Marine Corps and  displayed dishonorable conduct and terrible judgment by distributing  sexually explicit photos of Active-Duty and veteran women marines  online.   The behavior on the Facebook page Marines United is wholly  unacceptable and is not only morally repugnant but undermines the  safety, the security of female marines and, indeed, our national  security.   Women marines were, in some cases, identified by name, rank, and  location. These women who are bravely serving our Nation in uniform  were put at risk of blackmail, of violence to themselves, or worse.  This cannot and will not be tolerated by the United States Congress, by  the leadership of the Marines, and by Americans across this country.   The Marines represent the greatest fighting force in the history of  the world, and actions like this cannot be allowed to undermine their  effectiveness and unit cohesion. As the founder of the bipartisan Task  Force to End Sexual Violence, I join my colleagues from both sides of  the aisle to understand the persistent challenges that the culture of  sexual violence poses on school campuses, in the workplace, online, in  the military, and throughout our society.   We are beginning to change the conversation around sexual violence  and intimidation, but there is much more work to be done. I strongly  support the bipartisan legislative action to back up the cultural  change that we know is starting to take place.   The PRIVATE Act, led by Representative Martha McSally, would amend  the Uniform Code of Military Justice to ensure that the type of  explicit sharing that was seen in the Marines United scandal is  expressly prohibited.   Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly thank Representative McSally and  our Democratic colleague Representative Jackie Speier for their  leadership on the Armed Services Committee in protecting the interests  of women in our military.   I know that leadership within the Marines and the Armed Forces is  taking the issue of sexual harassment and sexual violence very  seriously, and I appreciate their commitment to improving safety for  all our servicemembers, regardless of gender. This is an issue that  transcends politics. I have been encouraged by the bipartisan support  that this issue has received.   I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to end sexual  violence and intimidation in the military and, indeed, throughout our  society.   Mr. Speaker, I want to just take a moment to share with you the  testimony of Lance Corporal Marisa Woytek, as indicated by our leader  today, Representative Lois Frankel. She quoted some of the testimony,  and I wanted to share a few other parts with you.  [[Page H3055]]    These are two marines who came and spoke to our bipartisan Women's  Caucus, and they described what had happened to them; that these  personal explicit pictures had been shared on the internet, that their  names, their rank, their duty station, had all been shared without  their consent.                                time  1815    I want to talk to you about the backlash since they had the courage  to speak out, because as we investigate further in the Bipartisan Task  Force to End Sexual Violence--whether it is in high schools, whether it  is on college campuses, whether it is in the military--when someone has  the courage to identify the harassment, sexual assault, intimidation,  there is an incredible backlash on social media.   She writes:   ``Within the past 24 hours alone, I have had former Marines harass me  online, and say and state that they actively look for sexually explicit  pictures of me. One of the former Marines who has been harassing me has  also been a predator to many women online denigrating women in Marines  United, and has even gone as far as saying he would throw an Active  Duty female Marine `into a barrel of acid.' ''   These are our best and brightest. These are the people that we rely  upon to keep our country safe, to uphold the dignity of our values  overseas.   She continues:   ``Another Marine stated to me directly that he was `passing my info  around to Marines, so far the rough estimate is 3,000. Good luck ever  being able to show your face again.' ''   This is a woman who has trained, who has dedicated her life, and  whose family is proud to call her a marine. And I, as a Member of  Congress, am proud to call her a marine. She does not deserve this in  the workplace.   One last quote:   ``Another former Marine asked `Who has this bitch's pictures, I want  to blast them all over.' ''   I have to ask my colleagues for a bit of personal privilege to even  use that word on the floor of the House of Representatives. That is not  a word that should ever be used for a marine in the United States  Marine Corps.   So I think you can tell this is deeply troubling to us as Members of  Congress, deeply troubling--it should be--to the leadership of the  Marine Corps, all the way up to and including our Commander in Chief.  This is simply unacceptable.   As members of the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence, as  members of the bipartisan Women's Caucus, as Members of the United  States House of Representatives, we will not let it stand.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record testimony of a female marine.                 Testimony of Lance Corporal Marisa Woytek         My name is Marisa Woytek. I am a Lance Corporal in the       United States Marine Corps. I enlisted, like many of my       brothers and sisters because I wanted to be part of something       bigger than myself. I joined to follow in my fathers' foot       steps who served honorably in the Marine Corps.        Over the past few years of being active duty, I've       experienced the amazing things the Marine Corps has to offer.       I experienced, brotherhood and sisterhood, I experienced       comradery, and I have many fond memories that I will carry       with me until the day I die. But with the good, comes the       bad. Since my first few weeks in the Marine Corps outside of       boot camp, I have seen on numerous occasions the denigration       of Marines, especially female Marines by fellow Marines. Some       active duty and some former Marines have been posting picture       women for the so called game of ``Smash or Pass'', and some       have included personal and explicit pictures including these       women's names, ranks, and duty station without their consent.        Since speaking out, I've received backlash on social media.       Within the past 24 hours alone, I have had former Marines       harass me online, and say and state that they actively look       for sexually explicit pictures of me. One of the former       Marines who has been harassing me has also been a predator to       many women online denigrating women in Marines United, and       has even gone as far as saying he would throw an active duty       female Marine ``into a barrel of acid''. Another Marine       stated to me directly that he was ``passing my info around to       Marines, so far the rough estimate is 3,000. Good luck ever       being able to show your face again''. Another former Marine       asked ``Who has this bitch's pictures, I want to blast them       all over''.        My brothers and sisters are why I am here today. The       majority of Marines are intelligent, well rounded, and       respectful people. Those Marines are who the world should be       praising. The disgusting actions of a few do not define an       entire branch. We must remember that the Marine Corps is an       institution that prides itself in honor, courage, and       commitment. Most Marines practice these values everyday, and       those who do not bring dishonor to themselves and to the       United States Marine Corps.
