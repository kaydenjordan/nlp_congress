 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   Like so many of the Republican amendments that were shockingly made  in order, this is yet another tragic attempt to gut DOD of any efforts  to increase diversity and decrease extremism.   Let me be clear: This provision will only hurt our national security  and readiness. Some 41 percent of our military members are minorities,  and that number will continue to grow. So it is unbelievable to me why  my colleagues across the aisle are so opposed to ensuring that nearly  half of our servicemen and -women feel seen, heard, and supported as  they defend our country.   As we continue to face recruitment and retention challenges, we  should be using every tool in the toolbox to recruit the best and the  brightest. That means recruiting people of diverse backgrounds.   As a Black woman standing before you today, hear me when I say that  this amendment is as harmful as it is hurtful.   We simply should not have to defend why diversity is our Nation's  strength and yet, here we are. It is maddening, and it is dangerous.
