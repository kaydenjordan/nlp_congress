 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   It is a long title for a bill; however, we are talking about  protecting unborn children. As it has been obvious here today, it is  always difficult to talk about this issue, but when we talk about pain- capable unborn children, we are referring to, in particular, children  who are still in the womb at 20 weeks.   As it has been pointed out by my colleagues time and time again,  scientists have proven that unborn children, even at 20 weeks old, are  capable of feeling pain. The goal of this legislation is to protect  these children by ensuring that they cannot be aborted.   Today, if a physician performs an in utero surgery on a 20-week-old  unborn child, the standard protocol for the child is to be treated as a  patient, not just a blob of tissue. That child would be given an  injection of pain medication before the surgery, and this is above and  beyond the anesthesia given to the mother before the surgery.   These babies have demonstrated to medical experts that they respond  to painful stimuli because they flinch and they recoil from sharp  objects.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  legislation when it comes to the floor. Let's do the right thing and  protect unborn children.
