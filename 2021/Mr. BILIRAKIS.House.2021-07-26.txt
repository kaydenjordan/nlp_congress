 Madam Speaker, in Pasco County, one of the counties in  my district, we have seen a huge spike in overdoses, including 25  fatalities in the month of June alone. Very, very sad.   During January through June 2021, we have seen more overdoses than  any other similar period on record.   Fentanyl continues to be a significant factor. We must do everything  we can to prevent fentanyl from flooding our streets, including  stopping the free flow at our Nation's southern border.   I have been to the border, Madam Speaker, and I have seen how easy it  is to move drugs into our country. We must secure our border.   Additionally, we must implement commonsense safeguards to prevent  opioid abuse and improve access to quality treatment options. I will  continue to work on these priorities.   Separately, Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committees on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be  discharged from further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.
