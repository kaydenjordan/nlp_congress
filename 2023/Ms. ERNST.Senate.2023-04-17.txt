 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Dirt  Road Candle Company of Atlantic, IA, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   What started as a hobby for Michelle Myers has turned into a full- time business through passion, a quality product, and rural Iowa  inspiration. In 2016, Myers and her husband Steve Myers bought a farm  on a dirt road. The farm was a dream come true for them. At first,  creating candles was Myers' hobby, but as demand for her candles  increased, she began to make it her second job, which led to the  creation of her small business. Soon after, Myers sold her candles on  consignment at a local boutique and started selling her candles online.  The growth has led Myers to hire six employees to join her at Dirt Road  Candle Company.   The vision statement of the company is ``happiness does have a  smell.'' Each candle is named after different moments or ideas that are  inspired by rural Iowa. Myers started giving her candles fun names when  she discovered that her customers engage more with the meaning of  candles. She has had candles named ``Call Your Mom,'' which was  inspired by Myers' time at Iowa State University, candles named ``Iowa  Nice'' or even ``Backyard Lilacs,'' which embodies the Iowa spring  spirit. All of the candles are hand poured on the farm and are made  with 100 percent USA-raised soy wax. Myers has even expanded her  product line to include room sprays, car freshies, counter sprays, wall  diffusers, wax melts, hand soap, and pet products.   Dirt Road Candle Company continues to look out for the community.  Candle proceeds have been donated to various charities. A couple of  years ago, she had a county-fair inspired candle. Proceeds went to  support a child to go to the county fair or to buy a child a chicken.  She also had a candle called ``Love Your Neighbor,'' with profits  supporting the 2019 Iowa flood victims. Further, Myers opens up her  candle workshop twice a year to sell her products in person. On those  days, she also invites other entrepreneurs to sell their products in  her shop.   Dirt Road Candle Company's commitment to its values has paid off. In  6 years, Myers and team have been able to grow from a hobby to a  thriving  [[Page S1132]]  small business that brings the joy of rural Iowa to many satisfied  customers. Myers' farm life is her inspiration, and she has been able  to use this muse to create a truly one of a kind Iowa experience from  the comfort of your home. I want to commend Michelle Myers and the  entire team at Dirt Road Candle Company for their continued dedication  to spreading joy through their candles. This business exemplifies the  perseverance and grit of the Iowa entrepreneur. I look forward to  seeing your continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________     Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Geothermal Eco Options, Inc., of Cresco, IA, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   With over 60 years of construction experience, owners Larry Leliefeld  and Frederic ``Reed'' Carlson provide a one-stop shop for geothermal  heating and cooling. Geothermal Eco Options, Inc., was founded in 2011,  serving Iowa and the surrounding States with drilling and installation  of geothermal loops. Geothermal loops, a unique technology using the  thermal temperature below the frost line to regulate temperature, can  be used for year-round indoor climate control in buildings.   The company boasts equipment and personnel that can provide drilling  to even the most closely packed areas. Each project is different for  the team. They offer different types of loop options including those  that run vertical, horizontal in the ground, adjacent to a pond, or  even retrofitting an existing geothermal loop to provide adequate  heating and cooling. Due to the expertise of the Geothermal Eco Options  team, a geothermal loop installed by the team can last decades and  require little to no maintenance.   Geothermal Eco Options is an established leader in the industry and  has an impressive list of certified staff. They have both State and  national certification for the drilling and installation of heat pump  loops.   Geothermal Eco Options, Inc.'s commitment to innovation and hard work  is clear.
