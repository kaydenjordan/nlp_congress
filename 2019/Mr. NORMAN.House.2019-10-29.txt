 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say that September 10, 2019,  was a very special day for an infant child who had been severely  neglected by her mother. And had it not been for the quick action by  members of the Tega Cay Police Department located in South Carolina,  the abuse would have continued.   Four officers--Sergeant Vince Holland, Officer Matt Boyd, Officer  Matt Connolly, and Officer Billy Donahue--responded to a call at 6 p.m.  from employees of the Tega Cay Walmart who were concerned about a  mother who was with an infant who, in the words of the officers, was  ``filthy'' and in dire need of help.   The officers immediately reacted to the situation by cleaning the  infant and giving food, diapers, and other aid to the child. The  officers stayed with the child while the South Carolina Department of  Social Services was notified and the child was taken into emergency  custody by the agency, along with two other children who were removed  from the home.   The mother was charged with three felony drug charges, shoplifting,  and cruelty to a child. In the words of Chief Steve Parker, ``That  little baby did nothing wrong.''   Because of the action of these brave officers who showed compassion  and empathy, three children are now out of danger and living in a safe  environment.   The four officers of the Tega Cay Police Department lived out the  words of Winston Churchill, who said, there are times when doing your  best is not good enough; we must do what is required.   Sergeant Vince Holland, Officer Matt Boyd, Officer Matt Connolly, and  Officer Billy Donahue are shining examples of the saying, ``to live is  to serve.''                            ____________________
