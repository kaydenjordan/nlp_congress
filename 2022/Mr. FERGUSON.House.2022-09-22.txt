 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  Democratic Caucus chair the schedule for the week to come. I yield to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, we have seen movement in the Senate. I  understand that there is activity over there. Does the gentleman have  an update on when we might see that legislation in the House? But more  importantly when we might see legislative text?    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleague if he is aware of any  other additional authorizing text that may be attached to the  continuing resolution.    One final thing. Leader Hoyer made an announcement this  summer that we were going to try to close votes in a timely fashion. As  we have just seen, it is virtually impossible to do it with proxy  voting because these four votes took almost 2 hours to complete.   Given that the business community is getting back to normal, we are  seeing workers return to work. We are seeing businesses return to  normal operations, and given that the President proclaimed that the  pandemic is over, does the gentleman also expect to end proxy voting  next week when the current covered period ends?    Mr. Speaker, I think America expects Congress to lead,  and we are seeing, again, across the Nation, people get back to their  lives, get back to normal. Certainly, there are many safe precautions  that have been taken.   But clearly, showing up to work is something that Americans expect  Congress to do, and I just cannot think of a reason why Members of this  body--while we get on airplanes and fly back and forth to our districts  every week. I see so many of our Members on both sides of the aisle  attending events and speaking at various functions and, certainly, they  are not campaigning remotely. I can't think of a reason why we wouldn't  do away with proxy voting and show up here in the people's House in  person.   Mr. Speaker, I would love to see if my colleague from New York has  any insight into that.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time.   We are failing miserably in American energy independence, with the  rise of home heating costs and fuel. We see what has happened to our  neighbors in the European Union. We see the rising costs. Certainly,  Americans are worried about that, the rising cost of rent, the out-of- control inflation, the excessive government spending. I mean, we have  that.   But more importantly, we have our communities that are less safe  because of the crisis at the border. The fentanyl crisis that is  hitting every single community.   I don't know that we have been leading.   I want to, Mr. Speaker, go back to the specifics of the question that  was asked here in terms of leading by showing up to work. I want to see  if there is any kind of rational reason why we shouldn't show up in  person to work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time.   The President ended the pandemic, declared that it was over. If that  is the case, shouldn't we be going back to normal, Mr. Speaker?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time.   Clearly, we see some of these important issues differently. Just  sticking to the main question of proxy voting and why Members of  Congress should not show up to do their job. American businesses are.  We can campaign in person. Certainly voting in person seems reasonable  to me.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the caucus chair, for his time  today and for setting the schedule, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
