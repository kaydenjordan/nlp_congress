 Madam Speaker, I am here today to lift up the voices of  my community, to address an issue facing too many Pennsylvanians, as  well as others across our country. I am here to talk about rising  prices and inflation.   When Sidney from Malvern tried to renew an essential prescription, it  was on back order and he doesn't know when it will be back in stock.   Andrew from Mohnton is a small business owner affected by supply  chain issues, making it difficult for him to employ his staff and keep  his equipment running.  [[Page H4583]]    And Dennis from Downingtown had to sell his car because he could no  longer afford the high financial burden on top of other expenses.   Our communities deserve support in facing these challenges, and it is  vital that we do everything that we can to confront them. I helped  establish an Inflation Working Group to find policy solutions to lower  costs for Americans, reinforce supply chains, and fight inflationary  pressures. Simply put, we must use every tool in our toolbox to support  our families.   We live in an increasingly globalized world, which is why I, along  with a bipartisan group of my colleagues, traveled to Australia and  India to speak with our international partners about cooperation on  trade, investments, and shoring up our supply chains.   I promise to continue to make this issue a priority, working with all  of my colleagues to find substantive solutions for my constituents and  for all Americans.                            ____________________
