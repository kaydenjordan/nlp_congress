 Madam President, I rise today to recognize the great work  of the Georgia Greater Black Chamber of Commerce. The Georgia Greater  Black Chamber has focused on recognizing the integral contributions of  Black-owned businesses to the strength of both our State and our  Nation's economy during National Black Business Month in Auqust. For 7  straight years, Georgia has been named the No. 1 place in the country  in which to do business, and the Georgia Greater Black Chamber has been  instrumental in making that possible.   As I mentioned, August was National Black Business Month, and the  Georgia Greater Black Chamber celebrated by honoring an important  Georgian: Mr. Herman J. Russell.  [[Page S5894]]    H. J. Russell was the epitome of the American entrepreneur. Despite  all the obstacles in his way, he worked hard to achieve his dreams. His  business started as a plastering company, and he grew it into one of  Atlanta's best real estate developers. Anywhere you look in Atlanta,  you will see the incredible landmarks that the H.J. Russell Company has  worked on: the Georgia Dome, Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, and  Castleberry Hill. As a business guy myself, I am inspired by all that  Herman J. Russell did in his life. Simply put, Atlanta would not be  what it is today without H.J. Russell and the H.J. Russell Company. His  children carry on this entrepreneurial spirit to this day. I recently  had the opportunity to visit with his sons Michael and Jerome. They and  their sister Donata Russell Ross are dedicated to continuing Black  entrepreneurship.   Recently, I had the privilege of visiting the Russell Center for  Innovation and Entrepreneurship--RCIE--with Housing and Urban  Development Secretary Ben Carson. The Russell Center assists African- American entrepreneurs by providing workspace, networking  opportunities, and educational resources. In 2019, RCIE converted a  43,000-square-foot corporate headquarters into space for 100 emerging  entrepreneurial companies. RCIE is a testament to the efforts of  African-American entrepreneurs to uplift each other.   As the Georgia Greater Black Chamber and other organizations in my  State look to support growth in Black business and entrepreneurship, I  will continue to work to support them. Through a recent conversation  with Dr. David Thomas, president of Morehouse College, I was made aware  that approximately 45 percent of the young men who start as freshmen at  Morehouse will not graduate. I have appealed to the Georgia business  community to support HBCU's and hire their graduates as part of the  solution to this problem. I was also proud to work with Congressman  David Scott on a scholarship program for the ``1890s'' land grant  institutions like Fort Valley State to help ensure they can continue to  produce farmers and agri-businesses that are of critical importance to  Georgia's economic future.   African-American entrepreneurship and business ownership accounts for  nearly 3 million businesses in the United States and nearly a million  employees. Before COVID-19, African-American unemployment was at its  lowest point in U.S. history. These are remarkable statistics, but we  must continue to advance the important work of supporting Black  businesses, as this is key to empowering communities and individuals to  move out of poverty and into prosperity.   I look forward to working with the Georgia Great Black Chamber of  Commerce and other Chambers in Georgia to ensure Georgia remains the  best place in America for all businesses.                            ____________________
