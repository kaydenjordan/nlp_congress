Mr. President, former Google executive chairman Eric  Schmidt, in writing with Jared Cohen, once said:         Modern technology platforms [are] even more powerful than       most people realize [and that] our future world will be       profoundly altered by their adoption and successfulness in       societies everywhere.    There is no question that Big Tech plays an ever increasing role in  our lives. I imagine most of us wouldn't even be able to count the  number of times a day we interact with technology platforms, from  checking our email to spending time on social media to searching on  Google, and the pandemic only accelerated that trend as our reliance on  technology for everything from social connection to food delivery  increased.  [[Page S2970]]    I don't need to tell anyone that technology platforms offer lots of  benefits. They are sources of entertainment and information. They make  it easier to stay close to distant loved ones. They allow us to shop,  to conduct business, and to connect with friends, and to advocate for  causes that we believe in.   But I also don't need to tell anyone that technology platforms have a  more problematic side as well. One big problem arises from the  increased ability Big Tech has to shape the information we see through  the use of opaque algorithms. Gone are the days when you logged into  Facebook and just consumed content that had been posted chronologically  since your previous login. Now, Facebook and other social media  platforms use algorithms to shape your news feed and provide  suggestions for additional content, emphasizing posts that the  platforms think you will be interested in and deemphasizing other  posts.   Now, obviously, algorithms are not all bad. Most of us like it when  YouTube automatically plays another video by our favorite band instead  of switching to something completely unrelated. But if a 15-year-old  kid watches a video and then YouTube's algorithms lead him or her down  a path of inappropriate videos--well, I think you could see that is a  problem.   A 2021 Wall Street Journal investigation into TikTok revealed how  easy it is for young users to be bombarded with inappropriate and  disturbing content. And thanks to limited or opaque disclosures, people  are often not aware of just how much their experience on technology  platforms is being shaped by opaque algorithms.   When we search for something on Google, most of us don't spend a lot  of time thinking about the fact that Google is tailoring our search  results to what it thinks we want to see or what it wants us to see.  But the fact of the matter is that almost all of the information being  presented to us by Big Tech platforms like social media and Google is  being filtered and tailored to us. And while, again, this can have a  positive side, it can also have negative consequences, ranging from  political polarization to addictive behavior.   As technology platforms play an ever more dominant role in our lives,  I believe platforms should be required to make users aware of the fact  that an algorithm is controlling the content they see. To that end, I  have offered multiple pieces of legislation to increase Big Tech's  transparency and to give consumers more control over their experience.   My bipartisan Filter Bubble Transparency Act would require large- scale internet platforms to notify users that the content they are  seeing has been selected for them by secret algorithms, creating a  unique universe of information for each user--a phenomenon that is  often referred to as the ``filter bubble.'' Platforms would also be  required to give users the choice to switch to a version of the  platform that is filter bubble-free.   I have also introduced the bipartisan Platform Accountability and  Transparency Act--or the PACT Act--to shed greater light on the  secretive content moderation processes internet platforms use.   The PACT Act would require internet platforms to prepare biannual  transparency reports outlining material that they have removed from  their sites or chosen to deemphasize. These reports would have to be  made available to the public and not in intentionally complicated  legalese. Platforms would have to provide clearly understandable  versions of these reports to consumers.   The PACT Act would require technology platforms to provide consumers  with greater due process when it comes to content these platforms  remove or otherwise moderate. So if Facebook, for example, removed one  of your posts, it would have to tell you why and would have to provide  a way for you to appeal that decision.   Today, I am introducing a third piece of legislation to increase  transparency and accountability at Big Tech. This bill is called the  Political Bias in Algorithm Sorting Emails Act, otherwise known as the  Political BIAS Emails Act. The Political BIAS Emails Act is intended to  address the problem political campaigns on both sides of the aisle have  faced in getting their campaign emails to Americans.   A recent study from North Carolina State University found that during  the 2020 election, Google's Gmail--the largest email provider in the  United States--sent greater numbers of Republican campaign emails to  spam folders, while Yahoo! and Outlook sent greater numbers of  Democratic campaign emails to spam, albeit by lesser margins than  Google did for Republican campaign emails. Well, that is a problem.   Americans should have access to political communications from both  parties so that they can make their own informed decisions on what  candidates they wish to support. Disproportionately filtering out  information from candidates of one party--or from a certain candidate  within a particular political party, as happened during the Democratic  Presidential primary--skews the information available to Americans.   I do not believe that Big Tech should be deciding what information  individuals receive. Americans are free to opt out of whatever email  communications they wish, including political communications, but Big  Tech should not be making that decision for them. My Political BIAS  Emails Act would prohibit email services from using filtering  algorithms on emails sent from political campaigns where the candidate  is running from Federal office.   Gmail and other email services' inboxing practices are a black box to  consumers, and they operate with very little accountability. To address  this, my legislation would require email services to submit  transparency reports noting the number of emails from both Republican  and Democratic campaigns flagged as spam, as well as provide  information to political campaigns on request to help ensure that  voters are receiving relevant information on every candidate's policy  positions.   This legislation would help ensure that Americans and not Big Tech--I  emphasize not Big Tech--are making the decisions on what campaign  communications they want to receive.   Internet platforms have enhanced Americans' lives in a number of  ways, as I have already mentioned. But as these platforms play an ever- greater role in shaping the information we receive, it is vital that we  insist on adequate transparency and ensure that Americans are given the  opportunity to opt out of the filter bubble. American people ought to  be in charge of what they see, not Big Tech companies.   I will continue to work to advance the various bills that I have  introduced to promote greater transparency in Big Tech. And as ranking  member of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Communications,  Media, and Broadband, I will continue to focus on ways to ensure that  Big Tech is accountable to consumers.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4409         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

There is no question that Big Tech plays an ever increasing role in  our lives. I imagine most of us wouldn't even be able to count the  number of times a day we interact with technology platforms, from  checking our email to spending time on social media to searching on  Google, and the pandemic only accelerated that trend as our reliance on  technology for everything from social connection to food delivery  increased.  [[Page S2970]]    I don't need to tell anyone that technology platforms offer lots of  benefits. They are sources of entertainment and information. They make  it easier to stay close to distant loved ones. They allow us to shop,  to conduct business, and to connect with friends, and to advocate for  causes that we believe in.   But I also don't need to tell anyone that technology platforms have a  more problematic side as well. One big problem arises from the  increased ability Big Tech has to shape the information we see through  the use of opaque algorithms. Gone are the days when you logged into  Facebook and just consumed content that had been posted chronologically  since your previous login. Now, Facebook and other social media  platforms use algorithms to shape your news feed and provide  suggestions for additional content, emphasizing posts that the  platforms think you will be interested in and deemphasizing other  posts.   Now, obviously, algorithms are not all bad. Most of us like it when  YouTube automatically plays another video by our favorite band instead  of switching to something completely unrelated. But if a 15-year-old  kid watches a video and then YouTube's algorithms lead him or her down  a path of inappropriate videos--well, I think you could see that is a  problem.   A 2021 Wall Street Journal investigation into TikTok revealed how  easy it is for young users to be bombarded with inappropriate and  disturbing content. And thanks to limited or opaque disclosures, people  are often not aware of just how much their experience on technology  platforms is being shaped by opaque algorithms.   When we search for something on Google, most of us don't spend a lot  of time thinking about the fact that Google is tailoring our search  results to what it thinks we want to see or what it wants us to see.  But the fact of the matter is that almost all of the information being  presented to us by Big Tech platforms like social media and Google is  being filtered and tailored to us. And while, again, this can have a  positive side, it can also have negative consequences, ranging from  political polarization to addictive behavior.   As technology platforms play an ever more dominant role in our lives,  I believe platforms should be required to make users aware of the fact  that an algorithm is controlling the content they see. To that end, I  have offered multiple pieces of legislation to increase Big Tech's  transparency and to give consumers more control over their experience.   My bipartisan Filter Bubble Transparency Act would require large- scale internet platforms to notify users that the content they are  seeing has been selected for them by secret algorithms, creating a  unique universe of information for each user--a phenomenon that is  often referred to as the ``filter bubble.'' Platforms would also be  required to give users the choice to switch to a version of the  platform that is filter bubble-free.   I have also introduced the bipartisan Platform Accountability and  Transparency Act--or the PACT Act--to shed greater light on the  secretive content moderation processes internet platforms use.   The PACT Act would require internet platforms to prepare biannual  transparency reports outlining material that they have removed from  their sites or chosen to deemphasize. These reports would have to be  made available to the public and not in intentionally complicated  legalese. Platforms would have to provide clearly understandable  versions of these reports to consumers.   The PACT Act would require technology platforms to provide consumers  with greater due process when it comes to content these platforms  remove or otherwise moderate. So if Facebook, for example, removed one  of your posts, it would have to tell you why and would have to provide  a way for you to appeal that decision.   Today, I am introducing a third piece of legislation to increase  transparency and accountability at Big Tech. This bill is called the  Political Bias in Algorithm Sorting Emails Act, otherwise known as the  Political BIAS Emails Act. The Political BIAS Emails Act is intended to  address the problem political campaigns on both sides of the aisle have  faced in getting their campaign emails to Americans.   A recent study from North Carolina State University found that during  the 2020 election, Google's Gmail--the largest email provider in the  United States--sent greater numbers of Republican campaign emails to  spam folders, while Yahoo! and Outlook sent greater numbers of  Democratic campaign emails to spam, albeit by lesser margins than  Google did for Republican campaign emails. Well, that is a problem.   Americans should have access to political communications from both  parties so that they can make their own informed decisions on what  candidates they wish to support. Disproportionately filtering out  information from candidates of one party--or from a certain candidate  within a particular political party, as happened during the Democratic  Presidential primary--skews the information available to Americans.   I do not believe that Big Tech should be deciding what information  individuals receive. Americans are free to opt out of whatever email  communications they wish, including political communications, but Big  Tech should not be making that decision for them. My Political BIAS  Emails Act would prohibit email services from using filtering  algorithms on emails sent from political campaigns where the candidate  is running from Federal office.   Gmail and other email services' inboxing practices are a black box to  consumers, and they operate with very little accountability. To address  this, my legislation would require email services to submit  transparency reports noting the number of emails from both Republican  and Democratic campaigns flagged as spam, as well as provide  information to political campaigns on request to help ensure that  voters are receiving relevant information on every candidate's policy  positions.   This legislation would help ensure that Americans and not Big Tech--I  emphasize not Big Tech--are making the decisions on what campaign  communications they want to receive.   Internet platforms have enhanced Americans' lives in a number of  ways, as I have already mentioned. But as these platforms play an ever- greater role in shaping the information we receive, it is vital that we  insist on adequate transparency and ensure that Americans are given the  opportunity to opt out of the filter bubble. American people ought to  be in charge of what they see, not Big Tech companies.   I will continue to work to advance the various bills that I have  introduced to promote greater transparency in Big Tech. And as ranking  member of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Communications,  Media, and Broadband, I will continue to focus on ways to ensure that  Big Tech is accountable to consumers.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4409         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
