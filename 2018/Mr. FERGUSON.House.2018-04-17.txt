 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5446. This  commonsense legislation makes a targeted but important reform to  protect American small businesses by ensuring that the rules for  seizure of perishable goods are restricted only to goods that are, in  fact, perishable.   The fact that we are having to even comment or debate on the fact  that a small business in Texas was destroyed by the actions of an IRS  agent that determined that bridal dresses were perishable is  unconscionable, and it should not happen, and it should not have  happened then; and I agree with my colleague from New York that it  should never happen again, and this legislation will help ensure that.   Now, I don't think we have to explain to anybody that, since these  bridal gowns are not perishable, why is this bill even necessary? But  it is a shame that we have had agents use this particular piece of  legislation to actually leave a family destitute because of their  actions of selling bridal dresses under the guise that they were  perishable.   This legislation tightens up the law to eliminate the language that  the IRS agents in Dallas and others across the country have used to  justify their overreaching use of same-day sale provisions. H.R. 5446  makes an important step to prevent the IRS from redefining these words  to suit their own purposes, threatening the livelihoods of American  small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sponsor this legislation to strength  protections for small businesses and job creators, and I encourage my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' and do the same.
