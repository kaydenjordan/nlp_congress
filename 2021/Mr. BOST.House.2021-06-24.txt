 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 239, the Equal Access  to Contraception for Veterans Act. This bill is sponsored by  Congresswoman Julia Brownley. I thank her for introducing it.   The Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act passed the House  last year with the support of the Trump administration.   It would eliminate copays for birth control at the VA healthcare  system. In doing so, it would remove a barrier to care for women  veterans. It would bring VA in line with the Department of Defense and  the private sector. It would correct a fundamental unfairness that  means women pay more for birth control at the VA than elsewhere. And it  would not in any way contradict or undermine the prohibition against  abortion and abortion counseling at the VA that already exists in law  and regulation.   Women are the fastest-growing group of servicemembers and veterans.  They are raising their right hands to serve this country in record  numbers. Ensuring they are cared for as veterans is one of my top  priorities as the lead Republican on the VA Committee.   We have made progress in making the VA safer and more welcome to  women, but we still have a long way to go. Women veterans die by  suicide at two times the rate as nonveteran women. Most of the veterans  who die by suicide are not engaged in VA care at the time of their  death. That is why connecting more veterans with the VA is key to  stopping veteran suicide.                                time  1230    One of the primary ways we can connect more veterans with VA is by  removing barriers that prevent them from seeking the care and benefits  they have earned. This bill will help to do that.   Women seeking birth control in the private sector do not pay copays.   Women seeking birth control on Active Duty do not pay copays.   This bill will make it so women seeking birth control at VA do not  pay copays either. That is all this bill does. Once again, that is all  this bill does.   Why would we want a woman to pay more for birth control as a veteran  than she did while on Active Duty?   Why would we want a woman to pay more for birth control at the VA  than she would in the private sector?  [[Page H3095]]    Is that any way to thank her for serving her country and defending  our freedoms? I don't think so.   Neither does Leader McCarthy, neither did the Trump administration.  Neither do many of my conservative pro-life lawmakers both in this  Congress and last Congress.   To be clear, this bill does not require allowing VA to provide any  additional form of birth control other than those already available at  the VA.   And once again, it does not in any way contradict or undermine the  prohibition against VA providing abortions and/or abortion counseling  to veterans. That is vitally important to me. I know it is for many of  my colleagues, as well.   I have really weighed this out and prayed this out and sought the  language and read the language. My life has been a pro-life life. I am  not changing those positions, and this bill doesn't change that  position either. I have taken the counsel of doctors who are familiar  with the mechanics of birth control that are being afforded here. They  are not abortion.   I am confident that supporting this bill is the right thing to do for  our Nation's veterans. I am confident that it is consistent with pro- life principles.   Madam Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues join me in voting this  afternoon, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Rosendale).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. Greene).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank both Congressman Rosendale and Congresswoman  Greene, and I appreciate their comments on the sanctity of life, and as  freshman Members, their commitment to our Nation's veterans.   Now, I agree with both of their comments on life. I disagree on this  bill. This is a bill that we have discussed many times, and the fact  is, the emergency contraception is available to veterans at VA today  and has been for many, many years.   You mentioned some of the groups who are opposed to this legislation,  and I respect their viewpoints, and most often agree with them. But I  do think it is appropriate to note right now, however, that just a  couple hours ago, the Heritage Action for America clarified their  position on this bill.   Importantly, Heritage Action noted that the emergency contraception  is not--I repeat--is not a chemical abortion drug and cannot be used to  induce abortion. I think it is important for our Members to keep that  in mind today.   And I also think it is important that you understand that many of our  colleagues who are pro-life should not be questioned on this bill  because it has been people who are pro-life that have not only worked  on this bill this session, but last. And it is vitally important that  not only the Members know this, but the American people know it as  well.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, if I may, I just want to reiterate to my friends and  colleagues that I am pro-life. Many of the people that have supported  this and will support this are pro-life, even groups now that are  saying and mentioning this is contraception. It is contraception. It is  not abortion.   Let me also say that this includes no other drugs or expansion of  drugs that are available. We want to be very, very clear on that. It  does not change the position of VA on abortion in any way, shape, or  form. This is only doing what is right for our veterans and allowing  them the opportunity to receive exactly what someone in the private  sector receives and/or someone on Active Duty receives.   I am hoping that my colleagues will understand this and understand  those of us who support this and why.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1300
