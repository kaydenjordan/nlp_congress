 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the consideration of H.R.  6147, and that I may include tabular material on the same.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 6147, the fiscal year  2019 Interior, Environment, and Financial Services and General  Government appropriations bills. This package continues the House's  important work on our annual government funding legislation. With the  passage of this bill, the House will be halfway done with our fiscal  year 2019 bills through the floor.   I want to thank, and I am sure Ranking Member Lowey thanks both  Chairman Calvert and his ranking member, and Chairman Graves and his  ranking member for their work with their colleagues.   These bills fund vital programs across the Federal Government,  including those that make Americans safer, protect our Nation's  resources, and create jobs. In addition to providing this necessary  funding, the bills ensure that the Federal Government is working  efficiently and in the best interest of the American taxpayers. This  includes streamlining Federal agencies, reforming financial policies,  and reducing burdensome regulatory red tape.   Both bills reflect American priorities. I would like to highlight  just a few of these. The Interior and Environment appropriations bill,  authored by Representative Calvert of California, provides $35.3  billion for the EPA, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Department of the  Interior and other programs that promote our natural heritage.   Within this total, the bill prioritizes funding to fight in  preventing devastating wildfires, fully funding the 10-year average for  suppression costs. The bill also targets critical resources to major  infrastructure that will improve the lives of Americans, boosting  funding to ensure communities have access to safe drinking water, and  accelerates the cleanup of Superfund sites. This is especially  important as we have more than 1,300 national priority sites awaiting  urgent attention to address hazardous materials threatening the health  of Americans across the country. I appreciate Chairman Calvert's  efforts in this area.   The Interior bill continues funding for other programs that manage  our national resources and cultural heritage, like the National Park  Service, the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, the  Chemical Safety Board, and the Smithsonian Institution.   Beyond these important investments, the bill rightsizes regulatory  programs to ensure that the government is working to support American  families and their communities.   This also includes addressing EPA's regulatory agenda and supporting  the administration's proposal to reshape its workforce. This will  enable the agency to focus on its core duties, while reducing  unnecessary spending.   The second bill in this package also works to reduce waste across  government. The Financial Services appropriations bill, authored by  Representative Graves of Georgia, totals $23.4 billion which, like the  Interior bill, is equal to fiscal year 2018 levels.   This bill prioritizes effective programs that improve our national  security and expands economic opportunity while finding efficiencies,  governmentwide, and while stopping harmful overregulation.   This bill also supports America's small businesses by providing loans  and resources that will help us grow and thrive. It also provides  stability for our financial system, and protects consumers, and  investors.   This bill also improves accountability of the American taxpayer by  directing the Internal Revenue Service funding towards customer service  and stopping the misuse of funding within the agency.   Another priority is law enforcement. This bill also provides funding  to fight the opioid abuse epidemic, protects our financial institutions  from cyber crime, and supports our Federal courts.   I would like to commend all the committee members on the  Appropriations Committee who led the drafting of these bills,  particularly Chairman Graves and his Ranking Member,  Mike Quigley, and  Interior Chairman  Ken Calvert and his Ranking Member, Betty McCollum,  along with their subcommittee members and their professional staff that  did a remarkable job.   I am pleased that the House is taking the next step forward on our  appropriations bill this evening.   I reserve the balance of my time.
