 Mr. Speaker, last month, Fox Business  reported that Biden repeated his false campaign pledge that he would  not raise taxes on Americans making below $400,000. Days afterwards,  tax commissioner, Danny Werfel, was hiring 3,700 employees, which is  insulting as higher income earners have returns carefully prepared by  professional accountants, unlike Hunter Biden's evasions.   In direct conflict to Biden, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration said there is no way to identify taxpayers that meet the  criteria of $400,000 or more.   According to Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform,  the findings of the inspector general blew up the narrative, and the  Democrats are knowingly lying.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with Biden open borders and  an attack here imminent.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Byron Thomas, a valued member of the  congressional district office for winning a seat on the Cayce City  Council. We are proud of him, and we know he will serve the public  well.                            ____________________
