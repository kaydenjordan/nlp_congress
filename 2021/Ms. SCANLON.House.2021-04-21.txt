 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible  staff of the Delaware County COVID-19 task force, led by Rosemarie  Halt, for their amazing work, along with the thousands of volunteers  from the DelCo Medical Reserve Corps and the DelCo Citizen Corps who  have created and implemented new systems to test, feed, and vaccinate  tens of thousands of people in our community.   These folks have been working day and night to help guide the  residents of Delaware County through the challenges of a once-in-a- century pandemic. In an ever-changing landscape, they have distributed  supplies, coordinated communication, and are now helping to ensure that  everyone gets vaccinated.   I am proud to honor them today during National Volunteer Week to  celebrate those working behind the scenes to get us back to normal.   Rosemarie, her staff, and the DelCo volunteers have been critical to  the response and relief efforts in our district. For over a year, it  has been all hands on deck, and we cannot thank them enough for their  service.                            ____________________
