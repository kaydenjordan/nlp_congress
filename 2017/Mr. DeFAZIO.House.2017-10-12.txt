 Mr. Speaker, well, last weekend I was shocked to read  the statements of the Republican chair of the Foreign Relations  Committee in the Senate, Senator Corker. He said that, ``Trump has put  us on the path to World War III.''   This makes it essential that Congress assert its full powers under  the Constitution of the United States.   In reaction to Nixon's secret bombing of Cambodia and the aftermath,  Congress passed something called the War Powers Act. Unfortunately,  there was a dispute between the two bodies, and, ultimately, the Senate  prevailed and watered down the bill.   Instead of saying, ``Before the President engages our troops in  hostilities, that he or she must come to the Congress,'' instead, the  bill ultimately adopted saying, ``48 hours after the President has  engaged our troops in hostilities, he or she must report to the  Congress and then seek subsequent authorization, or the troops would be  withdrawn after 60 days.''   I have introduced legislation in this and preceding Congresses to fix  that. That clearly does not represent the constitutional powers of the  United States Congress. The Constitution is absolutely clear. Only  Congress has the authority to declare war. Once war is declared, the  President, under the Constitution, is the Commander in Chief and would  act with one voice to conduct the war and coordinate military efforts.   So my bill would say--do away with the allowance of 48 hours and say:  Before engaging U.S. troops and military in hostilities, that the  President must first come to the Congress and seek a declaration of  war. I think it is absolutely essential that this Congress act on this  legislation and make it clear to the President of the United States  that he does not have the authority to wake up one morning and tweet of  an attack against another country and engage these people in an  escalation that may end, as Senator Corker says, in World War III.   This is a very dangerous time for our country. It is time for this  separate and equal branch of the government to assert its full  authority to rein in any and all dangerous activities by this  President.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would agree with many of the gentleman's  concerns and comments regarding the lack of a real legislative process  here. The bill could be better. But nonetheless, like the ranking  member, I will be supporting the legislation despite those concerns  because it is absolutely urgent.   I have a totally dysfunctional management at the VA hospital in  Roseburg, Oregon. A number of years ago, a whistleblower came to me and  said that substandard care was being provided. We asked the Office of  Inspector General to look into it. They whitewashed it, and then it  came out in the Senate testimony that the Office of Special Counsel had  found that this doctor had been penalized as a whistleblower because he  was pointing to substandard care.   I asked for another investigation and ultimately found, yes, indeed,  substandard care was being provided by the head surgeon. He was  suspended from his duties but is still the head surgeon. Now he has run  another very accomplished doctor, under very dubious circumstances, out  of my Eugene clinic. This is a surgeon who served 29 years, honorably,  in the military, 10 years at my regional hospital with rave reviews,  and, after 30 days at my new VA clinic in Eugene, was dismissed in the  most unusual way with no allegations put forward.   Mr. Speaker, again, it seems that we are having issues here when the  quality is substandard that this one person is able to basically just  get rid of the folks who are raising concerns about the care of  veterans. Again, this shouldn't happen.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the record two letters regarding the  dismissed doctor.                                                  October 17, 2017.        Dear Mr. DeFazio: I am a contracted physician in the       emergency department at the Roseburg VA. I have been working       at this facility since 2010. During that time I have truly       enjoyed providing care for the veterans. However, I have       significant concerns regarding the administration and       inefficiencies in healthcare, in the VA system.       Unfortunately, it seems that advancement of careers and the       fluffing of numbers supersede patient care.        Despite the build up of these concerns over the years, I       have recently became aware of an action that compels me to go       beyond the normal chain of command. One of the surgeons       working at the Eugene campus--still under the Roseburg       administration--was fired recently under very concerning       circumstances.        Dr. Scott Russi was working at the Eugene VA for less than       1 month when he was pushed out and fired. I know Dr. Russi       from the private sector. In addition to working at the       Roseburg VA, I have worked for the last ten years at Sacred       Heart RiverBend--a trauma, stroke, and cardiac center--and       one of the largest hospitals in the state. I worked alongside       Dr. Russi for many years at RiverBend and I found him to be       not only extremely competent and hardworking, but always very       professional. I was sad to see him leave RiverBend, but I was       encouraged that he would be working in the VA system as I       felt he would significantly improve the quality of care for       the veterans.        I find it very disheartening that a group of administrative       physicians, who rarely practice medicine, are able to strike       down such a promising figure simply because they seem to have       felt threatened by him. I know there are many people who are       upset by this firing and who have concerns about this system       in general. I have tried many times to discuss my concerns       with people in the administration and have been met with, at       best, excuses and, at worst, threats. It is clear to me as       somewhat of an outsider and observer (as I am not actually a       VA employee) that physicians who are dedicated to patient       care and most skilled are threatening to the administration.       These physicians are often ostracized and pushed out--and       when they can't be pushed out, false rumors are spread about       them. I have considered stepping away from the VA system due       to these continuing frustrations. It is disheartening to see       these veterans treated with such carelessness. However, I       feel that someone has to stay and actually care for them,       but, if I stay, I also want to try to make the system a       better place for them. For many, this is their only health       care.        I wish this was as exaggerated as it may sound, but       unfortunately this is only a small piece of a huge problem.       If you are interested in more details, I am more than happy       to discuss this further. In general, I keep my head down and       do what I think is best, but this presents itself as a moment       when speaking out is necessary and right.            Thank you,      Charlotte Ransom, MD.                                   ____         Congressman DeFazio: I am writing to ask for your help. I       am a surgeon and a veteran having attended the Usafa and       graduating in 1984, completing medical school on Hpsp       scholarship and spending the next 29 years on active duty. I       deployed four times as a combat surgeon and once as a       hospital commander, my last deployment in 2012 was as the       Dccs of Craig Joint Theater Hospital, Bagram Ab, Afghanistan.       I retired in October of 2013 and settled in Oregon as a       trauma surgeon eventually becoming the Trauma Medical       Director at Riverbend. I was the on-call surgeon the tragic       day Ucc suffered the active shooter event. I recently left my       civilian practice to serve our Veterans, for reasons I think       you would understand; I have seen the care my comrades have       been given and found it wanting, and serving my Vets is       therapeutic for my Ptsd and the sorrow I carry for not being       able to save more soldiers. I am the new surgeon at the Va       Eugene Hcc and have been working there part-time since       January of this year and full time since 23 July. Today I was       handed a summary suspension of clinical privileges as a       surgeon by the parent Va, Roseburg and Dr. Dinesh Ranjan the       chief of surgery. I have been denied the opportunity to       defend my reputation, denied the opportunity to stand before       my peers, and denied any opportunity to see the allegations.       And tonight, I have spoken with two Va physicians (Dr. Lisa       Brandenburger and Dr. Philo Calhoun) whose lives were       dedicated to serving Veterans but were irreparably damaged by       Dr. Ranjan. I am now being targeted by Dr. Ranjan because he       recruited me with the promise of a salary of $385,000, I       signed a contract for that  [[Page H8002]]       amount but I am being paid $280,000. Because I expressed to       the Eugene Hcc administrator I felt I was misled about the       salary, Dr. Ranjan has gone after my clinical privileges, had       them summarily dismissed and placed me at risk of being       reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (Npdb). I       have been suspended from patient contact for 30 days for an       investigation. If the investigation finds me deficient, I       will be reported to the Npdb. If the investigation extends       beyond 30 days, I will be reported to the Npdb. If I am fired       or quit my job, I will be reported to the Npdb. If I am       reported to the Npdb I will never work again as a surgeon.        I know it all sounds unbelievable, I think it is       unbelievable as I try and wrap my head around the events of       these last few days. I ask you not to send a congressional       inquiry to Mr. Paxton, as that would make my life worse. What       I thought would be my dream job, now has become a nightmare.            Respectfully,                                                       Scott Russi.     Mr. Speaker, since this has come out, I have had dozens  of calls from nurses and doctors and other workers in the VA system in  my region--in Eugene, Springfield, and southern Oregon, down to  Roseburg, at those two facilities--because of this mismanagement. They  say that the care is not up to standards, just like this particular  physician was not providing modern care when he did colonoscopies.   We need--vitally need--this legislation and the strongest protection  for whistleblowers. This isn't about protecting bad managers. It is  about promoting qualified and keeping qualified employees, which we are  having a hard time doing in my area. It is about providing the best  care to our veterans, and that isn't going to happen if people can be  intimidated or just shown the door when they raise concerns.
