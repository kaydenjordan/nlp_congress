 Mr. Chair, chairman, and ranking member, I rise today  on behalf of our oceans and the communities, economies and ecosystems  they support.   My home State of New Jersey boasts a multibillion dollar commercial  and fishing industry. That's 50,000 jobs and $7 billion every year.  Potential spills from oil and gas development imperil every one of  these jobs and every one of those industries. That is 50,000 jobs and  $7 billion a year, not to mention the threat to exacerbating climate  change.   An oil spill could trigger even greater devastation to the nearly  500,000 jobs supported by our State's tourism industry. Visits to the  beautiful shore generates $16.6 billion in wages and adds $5.5 billion  to the State's tax coffers. Too much is at stake.   We cannot auction off our environment. We can't auction off our  economy, and we sure as heck can't auction off our future to the  highest bidder.   We need to move away from dirty fossil fuels that would forever  change the character of our coasts for the worse. We need to protect  the Atlantic Coast by permanently banning offshore oil and gas  drilling.   Mr. Chairman, we need a concrete plan of action like this because the  climate is changing in a way that threatens our national security, or  ecosystems, and our economy.   Thanks to H.R. 1941--and I commend the sponsors--the Coastal and  Marine Economies Protection Act, we are acting to permanently protect  the Atlantic from offshore oil and gas drilling right now. I thank the  chairman, Mr. Chair, and the ranking member for this bill.
