That is what the President called  Dr. Anthony Fauci and the public health experts in the Federal  Government.   The President said:         People are tired of COVID. I have the biggest rallies I've       ever had. And we have COVID. People are saying: ``Whatever.       Just leave us alone.'' They're tired of it.    Then he added:         People are tired of hearing Fauci and these idiots, all       these idiots who got it wrong.    Those are the words of the President of the United States, Donald  Trump, in the midst of the worst pandemic America has seen in over a  century--220,000 dead and counting.   What lies ahead with this COVID epidemic, which the President is so  tired of hearing about? What have the so-called ``idiots'' told us  about the future of COVID-19? Here is what they have told us: More than  70,450 new coronavirus cases were reported in the United States on  Friday, the highest figure since July 24, according to the New York  Times database. More than 900 new deaths were recorded, and over the  past week, there have been an average of 56,615 cases per day--an  increase of 30 percent from the average 2 weeks earlier.   Is this a political commentary, these facts? No. These are the  numbers and statistics of reality--a reality which President Trump  refuses to acknowledge.   How are we doing when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to  the world? Well, we have five times the infection rate of the nation of  Germany. What is going on here? The great United States of America has  five times the infection rate of Germany?   Well, let's get across the ocean. Let's bring it to this side of the  Atlantic. How are we doing in comparison to the nations here? Well,  let's compare the United States to Canada. The COVID death rate in the  United States is 2\1/2\ times the death rate in Canada.   What does Justin Trudeau know about this epidemic that Donald Trump  did not? He knew that it took leadership to deal with it. He knew that  we had to step up as a nation and gather together all the people of  this country in common purpose to beat back this virus, and he failed  to do it--President Trump failed to do that. He said to the Governors  ``You are on your own. Go out and find protective equipment. Find  ventilators. See what you can do on the open market'' instead of using  the power of the Presidency and the leadership of the Presidency to  help make certain that every American had access to what they needed to  stay safe.   How did he do in setting standards for dealing with this deadly  virus?   First, he denied it was deadly. He argued it was going to go away.  When it gets warm outside, it will go away. It is a hoax. You remember  those statements. And do you remember that incredible press conference  where the President went off on some tangent about disinfectant and  Lysol? It was sickening to think that the leader of the free world  would do that.   How about the example set by the President. To this day, to get this  President to wear a mask is a rare occurrence. And there he was, just  days after being helicoptered out to Walter Reed Hospital, returning to  the White House, making his triumphant balcony scene, standing before  the American people and ripping off his mask just to tell them how  tough he was, how lucky he was. He was really telling the American  people: Don't take this mask business seriously. He can say the words,  but he just mouths them. The fact that you can see his mouth is an  indication that he doesn't believe it. And here we are.   Fortunately, in the early stages of this pandemic, this Congress rose  to the occasion. It was March 26. We called it the CARES Act. It was  indeed a comprehensive effort to deal with the coronavirus, a  comprehensive approach. We imagined all the possibilities, we saw the  economy sinking under our feet, and we came together with a vote of 96  to nothing here in the U.S. Senate--a bipartisan vote of 96 to  nothing--for a bill that we wrote together, Democrats and Republicans  sitting together.   It was an amazing day, and I am glad we did it, but there was one  clear shortcoming. We assumed when we passed the CARES Act that, come  the end of July and first part of August, this crisis would be behind  us. It isn't. At the end of July, for example, the Federal supplement  of unemployment insurance ran out for millions of Americans. In the  first part of August, the loans to small businesses dried up as well.   What has happened since? Well, on the other side of the Rotunda, in  the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 5 months ago--5  months ago--passed her Heroes Act. It was $3 trillion--comparable to  the first effort. She sent it to the Republican leader of the Senate,  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, for him to do his part. It is a  bicameral legislature. His part would require coming up with an  alternative and taking that to conference.   Did he do that? No. He refused to acknowledge it and mocked day after  day after day the efforts of Speaker Pelosi, questioning whether they  were enough or sincere or too political, on and on and on. Did he pass  his own measure? No.   Then negotiations started between the President, his White House  representatives, Speaker Pelosi, and Leader Schumer. They invited  Senator McConnell, head of the Republicans in the Senate, and Kevin  McCarthy, head of the Republicans in the House, to join in this  bipartisan negotiation. McConnell and McCarthy declined. They would not  even sit in the chairs during negotiations. In Senator McConnell's  case, he simply came to the floor on a daily basis to mock every effort  to respond to this COVID-19.   Well, this is not a news bulletin, but we are 2 weeks away from the  election, and guess what we are going to do on the floor of the Senate  today. We are going to entertain a new idea by Senator McConnell of how  to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. It turns out that it is a scant  list of his priorities. Not surprisingly, the first priority is an  issue he has called his redline on the floor over and over again--to  give immunity from liability to businesses that fail to take the  necessary steps to protect their employees and their customers from the  spread of this deadly virus. That is his first priority. He has said  that. Even before the first issue was raised as to what would be  included in this, the first thing that Senator McConnell insisted on  was protecting these businesses.   How do the American people feel about that? Well, they are pretty  clear. They believe if you put that immunity in place, that many  businesses won't do what they need to do to protect their employees and  customers. They worry that this gets them off the hook instead of  putting the responsibility clearly on their shoulders.   The good news is the overwhelming majority of businesses that I know  are really trying to do the right thing. The bad news is they are not  sure what that is. They hear about CDC guidelines that are ignored and  mocked by the President, and they hear about the possibility of other  standards that will be used.   We have had hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee when a  Texas businessman with a string of convenience stores, I think, came to  us and in good faith said: I don't know where to turn for a standard of  care. What am I supposed to do if I want to protect everyone coming  into my store--employees and customers alike?   I thought his statement was genuine. I really believed him, and I  still do. But it is no excuse for what we have failed to do here. We  have failed to come up with a national standard to protect people from  the spread of this virus.   Instead, Senator McConnell comes to the floor and says: If you can  find any standard by any level of government, it is good enough. You  are off the hook. That is no way to lead in the midst of a deadly  pandemic.   It is not the only issue. There are many others. Take a look at what  is missing in Senator McConnell's proposal. There is no new funding  when it comes to State and local governments. Remember the phrase  ``defund the police''? You heard it from the rightwing about the  leftwing of American politics wanting to defund the police. Well,  Senator McConnell's action will  [[Page S6307]]  defund police at State and local levels because these units of  government won't have the resources to hire the policemen they need,  the law enforcement officials they need, nor the firefighters, nor the  teachers, nor the healthcare workers. But that is priority one for  Senator McConnell: no help--no help for State and local governments for  fear that you might actually send money to a Democratic mayor or a  Democratic Governor. Spare me. That fire is not looking for party  registration; it is looking for kindling to light the fire of  infection.   Now, on housing, well, how does the McConnell proposal deal with  housing? No funding--no funding for housing or rental assistance.   Now, on the stimulus checks--$1,200 stimulus checks. I listened to  talk radio back in Chicago, and people are wondering: Is it possible we  are going to see a $1,200 check? Well, you won't see it in Senator  McConnell's proposal. There are no direct stimulus payments.   How about unemployment benefits? The Federal unemployment benefits  that expired on July 31 were $600 a week over the State amount,  whatever it might be. Some people may have made more in the process  than they did at work, but most were struggling to get by. If Members  of the Senate had not been in touch with real America in a while, they  may think that folks with these checks were binging on Netflix and  eating chocolate-covered cherries night and day. That is not the case  that I saw back in Illinois. People who had lost their jobs, even at  the time they received these unemployment checks, were still struggling  to pay for the mortgage, pay for the rent, pay for the car, keep up  with the credit card bills, and put food on the table.   So what does Senator McConnell propose that we do? He proposes we cut  in half that amount--to $300 a week. I guess back in Kentucky it is a  little bit different world, at least the way he sees it, but where I  live, that means a pretty dramatic cut in survival pay--survival pay-- for people who have lost their jobs.   On the healthcare side, this is the one that troubles me the most.  Couldn't we all agree that we don't test enough for the COVID-19 virus  in America? There are about 1 million people tested a day. Public  health officials say: Well, you need at least 4 million. Others say:  But if you truly want to reopen the economy and reopen the schools, you  need 14 million a day. So you would guess that anything we pass would  really zero in on testing to find out those who are positive, to do the  contact tracing to warn those who may have been exposed, and to try to  contain the virus.   So let's take a look at what Senator McConnell thinks about the  priority of testing. There is $16 billion for testing. How much did the  Democrats--Nancy Pelosi--propose? She proposed $75 billion. And let me  add that the McConnell bill provides no funding for hospitals or  healthcare clinics and no dedicated funding for nursing homes, where we  know the populations are so vulnerable. When it comes to the reality of  what we are facing in this COVID-19 pandemic, the McConnell bill, which  is coming before us this afternoon, is deficient in testing at a time  when we are facing so many infections.   On nutrition, the McConnell bill says that there will be no SNAP  benefit increases or funding for food banks and, on education, provides  $105 billion for education stabilization funds. Two-thirds of the K-12  funds will be held until schools provide a reopening plan and, of  course, the voucher program.   On postal assistance, the McConnell proposal alters the language in  the original legislation to change the borrowing authority. The Postal  Service is doing its best, and I thank the men and women who are  engaged in it. We should do more than thank them. We ought to fund them  and give them a helping hand.   So what it boils down to is this: If this is a real pandemic, if we  want to believe the public health experts--whom the President has  called ``idiots,'' like Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been my friend for  20 years--if we want to believe the public health experts, we need to  address this in a serious manner as we did last March in passing the  CARES Act. This is not a time for people to cover their backsides  politically. It is a time to remember that the American people need our  help more than ever. A halfhearted and half-inspired effort to do this  will not answer the call.   We need to stand as a nation on a bipartisan basis. How does it  start? It starts when Democrats and Republicans sit at the same table,  which has not happened. It starts when we agree--both parties agree--on  what the priorities must be, and it starts when we stop the speeches  and start with real action to pass legislation like the CARES Act,  which passed 96 to nothing on this floor. It is time to take this  deadly virus and epidemic seriously.   I yield the floor.
