 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a moment, I am going to propound a  unanimous consent request. But before I do so, I want to make some  brief observations.   Earlier this month, Democrats passed their extreme partisan  reconciliation bill--a bill that President Biden signed into law. When  the Senate was considering the bill, I introduced an amendment to  ensure that illegal aliens would not receive the $1,400 taxpayer  payments provided in the bill. Every single Democrat in this body voted  against that amendment. It failed by a single vote. If even one Senate  Democrat had voted for that amendment, it would have passed.   At the time, Senator Durbin incorrectly told this Chamber that no  illegal aliens would receive stimulus checks under this bill. It was  clear then, and it is even more clear now, that that statement was very  much in error, as even Senator Durbin has admitted.   Last Thursday, I gave my Democratic colleagues a chance for a do- over, once it became clear that there was a very substantial number of  illegal aliens who would be receiving these checks. Unfortunately, the  Democrats objected again and put themselves on record that they are  just fine with millions of illegal immigrants getting taxpayer stimulus  checks.   There has been some debate as to the exact number, but, just this  week, the Center for Immigration Studies released an economic report  that catalogued that we are indeed talking about millions of illegal  immigrants who are receiving these checks.   At the same time we were debating this partisan reconciliation bill,  the Senate considered another amendment, which I had introduced and  Senator Cassidy had introduced, to prevent the payments from going to  criminals currently incarcerated in prison. Again, unfortunately and  astonishingly, every single Democrat in this Chamber voted against it.  It failed by a single vote. If even one Democrat had demonstrated the  common sense to say violent criminals who are currently in prison right  now, today, shouldn't be getting $1,400 taxpayer stimulus checks, that  amendment would have passed. But every Democrat lined up in a party- line partisan vote to say no.   Today, I am going to give Democrats another chance at a do-over to  recognize that that extreme position is a position, frankly, none of us  could go home and explain to our constituents without being laughed at,  even in the bluest of States. And I am going to give an opportunity in  this instance for Democrats to vote on stopping the funds going to  criminals currently incarcerated and sending those funds instead to the  Crime Victims Fund, a program that is run by the Department of Justice  to compensate victims of crime.   So this is a choice the Democrats have: Do you want $1,400 checks  going to criminals in prison, or do you want instead to direct those  funds to the victims of crime that have suffered at the hands of those  criminals?   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 928,  introduced earlier today. I further ask that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon, I guess,  demonstrates the principle that hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays  to virtue, because the Senator from Oregon suggests that somehow  payments to people who are not criminals will be delayed if we don't  pay criminals in prison. That claim, on the face of it, is absurd.   The Federal prisons are administered by the Bureau of Prisons.  Government may not be good at everything, but I feel quite confident  that the Federal Government can produce a list of currently  incarcerated prisoners. I know the States can   The IRS, likewise, is perfectly capable of recognizing whether it is  mailing checks to prisoners in prison. This is not whether you have  ever been convicted of a crime. It is, Are you sending the checks to  Sing Sing? If so, don't send it.   The claim that somehow Joe Six-Pack at home is not getting his check  because we don't want to send checks to prisoners is demonstrably  untrue.   The Senator from Oregon also claims Republicans oppose stimulus  checks, when he knows that is simply not the case. As he noted, this  body overwhelmingly passed bipartisan COVID relief five times last  year. It is only when Senate Democrats took the majority that  bipartisan legislation ended because the Democrats decided to push a  hard partisan bill instead.   A clean bill providing relief checks would have passed with an  overwhelming bipartisan majority in this body, and the Senator from  Oregon knows that.   We have now discovered, though, that given a straight-up choice  between sending checks to criminals in prison versus sending checks to  the victims of crime, Senate Democrats stand with the criminals.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 929     Mr. President, I am going to suggest an even narrower  situation. Perhaps we can't agree on victims of crime. How about  murderers?   We just had a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee on gun  violence. We saw a horrific mass murder in Colorado. Can't we agree  that murderers shouldn't get checks--$1,400 stimulus checks--from the  taxpayers? Let's take the money going to murderers and put it in the  crime victims task force fund instead.   And so, Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S.  929, introduced earlier today. I further ask that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, you know, it could be hard in these partisan  days to know what the truth is. Both sides yell at each other. They  insult each other. It is hard to know who is telling the truth.   I ask the folks at home who are listening to this debate to exercise  a little bit of common sense. The Senator from Oregon just told you the  Federal Government has no idea who are murderers currently in prison. I  want to suggest that doesn't make any sense.   I feel quite confident the Department of Justice could produce a list  of currently incarcerated murderers in Federal prisons within 24 hours.  I am absolutely certain the State of Texas could produce that list. I  am confident the State of Connecticut could produce the list of the  murderers currently in Connecticut prisons. I am even confident the  State of Oregon could produce a list of the murderers convicted of  homicide currently incarcerated in the State of Oregon.   The claim that we don't know who the murderers are who are in our  prisons serving time for murder--it doesn't pass the laugh test.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 930    Mr. President, so let's see if we could agree in a different area-- rapists, those who committed sexual assault.   Again, these are public records and the Department of Justice and  every State criminal justice authority have a list of all the rapists.  How about let's not send $1,400 checks to rapists? Take the money and  give it to the Crime Victims Fund so it can go to victims of rape.   Here is a choice for Democrats: Do you want to send money to the  rapists or the victims of sexual assault? This ought to be a hundred- or-nothing choice.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 930,  introduced earlier today. I further ask that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, once again, the Senator from Oregon has said  something that is demonstrably false and that he knows is false, which  is that he has suggested that I opposed sending stimulus checks to the  American citizens, to law-abiding citizens. I not only didn't oppose  it, I voted for it. Republicans supported it. He knows that. That is a  red herring.    He just read a statement from the IRS Agency saying they get a list  of prisoners from the Bureau of Prisons, and he said: But we don't know  the crime.   The first unanimous consent request I put before this body is,  everyone on that list in the Bureau of Prisons, don't send them a  check. That doesn't delay your check. If you are not looking at bars,  if you are not in a jail cell that is 5 feet by 10 feet, this doesn't  affect you. This only affects criminals currently in prison.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 931    Mr. President, let's try one more time. The Democrats have objected  to not sending checks to criminals in prison. The Democrats have  objected to not sending checks to murderers in prison. The Democrats  have objected to not sending checks to rapists in prison.   Let's try a group that I think may be the lowest of the low, which is  child molesters. I spent a lot of years in law enforcement, and I think  there is no more horrific offense than those who commit crimes of  violence and sexual assault against kids. When I was solicitor general  of Texas, the cases where people sexually abused kids I thought should  be in Dante's Ninth Circle of Hell.   So here is a chance for some bipartisan agreement. Can't we all agree  that the Federal Government shouldn't send $1,400 checks to the child  molesters in prison right now for molesting  [[Page S1700]]  kids? And before the Senator from Oregon says, ``Who knows who the  child molesters are,'' well, the Department of Justice and every State  department of justice knows who the child molesters are in their  prisons.   Let's take the money that the Democrats want to send to child  molesters, and let's take it from the child molesters and give it to  the victims of crimes, the kids who have been molested. This is as  simple a legislative choice as I can imagine.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 931,  introduced earlier today. I further ask that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, there is an old saying that you don't learn  anything from the second kick of a mule.   The first time the Senator from Oregon said that I sought to disrupt  stimulus payments, perhaps he did so because he didn't know my views on  that topic, but he has since been corrected that I voted for stimulus  payments to American citizens in the time of economic crisis and didn't  oppose them. So he is now repeatedly stating falsehoods, knowing that  they are false.   You know, all of us were there when Joe Biden gave his inauguration  speech making a call to unity, making a call to healing, and there was  a chance we could have done that. On COVID relief, you don't have to  ask theoretically. Last year, when Republicans had control of the  Senate, we passed five bipartisan COVID relief bills, coming together  with overwhelming bipartisan majorities.   The Democrats decided, when they took control, they didn't want to do  that. You want to know just how far out of touch and how radical  today's Democratic Party is? We have seen the Democrats now say we will  send taxpayer stimulus checks to millions of illegal immigrants. We  have seen Democrats say we will send the taxpayer stimulus to criminals  in prison. We have seen the Democrats say we will send the taxpayer  stimulus checks to murderers in prison. We have seen them say we will  send the checks to rapists in prison. And we now just saw them say we  will send the checks to child molesters in prison.   It should be the essence of common sense to say don't give this money  to violent criminals; give it to victims of crime instead. In a sane  world, that would be a hundred-to-nothing proposition.   I challenge any one of you in the brightest of blue States: Go home  and explain to your constituents that you refused to take the money  from child molesters and give it to the victims of that crime. That is  the position of every Democrat in this Chamber because every single  Democratic Senator was the deciding vote rejecting the amendment on the  floor.   It is unfortunate just how extreme the hard left is right now, but it  is far out of touch with the American people, and it has long abandoned  any semblance of common sense.   I yield the floor    Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon suggested that the  concern of the Democrats is to get taxpayer funds to needy people.  People currently incarcerated are not needy. The Senator from Oregon  said we need to help Americans struggling with rent. You know what?  People currently incarcerated pay zero in rent. They don't have rent  costs.   So the argument of the Democrats is: We don't know who the criminals  are who are currently in jail. That does not comport with reality, and  any fairminded person watching this knows that.   I yield the floor.
