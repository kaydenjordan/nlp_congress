 Madam Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this  resolution to advance the cause of full and equal rights for all women.  I do so for my 1-year-old granddaughter for whom I deeply hope that,  when she reaches the age of understanding, the ERA will be as enshrined  in our Constitution as is the right to vote today. I also do so as a  proud citizen of my Hawaii.   On March 22, 1972, when the U.S. Senate sent the ERA to the States,  it was early in the morning in Hawaii; but by shortly after noon that  same day, our legislature voted for ratification, the first State to do  so.   For my country and Hawaii and for all of our women leaders who led  this fight, past and present, I proudly join my colleagues in voting  for the ERA.
