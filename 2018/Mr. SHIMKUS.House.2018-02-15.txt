 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the upcoming  centennial anniversaries of the statehood and independence of the three  Baltic States.   This year marks 100 years since the restoration of the state of  Lithuania on February 16, and the proclamations of independence of  Estonia on February 24, and Latvia on November 18. Thus, in the  aftermath of World War I, in 1918, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia  declared their independence and marked their beginnings as new  republics and their emergence as modern democratic societies.   Despite a history of turmoil, the people of the Baltics have always  stood up for their values and worked to maintain their independence,  freedom, and sovereignty.   Today, 100 years later, the three Baltic States are strong allies of  NATO and full-fledged members of the European Union. They are committed  to making the transatlantic community an area of cooperation,  partnership, and prosperity. The United States is proud to be strong  allies of the Baltic States, and our nations stand together to defend  our shared values of freedom and democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I extend sincere congratulations and send best wishes to  Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia on their centennial observations and  anniversary                            ____________________
