 Mr. Speaker, let me thank Congressman Horsford for  yielding this evening, and I thank him for his extraordinary  leadership.    Elijah Cummings was my friend. Nearly every legislative day for the  past 15 years, we talked about every subject you can imagine. Some of  it consisted of small talk, but very often it consisted of serious  conversations about our families and about our communities.   So, on behalf of my family and on behalf of the 750,000 people of the  First Congressional District of North Carolina, I extend condolences to  the Cummings family and to the good people of Baltimore.   Mr. Speaker, several years ago, I shared with Congressman Cummings a  very sad situation in my district involving an African American  attorney who had suffered a debilitating stroke and was having  financial problems. Immediately--immediately--Mr. Cummings said: I have  great affection for Black lawyers who have served their community, and  I am going to send him some money. And he did.   From time to time, I would see Mr. Cummings on national television on  the talk shows. I would come back to the floor on Monday night or  Tuesday night and I would sit next to him. I would compliment Mr.  Cummings about his appearances on television and how he handled  himself. I recall one day he told me that every minute that he is on  television, he spent 1 hour preparing for that 1 minute. He was one for  preparation.   I sat next to Congressman Cummings as he cast his last floor vote  several weeks ago. He didn't know it was his last, but it was. He was  seated right over where Ms. Clarke is seated right now. As his staff  assisted in getting him out of the chair, he looked at me that day and  said: ``I'm so sick. I love you, man.''   I say to you tonight, Congressman Cummings: I love you; we love you;  and America loves you.   Mr. Speaker, we celebrate a life well-lived. Elijah Eugene Cummings  belongs to the ages.   Rest in peace, my brother, rest in peace.
