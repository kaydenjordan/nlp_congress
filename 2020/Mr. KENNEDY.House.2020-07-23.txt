 Mr. Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart this morning to  remember our colleague, John Lewis.   He was a hero to me. He was my friend. I am going to miss his smile,  his soft voice that could quickly become a bellow. I will miss his  hugs, his eternal optimism, and his hope that we would heed his advice  and ``keep the faith.''   John had a long and special relationship with my family, with my  grandmother in particular. They went through a lot together. They  survived a lot. They witnessed a lot.   She asked me to read a letter here today in his memory. She writes:         Dear friends,        Our hearts are heavy, but also grateful for the gift of       John Lewis, a man who devoted his life to making gentle the       life of this world.        John's loving demeanor enveloped a mighty determination and       passion for justice, equality, and the realization of his       dream for the ``Beloved Community.''        A young man full of fire and ideals, qualities that he       never lost, he was a trusted voice to my husband, Robert       Kennedy, relied upon, first, as a student demonstrator and,       later, as a campaign aide.        Activist, lawmaker, champion, he was also a teacher and a       cherished friend.        He and Bobby learned from one another. They listened, they       understood, they acted.        As a Freedom Rider, John was badly beaten at a bus stop in       Montgomery, Alabama, in 1961. From the basement of the First       Baptist Church where John, Martin Luther King Jr., and Ralph       Abernathy sought refuge, they called Bobby asking for       protection from a crowd of armed White supremacists       surrounding the church. President Kennedy sent in the       National Guard.        In Indianapolis, the night we lost Dr. King, John       influenced Bobby's decision to ignore Mayor Lugar's plea to       cancel a rally, instead seeking to comfort and seeking       comfort from a devastated crowd of Black supporters.  [[Page H3697]]         As the youngest speaker at the March on Washington, his was       a clarion call to end racial segregation and discrimination       in the United States. Over half a century later, as unrest       over systemic violence against Black Americans gripped our       Nation in recent weeks, John reinforced what he knew was       true:        ``You cannot stop the call of history,'' the Congressman       said. ``You may use troopers. You may use fire hoses and       water, but it cannot be stopped. There cannot be any turning       back. We have come too far. We have made too much progress to       stop now and go back.''        John was witness to our Nation's history; he shaped it and       his legacy will forever be part of that history. When I think       of John and Bobby, I am reminded of Stephen Spender's poem,       ``The Truly Great.''       . . . those who in their lives fought for life,      Who wore at their hearts the fire's centre.      Born of the sun, they travelled a short while toward the sun,      And left the vivid air signed with their honour.        Sincerely,        Ethel Kennedy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his leadership on  this bill and for the support of this amendment.   Madam Speaker, in 1620, 400 years ago, the Pilgrims settled on  Wampanoag land in Plymouth, Massachusetts. For literally four  centuries, the Mashpee Wampanoag people have been fighting for their  sovereignty, for their land, and for their survival. And for  generations, they have been met with resistance from a government that  should be protecting and empowering them.   In the last few months, Madam Speaker, their fight has arrived at a  crossroads created by a Trump administration that has treated Tribes  with nothing but contempt since the day of his inauguration.   Because of decisions made by this administration, the Mashpee  Wampanoag's land may be stolen from them again in the coming weeks.   We have a responsibility to do what is right, to learn from the  mistakes of generations before us, to recognize that this land wasn't  land to be discovered or to be taken. It belonged to Tribes like the  Mashpee long before the Pilgrims arrived.   Madam Speaker, we need to pass this amendment to right the wrongs of  the past, to prevent them from becoming the wrongs of the present.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I stand today with my colleagues from  Massachusetts in support of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and in support  of Tribal sovereignty, and I ask my colleagues to pass this amendment.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
