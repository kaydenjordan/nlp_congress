 Mr. Speaker, today I would like to congratulate the  Shakopee High School wrestling team, who repeated as class 3A State  champions for the second year in a row.   Congratulations to the wrestlers for the hard work that went into  preparing for this perfect season. The dedication they have  demonstrated is unparalleled, and their success is well deserved.   Also, thank you to the parents, the coaches, the teachers, and the  mentors who dedicate their time, because they are equally committed to  the team's success and future.   Congratulations to the team, and may they enjoy this moment. They  have earned it.                            ____________________
