 Mr. President, 1 year ago yesterday, on December 6, 2019,  a terrorist attack on the Naval Air Station Pensacola killed three  American servicemen.   While it is appropriate and it has been done to honor each of these  men, I rise today with a solemn purpose of honoring and commemorating  the life, service, and patriotism of one in particular: Navy ENS Joshua  Kaleb Watson of Enterprise, AL, whose promising life and career were  tragically cut short in the terrorist attack a year and 1 day ago  yesterday.   Kaleb was posthumously honored last Friday, receiving the Purple  Heart in a ceremony in Pensacola. I really regret that I could not go  and that I was unable to join his family, but there was also a wreath- laying ceremony at Building 633 where Kaleb was shot and a candlelight  vigil there last night. I know that all were solemn occasions for the  Navy, for the family, and for America.   Kaleb was a rising star. A recent graduate of the Naval Academy,  Kaleb had dreamed of becoming a Navy pilot and had reported to  Pensacola for flight training the week of Veterans Day. Kaleb was  described as a natural leader, a person who put others first and  strived to bring out the best in them.   At the Naval Academy, Kaleb was a small arms instructor, wrestling  coach,  [[Page S7235]]  and captain of the rifle team. In fact, under his leadership, much to  the chagrin of a couple folks in this body, like Senator Reed, the  Academy's rifle team beat Army for the first time in a decade.   Ben Watson, Kaleb's father, said to me once that Kaleb's mission was  to confront evil, to bring the fight to them wherever it took him. He  was willing to risk his life for his country. Kaleb did confront evil  that day, and he made the ultimate sacrifice.   Unfortunately, that was not how Kaleb intended to serve his country.  It was not what Kaleb's parents expected when he joined the Navy.  Kaleb's father put it rather bluntly:         We never thought he would die in Florida.    Kaleb Watson was the officer on deck at the Naval Air Station  Pensacola on the morning of December 6, 2019. Consequently, he was one  of the first people the shooter encountered. Kaleb was shot at least  five times that day. Heavily wounded, he made his way out to flag down  first responders, gave them an accurate description of the shooter that  ultimately led to the shooter being killed. Unfortunately, later that  day, Kaleb died of his wounds while in the hospital.   The Navy conducted an investigation into the incident and concluded  the primary cause of the attack was the Saudi shooter's self- radicalization. However, the report also goes on to note numerous  deficiencies in many areas, some of which contributed to the attack and  others which could have deterred the attack or mitigated the  consequences. In other words, things could have been different that  day. Things should have been different that day.   We lost two other young men, Airman Mo Haitham from Florida and  Airman Apprentice Cameron Walters of Georgia, and 11 more individuals  were wounded. That has happened far too many times. Too many Americans  have lost their lives to shooters on U.S. bases on U.S. soil.   The Pensacola attack was the second shooting at a military base in 3  days. On December 3, 2019, a shooting at the Pearl Harbor Naval  Shipyard in Hawaii left two people dead and a third wounded. There have  been several other shootings at U.S. military installations, including  a mass shooting in 2009 at Fort Hood in Killeen, TX. That shooting  claimed 13 lives and left another 30 injured.   Five years later, another shooting happened at Fort Hood when a  gunman went on a shooting spree, killing 3 people and injuring 14  before killing himself. In 2013, 12 workers at the Washington Navy Yard  right here in our Nation's Capital were killed by a military  contractor, who was later killed by security officials. In 2015, two  military installations in Chattanooga, TN, were attacked by a gunman  who killed four people before he was shot by police.   There have been investigative reports about all of those shootings,  and there have been recommendations in each one of the reports.  Everybody shook their head and said: We have got to do better. We can't  continue to allow this to happen.   What we see from the Pensacola report we received just recently is  that many of those recommendations were never followed, especially with  regard to planning, training, and assessment of response plans for  situations just like the one that occurred in Pensacola, FL. That is  simply inexcusable.   We have young men and women every year, every day, every week, every  month that volunteer to put their lives on the line for this country,  never dreaming that their life may be put on the line within the  security of the confines of a U.S. military base on U.S. soil--not  overseas, not as part of some overseas terrorist attack, but right here  where they should be most secure.   Ben Watson and his wife Sheila have made it their mission to do  everything they can to prevent losing more of our sons and daughters in  this way. I think this body ought to do the same.   Every year, we have nominations. We make nominations, and we get the  appointments back, sending those young men and women to the academies  who will then go to those bases. We have a responsibility for that, as  well as our overall responsibility to the men and women in uniform.   This year, I asked for--and the conference committee included in the  final version of the NDAA--language requiring the Secretary of Defense  to implement, within 90 days, all applicable security and emergency  response recommendations to protect our military installations and  language requiring the Secretary of Defense to ensure that each  installation conducts or develops a plan to conduct live emergency  response training with first responders.   At a couple of hearings, including one just last week, I asked Navy  leadership at an Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee hearing for  their commitment. It is not the first time I had brought it up, but I  knew it was going to be the last hearing, and I knew that this NDAA was  hopefully going to include this language, but sometimes, the language  is just not enough. I asked for their commitment to ensure that these  long overdue steps are taken and accomplished. They, of course, gave me  those assurances and that commitment.   There are thousands of important provisions in the NDAA that  hopefully will come to the floor very soon, but none--none--of those  provisions are more important than those that ensure we do everything  we can to keep our servicemembers and their families, who live and work  on our bases, safe from attacks like these.   As the Navy itself said in the Pensacola report, talking about  security manning--and I quote from the report, The ``[Department of the  Navy] must abandon minimum manning thresholds designed to protect  physical assets and to meet ineffective response times. Instead,  installations must be manned to rapidly respond with a preponderance of  force at any time to preserve our most precious asset, our personnel.  Increased security force manning enables presence, deterrence,  assurance, and enhanced response''--our most precious asset, our  personnel.   Well, as a father of three and grandfather of two, I understand how  precious our children are to our families.   As a member of the Armed Services Committee for the past 2 years, I  have seen firsthand how precious our men and women in uniform are to  this country, and I have seen this body rise to the occasion to  understand our fiduciary responsibilities that we have to those men and  women who protect and defend us every day.   I had the privilege of visiting with some of the folks in Afghanistan  and Iraq and working with many more here in the United States. Wherever  they are serving, we owe them our best because we owe them our freedom.   I want to thank the Watson family--Ben, Sheila, their son Adam--for  their patriotism in supporting Kaleb in his dream to become a Navy  pilot, and I want to extend again my sincerest condolences for his  untimely death.   With the Watsons, however, I want to encourage this body to hold the  Navy to the commitments that they made to me last week and to insist  that the entire Department of Defense follow its recommendations for  protecting our military installations from within--protect them from  future attacks from within.   Although I will be leaving this body in a few weeks, I urge all of my  colleagues to take up the baton to do our congressional oversight duty  like our lives depend on it because there are lives which depend on it,  and if their lives depend on it, our lives depend upon on it.   Everyone should take up that mantle. Everyone should do all that they  can to preserve and protect the American service men and women who  protect us. They are our most precious asset, our personnel.   For their sakes and for their families, let's do this thing. Let's  get this NDAA passed and then hold them to it in this next Congress.   I yield the floor.
