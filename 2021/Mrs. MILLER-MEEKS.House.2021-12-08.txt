 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from  South Dakota for yielding me time to speak today.   Iowa's farmers, ranchers, and producers know the value of a hard  day's work. For years, they have endured challenges beyond their  control. Even though I am a doctor, I know of no work more demanding  than birthing calves in the middle of winter and helping them to  survive.    Natural disasters such as fires, drought, and derechos have created  significant market disruptions.   I was proud to be a cosponsor of Congressman Johnson's Cattle  Contract Library Act to give cattlemen access  [[Page H7490]]  to the most accurate data to make the best decisions possible for their  families and their business in the face of these conditions and provide  more transparency in the markets.   For months, I have been calling for increased transparency in our  cattle markets to help both producers and consumers. I was proud to  introduce the bipartisan Meat Packing Special Investigator Act to take  on anticompetitive practices and give producers a fair shake and  strictly enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act.   I was also proud to help introduce the Cattle Price Discovery and  Transparency Act, which aims to return fairness to the cattle  marketplace dominated by four major meatpackers.   It is crucial for Iowa's producers that there is fairness and  transparency in our cattle industry. I thank Congressmen Johnson and  Cuellar for their incredible work on this issue. I urge all of my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important legislation, H.R. 5609.
