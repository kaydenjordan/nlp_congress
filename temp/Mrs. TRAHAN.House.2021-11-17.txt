 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Build Back  Better Act.   Together with the historic infrastructure investments signed into law  by President Biden earlier this week, working families like the one I  grew up in will be able to get back on their feet and succeed in an  economy that finally works for them.   Now, I have talked about my childhood on the floor of the people's  House before. My dad was a union ironworker, and like his union  brothers and sisters have done for decades, he worked long, hard hours  to provide for my three sisters and me. When there wasn't work for him  at home in Massachusetts, he would travel out of State erecting bridges  and buildings in New York, Maine, and other places, sometimes for  months at a time.   As a first generation American, a union job with benefits was better  than most had, and it is certainly the reason I am standing here today.  But the demands of my dad's job placed limitations on what my mom could  do for work. Despite the wages and benefits secured by his union, my  parents couldn't afford childcare for four girls. So my mom picked up  jobs where she could to help make ends meet. Whether it was clerical  work, cleaning homes, hostessing, or caring for kids, she did anything  and everything possible to pay the bills while also making sure she was  home to care for us when my dad was away.   Here is the thing: My family's story is not unique, not in the  slightest. In fact, it is a story shared by millions of working  families across our country who show up to work each day but don't have  the support they need to get ahead.   My mom's story is one that is shared by millions of working moms who  want nothing more than to return to work and support their families but  can't because the math doesn't work, giving them no choice but to stay  at home and care for their families instead.   Mr. Speaker, under President Biden's leadership we are going to flip  that script.   The infrastructure package he signed into law earlier this week will  create millions of jobs with family sustaining wages and benefits by  repairing our roads, our bridges, our water systems, and more.   But creating millions of jobs only works if workers are ready to fill  them. That is why we are also working to pass the Build Back Better Act  which will make unprecedented investments in working families. Families  that continue to be the backbone of our country that we all have the  honor of representing.   By expanding access to quality childcare, providing paid family and  medical leave, establishing universal pre-K, and making home care  affordable for our seniors, this legislation will propel parents-- especially our working moms--back into the workforce and full  participation in our economy.   By lowering healthcare costs and driving down prescription drug  prices, the Build Back Better Act will ensure that families no longer  have to choose between their health and their ability to put food on  the table. By cutting taxes for low-income and middle-class Americans  and extending the child tax credit payment that has served as a  lifeline for so many, this package will keep money in families'  pockets.   Passage of the Build Back Better Act will ensure that no one is left  behind as we defeat COVID and rebuild our economy. That is why these  provisions are supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans-- Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike. Like President Biden,  they recognize that when we invest in working families, America wins.   Now, if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to hear  more about why they should support this bill, please let me know. My  mom, Linda Loureiro, is happy to call you and tell you what the Build  Back Better Act would have done for her and moms like yours 40 years  ago and why we need to get it done for her children and her  grandchildren today.                            ____________________
