 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I have been  listening daily to heartbreaking stories from real people about their  health challenges and what the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would  mean to them.   People like Peter Morley, who survived cancer and now lives with  lupus--he won't be able to afford his lifesaving infusions if repeal  happens.   For Baby Theo, born with two holes and an enlarged kidney, the return  of lifetime caps would mean the loss of insurance for him.   And Red Raccoon, an Iraq war veteran suffering from PTSD, he relies  on Medicaid to supplement the inadequate VA system.   Each of them and millions more will suffer if repeal or replace goes  forward. I believe we are a greater, more caring nation than this. I  believe we can, we shall, we must do better.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking  member for yielding to me and for her leadership on this committee and  in so many other ways.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this resolution. My  friends on the other side of the aisle keep talking about what this  bill does, but let me tell you what it does not do.   I want to be absolutely clear that this rule does not say that  arbitration is bad for consumers, and it does not say that consumers  can't use arbitration. The only thing that the CFPB's rule says is that  financial institutions cannot force consumers to waive their right to  participate in class action lawsuits and only use arbitration. This  protects an individual customer's rights. This is critically important  because the evidence shows that consumers receive a great deal more  relief from class action litigation against institutions than they do  in arbitration.   So my friends on the other side of the aisle always say that they  believe in consumer choice and customer choice and that customers  should be able to choose what is best for them and not be dictated to  by this Congress, but mandatory arbitration clauses restrict choice  for consumers. They prohibit  [[Page H6271]]  consumers from choosing class action lawsuits over arbitration.     MALONEY of New York. The CFPB's rule would restore  this consumer choice, further empowering people, customers, empowering  them to make their own decisions for themselves. This should be  welcomed by any American. This should be welcomed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution.
