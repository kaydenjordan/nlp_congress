 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I stand on the floor of the U.S. House of  Representatives as the clock keeps ticking for us to act on behalf of  DREAMers and DACA recipients.   Tonight, this House approved a continuing resolution funding  government to continue to stay open for another 4 weeks that did not  include a resolution to the dire conditions faced by DREAMers and DACA  recipients. It did not include funding for community based health  clinics, and it certainly did not adequately support the men and women  in our Armed Forces.   Yet, Mr. Speaker, as we continue to move forward, many Members of  this House have worked diligently throughout the months to address the  issues faced by DREAMers and DACA recipients. In fact, they have  engaged in bipartisan legislative solutions. And we currently have  three bipartisan bills that could have been voted on today on this very  same floor of the House of Representatives. I guarantee you that if  they would have been brought here to this floor and they would have  given us the opportunity to vote on them, they would have passed.   Because DREAMers are very popular in America. All polls show that  over 80 percent of Americans across the Nation in different States, in  different cities, want these young people to stay. Once you meet them,  once you see their young faces, their energy, their desire to work and  move forward, their patriotism for America, they win you over.   No other immigration-related issue, I believe, has polled as high as  the support that DREAMers are getting from across the country. Folks  who live in red States and blue States, in districts represented by  Democrats, districts represented by Republicans, feel overwhelmingly  that these young people should stay here; that they should not be  punished and sent back to a country that many of them don't really  know, where they have no connection with family members.   Some may not even speak the language spoken in those countries or be  familiar with the customs in those nations. They feel they are  Americans, and they have contributed tremendously to our Nation. So  these bipartisan efforts and solutions that my colleagues have engaged  in are very important.   Let's begin by talking about the Dream Act, a clean Dream Act, which  is a bipartisan bill led by Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, a  Democrat from California; and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a  Republican from Florida.   This particular bill, the Dream Act, a clean Dream Act, has 200  bipartisan cosponsors, including myself. This is not amnesty. Many have  tried to portray the DREAMers' quest and fight as a fight for amnesty.  This is not amnesty. This particular bill, which has over 200  cosponsors, asks of the DREAMers that in order for them to be eligible  for the Dream Act, that a person needed to have been 18 years of age on  the date of entry, that they must have been physically present in the  U.S. 4 years prior to the enactment of the legislation.   Any applicant could not be convicted of any offense punishable for  more than 1 year, or three or more offenses resulting in 90 days or  more of imprisonment. In other words, they had to have a clean record.   This was just to be considered. Once they were accepted into the  program, they will get a conditional permanent residency status, a  temporary green card. Then to transition to lawful permanent residence  under the Dream Act, a DREAMer needed to do certain things. In other  words, for them to transition from a conditional green card to a  permanent green card, they needed to maintain a clean record for 8  years. They needed to have completed a college degree or 2 years for a  bachelor's degree or higher, or they must have served in the military  for 2 years.   It further asks that they would have to have been employed for at  least 3 years for 75 percent of the time under the conditional  permanent residency status.   In addition to that, only after meeting all of the above, could they  then transition to legal permanent status. So after that, they would  have to wait an additional 5 years for them to be able to apply for  naturalization, citizenship. So they would have to wait in total, from  the time they got their temporary green card to the time they actually  will be eligible to apply for citizenship, a total of 13 years. More  than a decade.   So the campaign to portray the Dream Act or a solution to the  DREAMers and the DACA situation as amnesty is totally false. So 13  years--13 long years--they would have to wait from the minute they got  a temporary green card to the time they will be eligible to apply for  naturalization, citizenship.   So 80 percent of America supports these DREAMers. And this is the  Dream Act, a bipartisan bill that has been around for some time, led by  Republicans and Democrats that did not have a border security provision  to it.   But we heard how the other side of the aisle wanted to address some  of the concerns at the border. A group of bipartisan Members of this  House led by Representative Will Hurd from Texas and Pete Aguilar began  to put together a second proposal, USA Act. And this proposal currently  has 49 bipartisan cosponsors. It came out of efforts put together by a  group called the Problem Solvers.   In this particular proposal, in order for you to be eligible for the  USA Act, a person needed to be at least 18 years of age on the date of  entry and not have been convicted, again, of an offense punishable for  more than 1 year, or any combination of offenses resulting in  imprisonment for more than 1 year. Then the person could transition to  lawful permanent residency.   Again, they had to maintain a clean record for 8 years, and had to  complete a college degree or complete 2 years in a bachelor's degree or  higher postsecondary vocational programs. They must have served in the  military for the entire length of their enlistment contract or been  employed for at least 3 years 80 percent of the time they were under  conditional permanent residency status. Only after meeting all of the  above, could they then transition to legal permanent residency.                                time  2115    Then after 5 additional years, they will have been able to apply for  naturalization.   The USA Act has a border security component unlike the clean Dream  Act.   These bipartisan Members of this House tried to address some of the  concerns of Members from across the aisle who continue to complain and  be seriously concerned about border security. They included directing  Homeland Security to deploy more technology along  [[Page H549]]  the border and to submit a plan to Congress regarding expansion of  vehicle, cargo, and pedestrian inspection lanes on the top 10 high- volume ports of entry.   This last clause in this bill is very important because our ports of  entry are very antiquated and dilapidated. This is precisely where most  of the illegal drugs, illegal guns, and human trafficking enters our  Nation. This particular bill calls for revamping and modernizing these  ports of entry. The USA Act also would add an additional 55 immigration  judges per year over the next 3 fiscal years.   Finally, this bipartisan bill develops a strategy to address the  factors driving migration from Northern Triangle countries in Central  America.   So you have the Dream Act, the clean Dream Act, which many of us  fought for. You have the USA Act, another bipartisan bill that many in  this House fought to put together. But it does not end there.   In addition to these two avenues that could have been taken tonight  here in this House to address the plight of 800,000 DREAMers, the  Senate acted and sent us over an immigration framework of ideas led by  Senators Graham and Durbin, in addition to Senators Michael Bennet,  Jeff Flake, and Cory Gardner, and Senator Bob Menendez from New Jersey.   Under this framework, the eligibility criteria bars DREAMers who have  been convicted of crimes, and they must satisfy any Federal tax  liability that they may have accrued while receiving work authorization  under DACA.   A pathway to citizenship would be 12 years, unlike the other two  proposals that call for 8 years, this is at 12 years, and 2 of which  they could get credit for for their time under DACA.   This proposal, this framework, coming from the Senate also added  additional border security elements which included $1.459 billion for  wall planning, design, and construction, as well as an additional $1.1  billion for tactical infrastructure, software border surveillance  technology, and other equipment.   All three of these bills were crafted under a bipartisan effort by  Members from both sides of the aisle. I think that it is tragic that we  lost another great opportunity tonight to bring any one of those three  bills to this floor to be voted upon by the Members of this House,  particularly since the public sentiment--over 80 percent of America  feels that these young people should stay in our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of Texas,  Congressman Al Green, who is my good friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank  the Congressional Progressive Caucus for allowing and facilitating this  Special Order hour on DREAMers and DACA.    On my previous intervention, I highlighted how we contemplated  tonight, as this House passed a continuing resolution to fund  government, and how for many months we contemplated three pieces of  legislation to address the issues of DACA recipients and DREAMers that  were drafted in a bipartisan way.   As I mentioned earlier, the first one is the clean Dream Act. The  second one, put together by the Problem Solvers Caucus, is the USA Act.   The other Chamber, which is convening right now as I speak to debate  whether or not the government should continue to be funded and to take  up the continuing resolution that we sent over to the other House, as  they debate that, they will realize that none of the three proposals  that I highlighted earlier--the Dream Act, the USA Act, and also the  immigration framework that came over from bipartisan Senators--is  included in that continuing resolution, leaving the DREAMers and DACA  recipients out in the cold, propelling me to once again vote against  the continuing resolution, as I did over 3 weeks ago.  [[Page H551]]    This particular issue impacts 800,000 DREAMers across the Nation, a  population bigger than any one of our congressional districts.   Mr. Speaker, they will have a profound impact on the economy if they  are left out in the cold. According to the Center for American  Progress, my district, the 13th Congressional District in New York  which I represent, will lose more than $155 million in their own local  GDP. My home State, New York, will lose $2.6 billion. This is not chump  change. This is what the numbers show that we will lose.   So this is not a matter to be taken lightly. These young people are  not just a group of folks who will have an important impact on our  economy. They are also having an impact on healthcare. Many of them are  working to serve our senior population. Many of them continue to be  providing services impacting patients across our Nation's healthcare  system.   According to a 2016 survey by groups, including the National  Immigration Law Center and the Center for American Progress, more than  one in five DREAMers also works in the healthcare and educational  industries.   So these young people who are being left out in the cold by this  continuing resolution that is being debated in the Senate right now  work in our hospitals, in our clinics, in our community-based clinics.  They take care of our seniors, our children, those who are perhaps ill  with a catastrophic disease. They also work in our educational system.  So they are productive members of our society.   Let me just say that they are also working very hard to distinguish  themselves in higher education. Every year, an estimated 65,000  undocumented students graduate from high school. About 10,000  undocumented students graduate from college every single year.   Before President Obama announced DACA, these young people faced great  barriers when it came to higher education. We are nowhere close to  where we need to be if 55,000 high school graduates are not pursuing a  higher education.   Let's not forget these students. Let's not forget these DREAMers.  Let's not forget these DACA recipients. We have made a full effort in  the House and in the Senate to have a bipartisan approach to solving  this issue, but yet, once again, the continuing resolution which is  currently, right now, being debated in the Senate chose to leave the  DREAMers out in the cold.   Mr. Speaker, we will continue this fight. I ask the DREAMers not to  be afraid. I ask them not to be deterred, not to be discouraged, not to  dismay. We will continue this fight until they are allowed to stay here  with their families and they can continue to make America a stronger  nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 45 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, January 19, 2018, at  9 a.m.                            ____________________
