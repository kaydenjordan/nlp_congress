 Mr. President, today I wish to add myself as a cosponsor  of S. 720, the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, and urge my colleagues to  support this important legislation in its modified form. I have long  and staunchly opposed the BDS movement and associated efforts to  unfairly isolate Israel in international forums. This legislation will  prevent international entities from imposing their will on U.S.  businesses with regards to their decisions, consistent with U.S. law,  to conduct commerce with our close ally Israel and its citizens.   After carefully examining the proposed changes to the legislation, I  support the amended version of this bill put forward by my colleagues,  Senator Cardin and Senator Portman. This revised version of the  legislation makes meaningful revisions to the original language to  clarify and improve First Amendment protections. Initial concerns that  this bill unintentionally infringed on individuals' First Amendment  rights have now been addressed by these changes, agreed upon earlier  this year, and I feel confident that these modifications safeguard  Americans' constitutional right to free speech.                            ____________________
