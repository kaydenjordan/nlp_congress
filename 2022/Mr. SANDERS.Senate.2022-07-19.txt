 I object.    Mr. President.    Senator Lee raises important issues about the deficit. I  hope very much that he will be able to convince his Republican  colleagues and Democratic colleagues as well that, among many other  reasons, we should vote against this major corporate welfare bill that  is coming down the pike, which will add at least $76 billion to the  deficit. So if we are concerned about the deficit, as Senator Lee is  and many others are, I hope that will be one of the reasons we vote  against this massive corporate welfare bill that we will be considering  later this afternoon.   I hear a lot of concern about the deficit here in the Senate, and I  hear people say: We can't afford to feed hungry children. We can't  afford to deal with climate change. We can't afford to guarantee  healthcare to all. The deficit is very, very large.   Well, we are talking about $76 billion--at least that; maybe more-- which will add to the deficit. So when you consider the deficit, you  might want to also take into account tax breaks and corporate welfare  for large, profitable corporations.   I want to say a few words about this so-called chips bill and what it  says about our national priorities, what it says about our tax  policies, and basically what it says as to whether or not the U.S.  Congress is capable of representing the needs of working families or  whether we are totally beholden to wealthy and powerful corporate  interests and their campaign contributions.   Last week, when I spoke about this issue, I expressed deep concern  that Congress would provide $52 billion to a handful of profitable  corporations in the microchip industry with no strings attached. Here  it is, guys, $52 billion. Well, I stand corrected. As a result of some  new tax-reduction language, the corporate welfare total for the  microchip industry has gone up; it is now at $76 billion. And the  corporate lobbyists working on this bill, like pigs at the trough, are  not yet finished. They want more and more and more. Their needs are  insatiable.   Needless to say, I do not usually quote approvingly from the  editorial page of the Wall Street Journal. They are not my best  friends. In fact, I think I get attacked on that page more than any  other Member of the Congress. But, as you know, a broken clock is right  twice a day, and even the Wall Street Journal got this one right.   Among the many reasons they urged Congress to vote against this bill  is one that I think is very relevant. Let me quote. This is from the  Wall Street Journal editorial page today:         The chip bill isn't needed to compete with China, and it       will set a precedent that other industries will follow.       Anybody who can  [[Page S3355]]       throw up a China competition angle will ask for money. Why       Republicans want to sign up for this is a mystery.    The Wall Street Journal. The point they make is a good one. We should  be clear that over 90 percent of the cell phones used in this country  and over 90 percent of the laptops used in this country are made in  China.   So you pass this bill, and tomorrow we will hear, no doubt, from the  cell phone industry, from the computer laptop industry about how they  need their welfare checks as well. So I think the Wall Street Journal  every once in a while makes a good point, and today they did.   Mr. President, I recently came across a very, very interesting  interview that the CEO of Intel, Mr. Pat Gelsinger, did last Friday on  CNBC's ``Squawk Box,'' and I think in that interview he did tell us  everything we want to know about the American oligarchy, about  corporate arrogance, and the state of American politics. This is what  Mr. Gelsinger said last Friday--Mr. Gelsinger, head of Intel:         My message to congressional leaders is, hey, if I'm not       done with the job, I don't get to go home. Neither should       you.    He is talking to Congress.         Do not go home for August recess until you have passed the       CHIPS Act because I and others in the industry will make       investment decisions, and do you want those investments in       the U.S., or are we simply not competitive enough to do them       here and we need to go to Europe or Asia for those? Get the       job done. Do not go home for August recess without getting       these bills passed.    That is Pat Gelsinger, head of Intel, last Friday.   In other words, Mr. President, the CEO of a major corporation which  made nearly $20 billion in profits last year and a CEO who received a  $179 million compensation package is saying to Congress that if you  don't give my industry, the microchip industry, $76 billion and my  company, it is estimated, some $20- or $30 billion, that despite their  profound love for our country and their respect for American workers  and their understanding of the needs of the U.S. military and the  healthcare industry--despite all of that, in order to make more  profits, they are prepared to go to Europe and Asia.   Now, Mr. President, I am, thankfully, not a lawyer, but that sure  sounds like extortion to me. What Mr. Gelsinger is saying is that if  you don't give the industry a blank check--here is $76 billion--and  they want more, by the way--despite the needs of the military for  advanced microchips--and we hear that from the military--despite the  needs of the medical industry for advanced microchips, despite the  entire needs of the American economy for advanced microchips, the  industry is threatening to abandon this country and move abroad.  Patriotic people, no doubt. Clearly, lovers of America.   Mr. Gelsinger says we should stay in session, if necessary, through  August in order to pass his legislation. Well, I think we might want to  stay in session through August but not necessarily to pass his  legislation, because what I hear from the people in Vermont and people  all across this country is that the job they want done is not a massive  handout to large, profitable corporations; the job they want Congress  to do is, for a change, to protect the American working class, our  middle class, and the needs of the most vulnerable people in this  country.   What I hear is that the American people want us to guarantee  healthcare to every man, woman, and child, as every other major country  on Earth does.   What I hear is that the American people think it is absurd that some  of the wealthiest people in this country and largest corporations don't  pay a nickel in Federal taxes and that we should demand that those  loopholes be ended.   What I hear is that the American people want us to deal with the  existential threat of climate change so that the young people of this  country can actually have a planet they can grow up with in a healthy  way.   What I hear from the elderly people in this country, in my State, is  they can't make it on the Social Security benefits they are receiving  now; they want to raise those benefits.   What I hear from the people back home is they want Congress to do the  job and protect a woman's right to control her own body, they want to  see us pass serious gun safety legislation, and they want to protect  the rights of all Americans to be able to vote.   That, among many other things, is what I hear from the American  people in terms of getting the job done. Not too many people that I can  recall--I have been all over this country--say: Bernie, you go back  there and you get the job done, and you give enormously profitable  corporations, which pay outrageous compensation packages to their CEOs,  billions and billions of dollars in corporate welfare.   Now, maybe, Mr. President, you hear that. I don't hear that from the  people in my State.   By the way, when we talk about an expenditure of $76 billion, yeah,  we can give it to some large, profitable corporation with no strings  attached or we can use it--$76 billion--to expand Medicare, to provide  senior citizens with the high-quality hearing aids and eyeglasses they  desperately need, and for a bit more, we can provide dental care as  well.   For $76 billion, we could eliminate homelessness in America and  create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs from Maine to  California, building all of the affordable rental units that this  country desperately needs. We can end homelessness or give a corporate  welfare check to profitable corporations.   Mr. President, for $76 billion, we could make every community college  in America tuition-free for the next 7 years. Go home and ask the  people whether they think they would rather spend money on allowing our  young people to be able to go to community college tuition-free or a  welfare check to large, profitable corporations.   And on and on it goes. Seventy-six billion is a lot of money. I know  Senator Lee would probably prefer to see that go into deficit  reduction. Fair enough. And I am concerned about deficit reduction, but  I am making the point that we can invest this in a way that really  improves lives for millions and millions of working families.   Mr. President, there is no doubt that there is a serious global  shortage in microchips and semiconductors, which is making it harder  for manufacturers to produce the cars, the cell phones, and the  electronic equipment we need. This shortage is costing American workers  good jobs and raising prices for families, and that is why I strongly  support efforts to expand U.S. microchip production. But the question  we should be asking is this: Should the American taxpayers provide the  microchip industry with a blank check of $76 billion at a time when  semiconductor companies are making tens of billions of dollars a year  in profits and paying their CEOs very high salaries and compensation  packages? I think the answer to that is a resounding no.   It is important, in light of Mr. Gelsinger's remarks and his threat  to go to Asia or to Europe, to have a little bit of history about this  issue. Over the last 20 years, the microchip industry has shut down  over 780 manufacturing plants in the United States and eliminated  150,000 American jobs while moving most of its production overseas.  They did that, by the way, after receiving $9.5 billion in government  subsidies and loans.   In other words, we have the absurd situation where we have a crisis  that is caused precisely by the people we are now attempting to bail  out. So as a reward for their bad behavior, for shutting down 780  manufacturing establishments in America, they come back and say: Oh, we  have a crisis in America. We need your help.   So they want us to pay to undo the damage they caused. Well, that may  make sense to someone but not to me.   In total, Mr. President, it has been estimated that five major  semiconductor companies will receive the lion's share of this  technology handout. Those companies are Intel, Texas Instruments,  Micron Technology, GlobalFoundries, and Samsung. These five companies  made $70 billion in profits last year.   The company that will likely benefit the most from this taxpayer  assistance is Mr. Gelsinger's company, Intel. Now, I have nothing  against Intel, and I wish them the best, but Intel is not a poor  company. Last year, Intel made nearly $20 billion in profits. During  the pandemic, Intel had enough money to spend $16.6 billion not on  research and development, not on building new  [[Page S3356]]  plants, but on buying back its own stock to reward its executives and  wealthy shareholders.   Over the past 20 years, Intel has spent over $100 million on lobbying  and campaign contributions. So $100 million may seem like a lot of  money, but if you are about to get $20 billion from the taxpayers of  America, that is a very modest investment. Meanwhile, while they spent  $100 million on lobbying and campaign contributions, they were shipping  thousands of jobs to China and other low-income countries. Does this  really sound like a company that needs a taxpayer handout?   Another company that would receive taxpayer assistance under this  legislation is Texas Instruments. Last year, Texas Instruments made  $7.8 billion in profits. In 2020, the company spent $2.5 billion buying  back its own stock.   Meanwhile, other companies that will receive taxpayer support are the  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company--and by the way, you would  be shocked to know that the largest shareholder of the Taiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is--well, you guessed it; it is the  Government of Taiwan. So we would be giving money, I guess, directly to  the Government of Taiwan. And on and on it goes.   Mr. President, I should be clear in stating that I do believe in  industrial policy. I think that at times it is absolutely appropriate  for the government to sit down with the private sector and say: Look,  we have needs, and we want to work with you to solve those needs. You  have a right to make a fair profit. We have the need--the right to see  the needs of the American people addressed. We need a partnership.   To me, industrial policy means cooperation between the government and  the private sector--cooperation. It does not mean the government  providing massive amounts of corporate welfare to profitable  corporations without getting anything in return.   So the question is, Will the U.S. Government develop an industrial  policy that benefits all of our society or will we continue to have an  industrial policy that benefits the wealthy, the powerful, their  lobbyists, and the campaign contributors?   In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said:         The problem is that we all too often have socialism for the       rich and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor.    I am afraid that what Dr. King said 54 years ago was accurate back  then and is even more accurate today.   So, Mr. President, the Senate has an important decision to make, and  that is, do we simply provide a blank check or do we put some  restrictions on that money? That is why I will be offering an amendment  which does that.   It seems to me that if private companies are going to benefit from  generous taxpayer subsidies, the financial gains made by these  companies must be shared with the American people, not just wealthy  shareholders. In other words, if microchip companies make a profit as a  direct result of these Federal grants, the taxpayers of this country  have a right to get a reasonable turn on that investment.   Further, if microchip companies receive taxpayer assistance, they  must agree that they will not buy back their own stock, outsource  American jobs overseas, repeal existing collective bargaining  agreements, and must remain neutral in any union-organizing effort.   This is not a radical idea. All of these conditions were imposed on  companies that received taxpayer assistance during the pandemic and  passed the Senate in the CARES Act by a vote of 96 to 0. That is why I  will be filing an amendment to impose these conditions to this  legislation.   I understand that some language has been inserted into this bill that  would prohibit microchip companies from using these grants to buy back  their own stock. Let us be clear: This language is totally meaningless.  Under this legislation, companies will still be able to use the  enormous profits that they are making on stock buybacks.   Bottom line: Let us rebuild the U.S. microchip industry, but let us  do it in a way that benefits all of our people, not just a handful of  wealthy profitable and powerful corporations.    Let me suggest to my friend from Utah that I agree with  a lot of what he said about this legislation that we are going to be  voting on within the hour.   I would simply add that while this bill has had many names--lately,  they call it the chips bill; it has also been called the China bill and  so forth--but theoretically, it is supposed to be competing against  China.   But I would point out that since 2005, Intel has invested at least  $700 million in Chinese technology companies, including at least four  microchip startups. In 2020, 2 years ago, Intel invested in two Chinese  semiconductor startups, ProPlus and Spectrum Materials, as part of a  $132 million investment in 11 startups, including 3 in China. So we are  investing, ostensibly to protect us from China, in a company that, in  fact, invests in China.   I yield the floor.
