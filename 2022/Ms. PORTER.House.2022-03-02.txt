 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an amazing  Californian, Mr. Shelton Johnson. I commend his contributions to the  National Park Service and his dedication to telling the stories of our  history that often go untold.   Mr. Johnson has worked as a park ranger for over 35 years. In that  time, he has enthusiastically recounted the special contributions of  Black Americans to preserving Yosemite's wilderness. The all-Black 9th  and 10th Calvary Regiments, known as the Buffalo Soldiers, were among  the first park rangers, even before the founding of the National Park  system.   I am inspired by Mr. Johnson's creativity and commitment to sharing  our diverse history. Mr. Johnson was recently awarded the American Park  Experience Award for his lifelong efforts in helping more families and  youth feel welcome as they see their stories told.   As a fellow teacher and mom to three enthusiastic, park-loving kids,  I am honored to recognize him today.                          Competition in Capitalism     Mr. Speaker, a strong capitalist economy requires  competition. Weak antitrust enforcement has atrophied the bones of our  economy. When our economy lacks competition, we see prices go up, wages  drop, and innovation stall.   Last year, my office released a report detailing how Big Pharma's  market consolidation creates real harms for families. Too many  Americans can't afford lifesaving prescription drugs because Big Pharma  buys out its competitors so that it can continue its corporate abuse.   We have also seen how Big Tech's market consolidation reduces  consumer choice, stifles competition, and harms small businesses.   Competition is central to healthy capitalism. Reining in corporate  greed, holding big businesses accountable, and cracking down on  monopolies will strengthen our economy.   Congress must tackle market consolidation to create a level playing  field for all businesses and to strengthen our capitalist economy.                            ____________________
