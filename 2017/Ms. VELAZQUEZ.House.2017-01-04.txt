 I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, here we go again with another piece of misguided  legislation, but this one will jeopardize the health and safety of the  American people to benefit corporate America and polluters.   Let's be clear. The protections that will be overwhelmingly targeted  by this measure are not so-called midnight regulations. These are rules  that went through significant vetting. There are a host of statutes  that govern how regulations are crafted. From the Administrative  Procedure Act to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, to the Unfunded  Mandates Reform Act, to the Paperwork Reduction Act, there are numerous  processes to ensure regulations are written in a way that protect the  American people while preventing overreach.   Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, I  am well acquainted with the need to ensure that the regulatory process  is balanced. No one here supports overregulation; but, at the same  time, we cannot eliminate safeguards that have a proven record of  protecting the American public. This bill also has the potential to  create significant regulatory uncertainty for the same small businesses  my colleagues say they are trying to help.   At its core, this bill is about enabling the largest and most  powerful corporations to run rampant--without accountability. The  legislation before us could result in less protections for consumers,  and it could strip away workplace protections. We should reject this  bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
