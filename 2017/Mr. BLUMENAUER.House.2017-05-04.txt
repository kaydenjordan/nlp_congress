 Mr. Speaker, we began this debate listening to my  friend from Texas talk about how he was humbled to be here today  supporting the Republican bill. Well, frankly, I think he should be  embarrassed, embarrassed that my Republican colleagues are afraid to  have a full, open, lengthy debate about these impacts. We are taking a  consequential piece of legislation, and Republicans are jamming it  through without a CBO score so they don't know the impacts, and we  don't have the confidence.   We do know, however, my friend from Massachusetts has read into the  Record item after item, the medical association, disease advocacy  groups, the American Association of Retired People, it is an honor roll  of people who know about health care, who fought to preserve and  protect and enhance, and the Republicans have no answer to refute this  litany of experts who are independent, who are professional, who care.  Who are opposed. That is something that I think Republicans should be  ashamed of.   They have had 7 years chipping away at the Affordable Care Act to try  to make it worse, yet it still is supported by people who know. The  Republican approach should be rejected.
