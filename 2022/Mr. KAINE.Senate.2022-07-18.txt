 Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to  remove ``Robert E. Lee Memorial'' from the official name of Arlington  House.   This legislation is partially inspired by requests from descendants  of General Robert E. Lee and people who were enslaved at Arlington  House. This is also an effort to promote a society that is more just  and equitable for all, regardless of race, by moving on from a public  symbol that honors a figure that fought to protect slavery.   Arlington House is the first name of the historic mansion, which sits  on Federal land within Arlington National Cemetery. The property is  administered by the National Park Service and overlooks the Potomac  River and the Nation's Capital. The house was built by Martha Custis  Washington's grandson, George Washington Parke Custis, as the Nation's  first memorial to George Washington. Later, his daughter married Robert  E. Lee, and the couple lived in the home until the Civil War. During  that period, the site was chosen to serve as a national military  cemetery in part to prevent Lee from returning. Congress passed  legislation in 1955 designating the house the ``Custis-Lee Mansion'' to  memorialize Lee and subsequently amended the official title to  ``Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial.'' The legislation would  remove the latter part of that name and return the house to its  original name, ``Arlington House.''   Today, the National Park Service is dedicated to telling the story of  those who were enslaved at the Arlington House. I am hopeful that this  name change will help to do just a little bit more to encapsulate the  full history of the site, which included the presence of many families  and generations throughout history, such as the Syphax, Burke, Parks,  and Gray families.   I am pleased that companion legislation is also being introduced in  the U.S. House of Representatives by my colleague, Representative Don  Beyer, who has led this effort for years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to  remove ``Robert E.
