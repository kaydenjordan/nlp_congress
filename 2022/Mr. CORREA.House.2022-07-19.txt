 Madam Speaker, today, I join the American Lung  Association in recognizing an outstanding American and Californian,  Lynn Valbuena, chairwoman of the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians.   On August 25, Chairwoman Valbuena will be honored by the American  Lung Association for her contributions to healthcare both to her Tribal  nation and to other Tribal nations across the United States.   Lynn has devoted her entire life to serving her Tribal nation and her  community. In April, she was sworn in as chairwoman for the fifth  nonconsecutive term.   I extend my congratulations to Chairwoman Lynn Valbuena for this  well-deserved recognition and thank her for keeping up the good work.                            ____________________
