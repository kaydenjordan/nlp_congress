 Mr. President, I am almost embarrassed to talk about  what I am going to have to talk about today. Once again, in the U.S.  Congress, we find ourselves only days away from causing a lapse in the  National Flood Insurance Program.   The majority of Members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of  Representatives understand the importance of extending this program but  sadly some don't. You can lead some people to water, but you can't make  them think.   Without congressional action, ordinary Americans--the people who get  up every day, go to work, obey the law, pay their taxes, and try to do  the right things by their kids--are going to suffer. These folks work  pretty hard to earn money to cover their mortgages, to pay their  insurance premiums, to put food on the table, and to hopefully have a  little extra when all is said and done.   The U.S. Government made a promise to these people, these taxpaying  Americans, that if they pay their flood insurance premiums, we will  have their backs when they have a flood. We are about to tell them we  lied. When you lie to Congress, it is a felony. When Congress lies to  you, it is just politics, and that is not right.   Unless we do something, the National Flood Insurance Program, the  NFIP, is going to expire on July 31. Now, unless you are a rock--only  dumber--that is in 8 days, including today.   Every once in a while, Congress seems to just decide that keeping our  promise to the American taxpayer isn't worth the effort. What planet  did we parachute in from that we can't even maintain the status quo on  something that affects the lives of millions of people and helps more  than 22,000 communities across this great country?   I am standing here today because the reauthorization of the NFIP has  never been more urgent. Let me say it again. We have 8 days until  disaster. If the NFIP is allowed to expire on July 31, Congress is  going to be sending a clear message to the 5 million hard-working  Americans who count on this program, and that message is three words:  We don't care. We don't care. The unfortunate thing is, I think some-- it is a small minority, but some don't.   Last September, when Texas and parts of Louisiana were still reeling  from Hurricane Harvey, one Member of the U.S. Congress actually said:  ``The federal government is encouraging and subsidizing people to live  in harm's way . . . at some point, God is telling you to move.''   Give me a break. Are you kidding me?   The fact is, 50 percent of our country's population and 50 percent of  our country's jobs are along our coasts and waterways. Do you really  think they ought to just move? Living near water is an economic  necessity. People have been doing it since the beginning of time. It is  as true for us now as it was in Biblical times that our economies and  our livelihoods are tied to water.   Let's take the Mississippi River that runs through my State. Each  year, it sustains more than 1.3 million jobs and generates more than  $405 billion in revenue. How many jobs are tied to the 12,000 miles of  U.S. coastline? What do you think would be the economic impact if  everyone who lived near one of the 3.5 million miles of rivers in this  great country just picked up and moved tomorrow--as if they could  afford to do so. Give me a break. I hope we never have to find out what  would happen, but one thing is certain, nobody is going to move before  July 31, when the NFIP expires, just because some Members of Congress  erroneously think they ought to.   I want to make two other points. First, if Congress allows the NFIP  to expire, it is going to stall thousands and thousands and thousands  of home closings. That is right. Because the law requires it, many  lenders require homeowners to carry flood insurance. If there is no  NFIP, then there is no flood insurance. If there is no flood insurance,  then there is no home sale.   The last time Congress chose to do nothing and let the National Flood  Insurance Program expire, the NFIP lapsed for a total of 53 days. That  was in 2010. Over those 2 months, each and every day, 1,400 home sales  were canceled. That is every day. That is not total. That is every day.  Think about how that is going to impact our economy. Isn't that  special?   Just when we finally get the U.S. economy moving again, we are going  to step on it by letting the National Flood Insurance Program expire.  No wonder many Americans say--and I hear it all the time--yes, there  are some good Members of Congress. We just can't figure out what they  are good for.   I am also tired of hearing that the NFIP is being abused by rich  people for their beach homes. I hear it all the time. That is a bunch  of bovine waste. As a matter of fact, 98.5 percent--almost 99 percent-- of all NFIP policies are in counties with a median household income of  less than $100,000, and 62  [[Page S5251]]  percent are in counties with a median household income below the  national average of $54,000.   You don't have to live near a body of water. If you get 22 inches of  rain in 2 days, you are going to flood, even if you live on Pikes Peak.  For those who live in a coastal State like my State or elsewhere on a  floodplain, the reality is, the NFIP is the only place you can turn to  protect your property. Floods are the most common and the most costly  natural disaster. The damage that is done by hail, fire, wind, or a  fallen tree is covered by a homeowner's insurance but not a flood. If  you have a flood, it is not covered by your homeowner's policy.   The Federal Government made a promise. We promised more than 5  million Americans--half a million in my State alone--that we would have  their backs. We promised them that if they would pay their hard-earned  money into the National Flood Insurance Program through premiums, if  they flooded, we would cover it. It is time we get our act together and  keep that promise. The NFIP is just too important to be used as a  political football. For millions of people in this country, in my State  and elsewhere, this program is the only way they can protect their most  valuable asset--their home--and, at a minimum, we owe those hard- working Americans some peace of mind.   I urge my colleagues to support S. 3128, my bill and the bill of Bill  Cassidy, the senior Senator from Louisiana. It will extend the National  Flood Insurance Program for 6 months to get us through hurricane  season. That is all it does. It just maintains the status quo. It  doesn't change anything. It just says the National Flood Insurance  Program we have today is going to be extended for 6 months to get us  through hurricane season, while we in the Senate and in the House  continue to work on a reform bill that would rework the NFIP and turn  it into a program that looks like somebody designed it on purpose. That  is all my bill and Senator Cassidy's bill does.   We simply can't afford to let the folks in our at-risk communities  down, especially those exposed during hurricane season. Truthfully,  they deserve better from us.                          Nomination of John Fleming    Mr. President, I want to speak very briefly about a friend of mine  who has been nominated by President Trump for a very important position  in the Federal Government. This friend's name is John Fleming, and he  has been nominated by the President to be Assistant Secretary for the  Economic Development Administration at the Department of Commerce.   Dr. Fleming currently serves as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Health IT Reform at the Department of Health and Human Services, and he  has done a wonderful job. He has done such a great job that the  President has asked him to take on this program at the Department of  Commerce.   Dr. Fleming is a public servant's public servant. He is a four-term  Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. He is a physician. He went  to the University of Mississippi, undergraduate and medical school. He  is an entrepreneur and businessman. Aside from his family medical  practice, his businesses support about 600 jobs in my State.   After Dr. Fleming finished at Ole Miss and finished med school, he  enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He served there in the Medical Corps.   During his time in the House of Representatives, Dr. Fleming was a  champion of our economy, a champion for families, and a champion for  our veterans. He is a skilled physician, he is an experienced  entrepreneur, and he is a good guy. I know Dr. John Fleming and his  family well, and I am honored to be able to endorse his nomination.   Just to show you that he is well-rounded--I forgot this--John also  has a black belt in karate. I am not sure when he has time, but he is a  well-rounded guy.   I have no doubt--none whatsoever--that Dr. Fleming is well qualified  to be a very fine Assistant Secretary of the Economic Development  Administration, and I endorse his nomination categorically and  unconditionally.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I want to talk for a second about an  amendment I have to the minibus appropriations package.   I am going to talk very briefly about the amendment, but, first, I  want to respond to some of the comments of my friend the Senator from  Illinois, for whom I have great respect. I just disagree with him on  this subject of the Affordable Care Act, and I want to respond briefly.   Let me tell you what Republicans believe, at least most Republicans  whom I know. Most Republicans I know believe what Americans believe,  and that is that in our country, if you are hungry, we feed you. If you  are homeless, we house you. If you are too poor to be sick, we will pay  for your doctor. We in America, Republicans and Democrats, put our  money where our mouth is. We spend $1 trillion a year helping people  who are less fortunate than we are, and that separates our country from  every other country in the world.   Frankly, that is why so many of our neighbors across this great  planet want to come to America. It is because we care about other  people. I mean, when is the last time you heard of anybody trying to  sneak into China or Russia? That is why they want to come to America.   But when a government program, though well intended, isn't working,  we owe it to the American taxpayer to explain to them why, and the  Affordable Care Act has not worked. I wish it had.   I had the highest hopes. I remember when the Senate debated it. Call  me a nerd, but I watched it on C-SPAN. I wanted it to work. We were  promised: Look, as a result of this act, we are going to make health  insurance accessible, and we are going to make it affordable.   I said: Man, I will take a dozen of those. We have been trying to do  that for 50 years around here. Maybe this time we will get it right.   It was offered with the best of intentions. You will never hear me  criticize  [[Page S5258]]  President Obama for an act of patriotism. He was very well intended. He  wanted it to work. It wasn't a question of bad motives. It was just a  bad idea.   You know, 150 years ago, doctors used to bleed their patients with  the best of intentions, but they stopped doing it because it was a bad  idea.   Now, we can do better. I agree with the objectives from the Senator  of Illinois. Let me say it again that I have great respect for him, but  the American people deserve a health insurance program that looks like  somebody designed it on purpose, and that is not the Affordable Care  Act. I wish it were, but it is not. We can do better.                              Amendment No. 3430    Mr. President, let me hit a lick about my amendment to the minibus  appropriation package, H.R. 6147.   Here is the problem. We have a lot of foreign seafood imported into  the United States, and some of it is very dangerous. I am afraid to say  that a lot of it is very dangerous. I am unhappy to say that.   Our FDA is in charge of making sure that this foreign seafood is  safe. It spends $11.9 million a year to do that. My amendment would  give the FDA an additional $3.1 million, and here is why it is  important.   Last year, the United States imported $21.5 billion worth of  seafood--not million, but $21.5 billion. Now, the FDA is supposed to  inspect it to make sure that it is safe before you eat it. The FDA does  the best it can, but they are only able, with the small amount of  money, relatively speaking, that it has, to test a very small sample, 2  percent.   Ninety-eight percent of the foreign seafood coming in is not even  tested. When it is tested, the FDA often finds that it contains  salmonella, it contains listeria, it contains dirt, and it contains  illegal drugs, like antibiotics.   What does that mean?   Well, if you eat enough of the stuff, aside from the fact that you  could grow an extra ear or glow in the dark, then, you develop a  resistance to antibiotics. If you eat bad seafood, particularly shrimp  full of these antibiotics, and you get sick, you get an infection,  maybe an abscessed tooth. You go to the doctor, the doctor gives you  antibiotics, and they don't work anymore.   Now, remember that we are only examining 2 percent of all seafood  imports. If you run the numbers, you will see that barely 0.2 percent  of seafood imports are rejected every year. The vast majority, 98  percent, were not even checked. This isn't just about public safety,  although that is certainly important. It is also about public policy.   As for American shrimpers, let me tell you what they have to compete  against in my State and in other States. They are being asked to  compete with foreign fishermen who are unfairly subsidized by the  Federal Government and who face little to no environmental regulations  and little to no quality control. They fish where they are not supposed  to. They ignore international quotas. They pump much of their fish full  of illegal drugs, and they don't look out for the health of local  ecosystems, as our domestic fisher men and women do.   The result is dangerous. It is unsafe for the American people, and it  is unfair to the American shrimpers who do it the right way.   I don't want my family eating it. I don't want my son eating it. I  don't want my wife eating it. I don't want my dogs eating it. If the  American people are listening, be careful if you eat it.   That is what my amendment does.   With that, I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3407
