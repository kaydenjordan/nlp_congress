 Mr. President, with North Korea test firing ballistic  missiles last week, you might ask: Where is the United Nations?   There are a series of international sanctions aimed at North Korea's  nuclear program. These sanctions are in accordance with the U.N.  Security Council's regulations passed in the wake of previous North  Korea nuclear tests and ballistic missile tests. There is a U.N.  Security Council Sanctions Committee on North Korea that is charged  with monitoring these sanctions on North Korea.   The Wall Street Journal has reported that an expert panel working on  a report for this U.N. committee has faced roadblocks from Chinese  representatives, supported by Russia in some circumstances.   China and Russia supported these sanctions, but now they appear to be  running interference for North Korea so North Korea can continue to  violate the reason these sanctions were put on.   The expert panel is supposed to report the facts. And then by  reporting the facts, they aren't representing national governments and  shouldn't be representing national governments.   It is blatantly clear that the Chinese representative is doing the  bidding for the Chinese Communist Party. The footnotes with dissenting  comments are anonymous, but there is no doubt where they came from. In  other words, China.   In one case, it is as petty as insisting that a reference to a  company with ``Taiwan'' in its name should include an assertion that  Taiwan is a province of China. That is something you hear from China  all the time. Everyone knows China is obsessed with making others  pretend that Taiwan is not an independent country.   That leaves no doubt where these objections are coming from. You can  draw a very straight line back to General Secretary Xi. The bigger  problem is that other objections seem designed to minimize and paper  over the violations of these sanctions by North Korea. That is as good  as confirmed by suspicions that China has been helping North Korea  evade the sanctions that China supported in the first place and still  claims to support.   General Secretary Xi probably thinks that letting North Korea run  wild with its nuclear weapons program would cause problems for the  West. And we all know that the West is very concerned about North  Korea's developing of nuclear weapons and the ability to deliver.   General Secretary Xi is very shortsighted when he takes that view  that he wants to cause problems for the West by helping North Korea,  because it can't be in China's interest to have a nuclear-armed and  unstable regime as a next-door neighbor, which North Korea is a  nuclear-armed and a nonstable regime.   General Secretary Xi's strategy of sowing chaos is playing with fire.  That is why all of this activity going on in the U.N. and China trying  to cover up the violations of the sanctions is dangerous not just for  the U.S. interests, but it is very dangerous for China and the world.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week, Special Counsel Durham  indicted Michael Sussman, an attorney for the Hillary Clinton  Presidential campaign. He was indicted for lying to the FBI.   The indictment gives example after example of the Democratic Party's  bag of dirty tricks.   In September 2016, Sussman met with the FBI's general counsel, James  Baker. At that meeting he provided information and data files that  allegedly contained evidence of a secret communication between the  Trump organization and the Russian bank Alfa Bank.    The evidence, however, was fabricated. The allegations about the  Trump organization being linked with a Russian bank--these were false.  The email server at issue was neither owned nor operated by the Trump  organization.   But the lie in the indictment occurred when Sussmann allegedly told  the FBI general counsel that he wasn't providing the information on any  client's behalf. He repeated the same to another government agency.  Those assertions were apparently false. He was working for the Hillary  Clinton Presidential campaign.   Now, interestingly, the indictment states that although Baker was  allegedly unaware of the political affiliation of the information  starting in April 2016, Sussmann represented the Democratic National  Committee and regularly met with the FBI. According to the indictment,  the FBI failed to connect the dots. What Special Counsel Durham's  indictment shows in significant detail, by the way, are the steps that  the Clinton campaign and her Democratic allies took to dirty up Trump-- and did so--with known false information.   Time and again, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  cast false information against Trump to tie him to a foolish conspiracy  that he is an agent of the Russian Government. Time and again, when the  evidence is made public, the Democratic Party is shown to be the master  of the disinformation universe, and much of the so-called mainstream  press fell for and peddled the falsehoods.   What's wrong with our journalists being journalists and investigating  everything to the bottom rather than trying to not do their work and  letting people get away with this sort of action?   Now I am going to take a few examples from the indictment. Notably,  Sussmann was working with an unnamed executive at a technology firm  that had been offered a position in the Clinton administration, should  she have won that election in 2016.   The information compiled and analyzed the false Alfa Bank information  and, according to the indictment, ``exploited access to non-public data  at multiple internet companies to conduct opposition research  concerning Trump.''   To accomplish those ends, the executive enlisted ``the assistance of  researchers at a U.S.-based university who were receiving and analyzing  Internet data in connection with a pending federal government  cybersecurity research contract.''  [[Page S6640]]    Now, amazingly, the indictment later says that the university  accessed data of an unnamed executive branch agency through an unnamed  internet company. That unnamed internet company possessed that data  because it was a subcontract ``in a sensitive relationship between the  U.S. government and another company.''   Apparently, taxpayers unwittingly assisted the false-information  campaign used against Trump by the Democrats.   I'd like to say that you can't make this stuff up, but that is  exactly what they did. A researcher that worked to falsely connect  Trump to Alfa Bank said, ``We cannot technically make any claims that  would fly public scrutiny.''   They also discussed faking email addresses to try and beef up some  bogus false connection between Trump and Alfa Bank. Even the unnamed  tech executive essentially said the Alfa Bank data was a ``red  herring.''   One email in the indictment even says in part:         The only thing that drives us at this point is that we just       do not like [Trump]. This will not fly in the eyes of public       scrutiny. Folks, I am afraid that we have tunnel vision.    They recognized that what they were doing lacked any factual support,  yet Sussmann, the Democrats, and the Clinton campaign proceeded ahead  anyway.   Even more than that, Christopher Steele reportedly got his  information about Alfa Bank from Sussmann and included it in the Steele  dossier. The indictment clearly shows the depth to which the Clinton  campaign went to smear Trump--smear--with false evidence and plant it  with the liberal media, who then willingly ran with it--and probably  smiled as they ran with it. And here we are, years later, with a  country that has been almost torn apart because of the Democratic  Party's fake evidence against Trump.   Special Counsel Durham stated on December 9, 2019, in part, relating  to the Justice Department inspector general's report on Crossfire  Hurricane, ``last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not  agree with some of the report's conclusions as to the predication and  how the FBI case was opened.''   Special Counsel Durham has had several years to investigate and bring  a case forward. We have seen two instances where folks have been  charged with a crime, one already pleading guilty.   One must not forget the Obama-Biden Justice Department's and the  FBI's blatant misrepresentations to the FISA court during the Crossfire  Hurricane and other serious wrongdoing, much of which was uncovered by  Congress and the inspector general.   On June 29 of this year, Senator Johnson and I asked Attorney General  Garland if he agrees with then-Attorney General Barr's statement that  any Durham report be submitted in the form that will permit public  dissemination. On July 13 of this year, Attorney General Garland said  that he agrees.   Special Counsel Durham, let's see what you have got, and we will be  able to see it when the report comes out.
