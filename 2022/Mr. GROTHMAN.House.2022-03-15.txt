 Madam Speaker, tomorrow, we are going to be addressed  by the head of state from Ukraine.   I have been talking to people--young people, students, older people-- about if they know the background between those countries, specifically  the Holodomor, a starvation of the Ukrainian people that took place in  1932 and 1933.   I am shocked. I bet less than 10 percent of Americans know that 4  million--4 to 15 million, but at least 4 million--Ukrainians were  starved to death by the Communist government in the early 1930s.   Even less, I am sure, know that for misreporting this starvation, a  guy by the name of Walter Duranty, from The New York Times, received a  Pulitzer Prize for covering it up. So, this leftwing bias out of The  New York Times is not something that started today. They, of course,  hated the people who were starved because they were independent  farmers, and the Communist Party hates independent, family-oriented  people.                            ____________________
