 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding me this time.   I rise today in strong support of the continuing resolution. With  government funding set to expire on Friday, this legislation is  necessary to ensure we avoid a harmful government shutdown. There is no  other option.   The bill before us extends government funding until either January 19  or February 2 depending on the agency. It also includes temporary  extensions for critical expiring programs, such as Community Health  Centers, the National Flood Insurance Program, and others that are  important to rural regions like Kentucky's Fifth District.   Plus, on the heels of Veterans Day, it ensures that we continue  providing critical resources to our military, defending America around  the world, and takes care of our country's heroic veterans.   While a CR is not my preferred method of conducting business, a  government shutdown right before the holidays, does our Nation no good.  We need more time to complete our fiscal year `24 to give the House a  better negotiating position with the Senate so we can eventually pass  full-year appropriations bills.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge Members to vote for this CR.
