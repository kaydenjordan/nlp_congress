 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole) for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice the frustration of the residents  of my district in Pennsylvania.   Two weeks after the start of the 116th Congress, the Democrat  leadership in the House continues to refuse to come to the table,  negotiate a compromise, secure our borders, and put an end to the  shutdown.   I have been hearing every day from hundreds of people in my district:  do our jobs, secure the border, put partisanship aside, and get things  done. Reopen the government, yes, and build a barrier securing the most  vulnerable parts of our southern border and put an end to this  humanitarian and national security crisis.   It is in our hands. This is what the people want, and this is what  they expect. Instead, Democrat leadership appears to be treating this  like a game, like we have taken an important issue--disaster relief for  tragedy-stricken parts of our country--and poisoned it with  partisanship.   This is a messaging bill that makes for good talking points on TV,  but does nothing to make our country safer or end the shutdown. Let's  negotiate and do what the people expect of us.   We were sent here to serve the people, not our political ambitions.  It is long past time we start doing it.   Madam Speaker, I urge a no vote on the rule and on the underlying  bill, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding me the time.
