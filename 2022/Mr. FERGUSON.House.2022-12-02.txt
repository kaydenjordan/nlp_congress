 Mr. Speaker, I am honored today to stand here to honor  our dear friend, Jackie Walorski, and her tireless efforts on this  piece of legislation, the Jackie Walorski Maternal and Child Home  Visiting Reauthorization Act of 2022.   This legislation is important because it really does provide needed  services to our most vulnerable. Just in the State of Georgia, this  program produced over 20,000 home visits and really had an impact on  families with early development, mental health, substance abuse, and a  lot of other things that some incredible nurses did.   This program is being reauthorized with some much-needed reforms in  it. There is going to be stability in the program. Jackie fought hard  to make sure that this program was based on evidence so the dollars  will go where they work.   I am honored to be here today to support this legislation, but more  importantly, I am here to honor our dear friend, Jackie Walorski.
