 Mr. Speaker, had I been present for the vote on H.  Res. 354, a resolution ``Condemning the violence against peaceful  protesters outside the Turkish Ambassador's residence on May 16, 2017,  and calling for the perpetrators to be brought to justice and measures  to be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future'' (Rollcall Vote  No. 286), I would have voted ``aye.''   I would have also voted ``aye'' on H. Res. 355, a resolution  ``Condemning in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in  Manchester, United Kingdom, on May 22, 2017, expressing heartfelt  condolences, and reaffirming unwaivering support for the special  relationship between our peoples and nations in the wake of these  attacks'' (Rollcall Vote No. 287).                            ____________________
