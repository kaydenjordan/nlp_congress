 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of the world-class agriculture science program and FFA at  the Otto-Eldred High School in McKean County, Pennsylvania.   Last week, I had the honor of visiting the amazing students and  faculty at Otto-Eldred High School where agriculture is a staple of  their home economics program. Founded just 3 years ago, the new  agriculture program features a greenhouse, engine lab, life science  lab, welding booth, woodshop, and even an agribusiness lab.   At Otto-Eldred, agricultural education goes beyond the classroom. In  addition to the astonishing 75 percent of the students enrolled in  agriculture science, the school's Future Farmers of America chapter  membership compromises almost 70 percent of the entire student body.  This fantastic success is a testament to the excellence and the  commitment of the school administrators and faculty at Otto-Eldred.   As chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and a senior member of  the Education and the Workforce Committee, I know just how important  agricultural education is to the success of our Nation.    I commend the students, faculty, and administrators that make this  outstanding agricultural education possible, and thank them for the  opportunity to experience it firsthand.                            ____________________
