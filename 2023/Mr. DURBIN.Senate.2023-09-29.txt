 Mr. President, today, we mourn the death of a  trailblazer, my colleague and friend Senator Dianne Feinstein.   I have been privileged to have known Dianne throughout her entire  career in this Chamber and my entire time as well. She was my friend  and seatmate on the Senate Judiciary Committee for over 20 years. When  you are that close to someone politically--day in, day out, week in,  week out--you pick up on the things that mean the most to her.  Certainly, her family was the highest priority to her, over all things,  but her life experience created what we know as the legacy of Dianne.  How many times she told the story of serving on the pardon and parole  board for the State of California--the cases that she remembered in  detail that had occurred decades ago stuck with her and inspired her  when it came to her service on the Senate Judiciary Committee.   I think that situation also inspired her when it came to legislation,  where she was looking for fairness. We certainly all know her efforts  in dealing with the Violence Against Women Act. That was an  extraordinary effort by her, on a bipartisan basis with Senator  Murkowski, Senator Collins, Senator Ernst, Senator Patty Murray, and so  many others.   In addition to that, she recounted many, many times that terrible,  unimaginable tragedy when the mayor of San Francisco was killed along  with Harvey Milk, a commissioner. She was there at the bloody scene  afterward. She recounted that so many times in the midst of her debates  over an assault weapons ban.   Think about that assault weapons ban. It was almost the holy grail in  politics. So many people said that is the one thing we absolutely have  to do; it has to be done. She did it. She, along with Senator Schumer,  who was then a House Member, put together the bill that established an  assault weapons ban and reduced the number of deaths in America by  gunfire. They did it, and she was the leader, inspired by that terrible  tragedy with Mayor Moscone.   I can also remember, there was a time, years ago, when we engaged in  debate in this Chamber on stem cell science and biology. It was a  complicated debate. Many of us liberal arts lawyers were lost as they  went into the detail. Dianne not only led that debate; she had mastered  the subject. And time and again in the caucus, when we would discuss  it, she would be the one to stand up and straighten everyone out on the  basics. She was a gifted person in that regard.   But I do want to say that there is one thing that Senator Collins  noted that I noted many times. Members of the Senate, in the committee  hearings, were given a notepad in front of them--the Senate Judiciary  Committee was no exception--and a pencil nearby to make notes in the  course of our business. Sitting next to Dianne all those years, I can't  tell you how many flowers I saw her draw on those notepads. I asked her  for one, one time. She signed it, and I have kept it. But it is an  indication of the sweetness and the elegance in her life; that, on the  one hand, she could be arguing the most serious life-and-death issues  in the committee but, on the other hand, show that kind of dignity and  determination to bring the human side to the debate.   She was one of the best, and I was honored to call her a friend.   There were many times that she made the rollcall in the Senate  Judiciary Committee, the last year or 2, when I know it was an  extraordinary sacrifice. She was going to show up because that was her  responsibility. I respected her so much for that. And the committee  divided 11 to 10, I needed her. She knew it, and she was there. She  answered the call.   She served California with such distinction. She often talked about  her beloved Golden State, but we all know that she was also a treasure  to the Nation.   Dianne Feinstein inspired many, particularly many women, to public  service. She served California well, and she served our Nation, and it  was my honor to serve with her.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders),  the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith), and the Senator from Michigan  (Ms. Stabenow) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Smith), and the Senator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Senate's  need to swiftly confirm any U.S. attorney nominees.   Two days ago, I came to the floor to request unanimous consent for  the Senate to take up and confirm four pending U.S. attorney  nominations that were being held up by one U.S. Senator, the junior  Senator from Ohio, Senator Vance.   Two days ago, he said:         My position is we should have a full Senate vote on each       one of these . . . Justice Department nominations.    He also said:         [I]f it's so important to confirm these folks, bring them       to the floor for a vote.    But now that is exactly what he is attempting to prevent today.   For decades, the Senate confirmed U.S. attorney nominees of both  political parties by voice vote or what is called unanimous consent in  the Senate after they had been reported by the Judiciary Committee.  Before the beginning of the Biden administration, the Senate had not  required a rollcall vote on the confirmation of a U.S. attorney since  1975--almost 50 years. In fact, during the Trump administration, Senate  Democrats allowed every one of Trump's U.S. attorney nominees--all 85-- to move through the committee and be confirmed by voice vote, unanimous  consent.   Let me tell you, as a Democrat in those days, I knew what I was  getting with these U.S. attorneys working for Jeff Sessions, former  Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and William Barr. I knew what was going  to happen, but I respected the tradition of the Senate.   Now Senate Republicans have decided to change the rules and are  blocking the confirmation of these critical law enforcement officers.   I have faced this before. Republicans had said they were going to  object to U.S. attorneys but fortunately had better thoughts on the  subject as time progressed.   Now, this year, the Senator from Ohio has proudly announced that he  will--I will quote him, in fact: ``I will hold all [DOJ] nominations. .  . . We will grind [the Justice Department] to a halt.''   Grind the Justice Department to a halt.   U.S. attorneys are too important to be used as political pawns in a  national debate. They lead our Nation's effort to prosecute violent  criminals.   Don't tell me that you are for law and order, but you want to stop  criminal prosecutors from being appointed to the job. They lead our  Nation's effort to protect our communities from drug trafficking.    I quoted some numbers the other day about drug trafficking and  fentanyl deaths in the State of Ohio, the State where one of these U.S.  attorneys would be going to work, in the Cleveland area. Ohio runs  fourth in the Nation in narcotics deaths, and for the Senate to respond  by having one Senator from Ohio stopping the appointment of a criminal  prosecutor to go after these cartels or drug gangs is not explainable.   So I offered Senator Vance the opportunity to allow us to schedule  confirmation votes on all pending U.S. attorneys. I want to read  exactly what he said from the Congressional Record,  [[Page S4817]]  which, of course, is the permanent record of the Senate and will be  read by future generations.   This was on September 27, 2 days ago. Here is what Senator Vance  said:         I am the new guy, and I recognize that I am a little naive       when it comes to matters of the procedures in the U.S.       Senate. But I have had a lot of jobs in my life; and       yesterday we passed one vote and today we have passed zero       votes. The time that we have spent debating whether we should       have unanimous consent over these nominations, we could       actually use to vote on these nominations and end this       charade and call it out for what it is. If we believe that       these nominees must go forward, let's just have a vote on it.       Allow me to scrutinize them. Allow my colleagues to vote them       up or down. That is a totally reasonable thing to ask of this       Chamber and to ask of this leadership; and because of that, I       object.    Well, I accepted his challenge. I took his words to be heartfelt and  truthful, that he wanted votes. So today we had two votes on two of the  U.S. attorneys, considered by the Senate, which is exactly what the  Senator from Ohio asked for.   But there are two more on the calendar that he held up initially. He  said on the floor during our debate that these weren't people he was  necessarily objecting to but that somebody else in the Senate might be  objecting to. I didn't know what that meant, but I wanted to give him  the time to find out who that might be. It turns out there is no one  else--he is the only objector--even though he said on the record, in  the Congressional Record, that all he wanted was a rollcall vote on  these nominees.   Well, he is going to get the chance to keep his word that he put in  the Congressional Record, and he is going to get a chance to have the  vote he asked for. It is only fair. If we did it for the first two, we  will do it for the others.   Let me repeat it again. Senator Vance did not only refuse to move  these nominees by voice vote, as the Senate has done for decades, he is  now backtracking on his own words from 2 days ago and is refusing even  to allow rollcalls on these nominees.   This kind of obstructionism is becoming commonplace, I am afraid. If  you take a look at this Executive Calendar that we have here, there are  pages and pages of military officers who have served this country nobly  and honorably who are asking for a simple promotion they are entitled  to. They are being held up by another Republican Senator who doesn't  want to move forward on this, holding them for 6 months from promotion.  Is this the new way of doing business under a MAGA regime? I hope not.   Rebecca Lutzko is nominated to be U.S. attorney for the Northern  District of Ohio. She is a longtime Federal prosecutor who has served  as assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the  Northern District of Ohio for nearly 18 years. As a Federal prosecutor,  she handles cases involving prescription drug trafficking, gun crimes,  and corruption. Important? You bet it is.   April Perry is nominated to be U.S. attorney for the Northern  District of Illinois. She has significant experience in the private  sector and as a Federal prosecutor. She served in the U.S. Attorney's  Office for the Northern District of Illinois for over a decade, where  she handled narcotics, gang violence, public corruption, and fraud.  Important? You bet it is. Ms. Perry specialized in child exploitation  prosecutions and spent 6 years as the office's Project Safe Childhood  coordinator.   Are you concerned, as I am, about the exploitation of children, the  trafficking of children, the terrible sexual abuse that is taking place  on the internet? Do you think we ought to have the Department of  Justice on that case? Of course we should.   One week ago, Senator Vance was quoted as saying, ``My objection is  not to the specific qualifications of these particular individuals who  have been nominated.''   So, here, he is not complaining about any of their resumes or their  capacity to do the job and do it effectively. His concern--and he said  it publicly, so I think I am going to accurately quote him--his concern  is that the former President of the United States was indicted, and he  is very concerned about a Department of Justice that would even let  that happen.   For goodness' sake, things happened in the Department of Justice's  activities during the administration of Donald Trump that I objected  to, but I didn't stop the appointments of U.S. attorneys under Trump. I  didn't stop the people in law enforcement, who are keeping us safe in  our communities.   These are ably qualified individuals. I am asking Senator Vance: In  good faith, keep your word. What you said in the Congressional Record  is a matter of record, and you should stand by your word.   For that reason, I make the following motion: I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following  nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 314 and 315; that the Senate vote on  the nominations en bloc without intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; and that the Senate resume legislative session.    Madam President, it is interesting that we have got a new  argument.   Previously, he said: I have no objection to these nominees. I just  don't like the process. I want a vote.   I said: Fine. You can have a vote.  [[Page S4818]]    Now when we ask for a vote on the two remaining nominees for U.S.  attorney, he is finding fault with those individuals.   I hope he will take the time--and I know he is a fair person--to read  the record about what Ms. Perry did when she worked for the State's  attorney, Kim Foxx. It is true there was a controversial case before  her office and that she was the chief ethics officer in the Cook County  State's Attorney's Office. She served in that office at the time the  Jussie Smollett matter was being investigated, but Ms. Perry' role as  chief ethics officer was limited to recommending that State's Attorney  Foxx recuse herself and that the office seek the appointment of a  special prosecutor.   Notably, Ms. Perry resigned from that office a few weeks after the  prosecutors initially agreed to drop the charges against Mr. Smollett.  She has never been implicated, and to throw her name into this  situation is unfair. I am sure the Senator from Ohio doesn't want to do  that.   So listen to what he suggests--and I am glad Senator Reed is on the  floor, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.   Does it sound familiar?   We have a group of people--of nominees--who have come before us who  have been considered throughout history in a routine, unanimous consent  way, and now the Senator from Ohio says we have to go one by one and  have a cloture motion on each one of them. You and I both know, having  been here a few years, what that means. It is physically impossible,  whether we are talking about officers in the military or U.S. attorney  nominees, to say we will just stack them up on the calendar and go  through cloture votes, and it is unnecessary.   If we didn't single out a single U.S. attorney nominee in the Trump  administration but gave voice votes to all 85, it is an indication of  an effort of good will and bipartisanship even when we are suspicious  of what the political agenda may be of that Department.    To hold some of these people--the U.S. attorney for his own home  State, the city of Cleveland--to hold this person to this kind of  scrutiny that goes way beyond anything we usually have been involved in  is unfair to her, and it is unfair to the process and the system.   I am going to return to the floor. The Senator from Ohio and I are  going to be pretty familiar fixtures on this floor because if you say  something in the Congressional Record, as he did--that all he wants is  a rollcall, and we offered a rollcall, just as I did, and he denies it  over and over--he has some explaining to do.   If he thinks that standing up for the MAGA process here is something  the American people admire, I beg to differ with him.   We understand that the Department of Justice has an important job to  do to keep us safe in our communities, and for someone to say--for a  Senator from the U.S. Senate to say, ``I will hold all [DOJ]  nominations. . . . We will grind [the Justice Department] to a halt,''  really? That is your agenda? That is why you came to the Senate?   If the Department of Defense is being ground to a halt because of the  promotions of officers and to do the same thing at the Department of  Justice, and we are facing a government shutdown because of MAGA  Members of the House of Representatives, the American people have a  good picture, a good photograph, of the future if we go down one  particular path in terms of the future of politics in America.   I yield the floor.
