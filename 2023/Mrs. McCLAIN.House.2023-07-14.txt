 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, July 17, 2023 when  it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to represent the majority,  the  [[Page H3602]]  majority of Americans who actually pay their bills, the majority of  Americans who actually believe that if they have a right, they actually  have a responsibility.   Unfortunately, President Biden just announced that by the stroke of  his pen, he is going to forgive $39 billion in student loans, this  morning.   Now, let me be clear. This is in direct violation of the Supreme  Court's decision just 2 weeks ago that blocked his student loan  forgiveness plan. I guess the President has no respect for the  constitutional authority of the Supreme Court.   Apparently, he has no respect for hardworking taxpayers that are  going to foot this bill. Education isn't free. Someone pays for it.  Last I checked, the teachers don't work for free. It is you, the  taxpayer, who actually paid your student loans, who is now going to pay  for somebody that doesn't want to pay their student loans. Every  American who has paid off their student loans now gets the opportunity  to pay somebody else's.   What comes next, Mr. President? Are you going to forgive mortgages  and credit card bills? Where does this forgiveness end?   Rest assured, come hell or high water, I will fight this till the  end.
