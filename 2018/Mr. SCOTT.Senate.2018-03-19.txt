 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Banking  Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development,  today I wish to engage in a colloquy to discuss legislation that I  introduced, the Housing Opportunity Mortgage Expansion, HOME, Act, with  several of my colleagues to address an issue involving the Federal Home  Loan Bank, FHLB, system. The FHLB system is a cooperative organization  of 11 banks that support a mission of ``helping American families  realize the dream of home ownership, stimulate the creation of  affordable housing, and improve the local business environment.'' FHLBs  are privately capitalized by their 7,300 members and are subject to  strict oversight by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, FHFA. The HOME  Act is designed to correct the FHFA's perceived statutory limitation in  the FHL Bank Act that does not permit captive insurers to be considered  a class of the eligible insurance companies for membership in FHLBs.   In 2016, the FHFA determined that captive insurance firms were not  insurance firms for purposes of the FHLB Act. In making this  determination, the FHFA abruptly terminated the membership of  approximately four dozen captive insurance entities, including mortgage  real estate investment trusts, REITs, that were active and responsible  members of the FHLB system. These insurance captives greatly  contributed to the affordable housing mission of FHLBs through the use  of private capital versus taxpayer dollars, something that we should  always encourage. I thank Senators Duckworth, Johnson, and Baldwin for  their support of this legislation, which I am hopeful will receive  favorable consideration by this body in the future.   I yield to my friend from Illinois.
