 Today is December 14. The Senate Republicans have  spent months--literally months--begging our Democratic colleagues to  stop fiddling with partisan nonsense and focus on two core things: the  NDAA and government funding.   I have been talking about the need for a strong National Defense  Authorization Act all year long--all year long. I am glad we are  finally going to wrap up the basic governing duty that we have in the  next few days.   With respect to government funding, I was glad to hear Senator Shelby  announce yesterday evening that negotiators have reached a bipartisan,  bicameral framework for a full-year government funding bill.   Long-term continuing resolutions cheat our Armed Forces out of the  resources and the certainty that our commanders and civilian leaders  need to keep modernizing our forces, investing in crucial weapons, and  outcompeting adversaries such as China.   I am glad that our Democratic colleagues finally accepted reality and  conceded to the Republican position that we need to prioritize our  national security.   Republicans simply were not going to lavish extra liberal spending on  the Commander in Chief's own party as a reward for adequately funding  our national defense. It simply wasn't going to happen. Funding defense  is a basic, bipartisan duty of our government, not something that earns  Democrats special treats.   As Senator Shelby stated last night, this framework agreement doesn't  mean the hard work is over; it means the hard work can finally start.  It will take seriousness and good faith on both sides to produce actual  legislation that follows the framework.   Poison pills, especially far-left demands to overturn longstanding  and commonsense policy riders will need to stay away from the process.  And even then, the calendar will still make this a challenging sprint.  Our side has made it clear that the Senate has until December 22 to  complete either a full-year funding bill or a short-term CR into early  next year. That is the deadline, and those are the two options.   If a truly bipartisan full-year bill without poison pills is ready  for final Senate passage by late next week, then I will support it, for  our Armed Forces particularly. Otherwise, we will be passing a short- term continuing resolution into the new year.                                  Inflation    Mr. President, now on a different matter, against the backdrop of  punishing 13.8 percent cumulative inflation since January 2021, an open  borders crisis, spiking deaths from drug overdoses, and surging violent  crime from coast to coast, President Biden has decided that his A-1  priority needs to be--listen to this--cracking down on charter schools  and harming the educational opportunities available to millions of low- income students in the process.    Charter schools have long injected a huge dose of choice and  competition into the schooling options available to low-income  Americans and communities of color. This became especially true and  especially important back during the pandemic.   Big Labor teachers unions spent the entire pandemic forcing  government-run public schools to keep their doors shut long after  private schools, parochial schools, and schools across Europe were all  back operating safely in person.   Charter schools became a haven. They offered an escape rope out of  the learning loss for kids who would otherwise have been left behind.  No wonder that, according to one analysis, charter school enrollment  has surged since the pandemic started, even as public school  enrollments have fallen off.   But, sadly, whenever kids' best interests and Big Labor's pocketbooks  come into conflict, we know where most of today's Democratic Party will  come down. The Biden administration has dutifully written a harsh new  regulation that would intentionally chip away at the Federal charter  schools program and strip funding from many public charter schools.  President Biden and his team are trying to force charter schools to  conform to a whole new set of top-down, one-size-fits-all rules that  the teachers unions want to be forced onto their competitors.   The Democrats' rule is designed to hamstring charter schools and  leave them more reliant on government bureaucracies in everything from  what they teach to how kids get to school in the morning. Perhaps worst  of all, they want charter schools' Federal funding to be heavily  contingent on whether the Democrats' Federal bureaucracy agrees there  is a ``need'' for their existence.   This is a plan to take options away from parents, to take  opportunities away from kids, to take choice away from families, and to  transfer that power directly to Big Labor bosses and Big Government  bureaucrats--yet another example of Democrats' trying every trick to  make end-runs around parents' rights in education, stripping power away  from parents, and handing it over to the bureaucrats.   So I want to commend the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Tim  Scott, for bringing forward a Congressional Review Act resolution to  right this wrong. I would urge every Member of the Senate to put  families first and vote for Senator Scott's commonsense resolution.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
