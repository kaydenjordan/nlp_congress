 Madam Speaker, today is a serious and solemn day for our  country. The House's impeachment inquiry has exposed the truth and  uncovered significant evidence that the President abused his power.   To honor the oath to defend the Constitution that each of us took, we  must move forward with this impeachment inquiry. As Thomas Jefferson  once said hundreds of years ago: ``A sacred respect for the  constitutional law is the  [[Page H8694]]  vital principle, the sustaining energy of a free government.''   Let us honor the Constitution and defend it today by voting ``yes''  on this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, this bill that we are considering today, the  Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act, is about more than  partisan debate. This bill is about hiking; it is about hunting; it is  about fishing; it is about skiing--some of you all might not think I  ski, but I do--it is about camping; and it is about a Colorado way of  life and preserving our public lands.   The experiences we have outdoors with our loved ones bond us  together. And, for me, that was hiking with my father in Rocky Mountain  National Park.   Yesterday, my wife called me to let me know that our 1-year-old  daughter walked for the first time. I cannot wait to go back to  Colorado and be able to hike with my daughter in the iconic public  lands that are protected under this bill.   Ultimately, this bill is about ensuring that we protect our most  pristine and treasured places for generations long after we are gone.  That is the essence of our service: leaving a better world for those  who come next.   As Teddy Roosevelt once said: ``Here is your country. Cherish these  national wonders, cherish the natural resources, cherish the history  and the romance as a sacred heritage, for your children and your  children's children. Do not let selfish men or greedy interests skin  your country of its beauty, its riches, or its romance.''   At the end of the day, we have an obligation to protect these public  lands, which is why I am so honored to lead this bill. And I will just  say that we have worked incredibly hard to make this bill something  that our State can be proud of.   I am proud that the House has voted to accept two of my colleagues'  amendments, because in Colorado we get things done by collaboration and  consensus.   I am proud that every local jurisdiction impacted by a title of this  bill supports those very same titles--Republican and Democrat.   I am proud that this bill has bipartisan support back in the State of  Colorado.   It is unfortunate that this motion to recommit is not about any of  those things: It is not about improving the bill; it is not about  reaching consensus. It is purely political, and here is why.   Just a few moments ago, over 400 Members in this Chamber voted in  favor of an amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from  Colorado (Mr. Crow), who bravely served in our Armed Forces--fought for  our country in Afghanistan and Iraq--and he offered an amendment to  stress the importance of Colorado's Army National Guard High Altitude  Aviation Training Site.   That measure passed unanimously--or almost unanimously; I guess seven  or eight folks voted against it--because they recognized that the HAATS  program is something we must protect.   But the truth of the matter is this bill already addresses the  concerns offered by my colleague.   I will quote from the bill on page 37, subparagraph (f): ``Military  Overflights. Nothing in this title or an amendment made by this title  restricts or precludes any low-level overflight of military aircraft  over any area subject to this title or an amendment made by this title.  . . .''    I could go on, but you also are going to have to take my word for it.   I have a letter from the Colorado National Guard. As my colleague,  Mr. Crow, said yesterday during floor debate, we ought to listen to our  troops, to our commanders and what they have told us:         It is through the diligent efforts of staff within the       Department, the offices of the bill sponsors, and the       Department of Defense we have mitigated prior concerns       related to military overflight over the potential wilderness       areas identified in this bill, and I appreciate the efforts       of Congressman Neguse and yourself.    The letter from the Colorado National Guard concludes by thanking the  delegation for their effort to preserve Colorado's natural beauty and  looking forward to the passage of this important legislation. Those are  not my words, those are the words of the Colorado National Guard.   It is important for us not to lose sight of the bigger picture. The  CORE Act presents an opportunity for us to come together to show that  we can still govern on issues that are so important to all of our  constituents.   While I may be new to Congress, Mr. Speaker, the components of this  bill that we are slated to vote on in just a few short minutes are not  new to this Congress:   Title I of this bill has been introduced for five straight  Congresses;   Title II of this bill dates back to 2009;   Local advocates have been asking for the withdrawal of the Thompson  Divide since 2010;   Title IV of this bill was introduced in 2009.   Mr. Speaker, these bills have been around since George W. Bush was  President. When those bills were being drafted, the Washington  Nationals had not yet played their first game in Nationals Park.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask that we all vote against this motion to  recommit and support our public lands.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
