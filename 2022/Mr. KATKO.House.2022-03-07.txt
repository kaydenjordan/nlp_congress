 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5615, the Homeland  Security Capabilities Preservation Act.   The DHS Urban Area Security Initiative provides critical funding to  high-risk urban areas. Since UASI funding is risk-based, there are  urban areas that develop and support certain counterterrorism  capabilities using the grant funding but don't remain on the high-risk  list and therefore don't consistently receive funding every year.   This legislation simply directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to  submit to Congress a plan to make Federal assistance available for at  least 3 consecutive fiscal years to certain urban areas that did not  receive funding under UASI.   This plan will inform Congress about the needs and concerns of  certain urban areas that may not consistently receive such funding.   I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 5615, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5616, the DHS Basic  Training Accreditation Improvement Act of 2021.   This legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to  report to Congress on an annual basis on the accreditation status for  each basic training program within the Department. It also requires  congressional notification within 30 days of a lapse of accreditation  for any Department basic training program.   This legislation will help bring needed congressional oversight to  DHS basic training programs by ensuring that DHS is transparent about  any accreditation shortcomings and properly addresses them.   Madam Speaker, I urge members to join me in supporting H.R. 5616, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, I  think it is a good bill, and I commend my friend for bringing it to the  floor.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5681, the  Shadow Wolves Enhancement Act.   This bill authorizes adjustments to the job classifications of  officers assigned to the Homeland Security Investigations unit  operating in the Tohono O'odham Nation, also known as the Shadow  Wolves.   The Shadow Wolves are the Department of Homeland Security's only  tracking unit that is entirely composed of Native Americans. The Shadow  Wolves were established by congressional mandate in 1974 to combat  rampant smuggling that was occurring from Mexico into the United States  through the Tohono O'odham Nation.   For the past 40 years, the Shadow Wolves have been patrolling a 76- mile stretch of the border, utilizing a combination of high-tech  equipment and the traditional art of tracking passed down from  generation to generation on the Nation.   The Shadow Wolves take their name from the way the unit operates,  like a wolf pack, relying mostly on their ability to track. They use a  technique called cutting for sign, which closely observes and analyzes  any physical evidence left by smugglers. I was fortunate enough to  personally observe this impressive technique during my visit to Arizona  last year.   The Shadow Wolves' professionalism, skill, dedication, and presence  have proven critical for border security and are essential in building  Tribal stakeholder trust and engagement.   And for an elite unit, their operations couldn't be more impressive.  Between 2010 and 2020, Shadow Wolves' efforts led to 437 criminal  arrests, and the seizure of over 117,000 pounds of narcotics, 45  weapons, 251 vehicles, and over $800,000 in U.S. currency.   In recent years, the Shadow Wolves' mission has evolved from tracking  into more investigative work. Unfortunately, the current hiring  authority for the Shadow Wolves' program does not allow current Shadow  Wolves to be reclassified at the appropriate level for investigative  work, even if they have all the prerequisite experience.   Further, this lack of authority has led to pay inequities and limited  upward mobility for current Shadow Wolves officers. Without the passage  of this critical legislation, the entire Shadow Wolves program is at  risk of becoming nonoperational as current officers retire.   My bill, the Shadow Wolves Enhancement Act, allows current Shadow  Wolves to be reclassified as GS-1811 special agents upon the successful  completion of training. It also addresses pay equity for current Shadow  Wolves and allows new Native American applicants to be added to the  unit.   This bill also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop  a strategy to retain existing Shadow Wolves and expand comparable units  along the international land borders both north and south of our  country with the approval of appropriate Tribal governments.   Every day, the Shadow Wolves carry out a difficult and dangerous  mission under increasingly challenging circumstances. Every day, they  report for duty and help secure the border across arduous desert  terrain and rugged mountainous areas.   Today is the day that we in Congress honor their efforts and  modernize the Shadow Wolves program. Passage of this legislation will  provide long-term viability for a truly unique and necessary border  security program and a pathway for future Native American applicants.   This act has strong bipartisan support in the House and the Senate,  as well as support from the Department of Homeland Security and, of  course, the Tohono O'odham Nation.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a resolution from the Tohono  O'odham Nation Legislative Council in support of the Shadow Wolves  Enhancement Act.            Resolution of the Tohono O'odham Legislative Council       supporting federal legislation to reclassify homeland security    investigations tactical officers ``shadow wolves'' as special agents         Whereas, the Constitution of the Tohono O'odham Nation       vests the Legislative Council with the authority to       ``promote, protect and provide for public health, peace,       morals, education and general welfare of the Tohono O'odham       Nation and its members'' and to ``consult with the Congress       of the United States and appropriate federal agencies       regarding federal activities that affect the Tohono O'odham       Nation . . .'' (Constitution, Article VI, Section 1(c)(2) and       Section 1(j)); and        Whereas, the Tohono O'odham Nation (``Nation'') is a       federally recognized Indian tribe located on approximately       4,500 square miles in southern Arizona, with approximately 65       miles of its border on the International Boundary with       Mexico; and        Whereas, over many years, the Nation has cooperated with       the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to stem the flow of       narcotics and undocumented immigrants while maintaining the       Nation's opposition to a physical wall (Resolution No. 17-      053); and        Whereas, since 1974, the Nation has allowed the U.S.       Customs Service to staff a facility in Sells, and in return       the U.S. Customs Service employed up to 25 Native Americans       as Customs Patrol Officers; and        Whereas, around 1985, the U.S. Customs Service organized       these Native American Customs Patrol Officers into a select       unit which came to be known as the ``Shadow Wolves,'' which       utilized the unique knowledge and skill of Native Americans       to track and interdict smugglers crossing the lands of the       Nation; and        Whereas, the Shadow Wolves have gained an international       reputation as a small but highly effective interdiction unit       of the U.S. Customs Service; and        Whereas, U.S. Senator Kyrsten Sinema is proposing a bill to       authorize the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs       Enforcement to reclassify the members of the Shadow Wolves       unit from tactical officers to special agents; and        Whereas, this reclassification could improve the pay scale       for Shadow Wolves, improve their ability to enforce       immigration and customs laws, and better investigate and       track cross-border illegal activity; and        Whereas, the Nation's chairperson, Border Security       Delegation, Appropriations and Domestic Affairs Committees       have reviewed the legislation and recommend support.        Now, therefore, be it Resolved that the Tohono O'odham       Legislative Council supports federal legislation to       reclassify Homeland Security Investigations Tactical Officers       ``Shadow Wolves'' as special agents.        The foregoing Resolution was passed by the Tohono O'odham       Legislative Council on the 06th day of MARCH, 2020 at a       meeting at which a quorum was present with a vote of 3,175.7       FOR; -0- AGAINST; -0- NOT VOTING; and [02] ABSENT, pursuant       to the powers vested in the Council by Article VI, Section       l(c)(2) and (j) of the Constitution of the Tohono O'odham       Nation, adopted by the Tohono O'odham Nation on January 18,       1986; and approved by the Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary--      Indian Affairs (Operations) on March 6, 1986, pursuant to       Section 16 of the Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat.984).                                Tohono O'Odham Legislative Council:      Timothy Joaquin,        Legislative Chairman, 6 day of March, 2020.      Attest:      Evonne Wilson,        Legislative Secretary, 6 day of March, 2020.        Said Resolution was submitted for approval to the office of       the Chairman of the Tohono O'odham Nation on the 6 day of       March, 2020 at 4:54 o'clock, p.m., pursuant to the provisions       of Section 5 of Article VII of the Constitution and will       become effective upon his approval or upon his failure to       either approve or disapprove it within 48 hours of submittal.                                Tohono O'Odham Legislative Council:      Timothy Joaquin,        Legislative Chairman, on the 06 day of March, 2020 at 5:22       o'clock, p.m.      Ned Norris, Jr., Chairman, Tohono O'odham Nation.      Returned to the Legislative Secretary on the 6 day of March,           2020, at 5:32 o'c1ock, p.m.                                                     Evonne Wilson,                                             Legislative Secretary.     Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to support this critical legislation in support of our  Native American friends and partners.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of S. 658, the National Cybersecurity  Preparedness Consortium Act. This bill authorizes the Department of  Homeland Security to work with the National Cybersecurity Preparedness  Consortium to help prepare for and respond to cybersecurity risks at  the national, State, and local levels.   I applaud Senator Cornyn for his steadfast dedication to this most  important piece of legislation. Now more than ever, our State and local  communities must be prepared to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber  threats. Unfortunately, many of us have had constituent businesses,  schools, and hospitals, among others, that have been impacted by  persistent and evolving cyber threats.   This legislation will help provide training, exercises, technical  assistance, and other important resources to State and local  governments, critical infrastructure, and industry partners.   I thank Senator Cornyn for his work on this important bill. I urge  Members to join me in supporting S. 658, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
