 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to join a chorus of my  colleagues in speaking out against the nomination of Steven Mnuchin to  serve as Secretary of the Department of the Treasury.   What I believe is, if you look at Mr. Mnuchin's record, he has spent  a lot of time benefiting from--in fact, even exploiting--families who  are struggling homeowners in my State.   I would like to read into the Record a report by NPR from November of  last year which makes his pattern stunningly clear.         During the depths of the financial crisis, Mnuchin was       looking to make profits from the ruins of the housing bust.       In 2009, he put together a group of billionaire investors and       bought a failed California-based bank called IndyMac. It had       been taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation       after its sketchy mortgage loans went seriously bad.        Mnuchin and his partners bought IndyMac on the condition       that the FDIC agree to pay future losses above a certain       threshold. They renamed the bank OneWest Bank, and after       running it for 6 years, they sold it last year for a profit,       estimated at close to $1.5 billion.        Kevin Stein of the California Reinvestment Coalition, a       housing advocacy group, says that profit was made on the       backs of suffering Californian homeowners.    This is not in the text here, but homeowners who were suffering from  a massive mortgage collapse that was created in many ways or stimulated  by the greed and avarice of bad actors. I witnessed this myself in  Newark, NJ, watching people feed upon a subprime mortgage environment  where they were pushing bad loans on unsuspecting borrowers.    Back to the text:         In essence what they did is they bought a foreclosure       machine.        According to the coalition, OneWest foreclosed on more than       36,000 homeowners under Mnuchin. During that time, the FDIC       made payments to OneWest totaling more than $1 billion. Those       payments went to the billionaire investors of OneWest Bank,       says Stein, to cover the cost of foreclosing on working-class       everyday American folks, many of whom lived in California.    So this was what we saw at the height of the financial crisis. Mr.  Mnuchin, already very wealthy, already very successful, did not see  Americans struggling, did not join efforts to try to empower, support,  or deal with this crisis. What he saw was an opportunity to take over a  financial institution and continue, if not accelerate, the foreclosures  that were going on.   It has become painfully clear that in what Mr. Mnuchin oversaw in the  operations of this bank that, as its business model, he set out to  explicitly mislead and manipulate homeowners into foreclosure.   This one article that I read has been repeated by organizations and  by news outlets all over the spectrum, talking about how Mr. Mnuchin,  in this environment, worked very hard to accelerate foreclosures and  take advantage of this and make a profit. From elderly widows, the  stories continue, to families, to small business owners, to Active-Duty  servicemembers, there were many, many victims of Mr. Mnuchin's bank's  predatory tactics, taking advantage of folks in a crisis, as opposed to  trying to figure out a way to support folks through it.   I would like to read one more from the Minneapolis StarTribune, an  article that documented one instance of the disturbingly prevalent  practices of Mr. Mnuchin's company.   The headline reads: ``Negotiating on foreclosure, then locked out in  a blizzard.''         A Minneapolis woman who was negotiating with a lender to       find a way to stay in her foreclosed house--    Stepping back from the text, this is someone who is working hard to  do the right thing in negotiations.   Back to the text:         They arrived home from work during Tuesday night's blizzard       to find that the locks had been changed. After spending the       night at her mother's, Leslie Parks went Wednesday to       Hennepin County Housing Court, where a referee ordered that       she be allowed back into her mother's former duplex at 3749       Park Avenue while negotiations continued. Locksmiths on       Wednesday reconfigured the locks that had been changed       Tuesday by a contractor for OneWest Bank.    These are the kind of tactics that were being used, the kind of  hardball tactics that were being used by Mr. Mnuchin's company that  really undermined a lot of hard-working Americans from a variety of  backgrounds in many, many different States.   His record is clear. Mr. Mnuchin not only advocated in support of  this company and its tactics, but even now he talks about trying to  roll back the kind of protections that have been put in place to try to  protect average Americans. Many of them are in the Dodd-Frank  legislation that helped to protect against the creation of an  environment in which such predatory practices can take place.   This position that Mr. Mnuchin has been nominated for, which is the  Secretary of Treasury, has a critical role within our economy. But one  of those roles has to be the idea that average Americans will be  protected from the kind of financial victimization that was going on  during the recession--actually, which lead into the recession.   We see that we can prevent Wall Street from burdening Main Street  with the costs while they reap the rewards. This is the broken system  that we saw in the past that needs fixing and needs healing. We don't  need one of the architects of the system that caused so much pain to be  in one of the most important positions in our land.   The head of this vital agency must be someone who understands their  responsibility to look out for the struggling American trying to make  it by playing by the rules and someone who is qualified and willing to  direct the Department to fiercely protect the economic security of our  Nation, the economic well-being of the American people, and the  integrity of our financial system.   I don't believe Mr. Mnuchin is that person. He has made it clear in  his decades-long career that he is willing for a profit to work hard to  exploit hard-working families and shortchange homeowners for that  personal gain. This is unacceptable. Mr. Mnuchin has built a career and  has reaped literally millions of dollars of success by pushing people,  by exploiting people, and by hurting people.   The American people cannot afford to suffer through another financial  crisis. We can't afford to have a master Wall Street manipulator put in  the position that we should be relying on to protect us from that kind  of financial manipulation.   This is a difficult economy where people in our country are still  struggling under challenging financial  [[Page S1120]]  times. I believe that we can make a nation where people can do good and  do well at the same time, where we should not elevate or celebrate  people who really fed off of the misery and the challenges of others,  but, instead, that we can have a nation where we put people, regardless  of their political background, in positions like the Department of  Treasury to celebrate the best of who we are, the best of our values-- people who are public servants, people who have shown a commitment to  not only serve but even sacrifice for one another.   What we saw amidst this crisis--amidst a crisis that, in many ways,  was aggravated and caused by greed and avarice in the mortgage industry  and the banking industry, among rating agencies--was that many people  showed who they were in a time of American struggle and American  crisis. We saw with clarity where people's priorities were. Was it  exploiting people? Was it manipulating systems for their own avarice  and their own benefit, or was it for being there for our country,  trying to make thing things better, trying to give people bridges that  could carry them from financial struggle and strain to stability, or  people that were trying to crumble those bridges and have people free  fall in financial distress.   This is, unfortunately, what we see here today. We have President  Trump trying to elevate someone who has not shown a record of someone  who wanted to help but instead has shown a record of someone who wants  to hurt. That to me is unacceptable, especially at this time where so  many American families are still struggling to get back on their feet  to find financial security and find the pathway to their American  dream.   It is for this reason and more that I cannot support this nomination.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
