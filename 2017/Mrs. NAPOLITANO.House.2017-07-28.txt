 Madam Speaker, I was absent during rollcall votes  No. 436, No. 437, and No. 438 due to my spouse's health situation in  California. Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on H.R.  481--Providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 3180) Intelligence  Authorization Act for FY 2018. I would have also voted ``yea'' on H.R.  3180--Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. I would have  also voted ``yea'' on S. 114--Department of Veterans Affairs Bonus  Transparency Act.                             personal explanation
