 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of Ms. Plaskett's  amendment and just want to drill down on one point, which is, in the  name of job creation, we have this bill before us, and we are going to  spend $30 million which will, I suppose, create some jobs here in  Washington with some folks who sit on the commission and the staff who  are going to have to populate it.   But just a couple of days ago, President Trump had the manufacturing  CEOs of this country at the White House, and what they said was jobs  exist, but skills don't; that there is a skills gap in this country,  and that we need to have job training out there to connect people to  these jobs.   Well, we have the Workforce Investment Act that was signed into law  by President Obama in 2014, which created a framework for  apprenticeship programs, advance manufacturing programs, all the things  that these CEOs were talking about, and we are underfunding those  programs--just to take one, the Adult Formula Grants--by just about $30  million.   You want to create jobs? Don't spend $30 million on this ridiculous  commission when, again, we have so many other resources here in  Washington to review regulations. Let's put that money directly into  the programs that will create the skill sets so that people can  actually get a job to support themselves and their families. And don't  take it from us, take it from the CEOs who were with President Trump  just a few days ago about the fact that at a time when we have jobs in  existence, the fact that we are underfunding job training programs is  just totally criminal.    Let's use this $30 million in a more productive way that will  actually connect people to the jobs that are out there in the economy.
