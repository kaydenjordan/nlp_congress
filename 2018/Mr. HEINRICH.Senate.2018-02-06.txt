 Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent due to a family  medical emergency for rollcall vote No. 28. Had I been present, I would  have voted yea on the confirmation of Andrei Iancu, of California, to  be Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director  of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.                            ____________________
