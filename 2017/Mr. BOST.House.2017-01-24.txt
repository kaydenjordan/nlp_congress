 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is clearly divided. The division  was displayed when a group of students from Marion High School in my  district came to Washington for the inauguration weekend.   On the way back to their hotel on Saturday night, a group of  protesters surrounded their bus, threw projectiles through the windows,  and painted the bus. Imagine that. A group of history students coming  13 hours across this great Nation and wanting to participate in the  peaceful transfer of power only to be intimidated.   Free speech is essential to our democracy. However, acts of violence  and intimidation have no place. Now is the time for both parties to  move to get past this political division that is going through this  country.                            ____________________
