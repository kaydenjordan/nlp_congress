 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, and I rise today,  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the many persons who are peacefully  protesting and demanding justice for Breonna Taylor; peacefully  protesting and demanding justice.   But I also rise, Mr. Speaker, for the many persons who may never  protest, but believe that Breonna Taylor deserves justice.  [[Page H4722]]    I rise, Mr. Speaker, because my heart is heavy. It is difficult to  comprehend some of the things that are happening in this country. It is  expected that there will be some announcement in the near future as to  the fate of the officers who were engaged in the no-knock intrusion; a  no-knock intrusion.   Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you and the world what justice for  Breonna Taylor would look like. Justice for Breonna Taylor would look  the same as it would if Breonna Taylor were of a different hue. She was  an African-American female. She was in her apartment. She was not  breaking the law.   Justice for Breonna Taylor would look the same way it would look for  Breonna Taylor if she was were a White woman; a White woman in her  apartment; a White woman not breaking the law; a White woman who had  the police intrude into her home, as it were, with a no-knock warrant.  This is what justice would look like for Breonna Taylor.   And at some point in this country we have to acknowledge that there  is a perception that there is a system of justice that is not blind, a  system of justice that sees the color. And when the color of the person  is known, justice can sometimes turn a blind eye.   So today I rise, and I demand justice for Breonna Taylor, the same  justice that she would get if she were a different hue, in her home, 26  years old, committing no crime; the same justice.   And, finally, if we continue to allow the perception to exist that  injustice can be justified, it will not bode well for our country.   I stand for peaceful protest, and I denounce any form of protest  other than peaceful protest.   I demand justice for Breonna Taylor.                            ____________________
