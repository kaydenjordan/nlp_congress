 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  distinguished leadership and for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I want to focus in particular on where we are and where  we have been. I think it is important, as we discuss these issues  dealing with the Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act of 2017, that  we really have the responsibility, as Members of Congress, to engage in  safe and fair workplaces all over the Nation.   Certainly, I want to speak particularly about the Civil Service Act,  which I am stunned that this would extend the period of time for a  probationary period from 1 year to 2 years. But what is most striking,  since I am a member of the Judiciary Committee, is that Federal  employees will remain at-will employees for a period of time with  virtually no due process protection.   I clearly want to try to understand an administration that, first of  all, wants to make skinny the government to disallow it to do its work;  and then, on top of that, it wants to have temporary employees with no  due process rights.   Yesterday, we stood on the floor of the House to insist that there be  mandatory training for sexual harassment and, as well, to recognize  that there should be zero tolerance for sexual harassment and, of  course, sexual assault.   As an African-American woman, over the years, historically, we, along  with women all over the world, have seen the plight, or the  devastation, of sexual harassment and sexual assault. I was  disappointed that this floor could not vote on that resolution. I would  really ask for that resolution to be called up again so that this House  could go on record for supporting mandatory training.   At the same time, I think it balances, with due process, the work  that we have to do to make sure that we have a workplace that is  tolerable and allows women who feel insulted, harassed, and, God  forbid, assaulted easy, quick access to a pathway of relief.   This legislation and the underlying bill on this rule specifically  dealing with taking away due process rights from civil servant women  strikes me as the wrong direction to go in light of where we are. So I  am questioning this legislation. I think it is the wrong direction to  go. I, frankly, believe it should be pulled.    And as that legislation is pulled, I believe that we would do  ourselves well to reassert the resolution from yesterday and to cast a  vote. Let's get on the record of where we stand on the issues  protecting women against sexual harassment and sexual assault.   Finally, let me indicate that we are in the middle of appropriations.  We have not been compensated for the devastation of Hurricane Harvey.  My constituents are suffering. They are suffering in Puerto Rico, in  the Virgin Islands, and in Florida. The appropriation, or the  recommendation from the White House, is insufferable, unacceptable, and  it is time for us to move as a Congress to bring relief to the people  who have suffered from the hurricane.    Mr. Speaker, certainly my deepest thoughts as well  to the Hinchey family.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I come from an area that saw the  greatest catastrophic flooding in the history of the continental United  States. Someone asked me: I haven't heard anything from your State.   I said to them: We are still hurting.   We do have 120,000 to 130,000 homes still under water. People are  living in shells.   I am not selfish. I know what is going on in Puerto Rico, the U.S.  Virgin Islands, and Florida. We begged the administration to give us  the amount of money in their request for what was needed, and we got  $44 billion for every victim from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Puerto  Rico to Florida to Texas. I can't stand for that, for the desperate  people who are in need.   I ask the President to reevaluate his submission and to submit to us  a reasoned response to the devastation of this State and the other  States. I ask the appropriators, who I know are very concerned, to come  together to give us the emergency supplemental so that homes can be  rebuilt, that homes can be bought out, and that, in fact, the  infrastructure that is crumbling and caused the major flooding, that  reservoir pools that flooded whole complete developments, can be fixed,  that we can do infrastructure and save lives.   The people of the floods beg of you, and we will be in the fight.                            ____________________
