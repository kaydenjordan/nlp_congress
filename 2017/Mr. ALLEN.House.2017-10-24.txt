 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support my fellow Georgian's,  Congressman Doug Collins, bill, H.R. 469.   One of the biggest complaints I hear about the Federal Government is  the lack of accountability or these backroom deals. One glaring example  of this is what is referred to as sue and settlement litigation.   Under previous administrations, left-leaning groups would sue a  Federal agency to try and enact regulatory changes without going  through the normal rulemaking process. Both parties, the Federal  Government and special interest groups, settle in court with an  already-agreed-upon deal.   Regulatory rules are then made quickly without any public notice or  the input of any other relevant parties but carry the rule of law.   These new rules are often the most burdensome and cost our businesses  billions of dollars each year. This doesn't sound like draining the  swamp to me.   H.R. 469 stops these unfair arrangements by requiring agencies to  publicly post and report to Congress on sue and settlement complaints,  consent decrees, and settlement arrangements. It also prohibits the  same-day filing of complaints and settlement agreements in cases  seeking to compel agency action.   Congressman Collins' legislation, the Sunshine for Regulations and  Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act, will provide greater  accountability and transparency to the American public, while stopping  special interests from improperly influencing our Nation's regulatory  regime. We must uphold a fair and transparent regulatory process. The  American people demand this from us.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule on this  commonsense legislation.
