 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to talk about an extremely  qualified person who has been nominated to be the next Director of the  Central Intelligence Agency.   I just left a meeting with Gina Haspel, who is a woman who has spent  her entire career at the Central Intelligence Agency protecting our  country. Over the decades, she has been in the field a number of times  and has been in a number of dangerous situations. She has been an  analyst. She has been in leadership. She is currently the Deputy  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. By the way, she is the  first woman who has ever been the Deputy Director of this Agency. Of  course, she would be the first woman Director if she is to be  confirmed.   I had an opportunity to talk to her about a lot of issues, including  the morale at the CIA and how people feel about her being the Director.  As you can imagine, folks over there are extremely excited about this-- one of their own, someone they know and trust. They understand she has  their interests at heart. I think it would be terrific for that Agency  to have someone with her capability. She would be only the second  Director in the history of that Agency who came up through the ranks.   I also went down to what is called the SCIF, which is a place where  you can look at classified information. This week, I had the  opportunity to review her background, not just what is available  publicly but also what is in a classified form. Suffice it to say, I  was very impressed.   I spent my time looking at her record, looking at her background,  talking to her personally, talking to other people in the intelligence  community to understand the impact she would have on the men and women  of that Agency. I can state that I truly believe she is not only  qualified, but she may be the most qualified person you could think of  to run this Agency, and she will be good for the Agency.   I have the opportunity, when I go around the world to make visits on  behalf of the Foreign Relations Committee--I am a member of the Foreign  Relations Committee--to meet with CIA personnel. I was in Ukraine, in  the Czech Republic, in Germany over the Easter break, with our troops  on Easter, and had the opportunity to meet with some of the CIA  employees overseas. I can just state, you would be so proud if you had  the opportunity, as I have had, to meet with some of these people and  talk to them about what they are doing every day to help protect us and  the risks they take every day to help protect us on behalf of our  national security.   Who better to provide the President of the United States with the  sort of intelligence analysis needed to deal with so many challenges we  face around the world than someone who has been in the trenches, who  has been one of those people out in the field like the folks I met with  as recently as last month? She is someone who has a deep understanding  of intelligence operations.   By the way, she is not political at all--not a Republican, not a  Democrat. She is a career professional. What better Agency than the  Central Intelligence Agency to have someone who is a consummate  professional? I believe that is one reason she has such strong support  from former CIA Directors. You probably have seen this, but former  Secretaries of State and former CIA Directors have come forward to  support her, including Republicans and Democrats. The list includes  Leon Panetta, John Brennan, and James Clapper, who were all  intelligence leaders in the Obama administration. They have come out in  support of Gina Haspel. It is easy to see why she is so widely  supported.   Let me share one quick account I have read about. She is probably too  modest to talk about it. One of her assignments was in a difficult part  of the world, a dangerous part of the world. She was a station chief  there. She got news that there were two senior al-Qaida associates  linked to the Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. You may remember  those horrible bombings. They were on their way to the country where  she was stationed. With that little bit of information, she went to  work. As a result of her swift actions and her dedication and  intensity, she actually went full time, 24/7--they say she slept on the  office floor to the extent she slept at all--and she was able to  determine that these terrorists had gone to a particular hotel.  Intelligence tracked them there, and after a firefight, they were  apprehended. These two evil men who had killed so many people in Africa  through terrorist attacks were stopped, but just as important, their  computers were seized, and their computers revealed the next terror  plot they were planning. Lives were saved, and Gina Haspel was awarded  by George H.W. Bush the Award for Excellence in Counterterrorism.   So she has received a lot of honors like that throughout her career.  I tell you that story just to give you a sense of who this woman is  because I think when we hear debate in this Chamber and talking back  and forth, sometimes we forget the fact that these people do work in  dangerous situations to protect us.    She has been in situations where gunshots have been fired upon her  vehicle, as an example. She is one of those people who all of these  years has been out there serving us, and now for us not to support her,  I think would be the wrong thing to do.   I look forward to the confirmation. It will be another first for her,  the first woman Deputy Director, the first woman Director, but that is  not why she is doing it. She is doing it, as she told me today, because  she is a patriot.   She is from Kentucky, right across the river from where I live in  Cincinnati, OH. She grew up as a kid who believed in patriotism and  service and protecting our country, and she has devoted her life to  this.   One final point I hope some of my colleagues who might be listening  or who are undecided might think about. This is an incredibly dangerous  world we live in right now. Unfortunately, we face a lot of dangers. I  just had the chance to talk to Gina Haspel about what is happening with  regard to Iran, Syria, and the latest news with regard to the conflict  between Israel and Syria. We had a chance to talk at some length about  what is happening with regard to the Russian influence in Eastern  Europe and particularly what is going on on the eastern border of  Ukraine--the line of contact where I was a month ago, learning some of  the challenges we now have with getting good intelligence with regard  to what is happening in that part of the world. We talked about issues  relating to North Korea and the recent return of the three hostages. I  can just state, without going into detail, this woman knows the world.  There would be no on-the-job training. She has been Deputy Director for  18 months, but long before that she had a grasp of what is going on  around the world. She knows the people around the world, and she knows  her senior leadership team as well. She is a woman who is prepared to  step forward at a time when we cannot afford mistakes, when we need to  have somebody who has that experience.   I would just say to the families we all represent, we are charged  with voting up here, but ultimately we are charged with representing  millions of Americans, each of us in our respective States. Think about  their safety and think about whom you would want--whom you would want  in that position. I would challenge my colleagues to think of somebody  who is better qualified.   I know there are some concerns that have been raised by some of my  colleagues about actions that were taken by the CIA immediately after  9/11. One, we have to put ourselves in that mindset after 9/11 and the  great dangers we faced. Certain decisions were made that were  considered absolutely legal. In fact, the congressional leadership, the  so-called Big Eight, including the Intelligence Committee, Democrats  and Republicans, were all read into it and knew what was going on and  were approving of it. In fact, some would say that some Members of  Congress even pushed the CIA to do even more in terms of interrogating  people and getting more information to reveal thoughts that were being  planned to save lives.   I understand there is new thinking about that, and Gina Haspel  herself  [[Page S2614]]  said in her testimony yesterday that she has evolved her thinking about  that, but I would ask those same Members who were talking about what  happened in the early 1990s to think about what is happening today and  to wonder who could be more qualified.   By the way, if she is not qualified, that means a number of other  people, such as anybody in a senior leadership role at the CIA who  happened to have been there at that time, would not be qualified,  including John Brennan would not be qualified, who got a large  bipartisan vote in this body to be the Director of the CIA, even though  he was in a higher leadership role at that time at the CIA.   So, again, I hope she will be confirmed. I think she will be  confirmed, but I do hope that any colleagues who are wondering which  way to go will think about where we are today. It is a dangerous and  volatile world. We do need somebody who has that experience, knowledge,  background, and wisdom that comes with years of experience borne of  actual experience in the field. And to have this smart, decent, well- qualified woman not be confirmed would be not just bad for the CIA but  bad for our country and indeed bad for what all of us hope for, which  is a more peaceful world and one where we do have the kind of  intelligence we need to be able to keep that peace.
