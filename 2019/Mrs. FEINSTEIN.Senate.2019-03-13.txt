 Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the  nomination of Neomi Rao to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC  Circuit.   The DC Circuit is considered by many to be the most powerful  appellate court in the country. This is true in large part because the  DC Circuit hears challenges to many actions taken by the Federal  Government, including challenges to the adoption or repeal of Federal  regulations.   I believe it is particularly relevant that Ms. Rao has a record of  working to dismantle key regulations that ensure the air we breathe is  safe, that address climate change, and that protect American workers  and consumers.   Ms. Rao has a troubling and aggressive record as the head of the  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. She has led efforts to  weaken fuel economy, or CAFE standards, which I authored with Senator  Olympia Snowe and which has been the law since 2007. Before the  administration proposed freezing these standards, we were set to  achieve a fuel economy standard of 54 miles per gallon--MPG--by 2025.  [[Page S1818]]    Ms. Rao has also led efforts to repeal the Clean Power Plan. This  repeal has been estimated to result in up to 1,400 premature deaths  annually by 2030, due to an increase in particulate matter from  emissions that are linked to heart and lung disease. Further, the  repeal of the Clean Power Plan is expected to cause up to 48,000 new  cases of serious asthma and 15,000 new cases of upper respiratory  problems every year.   Ms. Rao was also instrumental in reversing the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission's actions to address pay discrimination.  Specifically, Ms. Rao eliminated reporting requirements proposed by the  EEOC that were designed to identify wage discrimination on the basis of  gender or race. Just last week, a Federal judge ruled that Ms. Rao's  action was ``arbitrary and capricious,'' which is significant because  the arbitrary and capricious standard is high and hard to prove. The  judge concluded that Ms. Rao's rationale for her decision was  ``unsupported by any analysis.''   Ms. Rao also approved the recently finalized title X ``gag rule'' on  family planning. Under this rule, any organization that merely refers  patients to an abortion provider is ineligible for title X funding.  This will result in many women going without lifesaving cancer  screenings, and it will reduce access to contraception.   I asked Ms. Rao about her work dismantling these key regulations. In  response to me, she downplayed her responsibility, saying that her role  was simply to ``coordinate regulatory policy.''   But when answering the questions of Republican Senators, Ms. Rao  expressed pride in her work. Asked specifically about her ``primary  contribution to pushing forward with deregulation,'' Ms. Rao responded:  ``There are a lot of regulations on the books that don't have the  effects that were intended . . . . And, you know, we're looking to pull  back the things that are no longer working.''   However, to take just one example, the CAFE standards have been  working; they have already saved $65 billion in fuel costs for American  families and prevented the emission of 250 million metric tons of  carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, her words don't match the actual actions  under her leadership.   Moreover, I asked Ms. Rao if she would commit to recusing herself  from any case involving regulations that she worked on while serving in  her current position. She refused to make such a commitment.   This is of great concern as other nominees have understood the  appearance of bias and unequivocally made such commitments.   For example, President Trump's first nominee to the DC Circuit, Greg  Katsas, said, ``Under the governing statute, I would have to recuse  myself from any case in which, while in the Executive Branch, I had  participated as a counsel or advisor or expressed an opinion on the  merits.''   In addition to her record of dismantling key regulations that protect  the environment, consumers, and worker health and safety, Ms. Rao has  taken a number of extremely controversial positions in articles she has  written. At Ms. Rao's hearing before the Judiciary Committee, I noted  that, while the writings that received the most attention are from when  she was in college, several are relevant to the work she has led in the  Trump administration and to cases she could hear if confirmed.   For instance, in addressing the issue of date rape, Ms. Rao wrote  that if a woman ``drinks to the point where she can no longer choose,  well, getting to that point was part of her choice.''   While she has since written a letter expressing that she ``lacked the  perspective of how [her articles] might be perceived by others,'' her  record demonstrates that these views seem to persist to today.  Specifically, Ms. Rao has been personally involved in repealing  protections for survivors of campus sexual violence. Ms. Rao has  acknowledged that her office approved controversial new rules on campus  sexual assault under title IX. Those rules would discourage survivors  from reporting their assaults, in part because survivors would be  subjected to cross-examination by their attacker's chosen  representative. It is safe to assume this change in the guidance will  be challenged in the DC Circuit.   In her writings, Ms. Rao also questioned the validity of climate  change, criticizing certain student groups for promoting ``a dangerous  orthodoxy that includes the unquestioning acceptance of controversial  theories like the greenhouse effect,'' which she argued ``have come  under serious scientific attack.''   Again, at the hearing, she tried to mitigate these writings saying,  it was her ``understanding . . . that human activity does contribute to  climate change.''   However, during her tenure in the Trump administration, she has led  the effort to overturn the very regulations that combat human  contributions to climate change. For example, and as I noted  previously, she has overseen the administration's efforts to rescind  the Clean Power Plan and weaken fuel economy standards.   I am also concerned about Ms. Rao's professional experience. She is  not admitted to practice before the DC Circuit, the court to which she  has been nominated. She has never served as a judge, and she has never  even tried a case.   In response to a question on the Judiciary Committee's questionnaire  about the 10 most significant litigated matters that she personally  handled, Ms. Rao listed only three, and two of these were arbitration  cases that she worked on while serving as an attorney in the United  Kingdom.   Ms. Rao's lack of litigation experience therefore raises an important  question as to her qualifications for this seat and suggests that she  was nominated not because of her appellate credentials, but because of  her anti-regulatory record.   I also have questions about commitments Ms. Rao appears to have made  on reproductive rights. I don't believe we should have litmus tests for  judicial nominees, and I know many on the other side agree with me on  that. Just in 2017, Senator McConnell said, ``I don't think there  should be a litmus test on judges no matter who the president is.''   Yet, on a recent radio program, Senator Hawley said that, before he  could vote for Ms. Rao, he wanted to ``make sure that Neomi Rao is pro- life. It's as simple as that.''   Subsequently, Ms. Rao met with Senator Hawley in private and  presumably assured him that she would be anti-choice. According to  Senator Hawley, Ms. Rao went further and ``emphasized that substantive  due process finds no textual support in the Constitution.''   Rejecting the entire concept of substantive due process means that  Ms. Rao not only believes Roe v. Wade was incorrectly decided, but also  other landmark cases, like Griswold v. Connecticut, which held that  States cannot restrict the use of contraception.   I am also concerned about her written responses to our questions for  the record. She gave several responses that were misleading at best.   Ms. Rao wrote that the center she founded at George Mason University  ``did not receive any money from the Koch Foundation.'' She added that  the center ``did not receive money from an anonymous donor.''   However, according to public records, in 2016, George Mason  University received $10 million from the Koch Foundation and $20  million from an anonymous donor. The grant agreements executing these  donations clearly state that support for Ms. Rao's center was one of  the conditions of these multimillion dollar gifts and ``Ms. Rao's  center benefited from those contributions.''   Additionally, Senator Whitehouse asked Ms. Rao if she had any contact  with the Federalist Society when considering potential faculty. Ms. Rao  responded ``no,'' but clarified the Federalist Society occasionally  made recommendations through its faculty division.   What Ms. Rao failed to mention is that she, herself, was a member of  the faculty division of the Federalist Society for her entire time in  academia. Given this role, I don't understand why she would claim that  she had no contact with the Federalist Society when considering faculty  candidates.   In closing, my concerns about Ms. Rao, from her writings to her work  dismantling regulations to her lack of candor with the committee, are  simply too great for me to support her nomination to the DC Circuit. I  will vote  [[Page S1819]]  against her confirmation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Rim of  the Valley Corridor Preservation Act.'' This legislation would expand  the boundaries of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area  by 191,000 acres.   This legislation would provide surrounding communities with much- needed access to nature and open space, while maintaining private  property rights and existing local land-use authorities.   The proposed expansion is based upon findings of the National Park  Service after a six-year special resource study of the area.   This study was directed by Congress in the Rim of the Valley Corridor  Study Act, passed in 2008.   The National Park Service's recommendation takes into account over  2,000 comments received from the public, elected officials, local  organizations, and other stakeholders.   This bill would add an additional 191,000 acres, known as the Rim of  the Valley Unit, to the existing Santa Monica Mountains National  Recreation area to provide members of the local community with improved  recreational and educational opportunities.   The proposed expansion would also better protect natural resources  and habitats, including valuable habitat for endangered wildlife, such  as the California red-legged frog, mountain lions, bobcats, foxes,  badgers, coyotes, and deer.   Notably, the ``Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act'' would  only allow the Department of the Interior to acquire non-Federal land  within the new boundaries through exchange, donation, or purchase from  willing sellers.   I want to highlight that this legislation will not create any  additional liability or restrictions for private property owners.   This legislation will significantly expand outdoor recreational  opportunities for residents of Los Angeles County, one of the most  densely populated and park-poor areas in California.   In fact, 47% of Californians--that's six percent of the total U.S.  population--live within two hours of the proposed expansion area.  Enlarging the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, at no  cost to U.S. taxpayers, will provide these communities with increased  access to public lands and boost the local economy.   This bill enjoys the support of more than 50 local municipalities,  community groups, and elected officials. It is the product of  significant public engagement in the legislative process.   I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Adam Schiff, for  re-introducing this legislation in the House.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the ``Rim of the  Valley Corridor Preservation Act'' as quickly as possible.   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Markey, Ms. Hirono, Mr.          Blumenthal, and Mrs. Gillibrand):   S. 783.
