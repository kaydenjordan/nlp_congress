 Mr. Speaker, this week is Rural Health  Week in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and today is National Rural  Health Day.   It is a time to promote awareness of the full range of issues that  impact approximately 60 million rural Americans. Pennsylvania ranks as  one of the States with the highest number of rural residents, with 23  percent of Pennsylvanians residing in rural areas.   Rural communities face unique healthcare concerns, such as a lack of  providers; accessibility issues, particularly in terms of  transportation and technology; affordability issues as a result of  larger percentages of uninsured and underinsured citizens; and greater  out-of-pocket health costs.   Mr. Speaker, before I was elected to the House of Representatives, I  spent nearly 30 years in the nonprofit healthcare field assisting those  facing life-changing diseases and disabilities. I am acutely aware of  the challenges many face when it comes to obtaining reasonably priced  healthcare. It is especially critical for rural America, like much of  my congressional district.   We are facing a healthcare crisis in our Nation's rural areas. These  often disadvantaged populations are still struggling to access  affordable quality care. Many remain uninsured; most are underinsured.  However, access to quality care remains the largest challenge.   Even when people gain access to health insurance, it does not equal  access to care. Rural hospitals across the country are closing, leaving  patients without access to their emergency rooms and their long-term  care facilities.   Mr. Speaker, 90 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, and nearly  700 are at risk. One in three rural hospitals is financially  vulnerable. At the current closure rate, more than 25 percent of rural  hospitals will close in less than a decade.   Continued cuts in hospital payments have taken their toll, forcing  hospitals to operate in the red until they finally make the painful  decision to stop providing care. Between 2017 and 2018, the number of  rural hospitals operating at a loss rose from 40 to 44 percent.   In addition to hospital closures, a workforce shortage plagues rural  America. Mr. Speaker, 77 percent of  [[Page H9536]]  more than 2,000 rural communities in the United States are designated  as having a shortage of healthcare professionals. Recruitment and  retention of experienced professionals, including primary care  physicians, is an ongoing challenge.   That is why I am a proud sponsor of H.R. 5641, the State Offices of  Rural Health Reauthorization Bill of 2018. This legislation benefits  States by increasing annual funding and reauthorizing vital programs  for rural Americans for the first time since the 1990s. I urge my  colleagues to cosponsor this piece of legislation today.   Another issue that has ravaged our rural communities is the opioid  epidemic. It continues to leave even more rural Americans in need of  crucial health services.   Adolescents and young adults living in rural areas are more  vulnerable to opioid abuse than their urban counterparts. The  prevalence of fatal drug overdoses has skyrocketed in rural areas. High  unemployment and a greater rate of the types of injuries that result in  prescriptions for opioid medications have contributed to this.   There are ways to increase treatment options. As a part of the VA  MISSION Act, which was signed into law in June, I included a provision  that expands healthcare access for our veterans through telemedicine.  We now allow VA-credentialed healthcare providers to practice  telemedicine across State lines.   Mr. Speaker, our veterans should receive the best care possible no  matter where they are located and where they live. With advances in  technology, we see new opportunities for veterans to obtain coverage  through telemedicine, especially in some of our most rural areas.   For those in rural regions, the need is great and services are  scarce. Let us all recognize and celebrate the power of our vibrant  rural communities in the face of these grave challenges.   As we celebrate National Rural Health Day today, it is my hope that  we continue to strive for a 21st century healthcare system that works  for everyone in America. Thanks to technology, we have the opportunity  to expand services, regardless of where one resides, and all Americans  deserve no less.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Penn State University  recently hosted its Military Appreciation Week, and this year's theme  honored 100 years of women who answered the call to duty.   Women have played a role in every major war in United States history,  and their contributions have continuously evolved over time; and today,  women now serve in nearly every combat role in the United States Armed  Forces around the world.   During World War I, nearly 30,000 women enlisted as nurses, clerks,  and telephone operators. Dating as far back as the American  Revolutionary War, women volunteered as nurses, spies, cooks,  ammunition carriers, water bearers, and more.   To kick things off, the Nittany Lions football team defeated Iowa on  Saturday, October 27, for the Military Appreciation Game.   Over the course of 2 weeks, Penn State continued to host several  numerous events and festivities to recognize servicemembers, veterans,  and military families. The celebrations continued through Monday, when  we observed Veterans Day.   Mr. Speaker, these annual military appreciation events give all Penn  Staters and community members a chance to honor those who bravely  served our country, and we are grateful for all of our American heroes.                            ____________________
