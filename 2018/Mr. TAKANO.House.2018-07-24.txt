 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2409, as amended, to allow  certain servicemembers to terminate their cable, satellite television,  and Internet service contracts while deployed. This is an important  part of modernizing the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and helps it  reflect the current lifestyle of servicemembers.   Internet and television access have become necessities in the modern  world. The SCRA is key to protecting the rights of servicemembers and  allowing them to fulfill their service obligations.   I would like to thank the chairman for working with the minority to  match this bill to the changes we are making under H.R. 5882, as  amended, the Gold Star Spouses Leasing Relief Act, which we will also  be voting on today.   I would also like to thank the chairman for working with us on  including National Guard and reservist servicemembers who are killed  while on duty.   Lastly, I want to recognize Mr. Kilmer and Mr. McGovern for working  with Mr. Costello to bring this important bill forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer), my good friend.                                time  1815     Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing  H.R. 2409, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H7133]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2787, as amended, the Vet MD  Act.   The Department of Veterans Affairs, like the Nation, is experiencing  a shortage of healthcare providers. With shortages in areas like mental  healthcare and medical administration, it can become increasingly  difficult to maintain a facility's efficiency and quality. That is why  it is increasingly important to promote medical education and  employment within VA as soon in a student's educational career as is  possible.   This bill allows VA to capture students as they complete their  premedical undergraduate degrees by offering them the opportunity to  shadow medical professionals in VA facilities. Not only does this  create a familiarity with VA among the students, but allows VA to  continue to do one of the things it does best: educate the Nation's  future healthcare providers.   I appreciate the hard work of my colleague, Representative Kaptur,  and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Vet MD Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 45 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I was listening to my friend from the State of Ohio,  I was struck by just how the process of legislating in this body works,  how ideas come from very real people seeking to solve problems through  their Representative. And I watched this legislation move through  committee, the gentlewoman graciously accepting the changes and  approving the bill.   I know that my colleague from Tennessee, a doctor himself, cares so  much about medical education. We worked together on expanding the  number of medical residencies.   I am delighted this bill has come to the floor so expeditiously.  Often, legislation takes so much time to win its way through, but an  idea that was very worthy moved through and, I think, in record time.   So, again, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing  H.R. 2787, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5538, the Reserve Component  Vocational Rehabilitation Parity Act.   This bill protects an overlooked provision related to our National  Guard and Reserve servicemembers who are mobilized under 12304b  authorities. This bill allows servicemembers to pause the clock on the  12-year limit to use vocational rehabilitation programs while mobilized  on Active Duty orders. Currently, this is allowed for mostly  mobilization authorities, but this particular authority was overlooked.  Simply, the bill adds to 12304a and 12304b authorities to the 12304  provision already listed within the statute.   This is an important fix because of the increased use of 12304b  authority by the Department of Defense over the past few years, and the  increases planned for the future. As we move the Reserve components  from a strategic reserve to an operational reserve concept, it is  critically important that we modernize our statutes to ensure benefits  parity while servicemembers are in uniform. This is a step in the right  direction.   With this bill, Congress has the opportunity to be proactive, instead  of reactive, to the needs of our servicemembers.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Peters for bringing this issue forward and  identifying a fix. He is a reliable and critical advocate for our  country's National Guard and Reserve servicemembers. I also thank Mr.  Bergman for reaching across the aisle and joining Mr. Peters in  introducing this bill. And I thank the co-chairs of the House's  National Guard and Reserve Components Caucus, Mr. Walz and Mr. Palazzo,  for supporting the initiative. Lastly, I thank the six other members of  our committee who were original cosponsors of the bill, including Mr.  O'Rourke, Ms. Brownley, and Ms. Kuster.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters), a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee,  the author of this bill, and my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing  H.R. 5538, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5649, as amended, the Navy  SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder (Ret.) Transition  Improvements Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee chairman,  Mr. Arrington, and ranking member, Mr. O'Rourke, for their bipartisan  focus on this issue and the bipartisan way they have crafted this piece  of legislation and have moved it forward.   This bill was generated out of feedback from our veteran service  organization partners, rigorous oversight, and many, many hearings. It  includes a number of curriculum changes, expansion of services, as well  as first steps to making TAP a part of a larger transition effort.   It also includes Ms. Brownley's Reduce Unemployment for Veterans of  All Ages Act, which eliminates the period of eligibility for vocational  rehabilitation services. Currently, veterans have only 12 years after  their military service to utilize vocational rehabilitation services.  This removes that deadline and allows anyone who qualifies for  vocational rehabilitation to access those services in perpetuity.   It also includes Mr. Poe's Veterans Education Disaster Act that  provides continued educational assistance to students impacted by  natural disasters. This is similar to the benefits that are provided  for veterans whose schools suddenly close their doors, in order to  ensure that veterans are not struggling while they seek to restart  their education. This would also allow veterans to continue collecting  their housing benefits even though their schools closed from natural  disasters, and allow them to stop and restart their tuition benefits  once their schools reopen.   We also pay for this bill by closing a loophole in flight school  costs, while also making modifications to law that allows for the  unique nature of flight schools.   All of these provisions have been crafted to fix issues we have seen  in the field, and they will make life a little bit easier for our  veterans.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. Arrington for these  necessary improvements to the Transition Assistance Program. A  testament to their work is the broad support they have received from  committee members for this bill, including Ms. Kuster, Mr. Peters, and  Ms. Esty. I look forward to their future work on this as they continue  to focus on and refine the program.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The work of this subcommittee is the work of great heart, and I  appreciate the heartfelt work that the chairman, Mr. Arrington, has put  forward.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke), my good  friend, the ranking member of the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee, a  gentleman with great heart for veterans.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. Esty), my good friend, and the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a very special piece of legislation to me. I was  once the ranking member of this very subcommittee, and I applaud the  work of Ranking Member Beto O'Rourke and Chairman Arrington. This is a  work of great heart, of great compassion, and we all know that we need  to improve the transition from military service to civilian life for  our servicemembers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 5649, as  amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1900     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5882, as amended, the Gold  Star Spouses Leasing Relief Act.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to first start by thanking the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos) for drafting this bill. It would allow the  spouse of a servicemember to terminate their lease after the death of  the servicemember.   Oftentimes, servicemembers and their families are required to move  far away from home due to the needs of the service and where the  servicemember is stationed. In the difficult time after the passing of  a servicemember, spouses should not be stuck in a lease far away from  their home and support network. This may seem like a small detail, but  it is something that can make life just a little bit easier in a very  trying time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman for working with us  on including National Guard and Reserve servicemembers who are killed  while on duty.   As we move the Reserve components from a Strategic Reserve to an  Operational Reserve concept, we are seeing too many deaths of National  Guardsmen and -women and reservists while they are in uniform. It is  critically important that we modernize our statutes to ensure benefits  parity while servicemembers are in uniform.   Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), for working on this issue and Mr. Wenstrup for  joining her in introducing the bill. I would also like to thank our  fellow committee members, Ms. Kuster, Ms. Brownley, and Miss Gonzalez- Colon, for cosponsoring this bill and raising the profile of this  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), my good friend and the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing  H.R. 5882, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for introducing  this important piece of legislation. I am dumbfounded that we have  landlords who would not recognize the situation of a fallen soldier,  but this law is necessary, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5864, as amended, the VA  Hospitals Establishing Leadership Performance Act, or VA HELP Act.   Due to nationwide shortages, nuanced certification and licensing  requirements, and complex position descriptions, human resource  professionals working in the healthcare industry must possess a unique  set of skills and qualifications.   Human resource professionals working within the VA must further  develop their skills while learning how to leverage the many hiring  initiatives, budgetary concerns, and Federal resources in a way that  can compete with the private sector's financial incentives.   The VA HELP Act is an effort to assist the VA in finding the unique  talent it needs to fill these health-specific human resource officers  by requiring the VA to establish qualifications and standardized  performance metrics for each human resource position within VHA.   By further defining the human resource positions within VHA and  standardizing performance metrics, the VA will be able to more easily  to attract, access, and retain quality human resource officers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 5864, as  amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5938, as amended, the Veterans  Serving Veterans Act of 2018.   Veterans exit the military with the highest quality of education and  experience in their respective fields. We, along with the private  sector, have worked diligently to ensure servicemembers are able to  translate their skills to the private industry. However, this bill  takes our efforts a step further by allowing the VA to create a  searchable vacancy and recruitment database containing each VA vacancy  and the corresponding military occupation code or skill that  corresponds to the positions.   The database will also allow interested servicemembers to opt in to  be included in the database, so that the VA may begin recruiting  transitioning servicemembers to fill vacant positions before their  discharges are complete.   In addition to the creation of the database, the bill also allows the  Secretary to create a pilot program to train servicemembers who served  as basic healthcare technicians while serving in the Armed Forces to be  trained as intermediate care technicians at the VHA.   By creating a pipeline from service to bedside, the VA can better  treat the 9 million veterans who depend on its services.   I appreciate the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon)  for her hard work on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing  H.R. 5938, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5974, as amended, the  Department of Veterans Affairs Creation of On-Site Treatment Systems  Affording Veterans Improvements and Numerous General Safety  Enhancements Act, otherwise known as the VA COST SAVINGS Enhancements  Act.   Mr. Speaker, the current funding issues currently surrounding VA are  evidence of the need for creative cost savings measures. I must thank  Representative Denham in identifying and championing one such creative  solution.   The VA COST SAVINGS Enhancements Act simply asks VHA to review its  current medical waste disposal system and determine whether hosting  this disposal onsite would result in cost savings over the next 5  years. If so, then the facility is required to implement onsite  disposal.   Onsite medical waste disposal is safer and far more efficient in most  cases, and this bill would simply require VHA to ensure they are  achieving the safest and most cost-effective method of medical waste  disposal.   Again, I thank Representative Denham for his work on the bill, and I  [[Page H7145]]  urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I ask my  colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 5974, as amended, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
