 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the moon landing and New Hampshire's role in this  important moment of history.   On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin completed their 13th  orbit around the Moon and fired up the descent engine on the now- historic Eagle Apollo Lunar Module. With pilot Michael Collins staying  behind in the command module, Columbia, these American heroes, with the  entire world watching and backed by a whole generation of scientists,  engineers, and specialists supporting them on the ground, began their  initial descent to be the first humans to set foot on another planetary  body.   What many Americans may not know is that as both pilots began their  historic descent, critical New Hampshire-made technology was helping  them along the way. Sensors made by RdF Corporation in Hudson were a  part of the lunar module propulsion system guiding them to the lunar  surface. RdF sensors were also on their spacesuits as they took that  first giant leap for mankind.   RdF, which continues to support the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, NASA, as it looks to return to the Moon and then Mars,  is just one of the many innovative small businesses in the Granite  State that have played such a critical role in our country's space  program.   For example, the Saturn V rocket program, which launched the Apollo  crews to the Moon, benefitted from a state-of-the-art computerized  system which was developed at Sanders Associates in Nashua, now a part  of BAE Systems. HaighFarr in Bedford has been in business for over 50  years designing complex antennas for the space program and has played a  significant role in our Mars lander and rover programs. Mikrolar, in  Hampton, manufactures high precision positioning systems and is a  critical piece of the James Webb Telescope, which will be the successor  to the Hubble sometime in the next decade.   The fact is that New Hampshire's pioneering and innovative small  business community has been a mainstay in the aerospace community for  decades and remains so today. As the ranking member on the  Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees and funds NASA, I am  supportive of NASA's efforts to get us back to the Moon and eventually  Mars, particularly because I know Granite State businesses will be  leading those efforts.   It is not just the private sector in New Hampshire that has stepped  up to keep us competitive in science and space. It is also our  educational community. The University of New Hampshire, UNH, is a key  contributor to NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been in  orbit around the Moon since 2009. The New Hampshire Space Grant  Consortium, which includes nine Granite State affiliates, including  UNH, Dartmouth, and our very own McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center, is  focused on educating our future scientists and space technicians.   A true accounting of New Hampshire's role in space would not be  complete without calling attention to two of our State's most  impressive space-faring heroes: Alan Shepard and Christa McAuliffe.  [[Page S5099]]    Alan Shepard was from Derry and is better known to the rest of the  world as the first American in space. His historic 1961 Mercury flight  paved the way for the Apollo missions to the Moon. I am also reminded  that, as the commander of the follow-on Apollo 14 mission, he also  became the first human to golf on the Moon's surface.   Christa McAuliffe's legacy as an advocate for her students and for  science education continues to inspire to this day. New Hampshire and  the entire country are proud of her pioneering efforts. Earlier this  month, the entire U.S. Senate honored that legacy and passed my  legislation authorizing the U.S. Mint to produce a commemorative coin  in her honor.   As we continue to celebrate these American achievements, we also  celebrate the New Hampshire businesses, institutions, and people who  helped make that possible and remember the pride Americans everywhere  felt that day.   I also hope that the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing will serve  as a wake-up call to all of us, a statement of the great things our  country can do when we stand united, working together, and focused on a  common goal. We need more of that today. I hope we will look to heroes  like Christa McAuliffe, Alan Shepard, and the Apollo 11 crew as we  rededicate ourselves as a nation to achieving the impossible.                            ____________________
