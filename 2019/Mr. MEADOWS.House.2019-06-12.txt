 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his passion, for  his advocacy, and for truly making sure that we set the record  straight.   The gentleman from Texas has his heart in the right place. Actually,  the gentlewoman who spoke earlier, she and I actually met the very  first time, we came together--a liberal from the northeast, a  conservative from the south--to actually address human trafficking  together.   I think it is high time that in a bipartisan way we get together,  work together on this supplemental, and let's do it tonight. Instead of  having show votes, let's make sure that we provide the money that the  President has requested to make sure that the humanitarian needs at the  border are taken care of.   The gentleman from Maryland is exactly right, now is the time to act.  Let's show the compassion with our vote.
