 Mr. President, reserving the right to object. We are in a  global fight against fascism and authoritarianism. We are seeing it in  Putin's war in Ukraine, and we are seeing it with Hamas and the  unspeakable horrors it committed on and since October 7. And we are  seeing it with Xi Jinping's explicit desire to take Taiwan by force.   These people do not hide their true intentions. They telegraph them  to the whole world; and, worse, they are willing to do whatever it  takes. Nothing is off limits to them. And that is the seriousness of  the global threat of an increasingly coordinated fascist movement. And  so to address one of these problems but not the other, to somehow judge  one threat to be greater than the other, to say we are going to fund  Israel but not Ukraine, is wrong. It is wrong morally because evil is  evil, no matter where it occurs. And it is wrong strategically because  we have a direct national security interest wherever fascism rears its  ugly head.   Take off your Ukraine lapel pins. Take back everything you said to  President Zelenskyy.   We were in the House when he addressed us. Everyone was anxious to  shake his hand and express support. We put it into our Twitter bios. We  put on the little lapel pin. We had him in the Old Senate Chamber on a  bipartisan basis.   Everybody is for Ukraine--unless it is hard. Everybody is for  Ukraine--unless I can't get something unrelated on domestic policy.   Everybody is for Ukraine when it is popular, when it is the thing  that just happened. But the moment Donald J. Trump wants to defund this  war, a lot of people go: Oh, my God, maybe I am not so enthusiastic  about this.   If you are for something, vote for the thing. There are a million  other jobs out there where you can be for something and never be put to  the test. I have an opinion. I am a guy at a bar. I am a person at a  bus stop. It is Sunday night dinner. I have an opinion. But in this  job, the way to determine whether or not you are for something is not  what you said before the vote, but it is how you voted. And if you are  for Ukraine, you have to vote to help Ukraine to defend itself in a  land war in Europe.   There is a land war in Europe. Vladimir Putin is trying to take  Ukraine by force, and he might just do it if we abandon them. So, if  you are for Ukraine, vote for Ukraine.   I would now like to yield to the senior Senator from New Hampshire,  Senator Shaheen.    Mr. President, a couple of hours ago, Republicans voted  down the motion to even begin debating the national security  supplemental appropriations bill. They claim to support Israel and  Ukraine, but, when it came time to act, they voted no.   But let's be clear about one thing: Every part of this bill is  essential for America's national security.   We have two wars raging and a number of other threats brewing around  the world, and this funding for our allies and our partners could not  be more urgent. It is the difference between having the weapons to  fight terrorists and authoritarians or not, having food and water for  civilians caught in conflicts or not, having the defense systems to  deter China from meddling in Taiwan or not.   Our friends are counting on us to help them, and our adversaries are  counting on us being too divided to do even the most basic task.   America remains the indispensable Nation. It is the leader of the  free world. It is the Nation that other countries, big and small, look  to in good times and in bad, and it is a responsibility that we have  never shirked away from. And now is not the time to start. Now is not  the time to turn our backs on Israel, on innocent Palestinians in Gaza,  on Ukraine, on Taiwan, or on any of our other allies and partners  around the world.   We are fighting an increasingly linked global fascist movement, and  it is directly tied to our security interests. So we ought to act like  it and pass this supplemental to keep our adversaries and competitors  from redrawing the world as they wish, at the point of a gun.   So let's start with Israel. There has been a lot of talk on both  sides of the aisle about the merits of conditioning aid, as if it is a  novel or unusual concept, except that it is not. The idea that having  requirements under Federal law for any Federal appropriations, that  that is somehow amounting to abandoning our ally or a break from the  norms is belied by history.    Whenever we approve Federal spending, whether it is for HUD for  public housing or the Federal Highway Administration for repairs or the  Department of the Interior for parks, we require detailed plans on  exactly how the money will be used, and we expect to receive some sort  of reporting on it afterward. It is also standard practice for our own  Defense Department and aid to other allies, which we routinely  scrutinize.   So it should be no different for Israel and the IDF or Ukraine--and  in a hot war, no less. There are millions of innocent lives caught in  the crossfire, and we have every reason to make sure that Israel is  using the weapons that we provide, funded by our own taxpayer dollars,  in a manner that is consistent with international humanitarian laws and  American values. That is taking every step possible to minimize  civilian casualties.   In many ways, the debate around conditioning aid is emblematic of the  wider one around Israel and Palestine, which has become so hostile and  so binary that people aren't even open to hearing the other side. It is  near impossible to have a dialogue when all people are interested in is  throwing rhetorical barbs and attacking the other side.   If you condemn Hamas's unspeakable brutality on October 7 and hold it  accountable for the death and bloodshed on that day and in the days  since, then you are supposedly excusing the conditions under the  blockade or you are accused of turning a blind eye to settler violence  before and since October 7.   If you question the manner in which Israel is waging war and the  carnage and suffering the war has wrought on innocent lives, including  children and babies, you are suddenly not sufficiently pro-Israel.   If you call out the fact that anti-Semitism is on the rise here in  the United States and around the world, that it is one of the oldest  sicknesses and a scourge that must be addressed, then somehow you are  indifferent to Islamophobia or the suffering of Palestinians.   No, I know anti-Muslim and anti-Arab hatred are alive and well, too,  and believe that they must be rooted out with equal force. And my heart  breaks for the countless innocent lives being lost in Gaza daily.   All of these things are true at the same time. They are in tension  with each other, yes, but not in contradiction. There is an awfully  messy and deeply, deeply contested history underpinning this conflict.  So to strip away all that context and flatten all these complexities  into a 15-second TikTok is a disservice to the Palestinian and Israeli  causes alike.   There are no simple and straightforward paths to peace here, but if  we can't engage without first holding purity tests, if we can't  acknowledge two things to be true at the same time, if we can't  recognize each other's humanity, then we are not going to be able to  build a just and lasting peace in the region.   Almost everybody believes Hamas is terrible and should be eliminated.  They want the hostages who were cruelly abducted and have spent 2  agonizing  [[Page S5802]]  months in captivity to be immediately released. They are appalled by  reports of Hamas's sexual violence against women and the drugging of  hostages. And they believe Israel has a legitimate right and  responsibility to go after the bad guys. The question is how.   People are increasingly and understandably alarmed at the scale of  human suffering and the high rate of civilian casualties in Gaza. It is  our job, as Israel's closest ally, to convey that truth and to make  clear that mass suffering actively undermines the possibility of a  future peace. A whole new generation will be radicalized watching  scores of loved ones die and entire neighborhoods leveled. That is in  no one's interest.   So our responsibility in the current moment is twofold: to provide  Israel with military aid, which I have consistently supported and I  will continue to support, but it is equally important to provide moral  clarity and strategic counsel when actions cross a line.   We do both of these things because we care. We also have an  obligation to look at the future because, whether it is 10 months from  now or 10 years from now, these two peoples need a way to live in  relative peace and stability side by side--if not as friends, then as  neighbors.   Palestinians, like Israelis, deserve a legitimate, representative,  and democratically elected government, and the only viable path to  achieving that is through a two-state solution. It is the only way to  guarantee a safe home for the Jewish people in Israel, and it is the  only way to ensure Palestinians have a secure state of their own. A  solution that does not recognize the humanity of both Israelis and  Palestinians is not just, and a solution that does not give both  peoples the condition to prosper without fear of violence will not  last.   Let's talk about the other part of this supplemental--Ukraine, which  is, unfortunately, also all too familiar with battles over sovereignty  and coexistence.   Ukrainians have spent almost 2 years fighting against Putin for their  very survival. And, make no mistake, Russia's failure to capture  Ukraine so far is in no small part due to America's support and our  leading role in rallying the world to stand up to Putin's aggression.  We know that President Zelenskyy knows that and, crucially, Putin knows  that. In fact, not long ago, he crowed that Ukraine wouldn't last a  week--wouldn't last a week--without help from the West.   So the consequences of failure to support Ukraine are not  theoretical. They are dire, and they are dangerous. Ukraine, as we  speak, is running out of bullets and other munitions. Already, our  shipments have been diminishing in scope and frequency, as existing aid  runs low, and it will be completely exhausted in a matter of weeks or  months. Heading into the winter, the lack of additional assistance is  likely to prove catastrophic.   But some of my Republican colleagues here are willing to undermine  the free world. I don't say this lightly. I like a lot of them. But  they are willing to undermine the free world and let Putin win because  they want hard-line immigration and border policy.   Democrats have demonstrated a willingness to stretch here.  Democrats--and I was texting some of the Republican colleagues with  whom I work very closely, and I said: Look, we are already two-thirds  of the way. We can't go all the way to your position. We cannot enact a  bipartisan bill if it is a partisan bill. But the idea that, if we  don't concede on a wholly unrelated matter, then Putin wins in a land  war in Europe? Are we really doing this?   And I want to just say one thing to my friends in the media--and God  bless them. God bless the fourth estate for all they do, but I am also  entitled to offer a constructive criticism: Stop pretending this is  normal.   (Ms. HASSAN assumed the Chair.)   Stop pretending it is acceptable to take a major foreign policy  issue--this is a land war in Europe. Vladimir Putin just decided to try  to take a country by force. And what they say is: Well, we don't  support that. We support Ukraine, but we see that we have leverage.   By the way, this is not a rhetorical flourish of mine. Senator Cornyn  said this 2 days ago. This is not a negotiation, is what he said. This  is the price you have to pay. This is the price you Democrats have to  pay.   What are we doing here? This is a foreign policy supplemental. We are  supposed to be for these things.   I could have woken up one morning and said: You know what, if we  don't enact my climate policies--which I feel urgently passionate  about--then I am a ``no'' on Ukraine because I know I have leverage and  they need every vote.   The reason I won't do that is I am not bananas. I am a responsible  legislator, and I know that is not the way you do things.   The idea--I have never seen this before. I have only been here 11  years. I am sure there is some historical precedent for it, but not  recently have we tied a foreign policy objective to an unrelated  domestic policy objective.   What they will say is: Look, it is all security.   Oh, come on. I understand the passion there is on the border. I  understand the problem there is on the border. But it is not a foreign  policy question, and the idea that we are going to let Ukraine get  taken--Kyiv will be in Russian control because we couldn't make a  border deal? We haven't been able to make a border deal for--well,  since I have been here for sure and then 5 years prior to that. That  stuff is hard. You don't take literally the most difficult issue that I  can think of in the Congress to forge a bipartisan consensus and say:  If we don't get it, then, I am sorry, Kyiv is just going to fall.   That is no way to run a railroad. That is no way to be the  indispensable Nation.   You walk into any global convening--and I remember--I am looking at  the Presiding Officer. I am sure the Presiding Officer has had this  experience. You are a Governor, and everybody wants to know what you  think, but when you are a Senator, you are not sure if people are going  to be as interested in what you think.   When you travel abroad, even when I was an appointed freshman  Senator, people are hanging on your every word--not as a head of state  but just as a representative of the U.S. Government. We remain the  indispensable Nation. Everyone wants to know what we are going to do.  Everyone wants to know what we think. They want to know what we are  funding. They want to know what our priorities are. So we cannot  forfeit that global leadership because we are fighting about something  else.   Now, again, Democrats have demonstrated by their negotiations, by all  of our public pronouncement, that we are willing to stretch a little  bit on this because it is that important. But it would be a hell of a  thing for us to allow Vladimir Putin to win because we are too busy in  a partisan battle about something totally unrelated.   I yield the floor.
