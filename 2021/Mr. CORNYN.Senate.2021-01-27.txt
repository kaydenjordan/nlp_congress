 Madam President, let me express my gratitude to the  Senator from Alaska for his words. I could not have said it better than  he did, and I am grateful to him for coming and articulating that  important message so clearly and emphatically.   Chris Wray, the FBI Director, is a pretty laid-back guy. As a matter  of fact, I frequently tell people he reminds me of the typical G-man-- you know, not a lot of emotion, not a lot of animation. But the FBI  Director, who I think is doing an outstanding job and has been doing an  outstanding job, gets positively animated when it comes to China and  the threats presented there. Of course, the FBI is principally in  charge of the counterintelligence mission against foreign countries  like China that try to steal our intellectual property, spy on our  country using a number unconventional means. I just want to say to our  friend from Alaska: Thank you for making that point. It is really,  really important.                            ____________________     Madam President, yesterday afternoon we confirmed another  one of President Biden's Cabinet nominees. Antony Blinken has led an  impressive career in the public sector and is well versed in both the  vast responsibilities of the State Department, as well as the  diplomatic challenges we will face in the months and years ahead, the  most important of which is China, but it is not China alone.   While Mr. Blinken and I have policy differences--some of them very  serious--I have confidence in his ability to represent our Nation on  the global stage. It is important for a new President, whether they be  a Republican or a Democrat, to have qualified, Senate-confirmed  officials in their Cabinet without delay.   Over the past week, we have worked to confirm nominees for some of  the most critical Federal Departments and Agencies. The Secretaries of  State, Defense, Treasury, as well as the Director of National  Intelligence, have each been confirmed by the Senate with broad  bipartisan support. And we will continue to process more of the  President's nominees in the days ahead.   Four years ago, our Democratic colleagues approached President  Trump's nominees with a grab bag of antics, including everything from  intentional delays to brazen theatrics. In most cases, this behavior  wasn't a reflection on the nominee or their qualifications, but of our  colleagues' antipathy toward President Trump.   Clearly we are adopting a different approach, and I hope it is one  that will deescalate these battles and one that will serve the national  interest rather than harm it.   Throughout my time in the Senate, I have tried to evaluate nominees  based on their qualifications, their integrity, and their ability to  carry out the responsibilities for the job they have been nominated  for, and I will continue to either support or oppose nominees based on  those merits and those criteria, not based on the party of the  President                            ____________________     Madam President, we know it has been the tradition of the  Senate to prioritize nominees for national security positions, and  there has never been a more critical time to ensure that President  Biden is surrounded by an experienced and capable team. From the  threats posed by an increasingly hostile Iran to those by an  unpredictable North Korea, there are many, many challenges on the  horizon.   One of the first the administration must confront is the expiration  of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, also known as New START.  This is the only remaining bilateral strategic arms agreement between  the United States and Russia, which are the world's most powerful  nuclear states, and it is set to expire in a matter of days.   Last fall, the Trump administration advocated for a 1-year extension  of New START, with the condition that both countries would cap nuclear  weapons--nuclear warheads during that period.   Unsurprisingly, Russia preferred a clean, 5-year extension with no  warhead limitations. President Putin delayed the final stages of talks  in the hopes that the potential Biden administration would strike a  deal more favorable to Russia. And it appears now, at least as things  stand today, that President Putin has hedged his bets correctly.   Following a call yesterday between President Biden and President  Putin, the White House announced that the United States and Russia are  set to extend New START for 5 years, with no conditions attached. This  was President Biden's first major foreign policy test, and,  unfortunately, he played right into Russia's hand.   For starters, it is no secret that New START was deeply flawed from  the beginning. And it is no secret that Russia cheats, which is why  verification is so essential.   The counting mechanisms in New START don't effectively keep our  countries on a level playing field, which is the primary goal of any  arms treaty because it promotes mutual deterrents. The treaty limits  the number of bombers each nation could possess but places no limit on  the number of warheads each bomber can support. Making matters worse,  the limits only apply to strategic, not tactical, nuclear weapons.  Russia has taken advantage of this loophole in New START, amassing some  2,000 tactical nuclear weapons compared to only 500 for the United  States.   Russia's nuclear doctrine signals its increasing willingness to use  those tactical nuclear weapons in a conflict, particularly in Europe,  as it warily eyes NATO. Another 5 years under New START will allow  Russia to continue growing its arsenal of tactical weapons and cement  its advantage over the United States, perhaps permanently.   Once that happens, the likelihood of Russia deploying and ultimately  using these weapons goes higher. These treaties ought to make the world  safer, not a more dangerous place due to imbalances, the potential for  mistakes, or miscalculation.   Beyond sheer numbers, there is also the question of trust or, I  should say, of verification, because it is hardly controversial to say  Russia isn't the most trustworthy partner. Last fall,  [[Page S164]]  the Kremlin attempted to poison a Putin opponent using a nerve agent.  Russia has launched massive cyber attacks against private companies and  government agencies here in the United States, the latest being the  SolarWinds hack. And last year, it attempted to steal coronavirus  vaccine data from the United States and some of our closest allies.   In short, Russia does not play by the rules, and New START does  little to prevent further cheating. By granting Putin's request for a  clean 5-year extension of New START, the Biden administration will not  only be rewarding Russia for its hostile actions against the United  States and our allies but also enabling Russia and other nuclear states  to continue growing their stockpiles while the United States plays by  outdated rules: no cap on nuclear warheads, no enhanced verification  measures--in short, no need for assurances for Russia to follow the  rules laid out in New START.   The expected treaty extension by the Biden administration wouldn't  address any of those blinking red lights. The biggest failure of a  clean, 5-year extension, though, is relinquishing the leverage we  currently have to take a more comprehensive approach to nuclear  disarmament.   As I said, the United States and Russia are the most powerful nuclear  states in the world, but together we account for only two of the five  nuclear armed states recognized by the nonproliferation treaty. Two of  the other countries, the United Kingdom and France--both of whom  provide regular information about the size and makeup of their nuclear  arsenal--are not a problem.   The fifth and final power is China, one of the world's biggest secret  keepers. It is a police state and opaque, as we learned once again when  it came to the virus from Wuhan Province.   As if we needed a reminder of the critical information China withheld  from the rest of the world, all we need to do is look at the COVID-19  pandemic. The first cases of COVID-19 appeared in China as early as  November of 2019, and the Communist Party of China willfully withheld  the information from the rest of the world, and it sought to downplay  the potential impact of the virus. China repeatedly silenced the brave  men and women of its own country who tried to sound the alarm, and, as  a result, countries around the world were ill-prepared for these  critical early stages of the fight against COVID-19. Now, more than 2.1  million people have died from this virus, including more than 420,000  Americans.   It is impossible to gauge how many of those lives could have been  saved by earlier intervention, but this should serve as a cautionary  tale when it comes to managing threats from China. We cannot allow  China to continue sitting on the sidelines while the four other nuclear  states play by the rules as we hope they will. The administration must  push to get China to the negotiating table--at the negotiating table.   The thick cloak of secrecy surrounding the Chinese Communist Party  has made it nearly impossible to verify information about the breadth  and the depth of China's nuclear capabilities. What we do know is that  China continues to pursue a nuclear triad, and experts estimate China  to have about 300 nuclear weapons.   Assuming that figure is correct, it puts China slightly ahead of  France and the United Kingdom in terms of raw numbers. That would make  China the third most powerful nuclear state in the world, and we have  every reason to believe that the size of its arsenal will continue to  grow.   In May of 2019, then-Director for the Defense Intelligence Agency,  GEN Robert Ashley, said China is likely to at least double the size of  its nuclear stockpile over the next decade. He referred to this effort  as ``the most rapid expansion and diversification of its nuclear  arsenal in China's history.''   Despite this already large and constantly growing nuclear threat,  there are virtually no measures in place to hold China accountable or  to bring them to the table. A simple extension of the New START leaves  in place a framework in which the Russians cheat, the Chinese are not  at the table, and the United States is playing by the rules of a bygone  era.   This must change. It must change. If you think about the fact that  since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear weapons have not been used on  this planet, it is a result of tough negotiations and a system of  mutual deterrence because we know, were nuclear weapons to be used,  that it could result in the extermination of the planet.   So that is why deterrence is so important. That is why reciprocity  and transparency are so important. The Cold War-era approach to nuclear  disarmament does not make sense in the modern world. Rather than enter  a 5-year extension of New START, the administration should use its  leverage to convene multilateral talks. America should invite the other  nuclear nonproliferation treaty states--Russia, China, France, and the  UK--to the negotiating table and encourage multilateral talks aimed at  limiting the growth of nuclear arsenals globally.   There is far too much at stake to merely cave in to the demands of  President Putin in Moscow and cave in as well to the recalcitrance of  Beijing to come to the table. The administration must pursue a  multilateral, comprehensive approach. It is the only practical and  workable solution to the vast nuclear threats posed by both China and  Russia.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
