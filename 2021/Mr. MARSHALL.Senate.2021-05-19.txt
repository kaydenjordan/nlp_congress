 Madam President, earlier this month, the Department of  Labor's jobs report showed an uptick of the unemployment rate to 6.1  percent and employers only adding 266,000 jobs, despite widespread  projections of approximately 1 million jobs to be gained in April.   To call this a dismal jobs report would be an understatement. It was  the worst jobs miss since 1998. Yet it is not  [[Page S2763]]  surprising considering the many conversations I have had with Kansans  throughout my travels. I have heard constantly how employers are  struggling to find people for open jobs, largely because folks are  staying at home due to the increased unemployment dollars and the  stimulus checks that Democrats continue to push.   Earlier this year, Democrats forced through legislation--without any  Republican support--that provided $300 more per week in Federal  unemployment benefits. This additional benefit, when coupled with the  extended unemployment benefits offered by States, already means that  the average recipient is making $15 to $20 per hour to stay home.   Democrats have made it more profitable for many Americans to stay  unemployed. That is because these policies are not intended to help our  economic recovery. They are intended to reform our American system and  create more dependency on the government.   This leap toward socialism comes at a time when our Nation is on its  way to reaching herd immunity and businesses are emerging from  government-imposed lockdowns. Now President Biden has delivered them a  government-funded labor shortage.   I recently heard from a wonderful small business in my hometown of  Great Bend, KS, that are short-staffed by some 70 employees--that is 70  employees they are short-staffed. They are unable to match the strong  incentive to stay home provided by the Federal unemployment benefits in  order to rehire their workforce. The company's mission is to provide  educational and work opportunities for people with developmental  disabilities, giving nearly 200 individuals in the area the  independence, inclusion, and training that they need to achieve  success. This labor shortage directly affects their ability to meet the  needs of the people they serve.   I have heard stories from manufacturers across Kansas struggling to  recall their workers, despite offering generous benefits and high-wage  jobs or restaurants remaining closed because they don't have enough  employees for their basic operations.   Homes aren't being built because of a lack of labor, and hotels are  turning away business because they don't have employees. One company  even shared a story of offering a high-skilled and high-wage position  only to be turned down because the prospective employee claimed they  were comfortable on unemployment, and the hours clashed with the local  bowling league.   We have seen the broader supply chain begin to feel the impacts, as a  lack of truckdrivers means that building materials, computer chips, and  common household goods like toothpaste and toilet paper can't reach  their destination, or food processing plants are short-staffed and  turning out less product than usual, driving up the cost for consumers.   Coupled with the trillions of Federal dollars that have gone out the  door so far, we are beginning to see inflation. In fact, the Department  of Labor's recently released consumer price index for April showed the  largest spike in inflation since 2008.   There are a record 8 million jobs--that is 8 million opportunities  waiting to be filled across this country. In my home State of Kansas,  we have 57,000 job openings, and the March labor report shows over  58,000 Kansans received unemployment insurance.   While there are certainly people who need access to increased  unemployment benefits during the heart of this pandemic, unemployment  insurance was never meant to be a permanent salary replacement.   Rather, the benefit is meant to provide temporary assistance while  folks get back on their feet. The government should not be in the  business of creating lucrative government dependency that makes it more  beneficial to stay unemployed rather than return to work. That is  called socialism.   Nearly half of the States have halted the additional benefits, and I  have called for the Democratic Governor from my home State to do the  same. Unfortunately, no State in the Union with a Democratic executive  has stepped up and dropped the benefits, despite many of these States  having the highest unemployment rates in the country. Instead,  Democrats in Congress are moving to make the enhanced benefits  permanent.   For all these reasons, last week, 15 of my colleagues joined me in  introducing the Get Americans Back to Work Act, which decreases Federal  unemployment benefits to $150 per week at the end of May and then fully  repeals them altogether at the end of June. Not only will this help get  people back to work but the savings generated can be used to pay for  roads and bridges.   Let me close by saying ``work'' is not a four-letter, dirty word. A  job brings dignity and purpose to all who have one. Over the past year,  we have made great strides to develop safe and effective vaccines.  Because more Americans are getting their shots, we have seen COVID  cases decline to nearly a quarter of where they were in January. Now is  the time for folks to get back to work, to get our kids back in school,  and get our economy back to prepandemic levels.   I yield the floor.                                   S. 1260
