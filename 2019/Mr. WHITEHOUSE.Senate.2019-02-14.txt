 Madam President, let me start by thanking Leader  Schumer for his incredible remarks this morning. There is a surge of  energy around this issue. He has represented that surge of energy very  well. He challenged the other side of the aisle to bring it on. Let me  sign up right now as the proud member of the ``bring it on'' caucus.  Bring it on. We are looking forward to this conversation on our side.   It is clear that the people of America want action. The polling is  immensely strong on this issue. It is clear that the people of America  see this issue in their daily lives. This is not academic theory any  longer. They see the wildfires. They see the droughts. They see the  floods. They see the sea level rise. They see the fish moving about.  This is in their lives now, and the polling shows that.   A vast majority of Americans say they are--and this is the word in  the poll--``worried'' about climate change. The world has reported they  see this as the No. 1 issue facing the world's security.   Against that backdrop of an active, engaged, and knowledgeable  American population and a world that is looking for the United States  to lead, the city on the hill, what--what--do we get from the  Republican majority in the Senate? We get a bill, a measure brought to  the floor--the first time, as Leader Schumer pointed out, that the  Republican-controlled majority has brought any meaningful legislation  related to climate change to the floor--that they intend to vote  against.   Who brings a bill to the floor that you intend to vote against? How  is that possibly sincere or serious, and what is  [[Page S1343]]  your alternative? If you don't like the Green New Deal, what is your  plan? Where is there one?   The fact is, since the Citizens United decision and since the fossil  fuel industry powered up its political efforts, there is now no  Republican Senator in the Senate who has cosponsored any serious bill  to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They stay away from  this issue like the plague.   The world has changed around us. The 2020 election has already begun,  in many respects. Voters are alert to this. A Democratic House is ready  to produce real legislation, meaningful legislation. With any luck-- actually on the House side, somewhat bipartisan legislation, and here  in the Senate, the blockade continues, and the only measure brought to  the floor is a trick vote that its sponsors will actually vote against.  That is a pathetic statement of where our friends on the other side are  on this.   I hope this actually turns into a breakthrough moment in which there  are some serious conversations on the other side to say this is not  tenable; this is ridiculous; we are going to be embarrassed by this;  but on our side, we say bring it on.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, this year marks the 160th  year that the Church of St. Michael the Archangel has served the people  of South Providence and the larger Rhode Island community. Rhode  Island's earliest values are of inclusion, acceptance, and respect for  difference. The founder of our State, Roger Williams, went off into an  unknown wilderness and established a land in which tolerance and  religious openness were the new standard. In keeping with these  founding principles, the community of St. Michael's has been a place of  welcome since its inception.   Generations of immigrants built this country; yet too often, those  who come seeking the American dream are met with discrimination.  Originally serving Irish and Western European immigrant populations  often pushed to the margins of society, St. Michael's has expanded to  incorporate the Providence of today, a multicultural, multilingual  community.   Faith compels work toward fairness and justice for all living beings,  regardless of nationality or social status. St. Michael's has fostered  a vibrant community of people who are answering that call. The people  of St. Michael's have partnered with nonprofit groups and other faith  organizations to carry out meaningful advocacy work and provide direct  services to those in need. It has been a privilege to know and work  alongside church leaders like Sister Mary Reilly, Father Ray Malm, and  the late Sister Ann Keefe. Their tireless advocacy and spirit of  service have been manifested through the good works of numerous  community organizations including Sophia Academy, Providence CityArts,  AIDS Care Ocean State, and the Institute for the Study and Practice of  Nonviolence. These groups have made rich and diverse contributions to  the character of Rhode Island.   The immigrant spirit of perseverance is shared in the moral fiber of  this country. In Rhode Island, St. Michael's church has been a symbol  of refuge and hope for 160 years. They have made our State and the city  of Providence better through their dedication to public life. I applaud  the work of St. Michael's and its pastor, Father Robert Perron, and I  congratulate the venerated parish on 160 years of service.
