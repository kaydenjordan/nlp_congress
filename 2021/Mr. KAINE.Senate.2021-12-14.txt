 Madam President, I am honored to join my colleagues today  to speak about the child tax credit and to do something similar to what  they have done and just make it personal to families.   Tomorrow, on the 15th of December, more than 930,000 Virginia  families, who together have 1.6 million kids, will receive a child tax  cut payment--$300 for a child under age 6 and $250 for each child  between ages 6 and 17. Those are big numbers. Those are big numbers-- 1.6 million children; 930,000 families.   And I am here joining my colleagues to ask that this payment to  parents--this parents' tax cut--to help their children is not the last,  because unless we act, the sixth payment that will go out tomorrow will  be the last.   Now, the numbers are big, but sometimes the numbers can obscure--data  and statistics can obscure--what is really at stake. So just a week  ago, I put up on my Senate web page a question: What has this tax cut  meant to your family?   In 1 week we have received more than 200 responses, and I just want  to share a few with you.   Heather, from Glenn Allen, is a full-time caretaker of her physically  disabled daughter. Her daughter started having trouble with the stairs  in her home. So they used the child tax cut payment to help them buy a  new stair lift so her daughter is still able to navigate the home.   Heather wrote this to me:         My family deeply appreciates the child tax credit because       we routinely incur additional expenses while caring for a       loved one with a disability. I take care of our daughter full       time, which makes us a one-income household, so the tax       credit helped make a difference.    Beatrice from Rockingham, in the Shenandoah Valley, works at Cooks  Creek Presbyterian Church, and she sees how the child tax cuts have  affected families they work with. One mother of six, whose husband is  incarcerated, relies on the payments to help with her child's medical  expenses. Another couple that comes to this church, who are in their  sixties, are raising their great-nephew because his mother suffers from  addiction. The tax cut is helping them cover necessities for this  great-nephew.   Lawanda--I have a picture of Lawanda and her family. She is a single  mom from South Boston, down on the North Carolina border. Lawanda sent  me this picture and said: Use this picture. She used the payments to  help buy clothes and shoes for her children and to buy fresh fruit and  vegetables, which they usually can't afford.   I love this picture because this is a picture of people with smiles.  These are resilient people, who dream of a better future, and this  child tax cut is helping them achieve at something as simple as being  able to buy fresh vegetables rather than canned, or shoes. Something as  simple as that is what this child tax cut is about.   A Virginian from Lynchburg wrote that the tax cut has helped buy  healthy food, clothing, and shoes. And then she said this:         Children grow so fast now and eat more, which causes many       trips to the grocery store. We are senior citizen, retired       grandparents with legal guardianship of our granddaughter.       With this being the last payment in December, which would be       used partly for Christmas gifts for her, we will [really]       have to stretch this.    Grandparents--grandparents raising their granddaughter and finding in  this tax cut the ability to afford Christmas gifts.   Nicole from Leesburg is using the tax cut for therapy for her  autistic son because insurance no longer covers it.   In another picture is Sasha from Midlothian, which is right outside  of Richmond. Sasha wrote to me and said this--and this is Sasha and her  young one:         My husband and I both have secure jobs, but the cost of       full-time infant care is very high. We spend 23 percent of       our combined monthly income on daycare for one child--our 1-      year-old son. We also just paid off my student loans and       are saving to buy our first house next year. The child tax       credit has allowed us to save more money for that house       and to pay off debts. We would like to grow our family but       worry about our financial burden.   She also wrote:         Thank you for working so hard to pass the Build Back Better       bill. I am following it closely because it means so much to       my family's future.    From Alexandria, a constituent wrote:         Before the pandemic, the high price of childcare made it       difficult to balance my family's budget. Each month we went       into debt a little bit more. My husband is a full-time       student, and I am the sole breadwinner.    The child tax credit helped them start to pay down debt, to begin an  emergency fund, and to start a college fund for their son.   A resident from Waynesboro:         I benefited tremendously with the child tax credit. I am a       single parent in every aspect, raising two growing boys. It       has helped me out with getting things they need for the       school year. Also I saved some to be able to give them a good       Christmas.    Finally, Laquanda from Roanoke--all she said was this:         Please fight for us. Please fight for us.    I could go on for a long time with these messages, as could my  colleagues, but I will stop there. I have read you stories from people  who live in every region of Virginia.   I want to thank my colleagues Senators Bennet, Brown, Booker,  Warnock, Cortez Masto, and others for leading the charge on getting  this policy into the American Rescue Plan earlier this year, and I want  to thank all of my Democratic colleagues because this thing passed by  one vote in March. If any of us had been absent, if any of us had lost  our last race, the American Rescue Plan would have failed, and none of  these families would have received the support of the child tax credit.   Well, we are going to have that opportunity again, and, given the  fact that one party has said they will not support this bill, it is on  our shoulders. These families who are struggling and working so hard  and who have hopes as high as any of our hopes, they need us. As  Laquanda said, they need us to fight for them.   Thank you to my colleagues for joining in that.   With that, I yield the floor but would defer to my colleague from  Colorado.
