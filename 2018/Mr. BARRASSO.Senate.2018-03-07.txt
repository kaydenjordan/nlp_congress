 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, over the next couple of weeks, Congress  is going to need to finalize government appropriations for the  remainder of this year. Among the things that some people are talking  about is including money for a couple of ObamaCare programs. One of  them is money for the so-called cost-sharing reduction payments.  Funding for these payments was never appropriated by Congress. The  Obama administration paid the insurance companies anyway. President  Trump stopped these illegal payments last October. Now, some people in  Congress are talking about funding them again.   We all know that ObamaCare has been a disaster for millions and  millions of families all across the country. We know that for the  people who live in States that use the Federal healthcare.gov exchange,  average premiums have doubled since the law took effect. Certainly  Wyoming is one of those States that experienced it; I heard about it in  Clark County just last week. We know it. We hear about it in letters  from the people who write to us. No matter where they are from in the  State of Wyoming, we continue to hear about the costs going up. I am  sure there is a similar situation in the State of Arkansas, the  Presiding Officer's State, as well.   According to Gallup, the number of uninsured people actually  increased last year by 3 million. Many people are finding that they  just can't afford to have ObamaCare insurance. It is especially hard  for hard-working families who don't qualify for subsidies under the  healthcare law. So we know there is a problem, and we know we have to  do something to help people who are struggling in ObamaCare markets.   If people are going to discuss using this government spending law to  spend more money on the collapsing ObamaCare markets, there are other  things we should be discussing as well. We should discuss finding a  real solution to rising healthcare costs--one that doesn't just  continue the unworkable, unaffordable, and, frankly, unfair system that  ObamaCare created. We should discuss actually giving people more  freedom and more flexibility to choose a healthcare plan that is right  for them.   I am introducing a bill today to do just that. My legislation will  build on a step that President Trump and the Trump administration took  last month. The administration reversed a last-minute Obama-era policy  that had all but killed short-term health plans. These are less  expensive health plans that are free from the expensive and intrusive  and burdensome regulations that ObamaCare placed on other insurers, so  they are a much more affordable option for many Americans who have been  priced out of ObamaCare.   President Trump is on the right path with this new rule. It is  absolutely the right decision. He is giving people back an option so  they can decide for themselves if it is a right choice for them. I  think we should go a step further, and that is why I am introducing  this legislation. We should go a step further in the omnibus spending  bill. We should make this more affordable choice permanent. Making it  permanent protects people. It protects people so a future  administration doesn't do what President Obama did and try to wipe out  choices for Americans.    This legislation I am introducing today gives people a choice to have  these plans for not just 90 days--which was allowed at the end of the  Obama administration--but for a full 364 days. So it is up to a year.   It also makes sure people can then renew these plans, if they want  to, so it can become their permanent insurance, free from the mandates  of the Obama healthcare law. It protects them from being dropped if  they are sick. Remember, that was one of the biggest promises of  ObamaCare that was broken. President Obama said: If you like your plan,  you can keep your plan. Almost immediately, people found out it wasn't  true at all. In fact, it was called by some of the press the ``Lie of  the Year.''   In 2013 alone, there were 4.7 million Americans who got letters from  their insurance companies telling them that their insurance plan had  been canceled. Under my proposal, people with these short-term plans  wouldn't have to worry about getting a cancellation letter. They would  be protected from their insurance company, and they would be protected  from Washington, DC.   States are much better suited than Washington to regulate their  insurance markets in ways that work best for the citizens of their  State. These simple changes in my legislation will help give people  back--help give to them--the freedom ObamaCare took away. That is what  we are looking at, the need for freedom for the American people. We can  essentially give people an escape hatch to get out of the ObamaCare  plan entirely. We can give them the freedom to choose the coverage that  works for them and works best for their families.   That is the right way to bring down healthcare costs for Americans:  Give them options, give them choices, give them freedom, not make them  buy a one-size-fits-all government plan.   People living in more than half of America's counties have only one  choice of insurance in the ObamaCare exchange--only one--half of the  counties in the country. It is not a choice. They don't have options.  It is a monopoly.   The left-leaning Urban Institute estimates that 4.2 million Americans  would enroll in short-term plans next year if we just let them keep  their plan as long as a year. That is the kind of pent-up demand that  is out there for these more affordable, more flexible plans with much  more freedom.   Just the one change could make a difference in the lives of 4 million  Americans. My legislation does just that, and it has other benefits as  well.   I think it would be an attractive option for many more Americans, but  a lot of Democrats in Washington don't want to talk about options. No.  They know ObamaCare markets are collapsing; they don't seem to care.  They know costs are soaring out of control; it doesn't seem to concern  as many as it should. They know middle-class families are being  squeezed the hardest by these rising ObamaCare premiums. Their answer?  We have heard it. We have heard it on the floor of the Senate: Try to  push everyone--everyone in America, want it or not, everyone in  America--into a single, government-run insurance plan that looks a lot  like Medicaid. That is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing  and what I am proposing today.   What the Democrats are proposing is more of the same failed idea that  caused Americans so many problems under ObamaCare: government control.   If there is going to be talk of propping up the ObamaCare markets  during the omnibus spending bill, then we should also be talking about  helping people get out of the ObamaCare markets. Give them the freedom,  give them the escape hatch.   We should protect people who want health insurance but who don't want  ObamaCare health insurance. They know what works best for them and  their families, and we should trust the American people to know what is  best for them and their families. We should give people the freedom and  the flexibility to make those decisions for themselves, and we should  give them more opportunities to escape from the disastrous,  destructive, and extremely expensive ObamaCare markets.                                  ______                                         By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Daines, Mr.          Gardner, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. King, Mr. Manchin, and Mr. Tillis):   S. 2509.
