 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the life and legacy of a  great statesman and social justice warrior, Congressman Ron Dellums,  who passed away on July 30.   Mr. Speaker, the contributions that Ron made to our community, the  Nation, and the world are endless. As a former marine and the first  African American to serve on the House Armed Services Committee and  later to become its chair, he was a true patriot and a hero.   As cofounder of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional  Progressive Caucus, Ron fought for the civil and human rights for  everyone in America and around the world; also, he fought to end  poverty.   As a social worker, Congressman Dellums made it his life mission to  fight for the most vulnerable. That was evident in his fight against  the brutal apartheid regime leading to the passage of his South Africa  Sanctions Bill after introducing it 11 times. President Reagan vetoed  the bill and Congress overrode the veto.   I am blessed to call Ron my dear friend, my predecessor, my mentor,  and my former boss. I miss him tremendously, and I will hold him dear  to my heart and the lessons that I learned from this great public  servant.   My condolences are with the Dellums family, friends, and loved ones.  His legacy and his spirit will be with us forever.   Now I ask my colleagues to join me, please, in a moment of silence  for our great fallen hero.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of our Special Order tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to really celebrate the  life and legacy of my mentor, my former boss, and my dear friend,  Congressman Ronald V. Dellums.   I had the privilege to serve as an intern in Ron's Washington office  during the Watergate hearings of 1974 and as a senior member of his  staff for 11 years.   First, my deepest condolences to Ron's beloved family, friends, and  our community, who he loved so deeply, as we continue to come to grips,  quite frankly, with the grief in the passing of this tremendous voice,  yet we honor and celebrate Ron's magnificent legacy.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank Congressman Jamie Raskin for being a part  of this Special Order tonight and for co-leading it. Congressman  Raskin's father, Marcus Raskin, was a close and cherished friend of  Ron's. They deeply loved and respected each other.   Let me also thank all of my colleagues in the Congressional  Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus for holding this  Special Order tonight to remember a truly historic figure, the late,  great Congressman Ron Dellums.   Congressman Dellums was a founding member of the Congressional Black  Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and I know this  celebration of his life would mean so much to him.   Ron will be remembered not only for his many accomplishments, but for  his integrity and his brilliance. He was a courageous statesman, a  warrior for world peace, a soldier for social justice, and a son of  west Oakland. He served his country in both the Marines and in this  Congress, with distinction, for 27 years and as mayor of Oakland for 4  years.   He was beloved by his east bay constituents, regarded by his  colleagues from both sides of the aisle, and respected as a global  leader.   Above all else, Congressman Dellums was a visionary, and his  conscience guided him in the pursuit of peace and justice and equality  in all forms.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), one  of Ron's very close friends, a person whom he loved dearly, who is an  icon in his own right, someone who led the fight for our voting rights.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lewis for that very  beautiful tribute to Ron. It was a loving tribute, and I know  personally how much Ron loved him and, in many ways, looked up to him  and respected him as a human being and for his tremendous leadership.  So I thank the gentleman on behalf of Ron's family, friends, and our  community.   Now I would like to ask Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton to come  forward. Congresswoman Norton knew Ron very well, served with Ron, and  Ron served as chair of the District of Columbia Committee when I was  actually a staffer during that period. They had many, many struggles  during that day. Ron and Eleanor remained friends, and he loved her  dearly and always asked about her.   I yield to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms.  Norton).    I thank Congressman Eleanor Holmes Norton. Let me say that  Ron passed away in his home here in Washington, D.C., on July 30. She  was his Representative.                                time  1700    Ron loved the District of Columbia, as Ms. Norton said. His children  went to Alice Deal Junior High School and Woodrow Wilson High School.  He worked with Ms. Norton, as well as Hilda Mason, who was on the city  council and was a strong activist for statehood. So I thank Ms. Norton  for reminding us of Ron's wonderful history in the District of  Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), my  friend, a member of the Judiciary Committee and the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, but a prior member of  [[Page H7905]]  the House Armed Services Committee. I thank Congressman Johnson for  being with us tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Johnson for that very  beautiful tribute.   I know one of Ron's greatest gifts was mentoring those who came after  him, and I know he certainly appreciated Mr. Johnson's leadership on  that Armed Services Committee and talked a lot about the great work  that he was engaged in.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi),  our leader, who knew Ron very well, even before Ron and Nancy served  together in Congress. I thank her so much for being here and for paying  tribute.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Leader Pelosi for those remarks.   Let me just say one thing to Ms. Pelosi in terms of Ron's sensitivity  and an example of his humanness. He was so happy she reached out to him  during his last few days on this Earth. I was with him, and after he  spoke with Ms. Pelosi, he had tears in his eyes. He talked about how  much he missed her and how much he loved her. He was so grateful that  she gave him that call, so I thank her very much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay).  Congressman Lacy Clay, of course, is the son of a great hero,  Congressman Bill Clay, with whom Ron served. Also, he was so proud of  Lacy, because he knew Congressman Clay as a teenager. He may want to  share some of his stories about that period of time also.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Clay for some of the  stories he shared that many of us as a former staffer remember.   Yes, I remember Ron playing the role of Frederick Douglass, and it  was unbelievable because it didn't take much for the transformation.  Sometimes we would say: Who is this, Ron or Frederick?   So I thank the gentleman for reminding us of that tonight.   Mr. Speaker, Ron's family hailed from Texas. Congresswoman Jackson  Lee was a friend of Congressman Dellums. She currently serves on the  Judiciary Committee, Homeland Security Committee, and the Budget  Committee. Also, Ron was very proud of Sheila, and he loved hearing the  gentlewoman speak and listening to her insights about criminal justice  reform in our judiciary.   So I thank the gentlewoman again for being here tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee for reminding  us what a visionary and a leader Ron was.   Mr. Speaker, I remember when we came to Houston, Texas, Ron was  determined to put together a coalition between African Americans and  Latinos to look at our common issues. He and Mickey Leland were very  close, and he worked very closely with the Latino community to really  put together the agenda that spoke to both of our communities. So I  thank the gentlewoman very much for being here and reminding us of  that.   He was a coalition builder. I called him the father of coalition  politics, and the gentlewoman laid that out tonight.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, we have heard quite a bit tonight of the life  and legacy of a great human being and a great warrior for peace and  justice, Congressman Ron Dellums. Let me highlight a couple of stories  that weren't highlighted tonight that I would like to share.    First of all, Ron really worked in a bipartisan fashion on many, many  issues. I remember that Ron and former Speaker Newt Gingrich were  talking about collaborating on a book together. This was really a time  of true bipartisanship.   Also, Ron called himself a feminist, and he believed in equality for  women. This just wasn't lip service. He followed his convictions in his  hiring practices. Ron hired women and women of color in the early 1970s  and took pride in employing a diverse staff.   When I worked for Ron in the seventies, I was one of a very few  African Americans and only a couple African American women in key  senior staff positions on Capitol Hill, but he made certain that I was  treated fairly and empowered me to manage his office.   Ron had remarkable female role models, including his mother, Mrs.  Willa Dellums. She was a major influence on Ron and taught him to be  proud that he was an American of African descent. She taught him that  his culture and his heritage was an important part of who he was as a  human being and as an elected official.   Ron was really the big brother that I never had. He gave me personal  advice and support as a single mom raising two boys here in Washington,  D.C. He loved children.   When my son, Craig, graduated from Brent Elementary School around the  corner from the Capitol, he asked Ron to be his graduation speaker.  Mind you, this was, I believe, in the sixth grade.   Ron left the Hill, spoke at the graduation, took pictures, and talked  to the children afterwards. Mind you, these were young children. They  didn't have political clout and they couldn't vote, but Ron didn't  mind. He did this out of the goodness of his heart because he loved  children and cared about their future.   When Ron retired, I announced my candidacy for his seat. He  introduced me at my campaign kickoff, and he literally passed a blue  baton to me at that kickoff, which I will cherish forever. But that  baton reminds me of his impact on the world both in the policies that  he championed and in all of those he inspired to follow in his  footsteps.                                time  1730    Ron didn't serve in public office for the glory. He served to make  life better for other people. He used to tell his staff: ``Don't  measure decisions by what is politically expedient. Just ask yourself:  Is this the right thing to do? And if it is, then go ahead and do it.  You don't need to ask me about that.''   In his final weeks on this Earth, I had the privilege to visit Ron  several times. I spent my birthday, July 16, with him in the evening.  He was in rare form, telling stories, toasting our friendship, and  singing happy birthday to me. Yet he was frail, in pain, but all along  he demonstrated a sense of hope and courage, even as he knew he would  meet his Maker soon.   As Ron lived with dignity and respect, doing it all ``his way,'' he  left this Earth exhibiting courage and a sense of peace, reminding me  of the Scripture 2 Timothy 4:7, ``I have fought the good fight, I have  finished the race, and I have kept the faith.''   There is no more fitting way to honor the memory of Congressman  Dellums than for us to lift his legacy in the spirit of respect for  different points of views, sticking to one's values and principles, and  fighting to make this a better world for all.   It is an honor of a lifetime to carry the baton which Ron passed on  to me in our shared fight for justice, peace,  [[Page H7908]]  and equality. But most importantly, as Ron said, we must secure the  future for generations yet unborn. That is what this blue baton reminds  me of.   I thank all of those who have been here tonight to share the memory  and celebrate the life and mourn the loss of my friend, my former boss,  the great Congressman Ronald Dellums.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
