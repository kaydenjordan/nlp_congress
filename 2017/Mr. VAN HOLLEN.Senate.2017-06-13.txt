 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the service  of Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner. Ms. Lerner's term as the leader of  the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, OSC, has expired. By many accounts,  she has been the most successful leader of that office in the agency's  40 year history.   This office has a critical mission, one that is more important now  than ever. It protects government whistleblowers and helps to eliminate  government waste, fraud, and abuse. It is also responsible for the  enforcement of the Hatch Act, which keeps the Federal workplace free  from improper partisan politics.   Special Counsel Lerner was confirmed unanimously by the Senate in  June 2011. During her tenure, she restored the integrity of the Office  of Special Counsel after a difficult period. Moreover, she  reestablished the OSC as a safe and effective office to defend  government whistleblowers.   Moreover, I would also like to recognize the exemplary service of her  principal deputy, Mark Cohen, who is leaving government service as  well. The OSC played a critical role in protecting hundreds of  whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs. They worked with  these courageous employees to improve care for veterans at hospitals  across the country, including efforts to improve conditions for  veterans in the Baltimore VA.   Under Ms. Lerner and Mr. Cohen's leadership, the OSC worked with  Homeland Security whistleblowers to end an improper overtime program,  saving the taxpayers $100 million a year according to the Congressional  Budget Office.   These and many, many other victories for whistleblowers and taxpayers  set a new standard in terms of effectiveness for this important office.   As my colleague and friend from Maryland, Congressman Cummings,  stated in a recent Washington Post article, ``Ms. Lerner turned the  Office of Special Counsel `into a model agency and set the bar as the  head of that office.' '' I ask unanimous consent to have this article  printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   As Senator Grassley, a longtime champion of government  whistleblowers, stated in the same article, ``Her leadership should be  a road map for future leaders of this office.''   Given the office's important good government role, the OSC enjoyed  broad, bipartisan support under Lerner and Cohen's leadership. I concur  with my colleagues and encourage the next leaders of that office to  follow their lead as I pay tribute to their government service.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Washington Post, June 7, 2017]   Special Counsel Lerner Leaves Office as Trump Rejects Highly Praised                           Whistleblower Advocate                             (By Joe Davidson)         The defining moment for the Office of Special Counsel (OSC)       after Carolyn Lerner became head of the agency was a gruesome       one about body parts and a dismembered Marine.        It's not the usual fare for the office on M Street NW that       deals with Hatch Act violations and prohibited personnel       practices. But protecting whistleblowers is where OSC makes       its reputation--as in the 2011 case involving the Defense       Department's Port Mortuary in Dover, Del.        Soon this little but powerful office will have a new       special counsel. Rejecting the advice of Republicans and       Democrats to keep Lerner, President Trump has nominated Henry       Kerner to take her place. He is a former Republican       congressional staffer and currently assistant vice president       at the Cause of Action Institute, a small-government advocacy       organization.        Lerner, who leaves office on June 14, had been on the job       only a few months when she revealed reports by federal       employees of grisly transgressions at the morgue operated by       the Air Force. Body parts were lost in two cases, and in       another, the office reported that the mangled body of a       Marine ``was dismembered with a saw in order to make the body       fit inside a military uniform, without the consent or       notification of the family.''        With a staff that wouldn't begin to fill one Pentagon       hallway, Lerner humbled and embarrassed the Defense       Department, the government's largest agency. Lawmakers were       appalled. The Air Force secretary at the time expressed his       sincere ``regret'' for ``lapses in our standards at Dover,''       a non-apologetic understatement.        The action of the Office of Special Counsel--no relation to       a special prosecutor or to Robert S. Mueller III, the special       counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016       presidential election--secured mortuary reforms and protected       the employees who were targets of Air Force retaliation.        ``I think that we have sent the federal community a message       that whistleblowers should be valued,'' Lerner said Monday in       her office overlooking St. Matthew's Cathedral.       ``Whistleblowers now feel comfortable coming forward, and       that is helping our government.''        The Port Mortuary case ``really helped the federal       community understand that OSC was robust enforcer of       whistleblower laws,'' she added.        Considering the widespread retaliation against federal       whistleblowers, her assessment of their comfort might be       optimistic, but there is no doubt that the Office of Special       Counsel is a more robust agency than the moribund place they       found before she got there.        It moved ``from last-resort option to first choice for       getting relief for whistleblowers,'' said Tom Devine, legal       director of the Government Accountability Project, a       whistleblower advocacy organization.        Relief for individual whistleblowers also can mean systemic       improvements for federal agencies and taxpayers. The       Department of Veterans Affairs is the obvious example.       Congress approved VA improvements following a 2014 scandal       over the coverup of long patient wait times, which was       revealed by whistleblowers. Whistleblower disclosures also       led to a new overtime pay system for Border Patrol agents.       Lerner's office was instrumental in both.        Devine's strong praise for OSC is not unqualified. ``The       bad news is they operate at a molasses pace'' in some       instances, he said. He added that he would like Lerner to be       more aggressive about taking legal action against federal       agencies that violate whistleblower rights.        Despite the slow pace, agency statistics show impressive       gains. There were ``276 favorable actions for whistleblowers       and other victims of PPPs [prohibited personnel practices]       this past year, more than double the annual average,'' the       office said in its budget justification to Congress. ``In the       last two years, OSC has achieved five times the number of       favorable actions in whistleblower retaliation complaints       than in any prior two-year period in agency history . . . .       In FY 2016, for the second straight year, OSC received       upwards of 6,000 new matters, a 25 percent increase over the       prior two-year period.''        The increased caseload leads to bigger backlogs, but it       also demonstrates that employees are more willing to trust       the office with sensitive cases.        Ironic criticism comes from James J. Wilson, the agency's       chief human capital officer. He filed a whistleblower       retaliation complaint against Lerner with the Merit Systems       Protection Board after failing to find success before the       Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and       Efficiency. Regarding his complaints to the council, Wilson,       who previously filed grievances against former employers at       two other agencies, signed an affidavit saying, ``I received       final decisions closing these four matters with no further       action being taken.''        Whatever the criticism of Lerner, it is outweighed by       praise from whistleblowers and Members of Congress.        ``She's fearless,'' Robert MacLean, an air marshal       whistleblower, told me earlier this year. His was the first       federal whistleblower case heard by the Supreme Court and       MacLean credits his victory largely to work done by OSC.        Unusual in this era of hyper-polarization, she is lauded by       both sides of the aisle.        ``Leading the Office of Special Counsel requires a deep       appreciation for the patriotic work that whistleblowers do to       shine a light on fraud or misconduct in government. Carolyn       Lerner has been a steadfast advocate for government       whistleblowers, and I am grateful for her service at OSC,''       said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the       Senate Judiciary Committee. ``Her leadership should be a road       map for future leaders of this office.''        The Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus, founded by       Grassley and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), had urged the Trump       administration to retain Lerner.        ``I am disappointed the president chose not to take Sen.       Grassley's and my recommendation to renominate Carolyn       Lerner, who is an experienced leader with bipartisan       support,'' said Wyden.        It's also bicameral. Before Trump's decision, Rep. Rod Blum       (Iowa), Republican chairman of the House Whistleblower       Protection Caucus, led a bipartisan House letter saying       Lerner deserved another term. Among those who signed was Rep.       Elijah Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House       Oversight and Government Reform Committee.        Lerner turned the Office of Special Counsel ``into a model       agency and set the bar as the  [[Page S3452]]       head of that office,'' Cummings said by email Monday. ``She       served with independence and tenacity to hold agency       officials accountable when they retaliated against       whistleblowers.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, as a Member of the Senate who supports  efforts to build support for biomedical research and improved public  health, I would like to pay tribute to a great public servant and the  first woman and first librarian to lead the National Library of  Medicine, NLM, the world's largest biomedical library and a part of the  National Institutes of Health. Ms. Humphreys recently announced that  she will retire at the end of June after 44 years of extraordinary  leadership and distinguished public service.   On May 9, the board of regents of the National Library of Medicine  approved and presented the following resolution to congratulate,  commend, and thank Betsy Humphreys for her 44 years of service to the  NLM. I would like to share that resolution with my colleagues and join  the NLM board of regents in paying tribute to Betsy Humphreys, a public  servant who has had a profound and lasting impact on the NLM, the  United States, and the global community.   I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the resolution printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Ms. Betsy L. Humphreys has served NLM, the United States,       and the global community with distinction since 1973,       culminating in her appointment as the NLM Deputy Director in       2005, a post she continues to occupy today, and serving as       NLM Acting Director from April 1, 2015 to August 14, 2016--      the first woman and first librarian to lead the Library.        In a career that could be called one long highlight reel,       she directed the groundbreaking Unified Medical Language       System project, which produces knowledge sources to support       advanced processing, retrieval, and integration of       information from disparate electronic information sources,       and which is used around the world. In the process, she       developed unique knowledge and experience with the content       and format of many biomedical terminologies, health       vocabularies, and clinical classifications that would serve       her well in all endeavors to follow.        She was a key contributor to interagency efforts to advance       standardization of electronic health data, which resulted in       the development, promotion, and implementation of mechanisms       for designating US standards for health data exchange. She       was also a major contributor to the Federal regulation       setting the standards for use in electronic interchange of       administrative health data.        Taking a broader view, she led US government efforts to       remove major barriers to the use of standard clinical       terminologies in electronic health records (EHRs). Before       there was an Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for       Health Information Technology within HHS, she negotiated the       world's first nationwide license for a clinical terminology,       SNOMED CT, with usage terms favorable to the US. This became       a model for other countries and was adopted by the       International Health Terminology Standards Development       Organisation (IHTSDO) when it was formed to put ownership of       SNOMED CT in an international entity. She was IHTSDO's       founding Chair and has served with distinction as its US       member.        With the establishment of the ONC, she led NLM's       substantial and ongoing collaboration with that body to       develop, support, and disseminate for free US use the key       clinical terminologies required for certification of EHR       products and use of EHRs by Medicare and Medicaid providers       and hospitals. She also directed the development and       dissemination of many tools, including mappings, subsets,       browsers, etc., and innovative systems, including the NLM       Value Set Authority Center and NIH Common Data Element       Repository, to support the use of standards in health care,       quality measurement, and in research.        She directed the legislatively mandated expansion of       ClinicalTrials.gov to encompass registration of additional       trials and submission of summary results information. This       multi-year, multi-faceted process involved numerous partners       and stakeholders, showcasing her ability to grasp and solve       complex problems and her considerable skill at consensus       building. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest and most heavily       used international clinical trials registry.        She worked tirelessly and creatively to expand and enhance       access to research publications, data, and high quality       health information for scientists, health professionals,       system and product developers, information professionals, and       the general public. This often involved building and       maintaining strong partnerships across the Federal government       to adapt and rebrand strategies to changes in Administrations       and priorities and to capitalize on emerging opportunities.        She oversaw the expansion of PubMed Central to include       direct deposits of articles from many publishers, manuscript       submissions from investigators of publications resulting from       NIH-funded research and research funded by other Federal       agencies and private funders, including the Gates Foundation,       and digitized articles from back issues of biomedical       journals, through a partnership with the Wellcome Trust.        She led a collaboration with the Food and Drug       Administration (FDA) to make drug information and device       registrations submitted to the FDA by product manufacturers       available to the public via NLM's heavily used DailyMed       system. In addition, she guided the creation of the       AccessGUDID database, which provides public access to       registration data for medical devices.        Under her enthusiastic direction, NLM became an early       implementer of application programming interfaces and       download sites for its many heavily used data and information       resources, flinging open the gates and allowing their use by       other computer systems and by innovative product developers.        As NLM Acting Director, even in the face of hiring       restrictions, she enhanced the quality and efficiency of       NLM's high-volume operations, ensured reliable 24/7       availability of electronic information services that are       essential to research, health care, and public health       worldwide, and advanced major initiatives, including the re-      competition of NLM's Informatics Research Training Grants and       the re-competition and migration from contracts to       cooperative agreement grants of the Regional Medical       Libraries in the National Network of Libraries of Medicine.        Throughout her career, in an exemplary fashion, she       demonstrated creativity, adaptability, and resilience in       partnering with stakeholders inside and outside of NLM. She       leads by fostering employee development, diversity, teamwork,       and making optimal use of human, financial, and information       resources.        Throughout NLM, she is respected and indeed beloved for her       kindness, her resourcefulness, and her can-do spirit. Truly a       treasure as a human being and as a public servant, she       demonstrated a career-long commitment to interagency       collaboration and harnessing government resources for the       public good.                            ____________________
