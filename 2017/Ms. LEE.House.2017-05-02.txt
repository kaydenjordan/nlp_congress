 Mr. Speaker, let me thank Congresswoman Frankel for being  such an exemplary chair, and also our vice chair, Brenda Lawrence. You  have put together quite a team and really are raising the issues that  really don't get raised oftentimes on behalf of our women.   Also, to Congresswoman Jackie Speier, who I believe is in a hearing  right now dealing with this very, very important issue, I want to thank  her and all of our women in the Democratic Women's Working Group for  organizing this very important Special Order to address the  nonconsensual sharing of sexual images in the United States military.   I just have to say a couple of things.   First of all, as a member of the Military Construction, Veterans  Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee and as a woman, I am  appalled by the sharing of these private photos. It is really  disgraceful. It is disgraceful that our military continues to uphold a  culture of sexual harassment and disrespect toward women  servicemembers.   Now, let me be clear. The attitudes towards women exposed by websites  like the Facebook group Marines United are troubling and dangerous. Not  only do such actions threaten our mission, they strip our brave  servicemembers who are women of their dignity. No woman should have her  private photos exposed on the internet, especially not by her fellow  servicemembers.   I was pleased to see the recent Navy and Marine Corps decisions to  make the distribution of intimate photos a criminal offense. That is a  good thing. We really must do more.   Now, when questioning members of the Army, Air Force, Navy, and  Marines at a subcommittee hearing, it became clear to me, based on  their responses, that the culture of the military must change.   Members of the Democratic Women's Working Group continue to try to  help change this culture and are committed to ensuring that that type  of activity is prohibited in all branches of our military. That is why  I am pleased to cosponsor Congresswomen Speier's and McSally's bill,  H.R. 2052, the PRIVATE Act, which is a bipartisan bill that would make  it illegal within the Uniform Code of Military Justice to distribute  intimate images of a person if that person had a reasonable expectation  of privacy.   Now, let me be clear. The Department of Defense must expand its  efforts to foster a culture of dignity and respect that the military  service demands. And, Congresswoman Frankel, I just have to mention a  conversation I overheard.   I was on a plane flying from point A to point B, and there were two  marines sitting next to me, and they were talking very loudly to each  other.                                time  1800    That entire time that we were on the flight, their conversation was  about degrading women who were serving with them in the military. It  was quite shocking. This was just their conversation in the normal  course of conversation on an airplane. I was, quite frankly, shocked  and disgusted.   Today's report from the Pentagon shows promising progress, though.  Sexual assaults are on the decline, and servicemembers are now more  likely to report attacks. But the data also reveals that two-thirds of  women who do report assaults face backlash in their unit. It comes as  no surprise, then, that many victims choose to suffer in silence. That  should not be.   We know that tech firms like Facebook have a role to play in helping  address this kind of unacceptable behavior. Facebook's recent  announcement to help prevent nonconsensual pornography is a huge  advancement in combatting this epidemic--and that is what it is, an  epidemic--and addressing these heinous acts.   While the new feature takes down images that are reported, this  depends on users being vigilant and submitting reports. Too often  people do not report such behavior. We must be clear that we do not  condone this type of behavior and ensure that those with the courage to  speak up do not face retaliation.   I want to make it clear. Exploiting sexual images of fellow  servicemembers online is unacceptable, and it should be a crime. Rest  assured, as a woman, as a mother, grandmother, daughter of a veteran,  and a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  Appropriations Subcommittee, I will work day and night to address the  threats to our country and to our women servicemembers. Women in the  military are critical to our national security. They should have a safe  workplace free from sexual assault and harassment and intimidation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Frankel and Congresswoman Brenda  Lawrence and also Congresswoman Speier for their leadership and for  keeping this issue alive and for making sure the public understands  that there are Members of Congress who have said: enough is enough.
