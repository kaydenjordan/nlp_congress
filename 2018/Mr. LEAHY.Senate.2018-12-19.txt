 Mr. President, today we will pass a third continuing  resolution, CR, to keep the government operating through February 8. I  support this CR because a government shutdown is never good for our  country--in fact, it is a terrible idea--but this whole process has  been a missed opportunity.   For six of the seven appropriations bills covered under today's CR,  we have a clear path forward. These bills--Agriculture, Commerce- Justice-Science, Interior, Financial Services, Transportation-Housing  and Urban Development, and the State-Foreign Operations bill--could be  done by close of business today if there was the will. They are largely  finished, are the product of bipartisan compromise, and provide the  funds necessary to address critical needs of the American people and to  protect U.S. national security. Unfortunately, the President held them  hostage for $5 billion to try to wall off our southern border, a wall  he promised American taxpayers that Mexico would pay for.   What will be lost because of the President's intransigence?   These six bills provide much-needed funding to help combat our  Nation's opioid epidemic and critical investments in infrastructure to  help rebuild our Nation's crumbling roads, bridges, and highways. They  provide resources to protect the environment and help ensure that the  water we drink and the air we breathe is safe and clean for this  generation and the next.   They provide important assistance for our Nation's farmers and rural  communities who have been particularly hurt this year by the  President's trade policies, and they support key allies and national  security programs that are what enable the United States to be a global  leader, a role that is being increasingly challenged by China and  Russia.   Unfortunately, this much-needed assistance is put on hold because the  President held out for $5 billion for his wall, at the exorbitant cost  of $31 million per mile, straight from the American taxpayer's pocket.   We also should be passing a disaster package to help families and  communities devastated by Hurricanes Maria, Florence, and Michael, the  Hawaii volcanoes, California wildfires, and Alaska earthquakes. We  should remember that no one in this Chamber is immune from disaster.  Seven years ago, Tropical Storm Irene devastated my home State of  Vermont. Marcelle and I observed the wreckage from that storm in  Vermont--large parts of communities washed away, homes and farms  demolished, local landmarks and bridges destroyed. Republicans and  Democrats in the Senate, from across the country, stood by Vermont's  side then to help us rebuild because that is who we are as Americans.   This year, the images of flattened homes, buckled pavement, and  raging flames have been matched in horror only by the devastated lives  they have left in their wake. Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina,  Alabama, Georgia, California, Hawaii, and Alaska, they all need our  help, and it is indefensible that, because of the President's obsession  with one issue, his wall, we are punting this disaster funding until  the new year. These communities need to know their government stands  behind them in times of crisis.   Why didn't we get this done? Why can't we pass the six bills that are  finished and a disaster package to help those communities in need  before we adjourn? There is one clear answer to that question:  President Donald J. Trump. He has held all of our good work, by  Democrats and Republicans, hostage over $5 billion for his misguided  wall along the southern border. It is a travesty.   My opposition to his border wall, a wall he over and over pledged to  the American people that Mexico would pay for, has been clear from the  start. The United States is a country founded by immigrants, and  walling ourselves off from our neighbors to the south is not only  impossible and an expensive waste of American taxpayer dollars, it is  immoral, ineffective, and an affront to everything this country stands  for. Everyone agrees that we need to keep our border safe and secure,  but there are better and smarter ways to accomplish that than building  a 30-foot high concrete barrier between us and Mexico.   Let's not be fooled by recent White House rhetoric that President  Trump was backing down from his demands on the wall. The price demanded  by the  [[Page S7899]]  White House for letting the rest of these bills advance without $5  billion for the wall was a $1 billion slush fund to fuel the  President's extreme, anti-immigrant agenda. Why should we give a blank  check to a President who has shown, time and time again, that he is  more interested in vilifying immigrants than he is in solving our  immigration problems? His immigration policies have already caused  immeasurable human suffering along our southern border and tarnished  our reputation around the world. Providing his administration with an  additional $1 billion slush fund to enact this agenda is a nonstarter.   The fact is the President's wall does not have the votes to get  through the House or Senate, and he is in no position to practice  horse-trading of one untenable, unpopular, wasteful policy for another,  nor will Congress stand by and watch the President take funds from our  men and women in the military or their families in order to pay for the  wall. This fight will continue into the next Congress, but I do not  anticipate those basic facts will change. It is long past time for  President Trump to recognize that we live in a democracy. We have three  coequal branches of government. Governing effectively is not about  making threats and false promises. Campaign slogans are no substitute  for practical, affordable solutions.   I want to thank Chairman Shelby for his steadfast partnership this  year as we tried to get the appropriations process back on track. I  know that he shares my disappointment that we were not able to complete  our work, but I am proud of what we have accomplished this year. By  working together across party lines, we moved all 12 bills out of the  committee on strong bipartisan votes. We advanced 9 of the 12 bills  through the Senate, also with strong bipartisan votes, and we were able  to enact 5 of the 12 appropriations bills on time for the first time in  decades.   I also thank Chairman Shelby's staff and my staff for their hard  work, expertise, and their commitment to accomplishing our goals this  year.   I ask unanimous consent to print a list of the bipartisan committee  staff in the Record. I look forward to working with him and his staff,  and our colleagues in the House, in the next Congress to finish our  work.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  Senate Committee on Appropriations Staff         Charles Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jessica Berry, Jay       Tilton, Jean Kwon, Shannon Hines, Jonathan Graffeo, David       Adkins, Dianne Nellor, Adrienne Wojciechowski, Teri Curtin,       Bob Ross, Jean Toal Eisen, Jennifer Eskra, Blaise Sheridan,       Jordan Stone, Erik Raven, David Gillies, Brigid Kolish, John       Lucio, Andy Vanlandingham, Doug Clapp, Chris Hanson, Samantha       Nelson, Ellen Murray, Diana Hamilton, Reeves Hart, Scott       Nance, Chip Walgren, Drenan Dudley, Rachael Taylor, Ryan       Hunt, Melissa Zimmerman, Alex Keenan, Mark Laisch, Lisa       Bernhardt, Kelly Brown, Catie Finley, Chad Schulken, Jason       McMahon, Tim Rieser, Alex Carnes, Kali Farahmand, Dabney       Hegg, Christina Monroe, Nathan Robinson, Robert Putnam,       Christy Greene, Blair Taylor, Jenny Winkler, Hong Nguyen,       Clint Trocchio, George Castro, Mary Collins Atkinson, Lucas       Agnew, Valerie Hutton, Elmer Barnes, Penny Miles, Karin       Thames, Carlisle Clarke, Patrick Carroll, Elizabeth Dent,       Carlos Elias, Dayne Cutrell, Amber Beck, Allen Cutler, Matt       Womble, Rachel Littleton, Brian Potts, Mike Clementi, Colleen       Gaydos, Katy Hagan, Chris Hall, Hanz Heinrichs, Kate Kaufer,       Jacqui Russell, Will Todd, Tyler Owens, Jen Armstrong, Meyer       Seligman, Molly Marsh, Andrew Newton, Lauren Comeau, Brian       Daner, Courtney Bradford, Adam Telle, Peter Babb, Chris Cook,       LaShawnda Smith, Marisa Rhode, Christian Lee, Leif       Fonnesbeck, Emy Lesofski, Nona McCoy, Laura Friedel, Michael       Gentile, Ashley Palmer, Jeff Reczek, Sarah Boliek, Patrick       Magnuson, Jennifer Bastin, Joanne Hoff, Paul Grove, Jason       Wheelock, Adam Yezerski, Clare Doherty, Gus Maples, Rajat       Mathur, Jacob Press, and Jason Woolwine.     Mr. President, on November 6, millions of Americans,  including thousands of Vermonters, headed to the polls to cast their  votes in these midterm elections. Back home, Vermonters reelected our  governor, Governor Phil Scott, a Republican, to another term in office.  They also returned Democratic majorities to the State house and senate.   I was moved by the remarks delivered by Governor Scott on election  night. Of the elections, he said, ``Vermonters are saying they want us  to work for them, not against each other. They are saying we need to  listen to one another and prove to the rest of the nation that in  Vermont we can and will rise above partisan politics.''   I have spoken in Vermont about Governor Scott's speech. I believe his  remarks show how we work together in Vermont and how we should work  together in Washington. I am proud of the challenge put forth by  Governor Scott. I know that, in Vermont, it is a challenge we can meet.   The book will soon close on the 115th Congress, one in which one  party controlled majorities in both the House and Senate and the White  House. The book will open on the 116th Congress, where I hope we can  move forward with the bipartisan spirit that Governor Scott challenged  us all to adopt in his remarks on election night. As it has throughout  our Nation's history, Vermont is leading by example. It is an example I  implore every Senator to follow. Let's focus on what unites us, rather  than promote greater division between us.   I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Vermont Governor Phil  Scott be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Vermont Governor Phil Scott's Election Night Speech--Tuesday, November                                  6, 2018         Thank you all very much for being here tonight.        First, I want to thank my family--especially my wife Diana       and my daughters Erica and Rachael, my mom and many other       family members for their love and support. I wouldn't be       standing here today without you.        Throughout my life--whether it be in business, racing or       politics--I've been able to bring people together who have       the right attitude and chemistry.        I'd like to first thank my team. Both my campaign team who       worked long days that became longer nights; as well I want to       thank my cabinet and my staff who stuck with me through thick       and thin. I'm blessed with an incredibly talented team, so       loyal and bright, who have spent the last two years working       to make the vision we share for Vermont a reality.        Now I know we've taken tonight off, but I look forward to       continuing our work, with all of you, first thing tomorrow       morning.        Tonight, 180 Vermonters were elected to serve as our       Legislature for the next two years.        I want to personally congratulate each of them--some here       this evening. I look forward to working with you in the       coming months. And ``work'' being the key word because       there's so much to do.        There are few higher honors than being elected by your       neighbors, for them to have enough faith and trust in you to       represent them and their interests and be the person they are       counting on to work on the issues that are most important to       them and your community.        And there's no greater responsibility than working every       day to understand and solve the problems facing our state.        For those newly elected, like I was 18 years ago, you may       still think everything is black or white, yes or no, but I       would warn you, there's a lot of gray in between.        Typically, there are no easy answers, no corners to cut--      only hard work ahead, to do all we can to create a stronger,       more vibrant future for all of us.  [[Page S7908]]         In electing a Governor of one party and a legislature led       by another the message Vermonters have sent us tonight is       clear: work together.        Vermonters are saying they want us to work for them, not       against each other.        They are saying we need to listen to one another and prove       to the rest of the nation that in Vermont we can and will       rise above partisan politics.        We must come together for the future of our state in order       to strengthen our economy, make Vermont affordable and       protect the vulnerable in all 251 communities in Vermont.        Whether you're from Brighton or Brandon, Alburgh or       Albany--we all want the same thing.        We want the kids in every community to get a great       education, learn a trade, pursue the career of their dreams,       buy a home, start a family and retire right here in the state       we love.        This is the challenge we face together. And tonight, I       humbly accept that challenge once again.        I'd also like to thank my opponent, Christine Hallquist,       for stepping up and running an energized and historic       campaign.        While we may not have agreed on many issues, we did agree       from the start that this race would be about the things we       felt mattered most to the people of Vermont.        While across the nation other races in other states turned       negative and uncivil, in Vermont, we rose above it.        The news out of Vermont this election was clear: we can       disagree, we can debate--and we can do it with passion--but       in this state, we can do it respectfully.        It wasn't perfect. And at times we were reminded that we're       not immune to the hate and bigotry that is all too present       around the country, but by and large, this campaign was       marked by the type of civility Vermonters, and Americans for       that matter, deserve in our public process.        There was probably no better example of that than Zac Mayo       and Lucy Rodgers of Cambridge, two candidates, ending a       debate last month by sitting together to perform a musical       duet.        For this, and for stepping up, and putting yourself out       there, I'd like to thank all candidates tonight.        From the top of the ticket all the way down, it's not easy       to put yourself out there--win or lose. So, I thank you for       your contribution to the conversation and commitment to       making Vermont a better place.        I'd also like to note that the issues that have been raised       in this campaign due to Christine's historic candidacy are       front and center.        I want you to know that as long as I'm Governor, I'll       continue to make sure our state lives up to our motto of       freedom and unity as well as our reputation of tolerance and       compassion by being the most welcoming in the nation, while       defending all Vermonters from hate and bigotry.        This will remain one of my administration's top       priorities--no exceptions.        Today, Vermonters spoke loud and clear.        So, tonight, I'll reaffirm my commitment to the three       principles on which my administration bases every decision we       make:        First, we're going to continue to make Vermont more       affordable.        I travel the state every day, I see the struggles our       neighbors face and I know that the high cost of living, doing       business, energy, healthcare, education and taxes are forcing       too many to look elsewhere for opportunity.        We should all find that unacceptable. So, as I've done for       the past 18 years, I'll spend the next two, working to       reverse that trend.        Second, if we're going to grow our economy, we must bring       more into the workforce and attract more people to our state.        We need more kids in our schools, more workers for our       businesses, more proud, first time homeowners right here in       Vermont.        We need a bigger labor force to support the public       investments we care about because if we don't--if we can't       grow our economy--then we're faced with two options: raise       taxes or make cuts to programs which could harm the most       vulnerable, neither of which is acceptable.        That's why I ask legislators, in fact, all elected       officials to work with me on a plan to grow our workforce to       increase our working age population because our future       literally depends on it.        Third, we're going to protect our neighbors. We'll continue       to address the opioid crisis, those suffering from mental       health issues and find ways to make sure all Vermonters have       access to affordable healthcare.        We'll take care of our elderly and our veterans--who have       given so much to us--our children, and those who need us       most, when they need us most because it's what we do in       Vermont.        And finally, if we're going to accomplish any of this, we       must continue to rise above partisanship and politics of hate       and division.        Our time to make a difference for those who have elected       us, is far too short. We can't allow ourselves to fall victim       to pettiness, political games and angry rhetoric.        Now more than ever, we must be better role models because       our children are watching, and they want to be just like us.        We must be better, kinder and more respectful to each other       and take the time to listen.        This is the challenge ahead. This is my vision for our       future.        It is the greatest honor of my life to have the trust of       Vermonters to carry out this work on their behalf.        Thank you again from the bottom of my heart and as I've       done throughout my entire life, I will do my very best not to       let you down.                            ____________________     Mr. President, small business are at the heart of many  communities around the country, but in a small State like Vermont,  local businesses and their owners truly bring people together. Lloyd  Squires and his bustling Burlington bagel business, Myer's Bagels, is  one example. For the past 22 years, Lloyd has dedicated his life to  running this Vermont establishment, making more than 3,000 hand-rolled  bagels every day.   Lloyd grew up in Montreal and struggled with homelessness as a  teenager. However, his life turned around at age 15 when Myer  Lewkowicz, the owner of the Montreal-famous St-Viateur Bagel, offered  Lloyd a job that allowed him to finish school, put a roof over his  head, and learn from Myer's teaching. Myer had moved to Montreal and  started his bagel business in the 1950s, having survived the Buchenwald  concentration camp. Lloyd worked side-by-side with Myer for 15 years  until Myer passed away. To honor his mentor, Lloyd opened up Myer's  Bagels in Burlington, VT, in 1996.   Lloyd has worked tirelessly over the last two decades to develop his  growing business. Before Lloyd received his green card, he would drive  the 4-hour roundtrip from his home in Montreal to Burlington, VT, each  day. Lloyd lives much closer now, but still drives 4 hours each day to  deliver bagels around the region. Lloyd gives 1,200 bagels away each  week to local charities. When asked, Lloyd will tell you that his  favorite part about running his business and working incredibly long  hours is being able to talk to his customers and develop close  relationships with the community.   I am proud to recognize the business and community that Lloyd Squires  has helped create in Vermont over the past 20 years.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Burlington  Free Press article titled, ``A day in the life of Lloyd Squires,  Vermont's `best' bagel maker.'' It shares Lloyd's hard work and the  story of how he has gone from being homeless as a teenager to a  cornerstone of our community.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              [From the Burlington Free Press, Nov. 23, 2018]                      Day in the Life of a Bagel Maker                              (By Evan Weiss)         Lloyd Squires, 54, wakes up in his South Burlington home as       he does every day: without an alarm. He puts on a layer of       Under Armour, a Montreal Canadiens T-shirt and a matching       Canadiens hat.        He likes hockey. He'd fallen asleep around 9:30 the night       before, watching his team lose to the Sabres.        He rarely gets four hours of sleep.        2:00 a.m.        Lloyd, the founder and co-owner of Myer's Bagels, drives to       a gas station and picks up a cup of coffee.        In Burlington, Kountry Kart Deli is busy making sandwiches       for a less-thansober crowd. It is late for them, early for       Lloyd.        2:10 a.m.        He turns off Pine Street and arrives at Myer's, backing       into a spot that directly faces the shop. I tell him I think       that says something about him, that most people would pull       straight in. He says he likes to shine his headlights on the       bakery because it's been broken into three times this year.       If there's ever danger, he says later, there's a machete       hidden inside.        He unlocks the door and a large banner welcomes us in       cursive: Myer's Bagels. A Taste of Old Montreal.        Myer Lewkowicz, the namesake for the shop, was a survivor       of Buchenwald concentration camp. He moved to Mile End,       Montreal's historically Jewish neighborhood, in 1953 and       cofounded the famous St-Viateur Bagel in 1957.        In 1980, Lloyd was 15 and homeless, sleeping in a park for       five days. He took an overnight factory job and went to       schoolduring the day. After his third shift, walking by St-      Viateur at 3 a.m., Myer asked what he was doing out so early       every morning. He offered Lloyd a job on the spot, a job       Lloyd credits with saving his life: 13-hour days, Friday,       Saturday and Sunday, so he could stay in school.        Later, Myer would offer Lloyd the day shift, which he       happily accepted. He'd soon discover that the ``day shift''       was 3 a.m. to 4 p.m. six days a week.        2:11 a.m.  [[Page S7909]]         ``First thing I do is put on the radio. First person gets       to choose the station for the day.'' Lloyd chooses country       music.        2:12 a.m.        He turns the faucet to fill the kettle. Bagels are       traditionally made by boiling before baking (though some       commercial bakers will use steam to save time and money).        2:14 a.m.        He re-activates the fire with paper and Middlebury-sourced       wood.        New York-style bagels, the most common variety, are usually       machinerolled, boiled in tap water and baked in a gas oven.        Montreal-style bagels are traditionally hand-rolled, boiled       in honey water and baked in a wood-fired oven.        2:15 a.m.        He mixes Red Star yeast with a bucket of water and gets the       flour ready.        2:25 a.m.        He throws all of the ingredients into a 50-year-old       Canadian mixer. He says he has a new $20,000 model waiting in       the wings, but he likes the old one better--it's the same       kind he learned on at St-Viateur.        He likes reminiscing about his time there. Myer, he says,       once bought football tickets for six employees. They all       showed up to St-Viateur, excited, and stuffed into Myer's       car. He drove two blocks, parked and told them they were all       taking the subway: ``I'm not paying for parking.'' Myer later       helped Lloyd buy his first house.        Lloyd worked at St-Viateur for 15 years, half of his life       at that point, and only left after Myer died of cancer.        2:32 a.m.        Lloyd makes coffee, so some will be ready when the shop       opens at 4 a.m.        The fire is already roaring.        3:06 a.m.        He pours the requisite honey into the kettle.        3:27 a.m.        The gluten-free bagels are ``dropped'' first. Lloyd created       his own GF flour mix and is the only one who makes it in the       bakery. In total, he has 42 bagel recipes.        His favorite is ``Montreal Spice Whole Wheat . . . which we       don't sell. I make them just for me.''        3:30 a.m.        The first batch of dough is ready. On a normal day, the       bakery will go through four of these 140-pound masses.        3:32 a.m.        The rolling begins.        The room already smells of honey and toasted sesame seeds.        3:40 a.m.        The boiling begins.        As Lloyd drops the first gluten-full bagels, he says he       sees money differently. ``When I bought a car, I went,       `That's 15,000 bagels. I have to make those!' ''        3:52 a.m.        Baker Matt Audette, 25, covers the boiled bagels in       rosemary. They go in the oven immediately. Matt was born and       raised in Vermont, but came from a pretzel-baking job in       Washington, D.C. He likes the early hours.        4:02 a.m.        17-year-old Kyle McGuire has worked at Myer's for two       months, and Lloyd is by his side, training him to roll. When       Kyle is done with his shift, he'll go home to shower and head       to Colchester High School, where he's a senior.        Lloyd says he trained 100 bakers at St-Viateur; 75 are       still there.        4:08 a.m.        The shop has been open for eight minutes.        Everyone is working quickly before the morning rush.        4:09 a.m.        The second batch of dough goes in the mixer.        4:16 a.m.        The ready bagels are tossed into a long metal tray called       the chute.        Lloyd organizes them.        4:34 a.m.        Matt ensures the boiled bagels are fully covered. The honey       in the water helps make everything stick.        4:58 a.m.        The first customers arrive, tired and hungry.        5:06 a.m.        Lloyd moves to the station where his team slices bagels       headed for bags. He explains that each bagel has to be cut       with a knife because the hand-rolling process results in       varying shapes unfit for a standard slicer. There were three       main jobs at St-Viateur, he says: bagging, rolling and       baking. Myer had told Lloyd that as he worked his way up,       he'd make more money. Lloyd retold this story, laughing,       because he learned that the increased pay didn't come from a       better hourly rate, but from the longer hours required:       baggers worked 20, rollers worked 40 and bakers worked 75.        5:18 a.m.        Batch two is ready for rolling. There are five ingredients       in the dough:        -King Arthur's Sir Lancelot High-GlutenFlour        -Malted Barley Flour ? Sugar        -Water        -Yeast Lloyd estimates that 3,000 to 4,000 pounds of King       Arthur flour and 400 pounds of Green Mountain Creamery cream       cheese are consumed during an average week.        5:30 a.m.        Lloyd finally sits down for breakfast: a plain bagel with       lox, scallion cream cheese and tomatoes. He washes it down       with a Natalie's orange juice and is done by 5:35 a.m. It's       the only non-bathroom break he takes during his 8.5 hours in       the bakery.        5:38 a.m.        The chute is already littered with seeds beneath the wire       baskets. Over the course of the day, three to five pounds of       seeds will end up there. They'll be collected and thrown in       the fire because they still have oil.        ``It flavors the oven,'' Lloyd says.        5:39 a.m.        He mans the oven, which he built with three friends over       five 18-hour days, using 3,700 fire bricks. He'll       occasionally make pizza with his dough, adding crushed       tomato, garlic and 15-year-aged provolone, which he'll top       with his Montreal spice mix. It's not on the menu, but he'll       make it for party-sized orders.        6:36 a.m.        Dough number three is thrown in the mixer.        It's clear that the machine is old: a clamp and bag of       flour keep it closed.        6:40 a.m.        A rush of customers begins.        6:47 a.m.        Lloyd rolls with Kyle again.        Matt and Kyle explain how Lloyd can roll a bagel and throw       it perfectly into place anywhere across the table, or even       into the oven.        6:55 a.m.        Lloyd rolls alone again.        I clock him at roughly a baker's dozen per minute. He says       he could get up to 38, if needed, though he's recovering from       an eye injury. He's worked with people who could do 40 to 45,       no problem.        7:32 a.m.        Matt calls out, ``Fresh rosemary!''        Two customers grin and peer over to see the bagels lobbed       into the chute.        The bagels are flipped and flung using a long wooden paddle       called a shebah. The spelling of this word varies. When asked       why it's called a shebah, Lloyd says, ``That's what he called       it.''        ``He'' means Myer.        Lloyd used to buy the paddles in Montreal, but now       commissions them from Sterling Furniture Works across the       street. They start as blonde, unvarnished wood. Over time,       they develop a dark patina in the oven, the far edge turning       black.        7:36 a.m.        Kyle asks Lloyd, ``How's it going?''        Lloyd replies, ``Living the dream.''        He always responds, ``Living the dream'' or ``Rolling in       the dough,'' Kyle says.        They both laugh.        7:50 a.m.        The rolling continues. Lloyd estimates they've made 110       dozen bagels thus far.        They bake between 250 and 300 dozen on an average day, he       says, which is 3,000 to 3,600 bagels for those of us who       don't think in dozens.        8:08 a.m.        One burnt bagel comes out of the oven. It goes into the       fire next to the seeds.        Lloyd says Myer couldn't stand seeing anything wasted       because of his time in the Holocaust. According to the St-      Viateur website, Myer once spoke to a high school class and       said, ``At Buchenwald, all I dreamt of was a piece of       bread.''        8:10 a.m.        Kyle leaves, but before he does, out of earshot of Lloyd,       he says, ``He's a really awesome boss.''        8:16 a.m.        Lloyd takes the last sip of his gas station coffee, over       six hours after he bought it.        A group of visiting Austrians, who stopped by the day       before, say hi. One takes a picture, and Lloyd gives her a       free bagel.        8:20 a.m.        Lloyd hands a bag to someone from a local non-profit. He       estimates that on an average week, he donates 100 dozen to       local charities, including the Flynn Center for the       Performing Arts and Resource's YouthBuild.        8:23 a.m.        A police officer arrives for breakfast.        8:24 a.m.        There's a line, and the tables are full. Lloyd won't tell       you, but Myer's has been named best bagel shop in Vermont by       Epicurious, among others.        Why? It could be because people love Lloyd; he prefers       phone orders to web orders because he likes talking to his       customers and seeing how they're doing. It could be because       he learned from Myer Lewkowicz, one of the Montreal-style       originators. It could be because St-Viateur has greatly       expanded its bagel production while Myer's is still only made       in one bakery, one batch at a time. It could be all three.        8:34 a.m.        The third batch of dough is ready. Lloyd cuts into it and       it looks like a sushi chef cutting into a side of tuna.        8:50 a.m.        An ex-Montrealer, who now owns a business in Winooski,       greets Lloyd in French. Lloyd later says that the man,       Marcel, was his first-ever customer in 1996.        9:00 a.m.        A group of people watch Lloyd roll his bagels. I ask what       it's like to always be watched. He says, ``I like to talk to       people.''        9:05 a.m.        Trisha Ubermuth, 25, stands on a milk crate to organize the       bagels.        In the past, Lloyd has told the story that she once came in       as a child and declared she'd work there one day. It's not       true, but Lloyd tells me that bagels are, in fact, a family       business.        His sister, mother and nephew still work at St-Viateur. His       daughter works for his cousin who runs his own bagel shop,       Brossard Bagel, just outside of Montreal.        9:07 a.m.  [[Page S7910]]         Lloyd gives a free, hot poppy seed bagel to Marcel, knowing       it's his favorite.        9:31 a.m.        The rush slows. Everyone works at the same pace.        10:31 a.m.        Lloyd finally leaves, but he's not done. Ahead of him, he's       got over four hours of driving through Northern Vermont with       seven bagel drop-offs on the way. He doesn't dread it though,       it's a pretty drive. And, ``I love getting out and meeting       people.''        He's got another bagel inhand for lunch. ``My car is       covered in sesame seeds,'' he says.        7:15 p.m.        He finally gets home after only stopping for a break at       Piecasso in Stowe. He's used to long drives.        When he first opened Myer's in 1996, he commuted from       Montreal, leaving at midnight every ``morning.'' He got his       green card in 1997. After three years of the 100-mile       commute, and a car accident caused by sleeping at the wheel,       he moved to Vermont. He then worked 15-hour days, seven days       a week for seven years.        ``I've never worked less than 65 hours a week,'' he says.        He's barely gotten outside of Vermont and Montreal because       of the schedule. Now, fortunately, he gets a day off on the       weekend. He's recently been to both Connecticut and Boston.        He hopes one day to retire in Nova Scotia. But, first, he's       going to open a new take-and-bake bagel business with his       friend Sid Berkson in Enosburg Falls.        And, he's still got a bakery to run.        9:30 p.m.        He drinks chamomile tea and falls asleep, again, to hockey.       The next morning, he wakes up without an alarm at 1:15 a.m.       It's Saturday, and there will be twice as many customers. He       looks forward to meeting them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier this month, Marcelle and I, with  Marcelle's brother, Claude Pomerleau, attended the Kennedy Center  Honors Dinner at the State Department. We were moved by Deputy  Secretary of State John J. Sullivan's remarks, which touched on his  deep admiration for foreign service and his great appreciation of  American arts and culture. I wanted to share with the Senate his  remarks, which were filled with historical references and bits of  humor.   I ask unanimous consent that Deputy Secretary of State Sullivan's  remarks be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             Center Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan                 Remarks at the 2018 Kennedy Center Honors                      December 2, 2018, Washington, D.C.         DEPUTY SECRETARY SULLIVAN: Good evening. It's an honor for       my wife, Grace Rodriguez, and me to welcome you to the       Department of State. Secretary Pompeo asked that I extend his       sincere regrets he's unable to be with us tonight because of       his travel to Buenos Aires for the G20 summit. It's a real       privilege to be asked to stand in for the Secretary of State       at a very special event like this. Deputy secretaries are       usually delegated humbler duties.        I'd like to begin by thanking Kennedy Center Chairman David       Rubenstein, Kennedy Center President Deborah Rutter, Event       Chair Suzanne Niedland for their service and leadership. And       thanks to all of you in attendance tonight for coming to       honor the esteemed recipients of this year's Kennedy Center       Honor.        Gathered as we are in the Department of State, I must note       with a heavy heart the passing last night in Texas of       President George H.W. Bush, my former boss many years ago.       President Bush cherished this place and this institution. He       was, of course, the U.S. permanent representative in the       United Nations in the early 1970s, and later our first       representative to the People's Republic of China. And since       we're gathered in the Benjamin Franklin Room, I also note       that President Bush shares a distinction with Franklin: They       both served as our nation's representative to a vitally       important country but without holding the title of       ambassador. 1974, when President Bush was named the chief of       our liaison office in Beijing, the United States did not have       diplomatic relations with China. Two hundred years before,       when Franklin was sent on a commission to France and then       appointed our minister in Paris, the Court of Versailles       would not accept an ambassador from a self-declared republic       like ours. Only sovereign monarchs exchanged ambassadors       until well into the 19th century.        I've thought a lot about Franklin during my service as       deputy secretary of state. We host many special historic       events here in the Benjamin Franklin Room, including a       luncheon earlier this year for President Macron of France       during his state visit to the United States, and I'm often       asked to provide remarks. The speechwriters who prepared a       first draft appropriately note the venue, and refer to       Franklin as the first American diplomat, our minister to       France. But they also inevitably described him as, quote,       ``the father of the Foreign Service.'' And that's always       struck me as a stale, patriarchal language unsuited for the       21st century, and unlikely to inspire young Foreign Service       officers. But my effort to craft an alternative that would       motivate a new generation to careers in American diplomacy--      those efforts have failed recently. I spoke to a group of       eminent retired U.S. diplomats here in this room; they were       confused and appalled when I referred to Franklin as the       original gangster of the Foreign Service. (Laughter.)        So I've shifted my thinking to alternatives to enliven the       way we convey the remarkable life of Franklin. I had the idea       of bringing Franklin's story to life on the stage, perhaps       even a musical. (Laughter.) Who would want to see that?       Imagine, a musical about one of America's founding fathers.       (Laughter.) You laugh, but in fact, there was a Broadway       musical about Franklin, Ben Franklin in Paris, staged in       1964, and it faded quickly into obscurity. (Laughter.)        But I'm serious about promoting and honoring America's       diplomats past and present, whether it's Franklin, President       Bush, or our current friends and colleagues at this       department who are working to promote and protect America's       interests, America's values, and American citizens at       hundreds of posts, embassies, consulates, and missions around       the world, many in dangerous and difficult circumstances.       Their work is made easier by the worldwide popularity--      indeed, the pervasive influence--of the best of American arts       and culture, which is what we're here to celebrate tonight.        It is through the arts that we, the American people, tell       our story. We express the richness of our culture and       artistry when we export it to the rest of the world. And the       impact cannot be overstated. Music, theater, cinema--every       medium we celebrate tonight (inaudible) United States shows       to the world who we are. The work of the American artists       gathered here in this room is a powerful form of diplomacy.       Your influence is felt around the world.        The Kennedy Center Honors program recognizes these       exceptional artists who have contributed so much to our       culture and our world. The program is in its 41st year, and       its honorees include some of the most iconic figures in the       arts. This year's honorees certainly fall squarely into that       category.        Cher, our first honoree, needs no introduction. She's       commonly referred to as the, quote, ``goddess of pop,''       unquote, and I tested that assertion with a Google search,       whose results showed that to be true. (Laughter.) But I use       the word ``commonly'' with a purpose, because that is too       common a title for such an extraordinary talent and person.       She's achieved towering success in music, on television, on       stage, and in films. The accolades included here are too many       to name. Her voice and her music--``I Got You Babe,'' ``If I       Could Turn Back Time,'' ``Believe''--I could go on, to name       just a few--those songs are loved worldwide and have made her       a global superstar and a household name.        Composer and pianist Philip Glass is our second honoree.       He's no stranger to State Department programs and proudly       represented the United States as a Fulbright Scholar in Paris       in the 1960s. Since then, Mr. Glass has only gone on to       compose more than 25 operas, 10 symphonies, as well as       concertos, film soundtracks, and countless other works. Truly       in a league of his own, he's the recipient of the U.S.       National Medal of the Arts, and next month the Los Angeles       Philharmonic will present the world premiere of his 12th       symphony.        Our third honoree is another legend, Reba McEntire. And I       am not ashamed to say as a humble bureaucrat, I can't believe       I got to shake Reba McEntire's hand. (Laughter.) I'm telling       you, it's unbelievable. Thank you, Mike Pompeo. (Laughter.)       Her songs--``Fancy,'' ``Is There Life Out There,'' ``I'm a       Survivor''--have given her worldwide fame. She's recorded 25       number-one singles and sold over 56 million albums. But she's       achieved great success in other fields, including on       television and in movies. All you have to do is say her first       name, and the world knows exactly who you're talking about.        Wayne Shorter, the famous jazz saxophonist and composer is       next. He deservedly has been called--and again, I quote--a       genius, trailblazer, a visionary, and one of the world's       greatest composers. He's played with Miles Davis, Joni       Mitchell, Steely Dan, Carlos Santana--the list goes on. He's       won 11 Grammy Awards, including a lifetime achievement award,       but admirably, he does not rest on his laurels. He's now       working on his first album.        Finally, we honor the co-creators of Hamilton, and I hope       they will consider my suggestion of Franklin: An American       Musical. I'm just saying, Hamilton's secretary of treasury;       versus the secretary of state. (Laughter.) Just think about       that. These individuals--Lin-Manuel Miranda, Thomas Kail,       Andy Blankenbuehler, and Alex Lacamoire--together they wrote,       acted in, directed, choreographed, and arranged what has       become the best known, groundbreaking stage production of our       time. They are trailblazers who have created art that defies       categorization, breaks down barriers, and brings American       history to life.        My youngest son, Teddy, is a senior at Hamilton College and       among the show's biggest fans. He likes to wear his college       sweatshirt around Miami--excuse me, around Manhattan--and       engage the tourists who ask where do they paraphernalia like  [[Page S7911]]       that from the show. (Laughter.) He patiently explains to them       the merits of college, the musical, and being at the center       of both.        Now, I know I'm standing in the way of your dinner, so I       will conclude with an acknowledgement of a prior Kennedy       Center honoree--and I kind of slipped this before when I said       Miami instead of Manhattan--and that's because we're joined       tonight by Gloria Estefan. Welcome back. (Applause.) My wife       Grace and the Rodriguez family are delighted to see whom we       consider the first lady of Cuban Americans here tonight.        Thank you, again, on behalf of the Department of State, for       allowing us to be part of this celebration to pay tribute to       the lifetime contributions of the remarkable women and men we       honor tonight. Please enjoy your dinner. Thanks. (Applause.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, a remarkable Vermonter has reached a  remarkable milestone. Enid Wonnacott of Huntington, VT, deserves our  thanks for and recognition of her more than 30 years of agricultural  leadership in Vermont and the Nation.   Enid has led the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont,  NOFA-VT, since 1987. Her early leadership of NOFA coincided with my  chairmanship of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition,  and Forestry. Enid was a constant source of counsel to me about the  importance and unlimited potential of organic agriculture for Vermont  and the Nation, and she was a strong advocate and adviser as I worked  to make the National Organic Standards Act a part of the 1990 farm  bill. This is the law that authorized the national organic standards  and labeling program, ushering in the remarkable and still-burgeoning  growth of America's thriving organic sector.   Since that time, Vermont continues to be a leader in our country's  now $60 billion annual organic industry. To this day, I continue to  look to Enid for advice on organic agriculture and nutrition issues.  Enid Wonnacott's many accomplishments are presented in a profile  published in ``Seven Days'' in Vermont on October 30, 2018. I ask  unanimous consent for the profile to be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [Seven Days Vermont, October 30, 2018]            Longtime OrganicAg Leader Enid Wonnacott Steps Down                            (By Melissa Pasanen)          Enid Wonnacott has tallied many accomplishments over 30-      plus years as executive director of the Northeast Organic       Farming Association of Vermont. In 1987, her 10-hour-per-week       job came with one filing cabinet and a milk crate filled with       paperwork. Since then, Wonnacott has built the nonprofit into       a 20-person team supported by a $2.8 million budget. NOFA-VT       has had an impact not only on Vermont agriculture but       nationwide.         Wonnacott started at the association the same year that       Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) became chair of the Senate       agriculture committee. The two worked closely on developing       the National Organic Program, which eventually led to the       creation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture organic seal       in 2002.         ``Enid has been one of the most effective advocates for       organic agriculture in the entire country,'' Leahy told Seven       Days via email, acknowledging that the road was long and that       challenges continue. ``Through all of this, as a leader, Enid       has been patient but persistent and always a clear-eyed       problem solver. I have often looked for Enid's help on       difficult policy challenges,'' Leahy added, ``and she has       never been reluctant to let me know exactly what needs doing       to support and strengthen organic agriculture.''         ``This is recognition of her role as guardian and voice of       the organic movement,'' Ross said. ``It also recognizes the       evolution of organic as a significant and meaningful part of       our economy in Vermont and the economy nationally.''         Under Wonnacott's guidance, NOFA-VT has become the go-to       resource for organic farmers and gardeners, agricultural       advocates, and locavores for everything from technical       production assistance to comprehensive lists of farmers       markets and CSAs. There were fewer than 50 organic producers       in 1987; now NOFA-VT certifies more than 700. Its robust       farm-to-school partnership, subsidized farm shares and other       efforts work to broaden access to local and organic food.         The nonprofit's mobile pizza oven, though, is probably the       most vivid symbol of Wonnacott's unique contributions: She       embodies the warm heart of Vermont's organic agriculture       movement, pulling community together around organic food and       the farmers who produce it.         ``I love that whole program and initiative as much as       anything we do,'' Wonnacott said, after smoothly maneuvering       the oven into Burlington's Intervale on a September       afternoon. Later that day, she headed up a team of volunteers       and Intervale Center employees to bake pizzas for an event,       hands in the dough, laughing and hugging longtime friends who       stopped by.         Launched in 2006, the portable pizza oven fulfilled a       vision Wonnacott had for gathering people around food in a       way that fostered connection and conversation. ``I'm       passionate about community building,'' she explained. ``I       think people need and seek community.''         Particularly in the early days, freshly baked pizza helped       raise NOFA-VT's profile with consumers and farmers. The       copper-domed, wood-fired oven on a trailer has logged       thousands of miles and produced thousands of pizzas at events       such as farmers markets and young-farmer socials.         Since Wonnacott's cancer diagnosis in 2014, working the       oven has also provided a personal benefit. ``It's such a       physical, present thing to do, especially when you have chemo       brain,'' she said. ``To get out and see people is a really       healthy thing for me.''         People who have worked with Wonnacott say her positive       energy and balanced approach have been both anchor and beacon       through the hard work of building a movement.         Mara Hearst, now a sheep farmer in Dorset, was 19 when she       first met Wonnacott, who invited her to become a student       representative on the NOFA-VT board. Hearst said Wonnacott's       consistent message as a leader and mentor has been: ``We need       to make change, and there's a shitload to do, but let's take       time to be a community together.''         ``After hours, she's the first one to turn on the music       and get everyone dancing,'' said NOFA-NY board member       Elizabeth Henderson. When she was founding president of NOFA-      Mass., Henderson was on the committee that originally hired       Wonnacott for the Vermont chapter. ``It's one of the things       I'm proudest of,'' she said.         The agricultural landscape has changed dramatically since       Wonnacott became the nonprofit's third executive director at       age 26, fresh out of graduate school.         According to the Organic Trade Association, organic food       sales in the U.S. hit $45.2 billion in 2017 and accounted for       5.5 percent of all food sold. Twenty years ago, OTA's first       published sales figure was $3.4 billion.         The USDA National Organic Program helped propel growth.       However, its integrity has been questioned over the past       couple of years based on media coverage of probable standards       noncompliance by large organic dairy and egg operations.       Investigation also revealed that some organic imports were       receiving fraudulent certifications. Then the USDA withdrew       approved, strengthened organic animal-welfare standards,       though they had not yet been enforced.         After her initial diagnosis but before her cancer spread,       Wonnacott had planned to retire in 2021, when NOFA-VT will       turn 50. ``But it's also a good time now,'' she said. ``I       recognize there are a lot of changes to the organic industry,       challenges to organic integrity. I think there's a need for       really strong leadership, someone who has the energy I had       when I started.'' After a pause she added, ``I don't have the       fight anymore, just my love and appreciation for this       movement. I want it to be shepherded by somebody with a lot       of health and energy right now.''         Wonnacott's deep passion for agriculture was seeded while       growing up on her family's Weybridge homestead. Her mother       was dean of students at Middlebury College. Her father died       of cancer when Wonnacott, the youngest of three sisters, was       16. She spent a lot of time on a neighboring dairy farm,       showed livestock at the fair and worked with a large animal       veterinarian.         At St. Lawrence University in New York State, Wonnacott       studied biology and chemistry and first learned about organic       agriculture. She relief-milked for a nearby organic dairy and       read Wendell Berry's 1977 classic, The Unsettling of America:       Culture & Agriculture. ``You know when you read a book and       you're like, Oh, my God. This is what's in my head,'' she       recalled.         During a semester in Kenya, Wonnacott learned how to treat       cobra bites and hand-milk a 70-cow herd. Kenyan agriculture       was organic ``by default,'' she said. ``There was money to       supply inputs, but no one knew what to do with them. I saw       huge piles of imported chemical fertilizer next to broken-      down tractors.'' As graduation neared, Wonnacott applied to       veterinary school and, at her mother's suggestion, for a       yearlong Thomas J. Watson Fellowship to study alternative       agriculture. ``My mom was a really strong role model as far       as `women can do anything,' '' Wonnacott said. ``She       supported what was in my heart.''         She won the fellowship and worked on organic farms in New       Zealand, Nepal, Norway and England; the experience was       pivotal. ``It was an agricultural system that made common       sense to me, a culture of preventative management and health       for the soil, the plants and the animals,'' Wonnacott said.       ``I wanted to know, Why does the world not farm this way?''         Back in the U.S., she taught biology and environmental       education and became an organic certification inspector       before pursuing graduate studies at UVM.'' I had to figure       out why the world works the way it does,'' she said. ``How       does our agriculture policy influence other countries? How do       supply, demand and financial systems work?'' For her thesis,       Wonnacott interviewed organic farmers about the role of       policy in effecting  [[Page S7912]]       change. ``In the end, I felt like it's all about grassroots--      that was where change was going to come from,'' she said.         When Wonnacott landed the job at NOFA-VT shortly after       finishing school, she built on her thesis contacts to launch       that grassroots effort. In the mid-'80s, Wonnacott recalled,       ``organic was really the underground.'' Farmers told her they       didn't label produce organic because customers would assume       it had worms. ``People thought it was just hippies playing       around,'' she said. ``It wasn't respected.''         Her goal, Wonnacott said, was to raise the status of the       movement and provide support to farmers in the pre-internet       age. She also prioritized developing a farmer-driven organic       certification program with lengthy discussions to hash out       standards. ``For me, fascinated by movement building, by how       groups make decisions, these were really amazing meetings,''       Wonnacott said.         Jack Lazor of Butterworks Farm in Westfield met Wonnacott       when she was a graduate student and worked helping to deliver       the farm's yogurt to stores. He was part of the first       community forum she later led in her new NOFA-VT role. ``She       did it all at the beginning,'' Lazor said. ``She built this       thing up through goodwill and positive forces. She's a force,       but a gentle force.'' At the time, organic standards were not       consistent state to state, and Wonnacott soon found herself       at the center of a sea change.         Organic was growing rapidly, she recalled: ``Sen. Leahy       came to me. There was a lot of interest from California to       create a level playing field for interstate trade. He wanted       to know, `What does Vermont think of this?' '' Wonnacott and       other organic pioneers were both nervous and hopeful about       federal involvement. ``It's hard when you've been an underdog       not to be totally wowed by the attention and money for       research and organic support,'' she said. It soon became       clear, she said, that a national organic program ``was going       to move forward with or without us and we had to put our       energy into making it the best it could be.''         Pragmatism is a Wonnacott hallmark, according to Megan       Camp, vice president and program director at Shelburne Farms.       The two women served together on a statewide council       alongside diverse agriculture community representatives.       Tension would occasionally arise, Camp acknowledged: ``Some       people would pound the table, point fingers. Enid would make       the same argument firmly, but always listening, able to hear       multiple perspectives.''         Wonnacott believes strongly that it doesn't help to label       types of farming as ``good'' or ``bad.'' But she recognizes       that her approach has disappointed some. ``We're a really       inclusive organization, and that's been really important to       me,'' she said. ``We want to move all farmers along the       sustainability spectrum, never be organic elitist, never say       this is the only way you can farm. ``It's been a conflict for       some staff and some board members over the years,       absolutely,'' Wonnacott continued.         This was particularly evident when the local food movement       gathered momentum, sometimes at the expense of organic. ``Our       tagline has been, `Certified organic, locally grown'--you       don't have to choose,'' she said. But in practice, consumers       and farmers set their own priorities. For example, Wonnacott       explained, if one local farmer sells eggs from free-range       hens but also feeds them GMO grain and customers think that's       good enough, how can the local organic farmer charge the       premium price that's needed to cover expensive, non-GMO       grain?         Wonnacott is playing the long game. She believes that       collaboration and mutual support are critical to sustaining       agriculture in Vermont and nudging more farmers toward       organic practices. ``I believe we can be both a movement       builder and a bridge builder,'' she said. ``It's allowed us       to be at the table for a lot of really important       conversations, and I think it was pivotal in my hall of fame       award.''         Andy Jones, manager of Burlington's Intervale Community       Farm and former NOFA-VT board president, believes ``the big       tent'' has served the agricultural community well. Early on,       he noted, Wonnacott saw the benefit of offering technical       assistance to conventional dairies that were exploring a       transition to organic. She recognized that farm-to-school       programs could provide markets for local and organic farmers       and also teach new generations to appreciate the food. ``She       always wanted to build the answer ``to any problem, said       Jones. She sought ``ways to build the ag community, the rural       community. She knows Vermont is stronger when everyone is       successful.''         Wonnacott understands that her successor will face       challenges. NOFA-VT membership is stagnant at about 1,200       members, and this year's winter conference attendance was       down across NOFA state chapters. The USDA organic integrity       issues have provoked fractures within the organic community,       along with public confusion and distrust.'' I fear for the       future of organic, the splintering that's taking place,'' she       admitted.         Wonnacott is also concerned that new farmers don't see a       need to be certified, noting that Vermont is about to see a       huge land shift and transition between generations. ``I       really want beginning farmers to feel there's value in this       movement,'' she said. ``We need a really strong beginning-      farmer wave to replace the pioneering farmers.''         It's fitting in some ways that Wonnacott is navigating a       transition while also helping many of the farmers with whom       she started her career navigate their own. She has co-      facilitated two meetings with the old guard. ``It's like deep       therapy for all of us,'' she said with a chuckle. ``These are       the farmers who really inspired me. I wanted to do everything       I could to make their farms and their lives successful. That       drive has carried me through, and I could have done it for       another 30 years.''         After she steps down in the spring, Wonnacott will stay       involved in other ways. She's training to become an organic       inspector and will do that part time. She will also help out       during the pizza-oven season. But mostly, Wonnacott will       focus on her health, her family--husband Harry Frank and       their two grown children--and their Huntington homestead.         It's no surprise, though, that Wonnacott has not stopped       dreaming up new, creative ways to support her passions. ``One       of my favorite things to do is long-distance walking,'' she       said, explaining that she has solo-walked trails around the       world, most recently Ireland's Dingle Way. Wonnacott       envisions a statewide farm-to-farm walk to raise awareness of       organic agriculture and community. The Vermont walk would not       be a solo endeavor, however. With her signature warm smile       Wonnacott said, ``I have a great vision of hundreds of people       joining me to walk for the cause.''                            ____________________
