 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to thank some individuals who  helped in the passage of my bill, the Susquehanna National Heritage  Act, which designates York and Lancaster Counties in the district that  I represent as a national heritage area.   I thank Senator Bob Casey, who has been working on this in the Senate  for 12 years, as well as Representative   Rob Bishop from Utah, who  helped push this bill through the Natural Resources Committee when he  served as chair there last year. Representative   Tom McClintock was  chair of the subcommittee.   Also, I would like to recognize Mark Platts and Jonathan Pinkerton of  Susquehanna Heritage. They have been proposing this and working on it  in the district, and they will be helping to manage this national  heritage area.   I also thank Columbia Mayor Leo Lutz, who testified in support of the  bill last year.   National heritage areas celebrate the special historic places in our  country and highlight the beauty and natural resources of our  community. They also provide 148,000 jobs and nearly $13 billion in  economic growth. Our area will definitely benefit from this  designation.   I am very proud to have worked with these folks to help this bill  become law. I am also grateful to my colleagues who supported the  passage of this bill, and I thank them for their hard work and help.                            ____________________
