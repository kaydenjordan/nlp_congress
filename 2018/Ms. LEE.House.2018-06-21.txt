 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me  the time and for his tireless advocacy.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4760. This is an  anti-immigrant bill, plain and simple: It fails to provide a pathway to  citizenship for Dreamers; it dismantles family immigration; it ends the  important diversity visa lottery program; it funds $30 billion for  Trump's border wall; and it fails to address the horrible zero- tolerance policy.   Why are we moving forward with a bill that does not address the  malicious detention of families seeking asylum, a bill that does  nothing to reunite the 2,300 children separated from their parents?   These policies are really a disgrace and a stain on our country.   Just imagine the horrors of these families fleeing violence, domestic  abuse, but we are not providing refuge. No. Our government--our  government--has been ripping children out of the arms of parents. We  are holding kids in cages. And now the Trump administration wants to  leave whole families, including young children, in jail for extended  periods of time.   Locking up kids is child abuse. It is a violation of their human  rights. We must ensure that these children are reunited with their  families.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill. And  as my colleague Congresswoman Chu said, it is about making America  White again.
