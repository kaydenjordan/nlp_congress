 Madam Speaker, in the wake of yet another tragedy, I  rise to recognize the month of June as National Gun Violence Awareness  Month.   On Friday, yet another 12 people lost their lives to gun violence,  this time in Virginia Beach. Twelve more families were ripped apart,  another community forever changed.   I know firsthand the devastation a gun can cause. The accidental  shooting that left me a quadriplegic was life-shattering. And yet the  pain of losing a parent, a child, or a friend is forever unimaginable.   I have said too many times to count that we must address the gun  violence epidemic head-on. We owe it to the family members, the  friends, and the neighbors who lost their lives in Virginia Beach and  the thousands more who will die this year.   We know the policies that work. Now we must have the courage to enact  them.                            ____________________
