 Mr. Speaker, the number of people in this country  without broadband is outrageous. Being on the wrong side of the digital  divide has a devastating impact on so many people in our society,  including students who need to complete homework; veterans and seniors  who need telehealth services; individuals trying to start a business,  applying for a job, or teleworking, or keeping up with the news or  loved ones.    This pandemic has shined a bright light on the connectivity issues  and disparities in this country.   Mr. Speaker, 34 percent of my constituents don't have broadband  service at home. This is due to gaps in broadband deployment and also  because many face adoption barriers. People simply can't afford  service.   I am proud that H.R. 2 includes the Digital Equity Act, which I  authored with Representatives Lujan and Clarke. It provides critical  funding to close gaps in broadband adoption and promote digital  literacy.   We are long overdue for ensuring that every American is connected to  broadband, but we have an opportunity to rise up to this challenge and  address this issue by voting ``yes'' on H.R. 2.
