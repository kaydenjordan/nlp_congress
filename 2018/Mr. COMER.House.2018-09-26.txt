 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kristin Hill  Taylor, who recently received recognition as a 2018 Angels in Adoption  Honoree and whom I am honored to have with me in the gallery today.  This is the second time I have had the privilege of nominating a  deserving individual for their outstanding work in the adoption  community.   Kristin is a resident of Murray, Kentucky, along with her husband,  Greg, and their three children they adopted as newborns--Cate in 2007,  Ben in 2009, and Rachel in 2015.   A compassionate adoptive mother, Kristin is an advocate for the  adoption community and has created a great platform for sharing stories  about adoption, family, and faith on her blog, kristinhilltaylor.com.  She also self-published her family's story in a book entitled: ``Peace  in the Process: How Adoption Built My Faith & My Family.''   Kristin's advocacy and platform for story sharing have helped grow  and empower many members of the adoption community both near and far.  We have an active adoption and foster community in the district of  Kentucky which I represent, and I am proud to recognize adoptive  families and individuals like Kristin who pave the way for countless  folks in the adoption community.   On behalf of the First District of Kentucky, I congratulate Kristin  on all she does for children in need of loving homes and for families  who want to grow through the adoption process.
