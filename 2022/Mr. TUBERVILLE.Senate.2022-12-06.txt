 Madam President, I want to honor a great public  servant and Alabamian, my first chief of staff, Stephen Boyd. After  nearly two decades of public service, we recently said goodbye to this  integral part of our team. When you run for Congress, you learn that  people are quick to give you advice--especially when you have had a  lifelong career outside of politics. One tip I heard over and over was  ``hire a good chief of staff.''   I assembled a lot of teams as a coach. I could easily tell you what  makes a ``good'' offensive coordinator or a ``good'' defensive  coordinator. But when I thought about what would make a ``good'' chief  of staff, I decided I needed someone with three main qualifications:  one, someone who knew the Federal Government; two, someone who knew  Alabama; and three, someone who would lead with integrity. There were a  lot of people who fit the first two qualifications, but the third  qualification, integrity, was the most important to me. I was looking  for someone who didn't just have the knowledge or skills required to  oversee a Senate office and advise a Senator who was new to politics. I  was looking for someone who wanted to do the right thing for the people  we represent, someone who puts the service of others first. And that  someone was Stephen Boyd.   To simply say Stephen was born to serve and born to lead would be  accurate. Stephen's grandfathers and father served in the military, and  his family is dedicated to their community--but it would not tell the  full picture. Stephen has purposefully led a life dedicated to constant  learning so that he could be a better servant of others. A native of  Birmingham, Stephen received his undergraduate degree from the  University of Alabama. He used his God-given talents throughout his  time in college to lead in many roles, including as president of  university programs. Just last year, Stephen was awarded the  University's Bert Bank Distinguished Service and Achievement Award, one  of school's highest alumni honors. He went on to earn a law degree at  Alabama, and upon graduation, Stephen felt a calling to serve--and  headed to Washington, DC, to work for then-Senator Jeff Sessions from  Alabama. During his time in Senator Sessions' office, Stephen held  positions of increasing responsibility and served at times in policy  and communications roles.   He quickly earned a reputation for being able to digest complex  policy details and tell the story of the office's work in a way that  resonated with Alabamians back home. This is where Stephen began to  fully understand the responsibility that all of our offices have to  keep our constituents informed. While Senator Sessions served on the  Judiciary Committee, Stephen led the Senator's communications through  some of the most crucial moments in the Senate: Supreme Court  nominations and confirmations. It was also during this time that  Stephen met Martha Roby. At the time, Martha was an attorney in  Montgomery running for the U.S. House is an extremely competitive  district. Senator Sessions asked Stephen to serve his State by going  home and making sure Martha became Congresswoman Roby. Stephen, of  course, agreed. He ran a campaign in what turned out to be the most  expensive election in the district's history, and Martha Roby would go  on to serve in the House for a decade. After helping her earn her place  in Congress, Congresswoman Roby naturally asked Stephen to help build  her office in DC as her chief of staff.   Again, he stepped up. It was a new challenge to start an office from  scratch, but Stephen is always willing to put in the effort to find  solutions. That is one of the things that stands out most about  Stephen: his devotion to learning. He learns the details of  institutions he works for, the Members he works for, and the  constituents he works for, all in order to ensure he is consistently  meeting their needs. He learned quickly how important the role of  oversight is for Congress. And through all of his roles so far, he has  maintained a great respect for the power of congressional oversight and  what it means for the American people. In Martha Roby's office, Stephen  led his team to investigate the care provided by Department of Veterans  Affairs to Alabama's veterans. Under his  [[Page S6996]]  leadership, Stephen and led his colleagues conducted a months-long  effort to expose mismanaged care of our veterans and a scheme at some  VA facilities to falsely report wait times, covering up the fact that  veterans were waiting months for delayed care. The investigation  resulted in top leadership changes and disciplinary action against  multiple VA administrators and an audit to weed out those who were  lying about the treatment of our country's veterans. That commitment to  finding and exposing the truth was an invaluable quality when Stephen  was asked to combine his experience on the Hill with his law degree and  serve at the U.S. Department of Justice.   When President Trump tapped Senator Sessions to be his Attorney  General, Stephen was appointed and confirmed by the Senate as the  Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs. This  achievement, which very few people can claim, was the culmination of  over a decade of thoughtful service and leadership--built on a deep  understanding of how Congress works. In this role, Stephen expertly  managed the Department of Justice's relationship with Congress through  often-contentious periods. He oversaw the Department's response to  countless oversight investigations, congressional and confirmation  hearings, and even several congressional subpoenas.   Every Senator relies on their staffs, and I had to build one from the  ground up. This was a difficult task, but I knew with Stephen Boyd at  the helm, he would ensure we got the right people in the right places.  A devoted Washington Nationals Fan, Stephen describes a Senate office  like a baseball team. It takes everyone collectively executing their  individual jobs to win the game. And Stephen made sure each member of  our staff had what they need to execute their role on our team.  Deliberate, decisive, and always fair, that is how our staff describes  Stephen. He kept the team calm, but motivated. He never notched today's  win at the expense of tomorrow's victory. There was always a new  solution to consider to a problem, and tough situations tended to look  better in the next morning's light.   From the very first day, Stephen instilled a culture of integrity,  inspiring our team to maintain a focus on doing what is right on behalf  of the people of Alabama. The only ``thanks'' he worried about getting  was a thank you from a constituent whose life we made a little better  by helping them. For these first 2 years of my term--arguably the most  formative years--Stephen was at the center of every decision and every  action we have taken on behalf of the State of Alabama. And one  singular question was his guiding light: ``Is it good for the people of  Alabama?''   This was especially true when it comes to our office's work on the  Senate Armed Services Committee. Stephen traveled around the State, the  country, and the world to see our military in action. He focused on how  we can use our position on the Armed Services Committee to support the  military footprint in Alabama and our men and women in uniform. Stephen  pushed us to take a listen-first approach--to ask our military leaders  what they need and to actually listen to those requests. Thanks to his  leadership, we secured authorization of funding for a number of  projects important for the future of our national defense capabilities.  Some of these include: new barracks at Ft. Rucker, missile defense  projects, the construction of more ships in Mobile, a new physics lab  at Redstone Arsenal, and a new commercial vehicle inspection area at  Maxwell Air Force Base. And we even secured the No. 1 request from our  No. 1 commander in the Indo-Pacific region that had gone ignored for  years: a missile defense system for Guam.   Stephen was also a great support as Huntsville readies to become  Space Command's home in the next few years. He led the staffs of the  Alabama congressional delegation to have a united front in supporting  this transition and ensured our office maintains near-constant  communication with the Huntsville community and defense industry to  ensure a smooth transition. Once again, Stephen's approach to work--ask  first, work diligently behind the scenes, and do what is right for the  people--was an effective way to get things done. These are just a few  examples of how Stephen's leadership had external success.   But what people won't see are the daily moments of impact he had on  our office. Stephen was a trusted and reliable adviser. You ask a  question, and he will shoot you straight, even if you don't like the  answer. And for me, his trustworthiness and transparency were  invaluable these past 2 years. He worked to ensure I had all the  information, from all sides of the argument, in order to make a final  decision. And at the end of the day, Stephen always had the people of  Alabama in mind.   Stephen didn't spend the last two decades of his career trying to  gain acclaim. He quietly worked in the background to help improve the  lives of Alabamians. And I have no doubt he will continue with that  sense of service in his next endeavors.   Our office will greatly miss his steady hand and calm leadership. But  we know public service is not just a burden of time and effort borne by  the servant. I also want to thank Stephen's wife, Brecke, for her  constant support.   So, Stephen, thank you for your service to our office, the State of  Alabama, and to our country.                            ____________________
