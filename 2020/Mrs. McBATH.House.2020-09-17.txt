 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  for bringing this vital legislation to the floor.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will ensure that no woman is  unfairly fired or forced to risk the health of themselves or their  pregnancy just to earn a paycheck. Our mothers deserve these Federal  protections.   We want all to support our working mothers. Allowing them simple  accommodations can ensure that they are able to continue working and  provide a living for themselves and for their families.   Twenty-seven States have already passed laws that require certain  employers to provide accommodations to pregnant women. It is time for  federal action to ensure that all pregnant women are protected from  discrimination and continue to support their families. This legislation  is supported by both women's health groups and the business community.   I have here a letter from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce voicing strong  support for this legislation, and I submit this letter for the Record.          Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,                                                September 14, 2020.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports H.R. 2694, the       ``Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA).'' As reported by the       Committee on Education and Labor, this bipartisan compromise       would protect the interests of both pregnant employees and       their employers. The Chamber  [[Page H4519]]       will consider including votes on this legislation in our How       They Voted scorecard.        Employers currently face great uncertainty about whether,       and how, they are required to accommodate pregnant workers.       The revised PWFA would clarify an employer's obligation to       accommodate a pregnant employee or applicant with a known       limitation that interferes with her ability to perform some       essential functions of her position.        The PWFA takes advantage of the widely known and accepted       interactive process associated with the Americans with       Disabilities Act (ADA) that is used to find reasonable       accommodations for employees covered by the ADA, and also       carries forward the 15-or-more-employee threshold from the       ADA.        The Chamber worked extensively with advocates for this bill       to find bipartisan agreement. This important bill is a       reminder that through good faith negotiations, legislative       solutions to important questions and problems can be       achieved. We urge the House to pass the Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act.            Sincerely,                                                       Jack Howard.
