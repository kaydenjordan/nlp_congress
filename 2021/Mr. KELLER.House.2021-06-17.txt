 Madam Speaker, America's veterans have served our Nation  honorably, and they deserve timely access to the benefits they have  earned through their service.   The National Personnel Records Center was forced to scale down its  operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is currently staffed at 25  percent capacity, well below the staffing level needed to process the  estimated 5,000 records requests it receives on an average day. These  service records are required for veterans to access medical benefits;  adjudicate disability claims; and request a commendation, award, or  regalia, such as a Purple Heart or campaign service medal.   To date, there is a backlog of half a million veterans' requests at  the NPRC and, in some cases, veterans have waited for over a year for  documentation. That is unacceptable.   That is why I introduced the Records Act, which would compel the NPRC  to fully reopen, address the backlog, and develop a plan to prevent  this from ever happening again.   These men and women were willing to lay down their lives in service  to our Nation, and we need to continue working to ensure our veterans  get the level of responsiveness from their government that they  deserve.                            ____________________
