 Mr. Speaker, the American public very much wants to see  the full Mueller report. The Congress wants to see the full Mueller  report. They want to know what is in there about the Russians  interfering with our elections and if there is anything in there that  shows obstruction of justice, which Mr. Trump, according to Mr.  Mueller, was not exonerated for.   I am here to tell you, President Trump has said he wants the American  people to see the entire report unredacted. He thinks the American  public deserves to see everything in it about what the Russians did and  whether or not he or any people in his administration talked to  Russians or knew about Russian activity, whether there was even a  scintilla of collusion, and whether there was any possibility of  obstruction of justice.   That is President Trump today.   April Fools.                            ____________________
