 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order  to consider Rubio Amendment No. 4; that there be 2 minutes for debate  equally divided prior to a vote in relation to the amendment and 60  affirmative votes will be required for adoption, all without further  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I want to take a minute to speak against  this amendment.   This underlying bill is to repeal two war authorizations--one is 32  years old, and one is 20 years old. This amendment would turn 20- and  30-year-old wars into endless wars.   The amendment would say that no repeal could become effective until  the President certifies that Iran is no longer providing any material  or technical or financial support for bad activities in either Iraq or  Syria. So even if they are doing nothing in Iraq, the Iraq war still  isn't over as long as they are doing something in Syria.   Let's not turn 20- and 32-year-old wars into forever wars. The  American Legion opposes this amendment. I would urge my colleagues to  oppose it as well.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for all time to be yielded  back.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I would seek permission to speak for a minute in  opposition.    This is offered in good faith--and I appreciate my  colleague--but it is completely unnecessary for the following reason:  The White House and the Department of Justice have both stated, there  is no one currently detained pursuant to the 2002 authorization. It is  not being used as a ground for detaining anyone.   I was at the hearing yesterday, and my colleague from Idaho is  correct, Secretary Blinken talked about repeal of the 2001  authorization could affect detention and said we should not do a repeal  if there is not a replacement.   But the administration's position on the 2002 authorization is that  there are no military activities, including a single detention, where  we are using the 2002 as justification.   I would urge my colleagues to vote against the certification  requirement. Keep this bill a clean repeal of the 1991 and 2002  authorizations.                           Vote on Amendment No. 43
