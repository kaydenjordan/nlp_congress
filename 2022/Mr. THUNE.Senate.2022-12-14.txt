(Mr. KAINE assumed the Chair.)                            ____________________     Madam President, it is hard to believe that my friend  Richard Burr is leaving Congress. He is someone I have known since my  days in the House of Representatives, and we have been friends from the  very beginning. So it is difficult to imagine serving in the Senate  here without him. We came to the Senate in the same year as well. Our  wives are very close friends, and we have had many wonderful times with  the Burrs.   In fact, I have enjoyed hosting Richard in South Dakota on a number  of occasions. Richard is an outdoors guy, as I am, and he fits right in  in my home State of South Dakota--perhaps except for the fact that he  is the only guy not wearing socks. Although I will say, I have found  occasions which have required him to get the socks out of his suitcase.  During one of our trips to South Dakota to hunt pheasants, we landed in  Sioux Falls. We got off the plane and it was 7 degrees and I noticed at  the next stop he had socks on. So there are limitations to his practice  of not wearing socks.   But anyway one of our favorite pastimes, of course, in South Dakota  is pheasant hunting, and I have had Richard out there a number of times  during pheasant season. He is a great shot, I will say.   He has a favorite place to eat. It is Al's Oasis in Chamberlain, SD,  which is known for, among many things, homemade pies.   I discovered when Kimberly and I visited Richard and Brooke in North  Carolina, he is also a great handyman. Apparently, he thinks his guests  should be as well, since he put me right to work on a new door that he  was installing. We hung a door at his house. I was the grunt labor. He  was the architect, the designer, and just said: Hold this and that sort  of thing. So that was my job. But I was well paid for my trouble  because Richard also, in addition to his assets and his attributes of  being a handyman, is also an excellent cook. Many of you probably  perhaps here don't know that. But one of the privileges that I have  enjoyed in visiting Richard is getting to enjoy his cooking, and he  really can make just about anything--breakfast, lunch, dinner. I am not  saying he ought to open a restaurant in his retirement, but if he did,  I would certainly be the first in line at the opening.   Richard has certainly left his mark on Washington. His car, a 1974  Volkswagen Thing, often parked outside the Russell Building with the  top down no matter the season and adorned with his colleagues' campaign  stickers, I think everybody knows is a fixture here on Capitol Hill.   Richard, who as well as being a handyman is a capable mechanic, could  often be found working under the Thing's hood to keep it running, which  has become a true labor of love, particularly here in the last few  years.   But I would say that in this Chamber, of course, Richard is best  known and really known for being an outstanding legislator. And I have  to say thank you as he did to his outstanding staff. I mean there isn't  anybody here who works here who doesn't know that the heavy lifting in  this place gets done by staff. And so we appreciate your many years of  service to him and making him such an effective and accomplished  legislator. He mentioned the Capitol staff, the Capitol Police, who are  here on a daily basis protecting us, just saying how much we appreciate  everything you have done.  [[Page S7167]]    Richard has always been someone who knows how to get something done.  In addition to building a great team and staff around him, he knows how  to build coalitions. He knows how to get legislation across the finish  line, and that is evident in his record of accomplishment here in the  Senate. He talked a little bit about that. Promoting medical research  and innovation has been a passion of his; supporting veterans, changing  the way student loan interest rates are set to save families money;  working to ensure that childcare settings are safe and high quality;  establishing ABLE accounts for individuals with disabilities to help  better their lives, and the list goes on.   Long before COVID, Richard was working to prepare our Nation to  respond to the threat of a disaster or a pandemic; and since COVID, he  has worked to ensure that our Nation's future pandemic response  reflects the lessons that we have learned.   Of course, as he mentioned, his longtime work on the Intelligence  Committees of both the House and Senate and as chairman here of the  Senate Intelligence Committee, the number of hours I know he sat in  padded rooms in classified settings making sure that our country was  prepared, working with our intelligence community, as he mentioned, to  protect Americans from the threats that we face here at home and around  the world.   Richard has been a strong advocate for his home State of North  Carolina, particularly for veterans. He has worked to bring new VA  facilities to North Carolina to ensure that veterans and their families  who were exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune receive VA  medical care.   I think all of us get into this life in the hope that we can one day  leave Congress knowing that we have done something to make life better  for our fellow Americans. Richard can leave Congress with that  assurance.   I am going to miss him. It is a privilege and a blessing that you are  able to serve with a friend for so long. I will miss our daily  interactions. But I know that in Congress or not, our friendship will  endure, and I look forward to seeing all that Richard is going to do in  his next chapter in life.   I want to thank, as he said, Brooke, his sons and daughters-in-law  and now grandkids for the many sacrifices that they have made through  the years. I think we all know that this doesn't work unless you have  got a partner, and Brooke has been a partner for all these 28 years to  Richard and a part of everything that he has been able to accomplish  here.   So I wish him and his family many more happy hours in the years ahead  and congratulate him on his retirement and on a farewell speech that I  think we all ought to take to heart.   I yield the floor.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Burr) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz).   The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 45, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 391 Ex.]                                  YEAS--51       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Paul      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--45       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Capito      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Portman      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--4       Burr      Cruz      Hickenlooper      Sanders   The nomination was confirmed.
