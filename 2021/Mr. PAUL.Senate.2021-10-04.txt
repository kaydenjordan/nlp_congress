 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President.    Reserving the right to object, I join the chairman of the  Foreign Relations Committee in being supportive of Iron Dome, but I  think it should be paid for.   I think the American taxpayer dollars that pay for it should come  from money that could go to the Taliban. There is a fund with over $6  billion in it that was designated for the Afghan Government, and that  money, I think, could be spent on the Taliban if we do not rescind that  money.   The justification for my proposal for paying this is simple: Only an  economically strong United States can be a militarily strong ally of  Israel.   I support Israel. I voted for hundreds of millions of dollars to  support Iron Dome. I am glad the United States has a strong bond with  Israel. But the United States cannot give money it does not have, no  matter how strong our relationship is.   The United States is approaching $30 trillion in debt. Our out-of- control spending added $3 trillion to this debt just in this fiscal  year.   A day of reckoning is coming, sooner than you think. Interest on the  debt will be larger than what we spent on national defense in just a  few years. If the debt weakens us to the point where we have difficulty  funding our own military needs, how can the United States continue to  be a reliable ally to Israel?   Getting our fiscal house in order does not mean that we are failing  to support Israel--far from it. The billion dollars under consideration  today is on top of the more than $1.6 billion the United States has  already given for Iron Dome, and that is not all.   The United States provides Israel with just under $4 billion in aid  annually. To date, the United States has provided over $146 billion in  aid to Israel. In addition to Iron Dome, the United States has helped  Israel fund other missile defense systems as well. We spent $2 billion  on David's Sling and $3.7 billion on Arrow programs. That means the  United States has contributed $7 billion to Israel's missile defense  systems.   Iron Dome is an indispensable defensive tool that not only saves  Israeli lives but Palestinian lives. I want an Israel strong enough so  that it does not have to rely on American support. But if we are here  to add an additional billion dollars in aid, all I ask is that we make  sure that it is paid for.   My amendment would rescind $6 billion in Afghanistan reconstruction  money that otherwise might go to the Taliban. Secretary Blinken said as  recently as 2 weeks ago that this money may well go to the new Taliban  government.   Under this arrangement, we would devote $1 billion to Israel's Iron  Dome and return the rest to Treasury. This is clear to all of the  Republicans. So it needs to be very clear today that Republicans  support paying for Iron Dome, and they support paying for Iron Dome  with taking away money that would go to the Taliban.   I hope my colleagues will work with me to strengthen Israel,  strengthen the United States, and strengthen our alliance.                  Unanimous Consent Request--Paul Amendment    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator modify his  request so that instead of his proposal, the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 140, H.R. 5323; further, that  the only amendment in order be my substitute amendment, which is at the  desk. I further ask that there be 2 hours of debate, equally divided  between the two leaders or their designees, and upon the use or  yielding back of the time, the Paul substitute amendment at the desk be  considered and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered read a  third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended,  with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, I think it  is very clear, and very important that it be very clear, that I have  offered to fully pay for the Iron Dome system with an extra billion  dollars. The objection is coming from the Democrat side. They are  objecting to it being paid for.   We have offered this fund of $6 billion. We have offered to modify it  and make it less so there will still be some remaining money in this  system. We have offered other funds. We have offered a basically open  invitation to the other side that we just think it ought to be paid  for. So the objection from the other side is to paying for Iron Dome,  to paying for the billion dollars.   Interestingly, aid is already going to Afghanistan while the Taliban  is in charge. Now, allegedly, that aid is going to charitable  organizations. But the history of the Taliban has been to withhold,  control, manipulate, and corrupt charitable organizations as well.   I think it is a mistake to have money already flowing into the new  government under the Taliban and to charitable organizations because it  basically makes their job easier. It will make the public more pacified  if they are being fed by the Western world. They wouldn't be as happy  if the money is destroyed in this chaos. So, really, in some ways, you  do help to stabilize the Taliban by sending more money there.   But Secretary Blinken was asked this very question in committee by  myself: Can you guarantee the $6 billion will not be released at any  time to the Taliban?   And he said no; the implication being that if the Taliban behaves, he  sees this $6 billion going to the Taliban. I think it is a big mistake.   This is a big issue. Iron Dome is a big issue, but it is also a big  issue whether we send money to the Taliban. They already have $80  billion worth of our weapons. I think it will be a real big mistake to  send money indirectly or directly to the Taliban so I object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  interns in my office be given floor privileges until December 17, 2021:  Paris Nguyen and Seth Ricketts.
