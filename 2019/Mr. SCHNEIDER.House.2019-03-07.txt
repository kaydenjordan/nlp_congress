 Madam Speaker, forcing Americans to pay Federal tax  money they have already paid to State and local governments is double  taxation, and it is wrong. But that is just what the tax law passed by  my Republican colleagues in 2017 did.   The law places a severe $10,000 restriction on the State and local  tax deduction. According to the United States Department of the  Treasury, more than 11 million households will exceed this new cap. In  my district, around 42 percent of filers use the SALT deduction, and I  have heard from many constituents stuck this year with a higher tax  bill.   Madam Speaker, Illinois already pays approximately $1.36 for every  dollar we receive in Federal spending. It is not right that our  communities now must bear the burden for the President's irresponsible  tax law.   Lifting these punishing caps is a top priority for my constituents,  and I am pleased that there is growing bipartisan support for the  effort. This week, I cosponsored legislation introduced by Chairwoman  Nita Lowey, a Democrat, and Peter King, a Republican, to restore the  full SALT deduction.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort and  help bring needed tax relief to the communities we all represent.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I want to thank my colleague for  yielding.   Madam Chair, the American people elected a new Congress to clean up  corruption and make Washington work for them.   To that end, this week we will pass H.R. 1 to elevate the people's  voice in our politics, restrict the influence of dark money in our  campaigns, expand voting rights protections, and limit corporate  influence.   At the foundation of this effort is a commitment to increasing  transparency, so the American people know who is behind the money  funding the political ads they see and how much these individuals are  spending.   Currently, too many political action committees, including so-called  super-PACs, have an easy way around the important disclosure  requirements. By officially organizing a PAC or super-PAC just before  an election, these committees can spend on ads to influence an  election, without disclosing anything until after the voting has  already occurred.    In another scheme, PACs borrow money to pay for advertising and  operations and incur debts that are not paid off by donors until long  after the election.   Both of these practices are extremely troubling and obfuscate who is  donating to PACs. Voters are left in the dark until it is too late.   This amendment is a simple first step to address these abuses by  requiring the Federal Election Commission to report recommendations to  Congress for how we can crack down on these practices by PACs.   I call on my colleagues to join us to increase transparency and  support this amendment.
