 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of America's teachers.   In classrooms across the country, teachers are doing an excellent job  in educating our children and preparing them for their future success.  Teachers are much more than educators. They are leaders, and they are  role models.   Mr. Speaker, this week is Teacher Appreciation Week, and I ask that  my colleagues join me in honoring our teachers not just today, but  every day.   On a personal note, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring  three teachers in my life:   My father, the late Congressman Donald Payne, Sr., was a high school  teacher who used his time in Congress to fight for K-12 education at  home and abroad;   My sister, Wanda Payne, just retired last year from teaching  kindergarten and pre-K and special needs children for 31 years; and   My sister, Nicole Payne, who is director of alternative education for  the Paterson School District in New Jersey.   My father and sisters, like teachers across this country, help young  people grow into strong, capable adults. For that, let's honor them.                            ____________________
