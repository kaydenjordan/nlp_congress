 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  yielding.   I thank my colleague from Florida for bringing forward this important  bill, the Protect and Serve Act, and especially, Mr. Speaker, as we  celebrate law enforcement week nationally, a time to really thank those  men and women who serve and put their uniform on every day to protect  us, protect our communities, and keep our country and communities safe.   I know all too well just that value and importance of having law  enforcement and why they serve such an important role. Nearly a year  ago, when we had the shooting in Virginia where a gunman targeted  Members of Congress, it was those very law enforcement officers--in  this case, our United States Capitol Police--who were the heroes who  went toward the danger and confronted and took down the shooter, along  with Virginia police who joined in as well.   While they were risking their lives for us, they took on gunfire.  They were shot themselves. In this case, it was United States Capitol  Police David Bailey and Crystal Griner, who were just recently awarded  incredible honors from the President and national law enforcement  organizations for their heroic bravery. They went towards the fire, but  they were shot and continued to take down and confront the shooter.   Why this bill is so important is because it hardens penalties against  any criminal who would target law enforcement officers. They deserve  this protection. We have seen too often, in the last 2 years, where  police officers were targeted by people because they wore the badge and  because they are part of the thin blue line.   We need to stand with them. We need to make it crystal clear that we  are going to be standing with them and we are going to have their back.  More often than not, they are the ones who have our back. That is why  this bill is so important, Mr. Speaker.   I rise in strong support and urge all of my colleagues to support  this important legislation.
