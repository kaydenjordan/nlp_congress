 Madam Speaker, when a natural disaster  strikes across the country, be it a hurricane, a wildfire, or an  earthquake, American families are displaced. It is very important that  we do our best to streamline whatever assistance has been deemed  appropriate in the wake of that disaster.   So when we see a bill that streamlines the disaster recovery process  for FEMA, that provides for a universal application for Federal  disaster assistance for individuals residing in the areas hit by a  natural disaster so that universal application can be used by multiple  agencies, it is all beneficial. When you see a bill that streamlines  the ability to provide direct assistance to individuals and households,  thereby eliminating some bureaucratic obstacles, and a bill that  provides more flexibility to States, I strongly encourage the support  of language like that in a legislative endeavor.   Whereas we may not agree with 100 percent of the language that is in  a bill, it is our duty to measure the overall benefit for the citizens  that we serve, and I rise in support.
