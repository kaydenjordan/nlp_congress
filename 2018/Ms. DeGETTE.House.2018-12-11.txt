 Mr. Speaker, I know that the ranking member already  yielded back, so I thank Mr. Burgess for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I wanted to hurry down here to speak in favor of this  bill because I have been working on it for many years with my colleague  and friend, Jaime Herrera Beutler.   According to the CDC, maternal mortality rates rose by 26 percent in  the U.S. between 2000 and 2014. These deaths are preventable, and they  should not be happening in 2018. So to combat this alarming trend, 33  States have established maternal mortality review committees made up of  healthcare professionals who review individual maternal deaths and then  recommend policy decisions.   Our bill provides Federal support for these committees and supports  efforts to standardize them. It has 190 cosponsors. It has received  support from 90 national public health organizations.   It is really a great example of how the Energy and Commerce Committee  works in a bipartisan way. So I thank everybody for being here and  thank the chairman for his comity.                                time  1415
