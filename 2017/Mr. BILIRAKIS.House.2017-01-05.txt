 Mr. Speaker, as the 115th Congress kicks off this  week, I remain committed to supporting our Nation's veterans. We made  some good progress last year, but there is still much more work to be  done.   While our military spends over 6 months preparing soldiers for  assignment, we only spend 5 days preparing them to reintegrate to  civilian life. I will be making it a priority to ensure veterans have a  robust transition and support system for returning home.   We also must bring greater accountability and transparency to the VA.  If a VA employee fails to do their duty to care for our Nation's  heroes, they should be swiftly terminated. We need to turn around the  culture of mediocrity at the agency. I look forward to working with  Chairman Roe and my colleagues on the House Committee on Veterans'  Affairs this year to stand up for our men and women in uniform.                            ____________________
