 Mr. Speaker, let's face it: Coronavirus has totally  disrupted our lives across the country, in every community and  certainly around the globe. To all of us, it is frightening. It is a  nightmare.   This bill is a partial response to end that disruption. It provides  our medical workers, our hospitals, our small businesses, and virtually  every family needed assistance.   To you who oppose this bill, please, please stand down. We can't wait  another day to help. Don't add to this disruption by, in fact, being a  disrupter. Be a leader.
