 Mr. Speaker, the most solemn decision a country can make  is to send its sons and daughters to war. The most solemn  responsibility Congress has is to make that decision. Yet, Congress has  delegated that authority too often and too long to the executive.   It resulted from an AUMF vote, Authorization for Use of Military  Force, for a lie-based war in Iraq, resulting in the loss of life of  over 4,500 of our fellow citizens, 200,000 Iraqis killed, and  destruction and instability in the Middle East.   That authorization will be repealed by a vote of Congress, and I will  vote to repeal that authorization and restore to the Congress its  responsibility to make that solemn decision about whether and when we  send our sons and daughters to defend us abroad.                            ____________________
