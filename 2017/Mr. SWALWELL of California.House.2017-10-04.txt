 Mr. Speaker, America has again been  rocked by a mass shooting, and our hearts ache and our hands pray for  the victims and those who are recovering. You can't help but watch the  countless scores of video accounts and not feel an urge to act.   My constituents ask: Are we helpless to stop the next mass shooting?   We are only helpless once the trigger is squeezed and you are in the  pathway of a bullet, but we are not helpless in this House. In fact, if  we come together, we are more powerful than any weapon.   Aren't the dead owed a dialogue, a conversation about whether we  should have background checks, a talk about whether people who have  weapons of war should only be warriors, and what about talking about  restrictions on ammunition purchases?   I refuse to accept the tradeoff that we must allow and accept that a  mass shooting is going to happen in this country for an unfettered  access to firearms.   If the police officers who went into that building so blindly and  were so brave could do that and show that courage, we can come into  this building and have the courage to have a dialogue for those  victims.                            ____________________
