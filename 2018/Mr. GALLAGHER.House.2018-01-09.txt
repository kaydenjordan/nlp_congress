 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4569) to require counterterrorism information sharing  coordination, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4569         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Counterterrorism Information       Sharing Improvement Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. COUNTERTERRORISM INFORMATION SHARING COORDINATION.         (a) In General.--The President, acting though the Secretary       of Homeland Security, shall ensure that, for counterterrorism       purposes, the Department of the Homeland Security has access       to biographic and biometric data collected by the United       States Government on individuals associated with a terrorist       organization.        (b) Coordination.--The President shall direct the heads of       relevant Federal departments and agencies to coordinate with       the Secretary of Homeland Security to minimize and overcome       any administrative, technical, capacity, or classification       challenges to carrying out subsection (a).        (c) Protections.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall       ensure that all relevant laws, rules, and procedures,       including the section 552(a) of title 5, United States Code       (commonly referred to as the ``Privacy Act'' or the ``Privacy       Act of 1974''), regarding classification levels and civil       rights and civil liberties are followed while seeking to       carry out subsection (a).        (d) Report to Congress.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security       shall, consistent with the protection of classified       information, submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of       the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report on       the implementation of this section.        (2) Contents.--The report required under paragraph (1)       shall include a description of how the data referred to in       subsection (a) is utilized for Department of Homeland       Security screening and vetting purposes and any challenges       associated with incorporating such data into departmental       screening and vetting systems.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As we destroy the caliphate in the Middle East, foreign fighters and  terrorist sympathizers have fled the battlefield and are looking for  new ways to spread their hatred, recruit new followers, instill fear,  kill innocent people, and disrupt our way of life.   The December 11 bombing at the New York City Port Authority Bus  Terminal was the second terror attack in New York in less than 2 months  and a grave reminder of the reality of this threat.   Given this current environment, at the direction of Chairman McCaul,  I led a task force to identify specific national security challenges  and examine how terrorists might infiltrate our homeland and bring harm  to our people. Subsequently, we produced a report with a series of  solutions to fix any identified weaknesses that may be exploited by our  enemies.   This report resulted in several pieces of legislation that have come  before the House today. To that end, my bill, the Counterterrorism  Information Sharing Improvement Act, seeks to enhance the current  information-sharing environment that exists within the Federal and  military communities. Throughout the task force, we heard time and time  again about the incredible amount of biometric and biographic data  being pulled off battlefields in Syria and Iraq, as U.S. forces and our  allies continue to roll back the territories once held by ISIS.   It is often DOD personnel that encounter ISIS fighters on the  battlefield, which often leads to the collection of valuable data.  However, if these fighters and their associates move back to the West  or try to enter the U.S., the DHS becomes the primary entity that will  engage them. Therefore, it is critical that the data recovered by the  DOD in the battlefield is able to reach the DHS and its systems for  effective frontline screening and vetting of known or suspected  terrorists.   In order to verify we are utilizing this information to support our  counterterrorism efforts, we must ensure that the Department of  Homeland Security gets access to that data in a timely manner,  particularly so that it can be used for screening and vetting purposes.  My bill directs the President, acting through the Secretary of Homeland  Security, to ensure that the DHS has access to biographic and biometric  data collected by the U.S. Government on individuals associated with a  terrorist organization. The bill also directs the Secretary to report  to Congress on these efforts.   The U.S. must prioritize any opportunity to identify bad actors  outside the country and expand our ability to identify and deter  threats before they reach the homeland. Unfortunately, information- sharing challenges among U.S. agencies can prevent valuable information  from becoming available for frontline screening and vetting. Not only  is this a bureaucratic challenge, given the number of separate  government agencies and components involved, but legal capacity and  technical issues exist as well.   This bill will address these challenges and create improved  collaborations between the Department of Homeland Security and its  other Federal and military partners.   Mr. Speaker, I therefore urge my colleagues to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank my  colleagues for their hard work in generating the task force report and  all of the ideas that led to the variety of bills we are doing here  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
