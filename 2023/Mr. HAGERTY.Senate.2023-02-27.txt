 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my  dear friend, Fredrick D. Schaufeld, for receiving the 2023 Horatio  Alger Award. Fred has spent decades giving back to his community by  creating job opportunities and a path to prosperity for so many, while  at the same time contributing significantly to philanthropic efforts.  No one is more deserving of this honor than Fred Schaufeld.   The Horatio Alger Award symbolizes the values of personal initiative  and perseverance, leadership, and commitment to excellence, belief in  the free-  [[Page S505]]  enterprise system and the importance of higher education, community  service, and the vision and determination to achieve a better future.  These are the ideals that serve as Fred's North Star.   Throughout his career, Fred has exemplified the best of American  exceptionalism. In addition to his time in the private sector, Fred has  spent decades giving back to his community, whether through his time as  the chairman of the Inova Health System Foundation or through his  participation on the board of the Wolf Trap Foundation for the  Performing Arts. Additionally, and one of my personal favorites, Fred  is a recipient of the Loudoun Laurels award and the Loudon County Boy  Scouts' Good Scout award.   I would also like to congratulate his wife Karen for her  contributions to these causes over the decades. I know firsthand how  important a supportive partner like Karen can be, and I am so pleased  that you both are recognized in such an appropriate manner for your  efforts.   Congratulations.                            ____________________
