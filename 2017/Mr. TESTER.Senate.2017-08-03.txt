 Thank you, Mr. President.   I want to thank Chairman Isakson for his work on the VA Committee. We  have gotten a lot of work done the first part of this Congress because  we communicated. We haven't put up artificial barriers. We sat down and  all realized taking care of our veterans is the cost of war. We need to  do it and live up to the promises of these folks when they signed up.  We have done pretty good work.   It is not only Johnny. It is not only myself. It is also the people  who have served on that committee, many in the Chamber right now. I  want to thank them for their commitment to making sure we live up to  the promises we made our veterans, but it is about working together. It  is about talking to folks. It is about compromise. It is about not  digging in but moving together. This is a great country, and it was  built by people working together.   The VA Committee is a prime example of people working together. We  set aside our differences. We listened to the veterans service  organizations. We let them drive the bus, to an extent. We worked with  Secretary Shulkin and other leaders within the VA. We have been  transparent. We have been honest when we disagreed. We haven't  embarrassed one another. Quite frankly, this is the way it can work in  this body when we start from a point of agreement rather than  disagreement.   We have two bills already signed into law: an accountability bill,  which holds VA employees accountable to the veterans, fires bad  employees, protects whistleblowers; and the Veterans Choice Improvement  Act, which makes VA the prime payer and reduces out-of-pocket expenses  for veterans. Then, the bills passed last night to take care of the  disability appeals, some 470,000--we are going to expedite that process  and bring it down from 3 years to 1 year.  [[Page S4792]]  The VA will do that. We will give them the tools to do that. It will  simplify it and cut the redtape.   Veterans Choice funding is a fix to allow the private sector to fill  in the gaps where the VA can't provide healthcare. It will help recruit  and retain more doctors and nurses, critically important, and it  expands the capacity in the VA, which is critically important.   Then there is the ``Forever'' GI bill which eliminates the 15-year  limit. It breaks down educational barriers and helps veterans  transition into civilian life.   We have done some good work. We have done some good work for this  body. We have done some good work, more importantly, for the veterans,  and we need to continue on that line as we continue to address  healthcare and we continue to address important issues like tax reform.  It is about working together. It is about finding common ground. It is  about taking everybody's opinion into context and then drafting up  bills.   Chairman Isakson and I have done that, and we are going to continue  to do that. We have some more tough issues to deal with over the next  year and a half, but we are going to work together to make sure we do  it and we do it right. With help from the committee and help from the  Senate, we could have more successes.   I thank the chairman of the committee and thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor the Vietnam  Veterans of America and the work Mr. John Burgess and the local  Flathead Valley chapter has done on behalf of his fellow veterans of  the Vietnam war.   During that war, more than 2.5 million Americans fought bravely in  service to their country. While more than 58,000 of those men and women  gave the ultimate sacrifice, many more endured and are still here with  us today. However, it has not been an easy road for these veterans. For  far too long, veterans of the Vietnam war have received neither the  recognition nor the benefits that they truly deserved.   As ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, it has  been my honor to fight for legislation that rectifies this oversight  like the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act that would allow veterans  who served in the waters offshore during the Vietnam war to also be  eligible for service-connected disability benefits as a result of agent  orange exposure. I have also proudly sponsored the Toxic Exposure  Research Act which increases research into the health conditions of  descendants of veterans who were exposed to toxins during their  military service, particularly those exposed to the herbicide agent  orange during the Vietnam war.   Honoring these veterans takes more than just legislation; it takes  dedicated  [[Page S4826]]  people who are committed to telling their stories and honoring those  who have served. The local northwest Montana chapter of the Vietnam  Veterans of America in the Flathead Valley, which now has more than 100  members, has been an important partner working to ensure veterans who  fought in the Vietnam war are receiving the care, honor, and  distinction they have earned.   The Vietnam Veterans of America has become an invaluable part of the  community, hosting bingo events at the Montana veterans home, providing  residents and staff with an annual picnic, helping with many  ceremonies, and working with the Flathead Valley Community College  Veterans with a scholarship for veteran students.   John Burgess and the northwest Montana chapter of the Vietnam  Veterans of America are carrying on this legacy of service September 7  to 10 with the arrival of the traveling Vietnam veterans memorial wall  in Kalispell. Through ``Bringing the Wall that Heals,'' countless  Vietnam veterans and their families with be presented with an  opportunity to find peace and closure while honoring those we have lost  in service. This special event helps mark the 35th anniversary of the  Vietnam Veterans Memorial.   On Veterans Day of 1996, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund unveiled  a half-scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington,  DC, designed to travel to communities throughout the United States.  Since its dedication, the ``Wall That Heals'' has visited more than 400  cities and towns throughout the Nation, spreading the memorial's  healing legacy to millions.   To John, the northwest Montana chapter of the Vietnam Veterans of  America and all those who dedicated their lives to this country in  service, on behalf of myself, Montana, and our Nation, I extend my  greatest thanks for your enduring bravery, service, and self- sacrifice.                            ____________________
