 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 228 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:  [[Page H2375]]                                     H. Res. 228         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1628) to       provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of the       concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2017. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The amendments specified in section 2 of this resolution       shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and       on any further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) four hours of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Budget or their respective       designees; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.        Sec. 2.  The amendments referred to in the first section of       this resolution are as follows:         (a) The amendment printed in part A of the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution modified by       the amendment printed in part B of that report.        (b) The amendment printed in part C of the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution modified by       the amendments printed in part D and part E of that report.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the  underlying legislation.   This rule is a fair rule that adequately provides both sides of the  aisle with ample time to debate the merits of the underlying  legislation. In fact, the Rules Committee thought it was so important  that ample time be provided to this debate, that we are provided 4  hours of general debate on the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, in honor of our former President, Ronald Reagan, I wear  brown today. The former President, when he was President, believed that  wearing brown was good luck to him and good luck for the things which  he was undertaking. So, in honor of Ronald Reagan, I, too, wear my  brown jacket today.   Mr. Speaker, it has become abundantly clear that ObamaCare has failed  the American people. Our Nation's healthcare system today is broken and  only getting worse under the current law, known as the Affordable Care  Act, or ObamaCare.   Simply put, ObamaCare is collapsing, and it is collapsing fast.  Options and choices are disappearing for consumers, and an  anticompetitive marketplace has been created that firmly harms  patients.   How bad is it? Nearly one-third of all U.S. counties currently have  only one insurer offering plans on their State's exchanges. That is a  government-created monopoly, Mr. Speaker, and that kills the free  market, meaning no choices for the American people and higher costs are  what the American consumer and the healthcare market are finding.   And it is only continuing to get worse. As more and more insurers  leave the marketplace, prices will continue to rise, forcing healthy  individuals to make economic decisions not to purchase health care,  creating a self-defeating spiral of rising costs and less options. That  is why we must act, and act today, which is what we are doing.   It is no wonder that in such a government-controlled system that  premiums have increased by an average of 25 percent on the ObamaCare  exchanges this year alone. And it is no wonder that some 19.2 million  taxpayers chose to outright pay the individual mandate penalty or  claimed an exemption. What this means is that ObamaCare is not a good  option to these 19.2 million people.   Mr. Speaker, the American people, I believe, sent us to Washington,  D.C., to fix this issue. They are telling us directly: this must be  fixed now. And people certainly outside of Washington resent the  Federal Government telling them how to purchase health care and what  that healthcare marketplace would look like. But we really do not have  to tolerate this. We do not have to agree that we will accept the  status quo.   Mr. Speaker, I believe the American people are smart. I believe the  American people want independence, they love freedom, and they want to  know that they can make their own choices, because they believe they  make better choices than a one-size-fits-all plan out of Washington,  D.C.   What brings us here today, however, most assuredly, is a broken  system. So, Republicans offer today H.R. 1628, the American Health Care  Act of 2017, which will eliminate Washington's one-size-fits-all  healthcare policy for the American people. It dismantles the disastrous  ObamaCare taxes that are strangling the working middle class and  diminishing America's economic prowess. We will end this with the  opportunity to vote today to change the status quo.   It eliminates the onerous employer and individual mandates. It  prohibits health insurers from denying coverage and helps young adults  access health care by getting back into the marketplace while  stabilizing and restoring the free market opportunities for all  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are counting on Washington getting  it right this time. What does getting it right mean? Getting it right  means giving them the opportunity to exit a bad system and to have a  better chance at a new system.   This rule provides House Republicans with the opportunity to restore  exactly that--a better healthcare plan to provide the middle class and  low-income families who have been left behind on either side of the  aisle, and it gives them an opportunity to have tax advantages in the  employer marketplace.   Mr. Speaker, today, we will be dissecting this into three separate  areas. We will have Members of the Republican majority here to explain  that and the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from  Lewisville, Texas (Mr. Burgess), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee, a gentleman who sits on both the Energy and Commerce and the  Rules Committee. He is quite literally the most knowledgeable person on  health care in the United States Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Florida very much. In fact, the  gentleman is correct. We had an opportunity to quote the Bible, Janis  Joplin, and ZZ Top when we were doing our hearings. We had so much time  with each other, and I enjoyed the hours and hours that we had to  debate these essential items.   But the other side of the story is essential health benefits are not  being done away with. They are being transferred entirely to States.  States have asked for the ability to manage their own money, and manage  their own people's benefits of what would be required in the States. So  in no way should a person take away, well, we just did away with it. In  fact, we transferred the authority and the responsibility of essential  health benefits to the States because Governors have been asking for  this.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take just a moment to explain what I believe  is at the heart of the legislation and really, in reality, the key to  fixing health care. It is the second part of this.   We heard the gentleman from Lewisville, Texas, Dr. Burgess, speak  about the Energy and Commerce portions. I now would like to take a  minute to talk about the portions that come directly out of the Ways  and Means Committee.   The gentleman, Mr. Brady, from The Woodlands, Texas, today, spoke  about many of these; but at the heart of it, 170 million Americans  currently receive their health care through an employee-employer tax  advantage or tax benefits, an untaxed benefit whereby people who have  an employer who can provide their health care, it is not taxed-- pretaxed to the employee, allowing them to have a good healthcare  system. Well, all the while, millions of Americans pay higher premiums  out of their pockets in the individual market. Those are people that do  not have an employer who is able to help them. So that is not fair.  That does not help these people.    What we are doing here is putting together an addition of, really, a  great Republican idea; and it takes the important step to provide the  same tax-free benefits for those employer-sponsored plans that we will  give to regular employees, and it is called a tax credit. This tax  credit is going to work because it allows every single American that  does not receive the tax benefit at work to get it for themselves.   Who is this? Well, quite honestly, it is small-business owners; it is  low-income workers; it is entrepreneurs. It includes, really, a lot of  real estate agents and people that work for a small business, maybe  heating and air-conditioning systems like we have all across this  country. It will give their families an opportunity.   How much money? Well, we will provide them between $2,000 and $14,000  a year for their families to be able to have these opportunities to  purchase a nongovernment healthcare plan, meaning that, as they would  go to the marketplace, we are going to help these people through a tax  credit available January 1, providing them with an opportunity to  purchase health care on a benefit basis.   Why is this important? It saves money because what it does, it  creates two things: a family then has an insurance plan, including a  healthcare component that goes to the hospitalization; and secondly, it  gives them an opportunity to have their own doctor or healthcare plan  that they choose. This is important because many of these people end up  in the hospital in the most expensive kind of way we can provide health  care: at the emergency room.   So this gives these families parity in the marketplace. We believe  that that is important and is another part of this Republican  healthcare plan.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Woodall), who will be describing the third piece of this,  and that is the putting together of the piece from the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the vice chairman of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2386]]         Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, we are going to keep moving on. We were  allocated the same amount of time. I guess the answer would be no.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), who is the favorite daughter of Wyoming and  serves on the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Pasco, Washington (Mr. Newhouse), who is a member of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking our colleagues, the  gentleman from Massachusetts leading the Rules Committee, and his  ranking members as they came from each of the committees, some 50  hours' worth of hearings and markups, including some 16 hours in the  Rules Committee to not only talk about and vet, but to understand more  clearly what we would be voting on.   Mr. Speaker, today is a bill that is a compromise bill, no doubt  about it. I had my own plan and I had my own ideas. I took 2 years to  get involved in this process. It is difficult to write a healthcare  bill. But it didn't have to be my bill; it had to be a bill that we  could all work together on.   President Trump has been a part of that. President Trump took time  out of his schedule to do this. It is important to the American people.  President Trump, more than any single Member of Congress, gave the  message to the American people about what was necessary and what he  would do. He is going to live up to that, and we should, too.   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line to this whole thing is we are going to  present a Republican plan, and we are going to stand behind what we  sell. It is better for the American people. But make no mistake about  it: we are transferring power, authority, and responsibility not just  to States, but also to the American people. It will be up to them to  make determinations about their own health care because, for the first  time, we will allow some 50 million Americans to have a tax equity, an  opportunity to use tax credits that will be available to families  anywhere from $2,000 for an individual to $14,000 for a family.                                time  1030    This will empower people who have not found a fair shot at the tax  advantages it will give them: small-business owners; the American  people; the average worker in this country, including those who work  two or three different jobs; as well as those who are uninsured. We  believe it is a better shot, an opportunity. We are willing to put our  name on it and behind it.   For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge us to move forward. There will  be 4 hours of debate that remain in this opportunity. For that reason,  I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
