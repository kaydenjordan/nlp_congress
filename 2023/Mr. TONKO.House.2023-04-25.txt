 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 30th  anniversary of the U.S. Green Building Council, which was founded in  April of 1993.   This member-led, nonprofit organization has helped countless schools,  businesses, cities, and even countries build and operate better  buildings that truly transform lives.   Their LEED certification program has grown to become the world's most  acclaimed and widely used green building system with 105,000 projects  in 187 countries.   In my home State of New York, over 2,600 projects and over 15,000  homes have achieved LEED certification.   At a time when homeowners and businesses are dealing with rising  costs, research has repeatedly found that energy-efficient, lower-waste  buildings result in major savings. Plus, they boost staff recruitment,  retention, and productivity.   Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago there was no agreement on what constituted  green buildings, let alone any kind of accepted mechanism to certify  them.   Because of the efforts of the U.S. Green Building Council, our  country is moving toward better performing buildings that lower costs  and waste, mitigate climate impacts and improve health.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the council's staff for all their great efforts  and offer my congratulations to this incredible organization. Here is  to another impactful 30 years.                            ____________________
