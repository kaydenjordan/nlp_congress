 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the alarming rise in  prescription drug costs. America is the richest, most developed nation  in the world, yet one in four Americans has a hard time affording  lifesaving prescriptions. Families are making impossible choices  between paying the mortgage, putting food on their tables, or buying  lifesaving medications.   We turned a blind eye to the prescription drug ecosystem, and now the  system has become unsustainable. Americans are getting ripped off while  other countries pay far less for the same drugs.   In 2017, the U.S. spent $333 billion on prescription medication, up  from $236 billion in 2007, an increase of more than 40 percent over 10  years. That is unacceptable.   I have listened to my constituents who struggle to afford the  prescriptions they need, and they want us to act. This isn't a partisan  issue. It is a people issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support legislation like H.R. 3  so that the American people no longer are left with false choices.                            ____________________
