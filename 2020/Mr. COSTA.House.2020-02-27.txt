 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an exceptional veteran  in my hometown of Fresno, California, Albert Henderson.   In this photo, Albert Henderson and I are here at the veterans home  in Fresno, a wonderful facility that provides a continuum of care for  those men and women who served our Nation over the years.   Albert has an incredible story. He is one of the last living  survivors of the USS Bismarck Sea, which sank 75 years ago this month  during a World War II battle on the island of Iwo Jima. We all know of  that historic battle that took place on Iwo Jima.   His is a story of survival, and it is a remarkable one.   He joined the Navy as a cook at the age of 17. After learning of the  attack on Pearl Harbor, like many Americans who decided to selflessly  do everything they could to protect our country, he began his military  journey on the USS Bismarck Sea as a chef second class, where he often  speaks of the difficulties of preparing food for such a large group of  folks.   As the ship made its way to the Philippines in 1944, its fate was  sealed when it was struck by two Japanese kamikaze pilots.   In the kitchen at the time of the attack, Albert made it topside only  to discover that all the life rafts and preservers were taken by other  members of the crew.   He spent more than 4 hours struggling to stay afloat in the choppy  waters of the Pacific Ocean, praying for God's help to survive after  being rescued by a passing U.S. Navy motorboat.   For his services and injuries, Albert was awarded the Purple Heart  and the Good Conduct Medal.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues today to join me in recognizing an  American hero for this remarkable moment in history for a remarkable  man over 75 years ago.   Albert, we thank you for your sacrifice and your courage to our  Nation. God bless.                        Facing Coronavirus Challenges     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the challenges  facing our country and the world with the recent outbreak of the  coronavirus.   This disease presents a serious threat that I think requires a  proactive approach in a bipartisan fashion.   Unfortunately, the mechanisms put in place by the previous  administration, the Obama administration, to deal with pandemics like  this have been dismantled over the last year. They were put in place to  deal with the Ebola crisis and the SARS crisis years ago and to ensure  that in the future, if possible pandemics occurred, we would be  prepared.   In 2018, the President fired the entire pandemic response team. In  the President's 2021 budget request, he proposed cutting over $700  million to the Centers for Disease Control. Hopefully, this proposal  will be dead on arrival. In the face of this crisis, this is simply  unacceptable.   We need to be on guard. The social and economic impacts of this  pandemic could be devastating globally, but the public health crisis  affects all Americans.   We have just had the first case, in the last 24 hours, in northern  California that, it is believed, the cause, the origin, is from here in  our country, not coming from China.   We require a robust response. The Congress and the President need to  work together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure the well-being, public  health, and safety of the American people.   Hopefully, the President of the United States' press conference  yesterday reflects the administration's intent to work together. We  need to.   I am committed to joining my colleagues to ensure that we have an  effective strategy in place to protect all Americans' health and safety  from this potentially deadly pandemic virus, otherwise known as  coronavirus.   We need to be on guard. We need to do everything we can to protect  the American people.                            ____________________
