 Mr. Speaker, I want to use my time to quote other  conservative voices.   The Heritage Foundation just issued a report:   This package equips the American people's Representatives with  targeted, commonsense tools to constrain Big Tech companies' abuse of  power. These bills represent an important step towards restoring self- governance, shoring up our national security, and enforcing current  antitrust laws to promote competitiveness without expanding or unduly  empowering the Federal bureaucracy.   Senators Lee, Grassley, and Cotton issued a statement on September  26: `` . . . these bills improve antitrust enforcement without  appropriating any more funds to President Biden's out-of-control FTC.  We call on all of our colleagues in the House of Representatives to  strongly support this package.''   The American Mind on September 28 issued a story, ``While GOP views  on antitrust have evolved, one thing has remained constant: `antitrust  enforcement is law enforcement.' You can't provide `legal amnesty' to  Big Tech companies that flout antitrust laws. Defunding the antitrust  police will have the same result as defunding the municipal police:  enabling bad actors to harm the public.''   Finally, The American Conservative on September 29, I guess today,  issued this story, ``While Buck is pushing restrained, politically  viable legislation that would strengthen the average American's  position in the cultural battle against Silicon Valley, some of his  colleagues seem to be sticking to an overcooked theory derived from a  notion of corporate personhood.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following articles:   ``Heritage Tech Policy Experts Applaud House Antitrust Package'';   ``Republican Senators Urge House Republicans to Support Antitrust  Reform Package'';   The American Conservative: ``Tech Hawks Meet Resistance to a `Modest  Proposal''';   The American Mind: ``Don't Defund the (Antitrust) Police''.               [From the Heritage Foundation, Sept. 29, 2022]        Heritage Tech Policy Experts Applaud House Antitrust Package         Washington.--This week, the House of Representatives is       expected to vote on a package of three antitrust bills that       would begin the important work of reining in Big Tech: the       State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act, Merger Filing Fee       Modernization Act, and Foreign Merger Subsidy Disclosure Act.       Experts from Heritage's Tech Policy Center--Kara Frederick,       director of the center; Will Thibeau, policy analyst; and       Jake Denton, research associate--released the following       statement ahead of the scheduled vote:        Heritage Tech Policy Experts Applaud House Antitrust       Package I The Heritage Foundation        ``Big Tech companies should not have outsized authority to       shape and control society. However, we have all watched these       companies take an increasingly troubling share of control       over our politics and culture in recent years. Conservatives       should champion targeted, commonsense policies that constrain       Big Tech companies' abuse of power. This package equips the       American people's representatives with tools to do so. These       bills represent an important step toward restoring self-      governance, shoring up our national security, and enforcing       current antitrust laws to promote competitiveness--without       expanding or unduly empowering the federal bureaucracy.        ``From providing state attorneys general with a more level       playing field in critical litigation against Big Tech to       exposing Big Tech's cozy relationship with U.S. adversaries       like the Chinese Communist Party, this package is a requisite       starting point to rebalance the relationship between American       citizens and the Big Tech companies that abuse them.''                                   ____                                                  September 26, 2022  Republican Senators Urge House Republicans to Support Antitrust Reform                                  Package         Washington, D.C.--Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), joined by Sens. Tom       Cotton (R-AR), and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), urged their       colleagues in the House to support passage of an antitrust       reform package consisting of the State Antitrust Enforcement       Venue Act, the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act, and the       Foreign Merger Subsidy Disclosure Act. The bills would       protect antitrust enforcement by state attorneys general,       modernize the Hart-Scott-Rodino merger filing fees, and       require merging parties to disclose subsidies from certain       foreign governments, respectively.        The Senators issued the following joint statement:        This package represents a strong, bipartisan consensus       approach to strengthening enforcement of the federal       antitrust laws, against both Big Tech and other bad actors.       Importantly, these bills improve antitrust enforcement       without appropriating any more funds to President Biden's       out-of-control FTC. We call on all of our colleagues in the       House of Representatives to strongly support this package.  [[Page H8259]]                                          ____                    [From theamericanconservative.com]     Tech Hawks Meet-Resistance to a ``Modest Proposal''--The American                                Conservative                             (By Harry Scherer)         Intramural fights are causing a dustup in the House       Judiciary Committee this week as Colorado Republican Ken Buck       looks to push a legislative package that seeks to empower       state attorneys general with the authority to try antitrust       cases on their home turf, rein in monopolistic tech mergers       among large companies, and check China's financial       interference in domestic mergers. The bipartisan Merger       Filing Fee Authorization Act, which has reconciled the       priorities of GOP tech hawks and the aggressive antitrust       commissioners on the FTC, is being criticized by Ohio       Republican Jim Jordan, ranking member of the Judiciary       Committee.        On Tuesday morning, Jordan tweeted: ``Do you think we       should give the Biden DOJ and FTC more money? Do you trust       they won't use the money to target conservatives? Do you       think Joe Biden, Merrick Garland, and Lina Khan have your       best interests at heart? No, No, No.''        Buck, ranking member of the Antitrust, Commercial and       Administrative Law Subcommittee, is not swayed by those       critiques. In fact, the bills that he brought to the House on       Wednesday night seem to have been drafted to encourage state       governments to curb Big Tech mergers that allow the merged       entities to more comfortably ``target conservatives.''        Mike Davis, president of the Article III Project, told       Steve Bannon on Tuesday: ``This is a modest proposal. This is       time for Republicans who pretend they want to hold Big Tech       accountable. This is time for them to put up or shut up.''        Jordan might be one of those Republicans Davis was talking       about. When the Facebook Oversight Board upheld the company's       decision to ban President Trump from Facebook and Instagram       in May of last year, Jordan tweeted, ``Break them up.''        So which one will it be? Catchy, far-reaching political       slogans or common-sense policy? Jordan's position is       difficult to follow. One of the bills in the package, Buck's       State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act, passed the Judiciary       Committee in June of last year by a vote of 34-7 with a `yea'       vote from Jordan. The second, Colorado Democrat Joe Neguse's       Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act, passed the same       committee by a vote of 29-12 with a `no' vote from Jordan.       The third, the Foreign Merger Subsidy Disclosure Act, has yet       to get a committee vote.        That second bill, though, is what distinguishes those who       really care about discouraging anticompetitive behavior.       Right now, the FTC imposes fees when corporate entities file       for a merger, the values of which are determined by the total       amount of voting securities, assets, or non-corporate       interests being acquired through the merger. Neguse's bill       actually proposes to decrease filing fees for mergers under       $1 billion valuations, but increase fees for mergers in       excess of $1 billion. The bill also directs the FTC to       increase filing fees each year according to the percentage       change in the Consumer Price Index, a metric that measures       the prices paid by U.S. consumers for goods and services.        One group of GOP senators expressed support for those in       favor of the package. Utah's Mike Lee, Arizona's Tom Cotton,       and Iowa's Chuck Grassley urged their colleagues in the House       to pass the package, saying, ``This package represents a       strong, bipartisan consensus approach to strengthening       enforcement of the federal antitrust laws, against both Big       Tech and other bad actors. Importantly, these bills improve       antitrust enforcement without appropriating any more funds to       President Biden's out-of-control FTC.''        While Buck is pushing restrained, politically viable       legislation that would strengthen the average American's       position in the cultural battle against Silicon Valley, some       of his colleagues seem to be sticking to an overcooked theory       derived from a notion of corporate personhood. History will       be on Buck's side.                                   ____                           [From americanmind.org]                    Don't Defund the (Antitrust) Police                              (By Mike Wacker)         As the House gets ready to vote on a bipartisan package of       antitrust bills that would target Big Tech, Congressman Jim       Jordan--who would set the antitrust agenda if the GOP wins       the House this November-slammed his foot on the brakes. ``Do       you think,'' he asked, ``we should give the Biden DOJ and FTC       more money?'' This package, in fact, does not give them more       money, but given Jordan's emphasis, and his fiscally       conservative bent, one has to wonder if he plans to defund       the (antitrust) police.        Jordan has been an ardent critic of Federal Trade       Commission Chair Lina Khan, describing her as a woke, far-      left radical. These criticisms are fair and are shared by       other Republicans. During a Senate oversight hearing, Senator       Grassley-who previously voted to confirm Khan-decried the       agency's ``low morale, management and partisanship problems''       and its ``push for radical antitrust policies.''        Tweeting about how Lina Khan is evil, however, is not the       same as setting a robust antitrust agenda. And while       Republican senators Lee, Cotton, and Grassley have been       critical of Khan, they have also thrown their support behind       the antitrust package; if it passes the House, it can easily       pass the Senate and become law.        While GOP views on antitrust have evolved, one thing has       remained constant: ``antitrust enforcement is law       enforcement.'' You can't provide ``legal amnesty'' to Big       Tech companies that flout antitrust laws. Defunding the       antitrust police will have the same result as defunding the       municipal police: enabling bad actors to harm the public.        Nonetheless, given the increased politicization of the FTC-      and the broader politicization of federal law enforcement--       you shouldn't give antitrust enforcers a blank check. While       an earlier version of this package did assign $418 million to       the FTC, the latest version removed that appropriation in       order to win over GOP support. As Lee, Cotton, and Grassley       noted, ``Importantly, these bills improve antitrust       enforcement without appropriating any more funds to President       Biden's out-of-control FTC.''        In an ideal world, you would find ways to both increase       funding to law enforcement while also establishing guardrails       on that funding. While the FBI, for example, needs more       resources to investigate child sexual abuse, they also need       safeguards that prevent the agency from redirecting that       funding to pursue political investigations--an issue which is       not a hypothetical problem. But whether it's the FBI or FTC,       those guardrails can't be built overnight, so what can be       done now to improve antitrust enforcement?        Big Tech, not taxpayers or small and mid-sized businesses,       must foot more of the bill for antitrust enforcement. Title I       of the antitrust package adjusts the fees for mergers,       charging more for transactions over one billion dollars,       while also charging less for mergers under that threshold.       Moreover, these fee hikes would not give more money to the       FTC and DOJ; instead, they would offset taxpayer funding of       these agencies. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office       estimates that these ``discretionary offsetting collections''       would reduce federal spending by $1.4 billion dollars.        The FTC and DOJ must be diverted from fake problems to real       problems. Title II of the antitrust package does exactly       that. Especially given the willingness of Big Tech to       capitulate to China, both the FTC and DOJ need to focus on       foreign influence from, for instance, the Chinese Communist       Party when it comes to ruling on mergers. Here, Title II       would amend the premerger notification process, requiring       companies to disclose if they received ``a subsidy from a       foreign entity of concern.''        Finally, if you don't want to empower the FTC and DOJ, then       empower the states instead. When the federal government files       an antitrust lawsuit, it picks a venue for that lawsuit.       However, state governments--which already have to pool       resources to fund antitrust lawsuits against Big Tech--don't       have this same privilege. Before they can even debate the       merits of their lawsuit, Big Tech will make them debate where       they, should have a debate, burning time and money. Title III       would let states choose their own venue.        Voters are angry at Big Tech, but they are also asking       legislators, ``What are you going to do about it?'' Jim       Jordan and Tucker Carlson may share the same talking points       on Big Tech, but as Tucker himself once pointed out when       Jordan was on his show, his job as a talk show host is to       talk; Jordan's job as a legislator is to legislate.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard the arguments against this Big Tech bill by  my Republican colleagues.   My Republican friends ask why would we give President Biden a win  within 41 days before an election?   Let me be clear. This is not a Democrat bill, and this is not a  Republican bill.   Mr. Speaker, holding Big Tech accountable is an American bill. It is  American legislation. We are United States Congressmen. We are serving  in the United States Congress. We serve United States citizens. It is  never the wrong time to do the right thing.    My friends say this Big Tech bill doesn't prevent discrimination and  censorship. Competition is the solution for viewpoint censorship. MSNBC  may not support my views, but Newsmax and FOX will listen to me.   The New York Times and The Washington Post may disagree with me, but  The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times will hear me out.   Google controls 94 percent of online searches, and when it changes  its algorithm to discriminate against one side, there is no  alternative. The same goes for Facebook, Amazon, and Apple.   The real threat is that when a monopoly controls information in a  democracy, it controls the results of elections. That is the threat  that Big Tech poses to America. I am afraid that America may not be  able to withstand that threat.   Finally, my friends ask, Why give money to the Biden FTC and DOJ?   America is about to give Republicans control of the oversight and  appropriations process. Americans expect us to use those levers of  power responsibly and effectively. It is not too much to ask for  Congress to walk and chew gum at the same time? We can create  competition for Big Tech and level the playing field and at the same  time make sure our government treats everyone in this country fairly.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.
