 Mr. Speaker, I am excited this week to introduce H.  Res. 505, a bill to again commemorate and honor Juneteenth.   Juneteenth should be a holiday that brings all Americans together  because it is about freedom, freedom of a people. It was when General  Granger came to Galveston, Texas, with General Order No. 3, to release  the slaves who had been held an extra 2 years because a State would not  listen.   It is a holiday that brings us together. There will be commemorations  in Galveston. There will be commemorations in Houston, Texas, proudly  bringing people from all ethnic backgrounds together, from Friday all  the way to the Juneteenth holiday.   I am very proud to acknowledge Opal Lee, the grandmother of  Juneteenth, who brought a million petitions here to say that we need a  Federal holiday.   I am proud to honor the late Representative Al Edwards, who  introduced the first bill to make it a State holiday in Texas. I was  very glad to be inspired by him and mentored by him to introduce the  Federal legislation, introducing the resolution for 10 years and then  finally achieving my goal, our goal, to have a Federal holiday.   It is a holiday for all people. Let us celebrate Juneteenth on June  19. Do something in your community that heals, welcomes, and joins each  community together.   It is about freedom of a people, freedom of America, and our  wonderful democracy.                            ____________________
