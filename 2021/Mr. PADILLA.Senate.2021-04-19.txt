 Madam President, I also rise today to offer my strong  support for the nomination of Ms. Vanita Gupta to be the Associate  Attorney General of the United States.   In the 44-year history of the position, a woman of color has never  served as Associate Attorney General of the United States. We have the  opportunity to confirm a qualified, proven, and respected woman of  color in Ms. Gupta, and the Senate should not delay any longer.   As Associate Attorney General, Ms. Gupta would help restore  professionalism, empathy, and dignity to the highest levels of the  Justice Department. Through more than 5 hours of testimony--5 hours-- before the Judiciary Committee and in a lengthy career in public  service, Ms. Gupta has demonstrated exactly why our Nation would be  well served by her leadership in the Department of Justice.   Throughout her career, Ms. Gupta has paid particular attention to the  most marginalized and often the least heard among us. From representing  wrongfully convicted individuals as a young lawyer to her time in  leadership roles at the ACLU, the Leadership Conference, and the  Department of Justice, Ms. Gupta has demonstrated her deep commitment  to pursuing justice, equity, and equality for all people.   In pursuit of that goal, Ms. Gupta has also demonstrated her desire  and ability to work with anyone, including those who might normally  disagree with her. Indeed, Ms. Gupta's endorsements from groups like  the Fraternal Order of Police and individuals like Grover Norquist  confirm that she is a thoughtful listener, a bridge builder, and a  consensus seeker.   In this charged political era, it is hard to imagine that any other  nominee for Associate Attorney General could give my Republican  colleagues more assurance that their views will be fairly considered at  the Department of Justice. Yet, our Republican colleagues on the  Judiciary Committee requested that Ms. Gupta's nomination be  indefinitely stalled and that she be required to testify before the  committee again. When those demands were rightfully declined, they  chose to vote en bloc against referring Ms. Gupta's nomination to the  floor.   But the opposition to Ms. Gupta's nomination is, frankly, frivolous.  For 4 years now, the now-minority members of the Judiciary Committee  refused to even comment on, let alone criticize, President Trump's  tweets antagonizing judges, Senators, everyday Americans, and so many  others. Yet now they argue that Ms. Gupta's occasionally impassioned  tweets over the last 4 years are somehow disqualifying, despite her  sincere apology, her expression of respect for Members of this body,  and her promise to participate in turning down the rhetorical  temperature. My Republican colleagues' double standard could not be  more clear.   Similarly, our Republican colleagues spent the last 4 years hastily  confirming judges and nominees who refused to answer basic questions,  like whether or not Brown v. Board of Education was rightfully decided.  Of course it was. But now they argue that more than 5 hours of  testimony and 10,000 pages of documents were not sufficient to evaluate  Ms. Gupta, who repeatedly answered each and every one of their  questions. Again, the double standard could not be more clear.  [[Page S2009]]    I could go on and on, but instead of continuing to point out the  obvious hypocrisy, let me say a few more words about why I am excited  to have Ms. Gupta serve as the Associate Attorney General.   For years now, civil rights, voting rights, environmental justice,  immigrants' rights, and consumer rights have found themselves as a  second thought in the administration of our justice system. No longer.  Under Ms. Gupta's leadership, I look forward to seeing a Justice  Department that pursues equal justice for all of our citizens and that  recognizes the dignity and humanity of all people.   I look forward to seeing Ms. Gupta work with Republicans and  Democrats, with liberals and conservatives to find solutions to our  problems, as she has throughout her career. And I look forward to young  girls and boys of color once again seeing someone who looks like them  in the leadership of our Justice Department and knowing that one day,  they, too, can reach such great heights.   Colleagues, let's not wait a moment longer. It is time for us to  confirm Ms. Gupta as the next Associate Attorney General of the United  States.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        Committee on Foreign Relations    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, April 19, 2021, at 6 p.m., to conduct  a hearing.                            ____________________
