 Madam Chair, this amendment doesn't make sense from an  economic perspective or a health perspective. It would block  implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency's commonsense  standards for sources of emissions of methane in the oil and gas  industry.                                time  1115    And while we invest in renewable energy, at the same time, we know  that we can't wait to transition entirely to renewable energy before we  address other side effects of the extraction process, like methane.  Pound for pound, methane pollution from oil and gas wells is 30 times  more potent than carbon dioxide and is responsible for a quarter of  human-made climate change.   This EPA rule, frankly, is just a starting point. It is a long  overdue standard for the oil and gas industry to reduce methane  pollution. Frankly, I wish these rules went further, but these stricter  standards are a good start; they are necessary. Scientists have  published data that shows that methane released during extraction is an  incredibly large contributor to the climate threat.   I think it is really critical not to prevent the EPA from moving  forward and fulfilling the mission that Congress gave them to protect  our air, water, and planet, and that is what this amendment would do,  which is why I oppose it.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, before I begin my comments on this amendment,  I want to thank the chairman for including my other amendment regarding  volunteer and State wildfire assistance en bloc earlier today.   While a great deal of attention is being paid to Hurricane Harvey and  Irma, the West is also being ravaged by wildfires, costing hundreds of  millions of dollars and lives.   My amendment with Representatives Renacci and King that passed makes  sure that States and local governments will have a little bit more  resources with their volunteer fire departments to fight those fires,  and I appreciate that.   Madam Chair, this amendment that is at the desk would address the  really unsound plan by the EPA to close down their regional field  offices. My amendment would prevent this plan from occurring by  preventing funds from going to the closure of regional Environmental  Protection Agency offices.   We already know that the new EPA leadership has its priorities  backwards, focused on how they can help fossil fuels and coal and oil  rather than the congressionally mandated responsibility of keeping our  air and water clean and helping to keep people healthy.   So earlier this year, when the President's budget included closing  ten regional Environmental Protection Agency offices and reports began  to surface in April that Secretary Pruitt was looking to close the  Region 5 office, which covers the upper Midwest, I was disappointed,  hence, this action that I am taking here today with this amendment.   The reports we have heard are surrounding Region 5, but we have no  idea which regions they are targeting. In my home State of Colorado,  the Region 8 headquarters serves six States and 27 sovereign Tribal  nations. Our headquarters in Denver are essential to protecting health  and safeguarding the national environment in the American West.   It is very important to fight against this reckless EPA plan to close  down regional offices that keep our air clean. And now more than ever,  with tropical storms and flooded chemical plants and oil spills around  Houston, we all know how essential EPA presence in the field is. The  EPA field offices are often the first responders at the scenes of  environmental disasters. Regional field offices are uniquely well  versed in particular characteristics in our very diverse geographic  Nation.   It is very important for Congress to send an unambiguous message that  we want to safeguard the lives and welfare of our American citizens,  acknowledge and address the very real threat of climate change.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Well, if there is no plans to close offices and it would  cost more to close them, I would just hope that the Chair would accept  this amendment, which merely confirms what he just indicated.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would like to inquire as to how much time  remains.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota  (Ms. McCollum).    Madam Chair, again, the chairman has given his assurances  that there is no plans to close offices, that it would cost more to  close offices; therefore, since there is no additional money for office  closure in this bill, it is not happening.   I don't see why we don't just confirm that same intent that he  conveyed by putting this funding amendment restriction in place that  would prevent offices from being closed. If they are saying they are  not going to close, and if we are saying they are not going to close,  well, let's just put that in words so it means something. That is all  this amendment does.   Obviously, if the President or the executive want to propose  consolidation or closures, they can come back and seek funding for  that. The Chair is right. We have the final word.   If we include this language in the bill, our final word will be that  you can't close EPA offices without a change in funding and coming back  to Congress. So it is completely consistent with what the Chair  indicated. I think it is a very important statement for us to make as a  united Congress.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment is very simple. It offers Members of this body a very  clear choice about whether or not we want to keep our public lands in  the hands of those who rightfully own them, the American public; or if  we want to sell off our public lands to the highest bidder.   This amendment would prohibit the Federal use of funds to pursue any  additional extralegal ways to turn our Federal lands over to private  owners. For example, it would prohibit commissions. It would prohibit  groups that would find backdoor ways to do that, or any other means.   My amendment simply ensures that none of the funds through this bill  can be used in violation of the law that already exists. I would hope  that can be accepted by the Republicans. It is important to note that  this amendment would not do anything to undermine the current authority  for congressional- and administration-driven land exchanges that many  of us have worked on.   In the district I am honored to represent, over 60 percent of the  land is public land. These public lands are beautiful and majestic,  just as they are across the entire country. They are a critical part of  our American heritage; our Western heritage; in my State, our Colorado  heritage; and they serve so many incredible purposes.   First of all, public lands are good for our mind and soul. A U.S.  Army Iraq war veteran who lives in Colorado recently said: ``I fought  to protect all that makes our Nation great, and that includes the  public lands that belong to every American.''   Second, these lands are good for our bodies by protecting water  quality and public health. People hike and fish and enjoy outdoor  recreation time. The public lands are the ecosystems that house  headwaters of our river systems that we rely on for our drinking water  and that help keep our air clean through the plants that they water.   Not only are our lands good for the soul and health, they are also  the key economic driver in my district and my State. Across the  country, over $600 billion is generated through outdoor recreation on  our public lands, and visiting public lands support over 6 million  jobs.   I represent Rocky Mountain National Park, which has over 3 million  visitors a year. The entire economy of towns, like Estes Park, rely on  our public lands. From small businesses to ski resorts, from gas  stations to diners, our economy thrives in districts like mine because  of our public lands.   A recent poll across six Western States shows that 96 percent of  Americans support public lands. Let's vote on this and make sure that  96 percent in Congress agrees with 96 percent of the American public.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Well, look, the only argument the chairman has made  against this one, like the last one, is that it is not going to happen  anyway. So why not give the American people the assurance? Because,  frankly, it could happen anyway.   There is a real threat. There are Members of this body and there are  members of the President's administration that are seeking to sell off  our public lands, which would devastate our local economy, undermine  wildlife and the ecosystems that we support, and remove a critical  iconic part of our Western heritage.   Selling these public lands to private owners would lead to a loss of  access to our most majestic, treasured spaces, a critical part of our  quality of life not just for Coloradans, but for the millions of people  from across the country that visit our wild areas.   Time after time we see real attempts that are made here to transfer  our most precious public lands to private ownership or sell them at  wholesale.   With this amendment, we offer a clear choice. Let's confirm what the  chairman said: that this won't happen. Let's support the protection of  our public lands as all of our constituents do.   I think it is clear to make sure that Members are on the record. Do  we support keeping our public lands public? Or do we support the  corporatization of something that is, in many ways, the iconic essence  of our identity as a people and as a country, our public lands?   Madam Chair, I ask for my colleagues' support on this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
