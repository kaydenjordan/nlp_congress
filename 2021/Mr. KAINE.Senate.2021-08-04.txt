 Mr. President, myotonic dystrophy is a rare, multi- systemic, progressive, inherited disease that affects successive family  generations but is often misdiagnosed. Affecting as many as 1 in 2,100  individuals, myotonic dystrophy is the most common form of adult  muscular dystrophy. However, there is currently no cure and there are  no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments.   Today, I am pleased to introduce the first ever U.S. Senate  resolution designating September 15th as International Myotonic  Dystrophy Awareness Day. The resolution will help to highlight the  devastating generational impact of this disease, focus global attention  on accelerating drug discovery, and work to advance healthcare for our  community.   Caused by an inherited genetic anomaly, individuals with myotonic  dystrophy experience varied and complex symptoms, from locked muscles,  to heart, breathing, digestive, hormonal, and cognitive difficulties.  It is not uncommon for older family members to only be tested following  the birth of an affected child, and despite the availability of simple  genetic tests, misdiagnoses can persist for decades.   The different body systems affected, the severity of symptoms, and  the age of onset of those symptoms varies greatly between individuals,  even within the same family. Many of these individuals live with  debilitating symptoms yet in the majority of situations, they never  receive adequate or proactive medical care which could dramatically  improve their quality of life.   More research is desperately needed to change this reality. Virginia- based researchers are among the global leaders working to better  understand myotonic dystrophy and discover new treatments and a cure.  Much of this work is being led by researchers at Virginia Commonwealth  University (VCU) and supported by Virginia advocates.   The Resolution calls for the advancement of scientific and medical  myotonic dystrophy research at the National Institutes of Health and as  part of the Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program of the Department of  Defense; fostering biopharmaceutical innovation that will lead to  treatments approved by the FDA and eventually a cure for myotonic  dystrophy; advancing programs and policies that assist individuals with  disabilities caused by myotonic dystrophy and the caregivers of those  individuals; and encouraging awareness and education of myotonic  dystrophy among patients, caregivers, clinicians, and researchers.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see the Resolution  designating September 15th as International Myotonic Dystrophy  Awareness Day as an opportunity to raise awareness for this devastating  disease and to promote and advance the health, well-being, and inherent  dignity of all children and adults with myotonic dystrophy. I ask for  their support.                            ____________________
