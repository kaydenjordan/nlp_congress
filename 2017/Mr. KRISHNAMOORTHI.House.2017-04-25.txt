 Mr. Speaker, today, as a member of the House  Oversight Committee, I had the opportunity to view classified documents  related to General Michael Flynn's disturbing foreign financial  relationships.   I am very proud that Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings  worked together in a bipartisan fashion to bring those documents before  our committee. The issue of Russian interference in our democracy is an  issue that affects everyone. I hope that all Members will have the  chance to review these critical materials.   While the information in these documents is classified, I remain  profoundly disturbed by the additional questions they raised.  Unfortunately, I also remain very concerned about how they are being  portrayed by the White House.   This growing credibility gap between the administration and the  American people only underscores the need for an independent commission  to uncover all the facts. I am heartened, however, that today, Chairman  Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings came together in a bipartisan  fashion regarding this issue.                            ____________________
