 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Luna for leading  on this resolution.   Representative Schiff used his position as the chairman of the House  Intelligence Committee to mislead the American people by falsely  claiming that there was classified evidence of Russia colluding with  President Trump, which was not true.   The Mueller report and the Durham report make clear that the Russia  collusion hoax was a political lie designed to hurt President Trump and  mislead the American people.   Representative Schiff used the Intelligence Committee to advance a  political narrative against his political opponents, which violated the  important nonpartisan tradition of the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues today in holding  Representative Schiff accountable for his actions because the American  people deserve justice.
