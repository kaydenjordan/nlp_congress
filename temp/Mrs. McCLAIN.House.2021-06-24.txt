 Mr. Speaker, for more than 40 years, Joe Biden has been  a staunch supporter of the Hyde amendment. So have the American people.  Just this past January, polling found that nearly 6 in 10 Americans  oppose using tax dollars to terminate innocent lives. That number  includes a majority of Independents and nearly one-third of Democrats.   For decades, congressional Democrats joined Republicans in a truly  bipartisan effort to ensure tax dollars of hardworking Americans do not  pay for abortions. Unfortunately, President Biden is trying to shatter  years of congressional bipartisanship with a radical budget that has no  Hyde amendment protections.   The President ran on unity, yet his first budget proposal immediately  divides. This Congress must take back its congressional responsibility  and craft spending bills which protect the lives of the unborn, just as  past Congresses have done since 1976.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
