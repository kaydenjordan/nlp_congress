 Mr. Speaker, I am always grateful to have this  preeminent privilege of standing in the well of the Congress of the  United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce that three prominent Democrats  have asked to meet with me to discuss impeachment.                                time  1030    Mr. Speaker, I will meet with them in my office, and here is what I  will say:   I will tell them that impeachment is not about Democrats. It is not  about Republicans. I will tell them it is about democracy. It is about  government of the people, by the people, for the people. I will tell  them that it is about the Republic and that it is about what Franklin  said: We have a Republic, if we can keep it.   I will tell them that I refuse to sit on the sidelines while the  world is considering one of the greatest issues of our time. I will  tell them that I will continue to be a part of this great debate.   I will tell them these words I have heard, but I do not know the  origin of. I will tell them that if a man does not keep pace with his  companions, perhaps he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the  music he hears, however measured, however far away.   Mr. Speaker, I will tell them that tomorrow we will bring Articles of  Impeachment to the floor of the Congress of the United States of  America for a vote.                            ____________________
