 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bipartisan  compromise to fund our Federal Government for the remainder of the  year.   It is frustrating that the Trump administration inserted itself into  our congressional funding negotiations last year, which unnecessarily  delayed this bill for 7 months. The delay created uncertainty and  instability for local governments, schools, businesses, and the  families we represent. Nevertheless, this final funding package we have  under consideration today is a win for Minnesotans and Americans.   Democrats stood strong and united. That is why this bill does not  include any funding for President Trump's wasteful border wall, which  he wanted to pay for with cuts to our priorities here at home.   As the ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I am proud that we removed more  than 75 poison pill riders from our part of the bill. These destructive  policies would have delisted endangered species, rolled back  environmental protections, and chipped away at our public lands.   In addition to removing these harmful Republican riders, Democrats  also succeeded in holding off many devastating cuts proposed by the  Trump administration. We protected the EPA from steep cuts to its work  to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink. We fully funded  the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to keep our lakes and  communities that rely on them healthy. We increased funding for the  National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities, which enrich the  quality of life across this Nation.   This final, bipartisan agreement will protect our environment, meet  our trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans, and safeguard our  natural and cultural heritage. Sadly, the President's 2018 budget would  undo all this work, so we must stay vigilant.                                time  1515    I would like to take the opportunity to thank the chairman of the  full committee as well as the ranking member, Mrs. Lowey. I would also  like to give a special thank-you to the chairman of the subcommittee,  Ken Calvert, and to all of our staff, both Republican and Democrat, on  both sides who worked so hard to make this bill possible, along with my  personal staff.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage an ``aye'' vote on this bill.
