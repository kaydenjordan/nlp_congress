 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  President Biden's and House Democrats' work in reducing the budget  deficit, fighting inflation, and lowering the cost of goods in America.   Madam Speaker, it is no secret Russia's cruel war against Ukraine is  driving up prices not only here in America but all over the globe.  Putin's price hike has increased gas prices by $2 a gallon in many  places since Russian troops began to threaten Ukraine, and families are  seeing higher prices in the grocery aisles also.   But President Biden and House Democrats won't stand by and watch  rising costs and inflation continue to burden our hardworking families.  Putin may raise prices temporarily, but President Biden and House  Democrats are fighting back with key legislation, and we will win.   This week alone, Democrats acted to lower costs and crack down on  outrageous ocean shipping fees by passing the bipartisan Ocean Shipping  Reform Act. These shipping fees have made goods more expensive for  American small businesses and American consumers. This bill will  correct this inequity and make sure that American consumers are not  being overcharged.   Democrats soon will pass the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act, which  aims to lower prices for American families in the grocery aisle and at  the gas pump by giving American farmers and ranchers the support they  need to thrive. This bill will take massive steps, including lowering  fertilizer costs in the field to lower prices at the grocery store;  lowering meat and poultry costs by increasing meatpacking competition  and capacity; and lowering prices at the pump by making cheaper,  cleaner Unleaded 88 more available.   These are meaningful and practical steps we are taking to ensure  lower prices and to lower inflation. But that is not all.   This week, Democrats have delivered for the American people and will  continue to do so. Last March, we passed the COMPETES Act. Now it is in  conference, and we are negotiating with the Senate. The COMPETES Act  will strengthen our supply chain and lower costs big time.   This bill also will help us make more products right here in America.  We will see ``Made in the USA.''   It also will include my bill, which has language to provide critical  grants for maritime centers that would ensure our supply chain is not  interrupted by work shortages and to ensure a pipeline of the future  workforce. This will lower prices for our districts, like mine in  Texas-29, and it will also create many good-paying local jobs for  people in my district and all hardworking Texans.   Madam Speaker, I am hopeful that our negotiations with the Senate  while we are in the conference committee will soon end and that we can  find final passage of this very critical bill because this bill will  make sure that America competes and that America will see products that  say ``USA.''   Madam Speaker, one major accomplishment less talked about but so  important to all of us today and tomorrow is President Biden's historic  Federal deficit cut. In a nutshell, President Biden has delivered the  largest Federal deficit cut in the past 16 months than any other  President's first 16 months.   You see, Democrats understand that building a better America is not  only about today, but it is also about our future generations. It is  about building a better America for all of us here today but also for  generations to come. That is why Biden is on track to drop the budget  deficit by more than $1.6 trillion this year alone.   In contrast, the Trump administration and my Republican colleagues  raised the deficit every year that Mr. Trump was in office.   President Biden and House Democrats will remain committed to lowering  costs for working families, and I promise we will make good on that  promise. We will continue delivering results for today and for  generations to come.

Let me repeat the words, this is what we are talking about: racial  equity, inclusion, and economic justice.   I thank Chairwoman Waters for bringing this legislation forward and  for her leadership on all these important issues. I thank Chairman  Green who is the chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations for navigating us through this bill being heard today.   Specifically, I will speak about two bills which have been included  in this important package, such as the Improving Language Access in  Mortgage Servicing Act.   According to the U.S. Census, over 20 percent--that is one out of  five--households in the United States speak a language other than  English, and nearly 9 percent of households lack a proficient English  speaker.   Homeownership is an opportunity to build generational wealth and  speaking another language should never be a barrier in home buying and  mortgaging.   This legislation will establish language access requirements in the  eight most commonly spoken languages in the United States, besides  English, for creditors and servicers to ensure that Americans who lack  English proficiency are not at a disadvantage while buying a home.   Imagine getting something from your mortgage company telling you you  owe something or that you are at risk of maybe being foreclosed on, but  it is all in English, and you speak no English. Of course, you will end  up being in foreclosure because you don't understand the notice that  you are getting. This is what my bill is about.   The second bill is the Studying Barriers to Housing Act, which has  also been included in this package.    Mr. Speaker, this legislation will require the  GAO to conduct a study to identify housing barriers that contribute to  the issue of homelessness.   This study will find laws, regulations, common practices, and funding  formulas that create barriers to housing in an effort to pinpoint the  problems in our system that cause homelessness to continue and grow.   I am proud of both of these bills, and I hope that both of these  bills pass to increase expanded language access and to find the root  causes of homelessness.
