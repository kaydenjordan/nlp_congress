 Madam Speaker, I find the name of this bill, the  American Dream and Promise Act, to be quite a nightmare because while  this may be a bill that will help some, it destroys the dreams of the  American children.   The contradiction and the hypocrisy in this entire bill can be summed  up in this way: I have heard over and over, Madam Speaker, these  Dreamers are frontline workers; they have been in harm's way; they have  helped with this pandemic. Yet, we are going to open the border and  allow people into our country that do not have a COVID test. We are  putting our Dreamers in harm's way. I find the hypocrisy of this bill  somewhat puzzling.   But I also want to point out that this bill allows those convicted of  dangerous crimes, including MS-13 and other gang members, to receive a  green card by including the following exceptions if the applicants with  multiple misdemeanor convictions, even if the crime was violent or  resulted in death or bodily injury, they can still get a green card. It  will not take into account violent crimes committed as a juvenile when  adjudicating the application.   I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.
