 Mr. President, I am here to express my support for  the nomination of Vanita Gupta to serve as Associate Attorney General.   It is a little strange here on the floor today because under normal  circumstances I would talk about Ms. Gupta's exemplary record of  service and how she will excel as the third in command of the  Department of Justice and that she would be a consensus nominee. But  the extraordinary effort to scuttle her nomination on a partisan basis  in spite of her exemplary record asks some questions about what is  going on here.   Vanita Gupta is an accomplished lawyer with a record of working well  with just about everyone. When she was last at the Department, working  on really difficult issues like use-of-force guidelines for police, she  built solid relationships with law enforcement. So they have thrown  their full-throated support behind her nomination.   Here are the law enforcement agencies and leaders that are supporting  her: the Fraternal Order of Police; the Major County Sheriffs of  America; the International Association of Chiefs of Police; the Major  Cities Chiefs Association; the Police Executive Research Forum; the  Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association; the Hispanic American  Police Command Officers Association; NOBLE, the National Organization  of Black Law Enforcement Executives; and a whole array of distinguished  law enforcement leaders.   These are influential groups and respected individuals, and, for some  of my Republican colleagues, this kind of support from law enforcement  is literally unbelievable.   So here is what my colleague, the junior Senator from Arkansas, asked  Ms. Gupta about all these law enforcement endorsements during her  confirmation hearing: ``Did you, or anyone on your behalf or anyone in  or affiliated with the Biden campaign transition or administration,  pressure those organizations with threats of retaliation if they did  not support your nomination?''   ``No, Senator,'' she answered.   And she wasn't kidding. Law enforcement doesn't brook threats from  criminals, let alone Presidential candidates and executive nominees  seeking their endorsement.   And, indeed, they stood up to dispute that insinuation. Here is what  Jim Pasco, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police,  said in response:         I was kind of shocked by it. If [the Senator] really       suspects that, then he doesn't really know the law       enforcement organizations as well as he thinks he does, and       he certainly doesn't know Vanita Gupta as well as I know her.    Chuck Wexler is the head of the Police Executive Research Forum, and  here is how he responded:         Do you really think you can stand up to law enforcement and       threaten them? Do you really think that's going to work? We       never forgot that she stood with us when it mattered.    That is the reason for her support from law enforcement: She stood  with them when it mattered. And to say that she is such a radical and  so against law enforcement and disdains those who disagree with her-- which would presumably be law enforcement, if she is such an anti-law- enforcement radical, as my colleagues suggest--is completely blown to  smithereens by their continued support for her--not disdain: ``She  stood with us when it mattered.''   So when that effort to blow her up exploded in their face, colleagues  went after an op-ed that she authored 9 years ago in which she  supported decriminalization and defelonization of simple possession of  small amounts of drugs. It could be read to say decriminalization of  marijuana--other drugs, small amounts.   Well, we know a lot today about substance abuse that we didn't know  then that people who have addictions require treatment and care, not  punishment and incarceration. That is no radical position. The idea  that you should not prosecute people for possession of small amounts is  the basis of drug courts.   I started the drug court in Rhode Island. It has been a roaring  success. It is the basis for diversion programs. As attorney general of  my State with full criminal jurisdiction in my State of Rhode Island,  we constantly did diversion of cases of possession of small amounts of  drugs--all kinds of drugs--  [[Page S1972]]  because they don't belong in the criminal justice system. They get  swept up, and you divert them out before prosecution.   This is nothing peculiar or unusual. This is the position of the  World Health Organization. This is the position of the Organization of  American States. This is the position of the International Red Cross.  Heck, even former Speaker Boehner supported decriminalization of simple  possession of some or all drugs.   So they had to get into rhetorical tricks to try to make the point  look different than it actually is. And Republicans repeatedly asked  her questions about that statement regarding small amounts with respect  to what they call here ``the legalization of `all drugs.''' In response  to that, she said:         I have never advocated for the legalization or       decriminalization of all drugs, and I do not support the       legalization or decriminalization of all drugs.    If I were to come up to you, Mr. President, and say ``Do you support  the legalization or decriminalization of all drugs?'' what will you  take that question to mean? It would seem to mean blanket  decriminalization or legalization of all drugs, not small amounts--all.   Well, they went on in this same vein. Here is a question for the  record from Senator Hawley describing Senator Cornyn's question  ``whether you advocate decriminalization of all drugs.''   That is not what she advocated. What she advocated was  decriminalization of small amounts--consistent with diversion,  consistent with drug court activity, consistent with the way the  substance abuse and recovery community treats this issue, and  consistent with the position of all those organizations and many, many  more. This is the way we operate in law enforcement these days.   So then they try to focus in on the word ``never.'' Senator Cornyn,  who was speaking on the floor a moment ago, ominously said to me, the  most important word in that quote is ``never.'' As you can see, it is  simply a misrepresentation of what she said in 2012.   Well, you could also argue--``I have never advocated for the  decriminalization of all drugs.'' You could also argue that the key  word in that sentence isn't ``never''; it is ``all.'' That is the  subject of the sentence: ``all drugs.'' Kilos of cocaine, pounds of  methamphetamine--no. Small, simple possession amounts--that is the way  everybody treats drugs in law enforcement these days.   As lawyers, we know that it is important to get the question right,  and it is not unusual for lawyers to flub the question. When you are  asking a question in court and you flub the question, you often get an  answer you don't like, and the remedy for that is not to call the  witness who answered your question a liar. The remedy for that is to  get the question right in the first place. And if the question is  whether Vanita Gupta advocated decriminalization of all drugs, the  answer is, in fact, no because small amounts of simple possession is a  very different thing than ``all drugs.''   And now they are hanging this extraordinary rampart of invective-- liar, deliberate liar--all over getting an honest answer to a question  that they asked badly or, perhaps, worse yet, a trick question intended  to trip her up that she answered honestly.   So what is going on? Why are they going through this exercise? Well,  step back a little bit and look what is going on in our country. The  first thing that is going on is that there is a massive dark money  campaign for voter suppression. There is a guy named Leonard Leo who  ran the dark money campaign that pushed three Supreme Court Justices  onto the Court. The Washington Post reported that as a $250 million  effort--$250 million.   After the Washington Post article came out and Leonard Leo was blown  like a covert agent who suddenly is identified with all of this, he has  to get out. Where does he go? He goes to something called the Honest  Elections Project, which is the sister organization of a group called  the Judicial Crisis Network, which--guess what--is running ads against  Vanita Gupta.   They used to run ads for the Supreme Court nominees. They spent tens  of millions of dollars running ads against Garland, for Gorsuch, for  Kavanaugh, for Barrett--tens of millions of dollars. But with Biden in  the White House, nobody is listening to them any longer. They are not  getting their appointees through, so they moved to voter suppression.  And all that money and that same guy, Leonard Leo, are now lined up  behind voter suppression.   So you get dark money ads paid for by Judicial Crisis Network against  the third-ranking person in the Department of Justice? They are used to  going for the Supreme Court. They are going after the third-ranking  person at the Department of Justice. Why? Because it is voter  suppression--because she has been the head of the Civil Rights  Division, which prosecuted voter suppression. She knows that stuff. She  will supervise Kristen Clarke, whom you will hear a lot more nonsense  about from the other side, who will run the Civil Rights Division and  sue for voter suppression.   So what this is really about is the voter suppression project that  you see alive and well in the country from the Republican Party. There  are reports that say that every single legislative body in the country  controlled by Republicans is pushing voter suppression measures. I  don't know that it is true, but it sure looks like it is true. And if  not, it is darn close. It is a pattern. Wherever you go in the country,  Republicans in charge--boom--restrict the ballot.   They know people don't like what they stand for. They know people  can't stand the dark money forces behind ads like this. So the secret,  as my distinguished colleague Senator Warnock said: Some people don't  want some people to vote.   So the two women who will be overseeing the Department of Justice  voter suppression resistance, the legal fight against voter  suppression, the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act, are being  subjected to this treatment.   On this, I will stand with Ms. Gupta   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Daily Beast, Mar. 22, 2021]        How Right-Wing Dark Money Is Trying to Kneecap the Biden DOJ                          (By Sheldon Whitehouse)         Someone is targeting Biden Justice Department nominees       Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke with attacks. Why? Both       nominees hold exceptional records as litigators and civils       rights activists. The respect they've earned extends beyond       the civil rights movement and progressives to law enforcement       and leading conservatives. They ought to be consensus picks.        But pull back the curtain, and strategy and motive take       shape. Gupta and Clarke are poised to use their skills to       defend Americans' right to vote, just as the Republican Party       is going all in on voter suppression as its path to political       victory in 2022.        Unraveling the strategy starts with the dark-money group       running the ads: the so-called Judicial Crisis Network (JCN).       This group's ordinary work has been to translate big donors'       money into political attack ads in the ``Court capture''       mission that set out to remake the Supreme Court to the       donors' advantage. JCN has placed more than 10,000 ads since       2012 in pursuit of that mission, and they've kept secret the       identity of those big donors.        In Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell's courtpacking machine,       this Judicial Crisis Network spent $7 million to oppose       President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, and       then spent another $10 million to boost Trump's nominee Neil       Gorsuch. JCN pledged $10 million or more for Brett       Kavanaugh's nomination. It spent $10 million in under two       months to support Amy Coney Barrett's bid. These campaigns       were funded with tens of millions of anonymous dollars,       primarily through four separate donations of at least $15       million. Those donations may well have been the same donor.        Eye-popping as that is, those millions are a tiny slice of       the funding behind the overall dark-money operation. A 2019       Washington Post investigation revealed JCN is one of a web of       front groups coordinated by Leonard Leo, the long-time       executive vice president of the Federalist Society.        The Post tracked more than $250 million in dark money       flowing through Leo's groups.        The groups see to the grooming and selection of reliable       nominees, the lobbyists needed to shepherd nominees through       confirmation, and the attack ads to motivate the confirmation       votes. Then, more groups lobby the selected judges through       amicus curiae briefs, signaling how their donors want the       judges to rule.        The dark-money network has won an avalanche of victories       for its donors. There are 80 partisan, 5-4 Supreme Court       decisions that limit workers' rights and access to       reproductive health care, erode environmental protections,       block commonsense gun safety laws, undermine civil rights,       and protect corporations from courtrooms. It is an astounding       80-0 rout for big right-wing donors.  [[Page S1973]]         After The Washington Post exposed the $250 million       operation, Leo stepped back from his Federalist Society role       and turned up at a new organization improbably named the       Honest Elections Project. This project began voter       suppression work in political swing states like Florida,       Nevada, Wisconsin, and Michigan that included: negative       ads against Democrats; threatening letters to election       officials challenging voter rolls; and a barrage of       lawsuits seeking voting restrictions for November's       election.        ``Trump's cronies at the Justice Department showed dark-      money donors the value of a captive Department that would       look away from voter suppression schemes.''        The media soon uncovered that the Honest Elections Project       was a rebrand of the Judicial Education Project--which shared       connections, donors, and aims with its sister group--yes, the       Judicial Crisis Network. As a reporter for The Guardian       observed, the Honest Elections Project melds two goals of the       right-wing dark-money operation: first, pack the federal       judiciary; and second, bring voting rights cases before the       packed courts. Rigging elections through the courts is now a       Republican judicial priority.        This brings us back to Gupta and Clarke. Gupta once ran the       Civil Rights Division. She prosecuted hate crimes and human       trafficking, promoted disability and LGBTQ rights, and fought       discrimination in education, housing, employment, lending,       and religious exercise. But most important, she challenged       voter suppression. Gupta, if confirmed as assistant attorney       general, will supervise the Civil Rights Division she once       ran.        Accomplished civil rights attorney Clarke will fill Gupta's       former role running the Division and enforcing voting rights.       The Honest Elections Project, kin to the Judicial Crisis       Network, wants no part of these two women, because they will       be strong, motivated leaders against unlawful voter       suppression. They preferred Trump's Civil Rights Division,       which didn't bring one single Voting Rights Act case until       late May of 2020.        That's the motive. The donor-approved Republican appointees       to the Supreme Court may handcuff the Civil Rights Division       with further judicial assaults on voting rights. But Trump's       cronies at the Justice Department showed dark-money donors       the value of a captive Department that would look away from       voter suppression schemes. As Republicans hinge their       election strategy on keeping Americans from voting, an active       Civil Rights Division is a deadly threat.        I get it. If I were a right-wing special interest group,       the last thing I would want is these two experienced lawyers       wielding the power of the Justice Department to defend voting       rights. But for everybody else, these women are two       appointments to applaud.    Madam President, before my distinguished friend's  speech, I ask unanimous consent to have an article appended as an  exhibit to the remarks I gave earlier.
