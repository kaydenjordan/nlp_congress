 Mr. Speaker, treating migrants humanely, humanely  as to where a young child will have to make a 300-mile journey, in  which they have no idea what is ahead of them; they have to go with  coyotes and drug traffickers, who, when they drop children across the  border wall that does work, that is the nice things that they do to  those children, and everyone here knows it, which is very upsetting.   So treating them humanely would be responsible, and that is what this  piece of legislation, H.R. 2, is.   The southern border is in crisis. About 5 million people have  illegally crossed into our country under President Biden's watch.   The cartels have smuggled in 14,000 pounds of fentanyl.   Border agents arrested 98 people, 98 people on the terror watch list  in FY22.   This crisis is the direct result of the Biden administration's failed  policies, and every American knows it.   Under President Trump, we had a secure border. All President Biden  had to do was nothing. All he had to do was sit there and do nothing,  but he couldn't even do that.   Instead, he took 94 executive actions to reverse the progress made  under Republican leadership. Unbelievable.   Republicans are once again acting to protect our Nation from the  gangs, drug cartels, and terrorists that exploit this crisis to hurt  the American people.   H.R. 2 resumes construction of the border wall. It pays our border  agents what they need and what they deserve and hires them the help  that they desperately need in terms of assets.   Biden's border crisis has raged far too long. Enough is enough. I  urge my colleagues to vote for this bill and to secure our southern  border.
