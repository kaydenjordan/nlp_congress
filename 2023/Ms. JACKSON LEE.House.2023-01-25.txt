 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 399 the Small  Business Advocacy Improvements Act of 2023, which classifies the  primary function and duties of the Office of Advocacy of the Small  Business Administration, and for other purposes.   Specifically, the bill would set requirements for the Small Business  Administration to include research on how small firms contribute to the  global economy.   H.R. 399 also requires the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business  Administration to represent the views and interests of small businesses  before foreign governments and international entities to contribute to  regulatory and trade initiatives that may affect small businesses.   According to the United States trade Representative, small firms,  which account for two-thirds of all new jobs in recent decades, are the  backbone of the American economy.   Small businesses make up 98 percent of all known U.S. exporters and  indirectly support roughly four million jobs in local communities  around the nation.   Residents in Houston take pride in their neighborhoods and places of  business, and when faced with hardships--most notably Hurricane Harvey  in 2017--they band together, resilient, and unwavering in their will to  move forward.   Small businesses, especially minority owned businesses, face many  challenges.   Nationwide, women and minorities start businesses at a much higher  rate than their white and/or male counterparts, despite facing  disproportionate amounts of obstacles while establishing and  maintaining their ventures.   By enabling more women and minorities to start small businesses, we  will see advancements in wealth and greater economic mobility.   According to a study by Next Street, research shows that self- employed business owners, specifically minority women in Houston,  experience faster earning growth compared to employees who are  compensated by salaries.   A study by the University of Georgia states that the buying power of  African American,  [[Page H303]]  Asian American, and Native American consumers has increased over the  past 30 years to $3 trillion in 2020, making up 17.2 percent of the  nation's total buying power that year. (Based on data provided by the  U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, and other  sources.)   I strongly support the Small Businesses Advocacy Improvements Act  because it allows women and minorities who own small companies to  express their interests and opinions in the on the global market.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 399 because of  the significant effects its passage will on millions of small business  owners around the nation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Small  Business Committee for astute work on issues dealing with small  businesses; Mr. Williams, a colleague from Texas; and the bipartisan  sponsors of this legislation.   I have always said that small businesses are the backbone of the  economic engine of America, so I rise in support of H.R. 400, the  Investing in Main Street Act of 2023, for the wiseness of providing  more investment in small businesses.   As a strong supporter of small businesses, I believe that this bill  will improve the livelihood of many small  [[Page H306]]  businesses that have continuously been impacted by the COVID-19  pandemic. The bill is designed to release more capital investment into  small businesses in America. If my colleagues have interacted with the  small business community, that is one of the number one issues that  they raise consistently.   The bill would allow certain banks and savings associations to invest  more into small business investment companies by increasing the  statutory cap from 5 percent to 15 percent--I can't even imagine the  number 5 percent--and the growing amount of small businesses and the  ones that really stayed the course in desperate times, which was COVID- 19.   According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020 had the  highest total number of applications for new businesses by far compared  to all other years. From 2019 to 2021, there was a 20 percent increase  in the number of small businesses. The Kauffman Foundation says that  the highest amount was among Blacks, Latinos, and immigrants.   People know that small businesses allow them to create jobs in their  own neighborhoods and to build future conglomerates, but obviously,  small businesses reported negative impacts due to COVID.   It is important for this bill to become law immediately. Pass it in  the Senate and ensure that we have the opportunity to keep our small  businesses from closing. When small businesses have ideas, we need to  be able to give them the investment to focus on.   The Biden-Harris administration has laid the foundation and has  helped create the conditions for businesses and job creation. We have  had increasing job creation every month, but we do know that cities  like New Orleans and Honolulu have seen the highest rate of small  business closures. Other cities are right behind.   The fact that we can have a Small Business Administration that  reforms and works with the Paycheck Protection Program, to improve  that, if we had another circumstance like that that held up some of our  small businesses, this investment is going to be a lifeline.   I am delighted to rise to support this legislation because, again, as  I opened my remarks, small businesses are the economic engine of  America and give women, minorities, and others the opportunity to build  an economic engine.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 400, the Investing in Main  Street Act of 2023, to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958  to increase the amount that may be invested in small business  investment companies.   As a strong supporter of small businesses, I believe that this bill  will improve the livelihood of many small businesses that have  continuously been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.   This bill is designed to release more capital investment into small  businesses in America.   The bill would allow certain banks and savings associations to invest  more into small business investment companies by increasing the  statutory cap from 5 percent to 15 percent.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States saw a significant  rise in small businesses.   According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020 had the  highest total number of applications for new businesses by far compared  to all years that data was available.   From 2019 to 2021, there was a 20 percent increase in the number of  small businesses created. That is more than double the average growth  rate year to year.   According to the Kauffman Foundation, the increase in the rate of  entrepreneurship during the pandemic was highest amongst Blacks,  Latinos, and immigrants.   Even though there has been a significant rise in the number of small  businesses during the pandemic, many businesses report negative impacts  due to COVID.   In April 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau launched the Small Business  Pulse Survey to produce data in real-time on the challenges small  businesses were facing due to the pandemic.   When the first survey was collected in April of 2020, 90 percent of  businesses surveyed stated that the pandemic had a negative effect on  business.   When the last survey was collected in April of 2022, 70 percent of  businesses surveyed stated that the pandemic had a negative effect on  business.   Almost three years into the pandemic, small businesses are still  struggling with getting back on their feet.   Cities such as New Orleans and Honolulu had some of the highest rates  of small business closures in the country because their economies are  largely built around serving visitors.   In large cities like San Francisco and Austin, the food industry was  largely impacted because those who would typically eat out on their  lunch break were now working from home.   The time for small business recovery is now.   The Biden-Harris administration has laid the foundation and has  helped create the conditions for business and job creation.   With the evolution of almost 5.4 million small businesses in 2021, we  must work to maintain and support these growing businesses.   The Biden-Harris administration partnered with the Small Business  Administration (SBA) to reform the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).  The policy changes targeted small business and companies that were left  out of previous relief efforts.   The data shows that these PPP policy changes provided more support in  minority communities than the rounds under the previous administration.   The Small Business Relief under the American Rescue Plan included  targeted grant relief and tax credits for small businesses hit by the  pandemic.   The Small Business Relief produced immediate relief to more than  600,000 of the hardest hit small businesses.   The Biden-Harris administration was able to provide more than 6  million small businesses with $450 billion in emergency relief via the  Small Business Administration.   Investing more in our small businesses has had a profound impact on  the job market in the United States.   In the first three quarters of 2021, small businesses with 50  employees or less created almost 2 million jobs in the United States,  the fastest start to small business job growth in any year on record.   Investing in main street should continue to be a priority for  Congress.   Through this bipartisan bill, certain financial institutions would  have the ability to invest more into small business investment  companies by raising the statutory cap.   I urge my colleagues to join me and support this important  legislation that will expand access to capital, increase the number of  small businesses, and create jobs at home.   We must show the American public that improving the economy is a  priority in Congress. This bill is a good first step at doing so.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and I thank  Ms. Tenney for her leadership on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in the name of Iranian freedom. Freedom now for  Iran and the Iranian people.   This legislation is brave, as it speaks clearly in a clear tone  without fear for the courageous persons who have gone to the streets,  not regarding their life or the lives of their families. I call them  brave, courageous, resolved freedom fighters, fighting for their very  life.   This legislation is absolutely necessary, and it is, of course,  bipartisan. I thank Mr. Meeks for indicating the strength of the Biden  administration and the sanctions that have been offered, and the manner  in which the Biden administration, Democrats, and Republicans have said  to Iran: No nonsense. No nonsense, and certainly no nuclear capacity.                                time  1415    Anything that we have to do to ensure that that does not happen  should not be tabled. But what should be tabled is the unbelievable  brutal fighting and killing that has occurred against freedom-loving  people.   I have been a longtime fighter with the people of Iran who are here  in the United States. Iranian Americans have taken to the streets to be  able to say: No more.   We will stand with our brothers and sisters in Iran.   I have seen the various attacks that have resulted in mass killings.  I have seen the fight in Camp Ashraf in Iraq where there has been a  large loss of life of people who have been fighting for freedom. I went  to the camp to see the devastation.   I have supported plans for democracy in Iran. I understand that they  need us to stand by them.   What a horrible and brutal scene that we have seen: children falling  dead, mothers, brothers, fathers, and uncles.   What about Mahsa Amini?   She was just 22 years old, wanting her life to be before her, seeking  democracy and freedom. She was a young, bright woman with courage that  was taken away viciously in an ugly attempt to show how domineering  this regime is. In the course of taking her away, her life was snuffed  out.   We don't know her last hours, last days, last minutes, or last  seconds. We don't know how brutal it might have been, how she might  have cried out for someone to be able to be empathetic and sympathetic,  someone to understand that her life deserved an opportunity to live,  and yet this brutal regime continues to be without concern for anything  that it does.   I want to say to all of the Iranian women, men, and children  protesters who are leading the fight, I say loudly and clearly that we  are standing with you.   I support this legislation entirely, and I want to continue the U.S.- Iran friendship with those people who are fighting for freedom.    Mr. Speaker, let me conclude my remarks by saying I  support Iranian women struggling against dictatorship.   Let me continue to say that I want this relationship between the U.S.  and Iran to continue with the Iranian people who are fighting for  democracy. I believe it is important that this legislation pass to show  that America is a champion for global democracy.   I would like to also indicate that I look forward to organizing the  Iranian women's struggle against dictators congressional caucus, and I  hope there will be many who will join us. Let us keep our voices alive.   I rise again to support H. Con. Res. 7. I thank the gentleman from  New York for his leadership, and I thank the sponsors of this  legislation for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 7, a resolution that  commends the bravery, courage, and resolve of the women and men of Iran  protesting and speaking out against the Iranian Regime's human rights  abuses.   As a long-time advocate and fighter for justice and equality, I am  inspired by the millions of Iranians that are putting their lives on  the line day after day in hopes that one day they will live in a  country that values justice, freedom, and the rule of law.   The U.S. Department of State cites Iran for a wide range of human  rights violations; among them injustices such as arbitrary arrest,  torture, and unjust executions.   I remember the attack on Iranian refugees at Camp Ashraf by Iraqi  soldiers on April 3, 2011.   Camp Ashraf was the home to more than 3,000 members of the People's  Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), an opposition group against the  Iranian regime.   I went to Camp Ashraf in solidarity and support of the democracy and  freedom loving Iranian people and that support continues to this day.   In July 2019, I penned a letter to President Maryam Rajavi to  commemorate the occasion of the Annual Gathering for a Free Iran and to  extend my heartfelt congratulations on her election.   I expressed my support for her 10-Point Plan for the future of Iran,  which ensures freedom of parties and assembly, an abolition of the  death penalty, a separation of church and state, gender equality and  several other promising policy positions that will thrust Iran into the  future.   Under President Maryam Rajavi's leadership, women have risen to hold  pivotal positions in the Iranian Resistance.   Iranian women will be the engine for change in Iran.   The uprising in Iran started with the murder of Mahsa Amini, a 22- year-old woman arrested by morality police in Tehran on September 13,  2022, for allegedly violating Iran's strict rules requiring women to  cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf.   Since the day of Mahsa Amini's funeral, women, men, and children have  taken to the streets, risking their lives for a free and democratic  Iran.   It is estimated that since the start of the protests in September,  over 500 protesters have been killed, and thousands more arrested.   To all the Iranian women, men, children, and protestors who are  leading the fight, I say loud and clear that I stand with you. America  stands with you.   I am proud to support the women of Iran, the youth, and the brave men  and women who are struggling to make these freedoms possible for the  people of their nation.   Let us continue to foster U.S.-Iran friendship and collaboration as  we work together to advance the universal rights of all humans,  including basic respect for human rights and the rule of law.   The mountaintop of justice for women, for men, for children and for  all Iran is on the horizon.   I will always champion global democracy, stand against human rights  violations, and never shy away from speaking truth to power in the  presence of oppression.   That is why I encourage my colleagues to work toward putting human  rights at the center of America's diplomacy by supporting H. Con. Res.  7.   Together, we will put an end to the indiscriminate violation of human  rights in Iran.
