 I want to thank my colleague and friend, the Democratic  leader, Senator Schumer, for raising the issues of immigration.   We are at a moment in the history of this country that I am sure will  be reviewed and reflected upon for many generations to come. Decisions  that are being made in the White House today in the area of immigration  will be criticized, analyzed, and in many cases repudiated in years to  come. It is time for us, at this moment, to have a sober reflection on  what this administration has done in 2\1/2\ years with the issue of  immigration and where we stand at this very moment.   This President came to the White House promising he was going to get  tough on immigration--immigration. Probably at the heart of America,  more than anything, has been the issue of immigration. We are a nation  of immigrants. My mother was an immigrant to this country.   I believe the diversity of our Nation is one of our core strengths  because we have attracted people from all over the world. This  President doesn't understand it. If he does, he is not pushing policies  that show any reflection on that reality and that historic background.  [[Page S4786]]    Think of how this administration started. Within hours after this  President was elected, he announced the Muslim travel ban; that he  would single out countries with Muslim-majority populations and say  that their people were not welcome in the United States. The reaction  was immediate across the United States. In the city of Chicago, I can  remember the supporters of those coming from other countries heading  out to O'Hare and attorneys volunteering to give them counsel. There  was an outpouring of support for these people, realizing that  fundamentally innocent people were traveling to this country. Yet the  President, with his travel ban, made it clear from the very start of  his administration his view on these immigrants.   What followed from there was a decision by this administration to  eliminate temporary protective status. Three hundred thousand  immigrants in this country came here because of natural disasters and  political upheaval and got protection in the United States. The  President wanted to turn them away. Was there any measurement as to  which ones might be dangerous? No. All would be turned away.   Then, of course, there was the President's decision to eliminate the  DACA Program. The DACA Program was created by President Obama. These  people were brought to the United States as children because of  decisions by their parents. They grew up in this country, and every day  in classrooms they pledged allegiance to that flag, believing it was  their flag too. At some point in their lives, they learned they were  undocumented. They didn't have legal status in America. President Obama  felt--and I, as a sponsor of the Dream Act, agreed with and encouraged  the creation by Executive order of the DACA Program. So 790,000 of  these young people came forward, paid a filing fee, went through a  criminal background check, and after they were approved, they were  given 2 years to stay in the United States, renewable, where they  couldn't be deported, and they could work legally in this country. That  program, as I said, attracted 790,000 successful applicants, many of  them outstanding students and amazing young people. I told their  stories on the floor of the Senate. President Trump decided to abolish  that program and to end the protection for these young people--790,000  of them.   That wasn't the end of it. The President continued with policies such  as zero tolerance. Do you remember that one? Last year, the Attorney  General of the United States stood up and quoted from the Bible as to  how it was the right thing to do to separate 2,880 infants, toddlers,  and children from their parents at our borders. Zero tolerance; treat  the parents like criminals and separate the kids.   What was worse was that no effort was made to track those children as  to where they were placed and what happened to their parents. It wasn't  until a Federal judge in Southern California came forward and forced  this administration to finally match up the children with their parents  that the effort was undertaken, and still more than 100 of them were  never matched--lost in the bureaucratic sea of the Trump  administration. That wasn't the end of it by far.   What we have seen at the border in the last several months has been  shocking and unprecedented in American history. This ``get tough''  President, who says he is going to cut off foreign aid to countries in  Central America and get tough at the border with his almighty wall, has  ended up attracting larger numbers of people who are presenting  themselves for asylum status at the border of the United States than we  have ever seen--dramatic increases we haven't seen for decades with  regard to the number of people at the border. The President's  immigration policy has backfired.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an  additional 2 minutes.    The net result of this has been the announcement by the  administration that, come Sunday, we will see mass arrests and  deportations in this country. Reports from the New York Times are that  thousands will be rounded up, arrested, and deported. When possible,  they say, family members will be arrested together and will be held in  family detention centers.   Have these people committed crimes since they have been in the United  States? There is no evidence of it. It is simply the fact that they are  undocumented at this moment, and many of them may have lived here for  years. These arrests and mass deportations are going to create fear in  communities across the United States, including in the city of Chicago,  which I am honored to represent. For what? It will not make America  safer for us if we deport these people. Sadly, it is going to mean that  their families will be torn apart and that there will be more children  and families in detention.   We were told there was a humanitarian crisis and that we needed to  apply ourselves and make certain that we had billions of dollars to  deal with it, and we did. Now the administration has turned around and  announced a new wave of splitting up families and deporting them from  the United States. This is not what America is all about. There is a  way for us to deal with immigration in a sensible, thoughtful, rational  way. Cruelty has no place in the history of this country, and it has no  place when it comes to the treatment of those who are in the United  States today.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from New York  (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the  Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Heinrich), the Senator from Vermont (Mr.  Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from New York  (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the  Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Heinrich), the Senator from Vermont (Mr.  Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for votes Nos.  202 and 203. Had I been present, I would have voted nay on the motion  to invoke cloture on the nomination of Peter C. Wright to be Assistant  Administrator, Office of Solid Waste, Environmental Protection Agency.  I would have also voted nay on confirmation of the Wright nomination.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
