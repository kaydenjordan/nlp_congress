 Madam Speaker, I rise today in the House to recognize and  congratulate Metamora High School head football coach Pat Ryan, who has  announced his retirement after 30 years at the helm of the program.   Over his 30-year tenure, Coach Ryan has led the Redbirds to seven  championship games and two State titles. He retires with a record of  268-76, and a spot in the Illinois High School Football Hall of Fame.   Coach Ryan's greatness is known across central Illinois. His players  love him. His students love him. Even his rivals love him, or at least  love competing against him.   Not only is Coach Ryan a legend on the field, but his success off the  field in modeling young men is unrivaled and unmatched. Coach Ryan  coached thousands of students and left a profound impact on the lives  of countless players. Many of his former players have become educators  and coaches themselves and attribute their career paths to Coach Ryan's  positive influence on their lives.   Congrats to Coach Ryan on his legendary career, both on and off the  field. He has made our central Illinois community a better place, and  he will be missed on Friday nights. I congratulate him on his Hall of  Fame career.   Go Redbirds.                            ____________________
