 Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize an important  anniversary for a cutting-edge research center located in my district.  For more than 20 years, the National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center at  Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville has been a pillar in the  biotechnology industry and a leading research institution in the United  States.   Born in the research title of the 1996 farm bill, with a $14 million  Federal appropriation the following year, NCERC has been a good  investment not just in my district, but in the broader bioeconomy in  America.   NCERC's work has culminated in more than 80 technologies that are now  in the commercial marketplace, generating over $7 billion of annual  revenue and thousands of direct and indirect jobs.  [[Page H5861]]    With a return on investment of $5.40 for every dollar of public  funding received, NCERC leverages every investment to create public- private partnerships that make a cleaner, low carbon, more sustainable  future a reality.   Mr. Speaker, I hope everyone will join me in celebrating the National  Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center.                            ____________________
