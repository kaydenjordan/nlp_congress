 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be up  to 20 minutes of debate, equally divided, under the control of Senators  McCain and Reed, following the first vote this evening.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
