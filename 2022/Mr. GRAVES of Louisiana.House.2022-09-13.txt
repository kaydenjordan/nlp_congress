 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5315 is bipartisan legislation that addresses  problems we have seen in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, we had a bridge collapse in Minnesota; we had a bridge  collapse in Georgia; and, more recently, right on the Tennessee- Arkansas line on the interstate, we saw a bridge collapse.   All of these accidents that resulted in deaths and injuries and  incredible impacts to traffic, they could have been prevented. They  could have been prevented by lowering the threshold by doing safety  inspections to critical infrastructure, like bridges; and this  legislation helps to facilitate that.   Mr. Speaker, over 90 percent of the drones that were flown in the  United States used to be foreign-made, in fact, from China. This  legislation not only helps to facilitate the incorporation of drone  inspection, which is cheaper, it is more thorough, it is more easily  accessible, and it lowers the threshold to safety inspections. It  doesn't put workers at risk. But it also ensures that we continue  making progress on this domestic drone industry and no longer cede this  leadership role to China.   This bill ensures that this is a domestic industry, U.S. technology,  American jobs. And as the gentlewoman just said, this legislation also  ensures that we have the workforce able to do this.   This bill is for 2 years. It is not designed to be in perpetuity. It  is 2 years. It is helping to seed this industry; helping to incorporate  this technology into our State DOTs, into our programs related to  utilities and transmission lines, and even in the aftermath of  disasters which, unfortunately, in my home State of Louisiana, we often  experience.   I thank my friend for working with us on a bipartisan basis on this  legislation, the gentleman from Arizona, the sponsor of this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 884, the National Aviation Preparedness Plan Act,  responds to a 2015 Government Accountability Office recommendation and  looks to establish clear roles and responsibilities among Federal  agencies and air transportation operators in the event of a  communicable disease outbreak.   I want to be clear that this bill only applies to future disease  outbreaks, and it is intended to guarantee that the confusion we have  seen among Federal agencies and air carrier operators is addressed and  does not repeat itself as we saw in the past few years.   America's aviation sector is absolutely critical to our economy. It  is critical to moving travelers for business, travelers to visit  family, and for tourism purposes. Goods must be transported all across  the United States and the globe.   We have to make sure that we are able to limit, contain, and reduce  the impact of these disease outbreaks in a timely, decisive, and  coordinated manner.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Larsen and Chairman DeFazio for working  on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, again, I reiterate that this bill is only for future  outbreaks. It only applies to future communicable disease outbreaks.  What is more, it grants no additional pandemic-related authority to  Federal agencies. It simply ensures there is a plan in place among U.S.  carriers so they can develop a timely and decisive response plan in the  event of a future outbreak.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5774 is designed to do two primary things. Number  one, it is to prevent the Federal Government from revictimizing  disaster victims. Number two, it is designed to save money.   In the aftermath of a disaster, we watch as countless Federal  agencies, the alphabet soup of Federal agencies, come rushing to the  aid of these disaster victims, offering everything from food  assistance, housing assistance, and you will see them having  organizations coming in and offering clothes, offering loans. You see  all of these uncoordinated activities.   Yet, we have one Federal agency that is responsible for disasters,  and that is FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA comes  in, and what happens with all of these other programs? You see  disjointed responses.   Let me give you an example, Mr. Speaker. In the aftermath of the 2016  1,000-year flood that we had in my hometown, FEMA came in and started  offering assistance. We saw disparate aid offered to different folks.   You had another recovery program come in and provide $1.7 billion,  Mr. Speaker. Here we are, 6 years after this disaster, and of the $1.7  billion, less than $700 million has actually been granted to flood  victims, granted to disaster victims.   Mr. Speaker, I know your home State of Texas got pounded by Hurricane  Harvey, some areas experiencing 42 inches of rain in 36 hours.   You have recovery and assistance programs that are disjointed among  the Federal agencies. They cause a bureaucracy. They actually  revictimize these people who have lost everything in these disasters.   This is designed to get recovery dollars where they are needed, to  expedite recovery, to save money because you are saving funds that are  being spent on long-term shelters; saving funds that are being spent,  in some cases, approaching $300,000 to provide a trailer for someone to  temporarily live in; saving money, again, on hotel rooms and getting  people back in their homes faster.   We still have people from our disaster 6 years ago who have homes  that have been mucked and gutted, stripped down to the studs, without  any additional recovery because they can't connect the dots.   So, as the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia said, this is  designed to, within 30 days of a disaster, estimate the impacts and  provide an initial payment to where States and local governments can  lead the charge in directing and prioritizing recovery dollars where  they need to go. This, importantly, has a 5 percent administrative cap.   Mr. Speaker, 2 years after the disaster I mentioned in my home State,  we had more money that was paid to the program managers 2 years later  than we had actually given to the disaster victims. These programs  aren't designed to enrich contractors, to enrich program managers, to  enrich people that are running these programs. These dollars are  designed by Congress to get to the victims, to expedite recovery, to  allow for the community and the economy to recover as quickly as  possible.   I want to be very clear. My cosponsor, the cosponsor who worked very  closely with us on this legislation, Congresswoman Plaskett from the  Virgin Islands, who in 2018 was incredibly affected by Hurricanes Irma  and Maria, hosted us down there to see the devastation. Years later,  again, she still has her constituents that are adversely impacted,  unable to recover, and requiring additional Federal funds.   Mr. Speaker, I want to be very clear: This legislation is intended to  reduce the expenditure of Federal funds. It is designed to expedite  recovery. It is designed to cap the bureaucracy and ensure no more than  5 percent of these funds are actually going to program management.   That way, the dollars can get immediately to the disaster victims, so  we stop seeing years and years of Federal Government dollars being  shelled out for temporary housing and temporary recovery efforts. We  need long-term recovery. We need our economy restored. We need our  communities restored.   There are two types of Members who are in this House: people who have  been through disasters, like the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands  and I, and those that will. Those that will are going to want to ensure  that they have supported legislation like this designed to reform, to  modernize, to apply lessons learned from disasters and make sure that  we are treating these victims  [[Page H7755]]  as true priorities, that we have Federal programs that reflect the  urgency of the situation that they are in when their homes have been  destroyed, when they have lost their vehicles, lost their clothes, lost  their possessions, lost all of these family heirlooms, making sure that  we are able to restore that family back in their community and,  importantly, get the economies restored again as quickly as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1468, as the gentlewoman from the District of  Columbia indicated, helps to restore the SEC's leasing authority back  to the confines of the General Services Administration. It ensures that  we have a uniform approach to leasing space in Federal agencies.   I thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia for her  perseverance on this bill. I know this has been a priority of hers for  a very long period of time. But I want to give you a little bit of  background.   In 2012, the SEC leased approximately 1.4 million square feet of  office space for $566 million. I want to say that again. The SEC leased  1.4 million square feet of office space for $566 million, in violation  of the law. They exceeded their authority when they entered into this  lease.   When there was Republican leadership, there was an investigation that  the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure did over the SEC's  actions. The SEC Inspector General similarly commissioned an  investigation.   The conclusion of these investigations found that not only did the  Securities and Exchange Commission exceed their authority in that  lease, but this was a trend. They had a history of mismanagement of  their leasing authority.    Unfortunately, recent actions by the SEC during the GSA's procurement  of leased space for the SEC indicates that they may be returning back  to their old ways.   I want to say again, I commend the gentlewoman from the District of  Columbia, ensuring that we have a uniform approach, ensuring that  taxpayer dollars are being managed in a way that we can all be proud  of, respecting the people who have worked hard for those dollars, and  we don't need to be mismanaging them.   The bill will ensure that the Securities and Exchange Commission,  like other Federal agencies, uses the GSA, the General Services  Administration, for its space needs and provide more safeguards for  taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the legislation, and reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   In closing, H.R. 1468 will better protect taxpayer money by ensuring  the SEC works with the General Services Administration on leasing to  improve oversight, reduce costs, and minimize Antideficiency Act  violations in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
