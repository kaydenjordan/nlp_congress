 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment,  striking language that would effectively allow unlimited use of  additional contingency funding for SNAP.   As I stated in my Rules testimony yesterday, when it comes to SNAP,  this administration chose the playbook of the Center on Budget and  Policy Priorities to create a food stamp free-for-all.   Recently, the CBPP wrote a piece that said: ``For other appropriated  entitlements, policymakers have a simple way to protect against  inadequate annual funding: by providing uncapped appropriations for the  last quarter of the fiscal year to fulfill the requirements of the  underlying law governing the program in question.'' In other words,  let's hit continue on one of the biggest welfare expansions in U.S.  history.   The administration and the majority are taking the advice of a multi- million-dollar organization and its leadership that thrives on creating  dependency and making a lot of money by doing so.   This slush fund of contingency money that I am talking about today  has the potential to exceed $17 billion with unanticipated costs listed  as the only parameter for spending. I can only guess what will, in  fact, be labeled as an unanticipated cost.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment, start  supporting solutions to end dependence, and help get people back to  work.
