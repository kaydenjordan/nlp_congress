 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R.  494, the Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Program  Reauthorization Act of 2019.   We cannot, as a nation, continue to condemn our children into the  criminal justice system. African American youth are significantly more  likely to be tried as adults. In 2014, although Black youth were only  14 percent of the juvenile population, they represented 52 percent of  the youth tried as adults in this country.   This legislation reauthorizes important programs that ensure  sentences for our young people are appropriate and not excessive, and  it funds accountability-based programs to intervene when youth are most  vulnerable in the system. I support this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
