 Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of  the majority leader the schedule for next week. I yield to my friend,  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), to talk about the schedule for  next week.                                time  1815     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that update. As  it relates to tomorrow's schedule, as the gentleman from Maryland said,  it could be fluid, depending on how the CR is processed in the Senate.  If the CR does not pass the Senate tonight, are there bills that are  specifically designated to come up tomorrow, or is that a to-be- determined issue?    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that update.   As it relates to the debt ceiling, we had a discussion a few weeks  ago relating to the debt ceiling. Would there be a bipartisan  negotiation? We haven't had that so far. Is there anticipation that  there would be a plan to try to engage both sides in a negotiation on  the debt ceiling, or is this something that we are just going to have  to wait to see next week?    Well, then we will see what develops from that  discussion.   As it relates to the National Defense Authorization Act, and as the  gentleman pointed out, we are aware there are bipartisan negotiations  between both the House and Senate, Republicans and Democrats.   I share the hope and expectation that they can come to an agreement.  There are a few final details that both sides are trying to work out. I  think they have already agreed, which we both share, that our troops  deserve a pay raise, need a pay raise, and that number has been agreed  to.   Hopefully, that is part of this, as well as the proper funding levels  for our Nation's defense as we see threats emerging throughout the  world. We also know the detriment of not having proper defense funding  because they can't enter into the contracts that are necessary.   Both of those conversations seem to be, from what we are hearing,  going well. Hopefully, that is a bill that can come to the floor next  week, and we can all come together to help pass that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman for any comments.    Madam Speaker, there are two specific pieces of  legislation I would like to ask the gentleman to look at.   One is, by the end of the year, as you know, there are some potential  cuts coming to entities like Medicare if Congress doesn't take action.  There is a bipartisan bill that members of the Doctors Caucus and other  members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and other committees of  jurisdiction have worked on. It is H.R. 6020. That would stave off  those cuts to our healthcare providers.   It would need to be passed by the end of the year--otherwise, those  cuts would automatically kick in--if the gentleman could take a look at  that bill and see if that is something we could do in a bipartisan way  before we leave for the year.   Another would be, you and I have had this conversation successfully  on other legislation dealing with ALS. The Steve Gleason Act was one of  those; there are others. I have spoken to Steve Gleason recently. There  is a piece of legislation that we were able to work on that got out of  the Committee on Energy and Commerce unanimously. It is H.R. 3537, the  Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act.   I would just ask if the gentleman could look at that bill. It came  out unanimously, bipartisan, from the Committee on Energy and Commerce,  and it is something that, obviously, would help a lot of people who  could use that help.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Well, that would be great news to so many people across  the country.    I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I share that sentiment the gentleman had,  and hopefully, we can achieve those bipartisan victories.   As you mentioned, H.R. 3537 would be a tremendous victory for people  who struggle with ALS to continue to seek out new therapies and be able  to live their lives in the best way possible. I appreciate the  gentleman's past efforts as well as the offer to bring that bill to the  floor next week.   Madam Speaker, if the gentleman doesn't have anything else, I thank  the gentleman, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
