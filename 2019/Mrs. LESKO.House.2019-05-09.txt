 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which requires  appropriate medical care for babies who survive abortion procedures and  imposes strong criminal penalties for failure to provide such care, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, if this unanimous consent request cannot  be entertained, I urge the Speaker and the majority leader to  immediately schedule the born-alive bill, so we can stand up and  protect the sanctity of human life.
