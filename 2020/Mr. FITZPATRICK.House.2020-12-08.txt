 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  incredible service of two very special Members of this Chamber who are  retiring after this term, Will Hurd of Texas and Tulsi Gabbard of  Hawaii.   Will Hurd is a native son of San Antonio, Texas, and a graduate of  Texas A&M University, where he was a student body president and  graduated with a degree in computer science and international  relations.   After graduation, Will spent 9 years working and serving our country  for the CIA. While primarily based here in Washington, D.C., Will was  also stationed overseas in Afghanistan and Pakistan and India. And  while in Pakistan, Will worked undercover and became fluent in the  native language.   In the CIA, Will worked to keep our national security safe, thwarting  terrorism across the globe, and putting nuclear weapons proliferators  out of business. Part of his responsibilities in Washington was to  brief Members of Congress here on the Hill on intelligence and national  security issues, which undoubtedly sparked his interest in politics.    During his time in Congress, Will has been a leading Member on  cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, immigration, and tech issues.  He worked incredibly hard to ensure that the Department of Homeland  Security is able to work efficiently and effectively, modernize our  immigration system, and speak on the need to stay ahead of our  adversaries in cybersecurity and technology.   Also a colleague of ours, Tulsi Gabbard was born in American Samoa  and was raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. A graduate of Hawai'i Pacific  University, Tulsi was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives at  age 21, the youngest legislator ever elected in the State.   A year into her service, she enlisted in the Hawaii Army National  Guard and volunteered to deploy with her fellow soldiers in 2004. She  went on two tours of duty in the Middle East, first in Iraq and later  in Kuwait, and is currently serving as a major in the Army Reserves.   In between her tours of duty, Tulsi served as a legislative aide to  the late Senator Daniel Akaka of Hawaii. During her time with the  Senator, she worked on issues related to energy, Homeland Security, the  environment, and veterans. During this time, Tulsi graduated from  Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy, where she was  the first woman to finish as a distinguished honor graduate.   During Tulsi's time in Congress, she has been a fierce advocate for  veterans, servicemembers, and their families. She has worked to make  their lives easier and to ensure that Congress never forgets the women  and men who sacrificed for our freedoms.   Mr. Speaker, Will and Tulsi have been two amazing Members of this  institution. I served with Will on the Homeland Security Committee, and  I served with Tulsi on the Foreign Affairs Committee. This Chamber and  our Nation are better off because they chose to serve in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, both Will and Tulsi caucus with different parties in  this Chamber, but they share an awful lot in common:   They are both people of class;   They are both people of honor and dignity;   They both put their life on the line in service of our Nation;   They both are independent thinkers;   They are both people of incredible courage;   They are both people of intellectual honesty;   They are both leaders whom I respect and look up to, both before I  was in Congress and certainly now.   They are two people who served this institution well, who made our  Nation proud, and I have no doubt that their time serving our Nation is  not at an end.   Mr. Speaker, I thank them both for their service, for their courage,  for their sacrifice, for being intellectual leaders, thought leaders,  being honest, staying true to their convictions, and putting their  country ahead of their party every single day of their lives. I  appreciate their service, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Dakota  (Mr. Armstrong) for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as my friend, David Cicilline, just alluded to, we have  no higher responsibility than to protect our children.   Cyberstalking is a serious crime that needs to be met with stricter  penalties and more cooperation amongst law enforcement agencies,  including my friends and colleagues in my former agency, the FBI.   The Office of Women's Health defines stalking as repeated contact  that makes one feel afraid or harassed. Each year, this crime affects  an estimated 7.5 million people, including many children.   Stalking disproportionately impacts women. Stalking victims are 50  percent more likely to be female, and according to the CDC, one in six  women has experienced some form of stalking in their lifetime.   Mr. Speaker, my Combat Online Predators Act ensures that not only are  we increasing penalties for these crimes, but we are also requiring  Federal law enforcement officials to evaluate and update practices to  combat this online harassment.   This bill provides enhanced criminal penalties for stalkers under  title 18, section 2261, by up to 5 years if the victim is a minor.   Moreover, the legislation calls for the Attorney General and the  Department of Justice to produce an evaluation of Federal, State, and  local efforts to enforce laws relating to stalking and to identify and  describe elements of these enforcement efforts that constitute best  practices across the United States.   Moreover, Mr. Speaker, this legislation was inspired by the story of  a family in my district in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the Zezzo  family, whose teenage daughter, at the age of just 13 years old, was  cyberstalked by a friend's father through social media.  [[Page H7013]]    Despite the stalking being sexual in nature, the then 51-year-old  stalker pleaded guilty only to a misdemeanor stalking charge and was  sentenced to probation and counseling.   Three years later, in 2016, this very same stalker began making  contact again. Hiding behind social media, the predator created a  perverted library of over 15,000 posts detailing his warped vision to  marry her and his insistence that no one could ever stop him from being  with her.   Thankfully, Mr. Speaker, following a sting operation by our hero law  enforcement officers, local police arrested him and sentenced him to  between 18 months and 7 years in State prison.   Sitting with the Zezzo family, I saw the pain in their eyes. After  hearing the disturbing story of cyberstalking endured by this young  girl and her family for years, the pain that they have endured for  years and still endure to this day, I knew that something had to be  done.   My Combat Online Predators Act is the first step in making the  internet a safer environment for all users, especially young Americans,  and this step cannot come soon enough.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cicilline and members of the committee. I  thank the Zezzo family, particularly Madison and Erin Zezzo, for their  advocacy in this incredibly important issue. They have turned their  unspeakable pain into action and provided a voice for all cyberstalking  victims across this country, especially our young victims and our  children.   We will continue to fight for justice for all victims.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Representative Stephanie Murphy, my partner  in this legislation, and Senator Pat Toomey and Senator Bob Casey from  my home State of Pennsylvania, all of whom had a part to play in this.   Mr. Speaker, we must do everything we can to forcefully respond to  egregious instances of stalking and cyberstalking, especially when  committed against the most vulnerable among us.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  Combat Online Predators Act.
