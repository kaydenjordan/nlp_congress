 Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the Senate  trial and the factors I have considered in making my decision on the  Articles of Impeachment from the House. I have now read hundreds of  pages of legal briefs and memos, including the testimony of 17  witnesses. Here, on the Senate floor, I have reviewed more than 190  witness videos and listened carefully to more than 65 hours of detailed  presentations from both the House managers and from the President's  legal team.   As cofounder and cochair of the Ukraine Caucus and someone who is  proud to represent many Ukrainian Americans in Ohio, I have been active  for the past several years in helping Ukraine as it has sought freedom  and independence since the 2014 Revolution of Dignity that saw the  corrupt Russian-backed government of Viktor Yanukovych replaced with  pro-Western elected leaders.   Since first seeing the transcript of the phone call between President  Trump and President Zelensky 4 months ago, I have consistently said  that the President asking Ukraine for an investigation into Joe Biden  was inappropriate and wrong. I have also said, since then, that any  actions taken by members of the administration or those outside the  administration to try to delay military assistance or a White House  meeting pending an investigation by Ukraine were not appropriate  either.   But while I don't condone this behavior, these actions do not rise to  the level of removing President Trump from office and taking him off  the ballot in a Presidential election year that is already well under  way.   I first looked to the fact that the Founders meant for impeachment of  a President to be extremely rare, reserved for only ``Treason, Bribery,  or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Any fair reading of what the  Founders meant in the Constitution and in the Federalist papers in the  context of history and just plain common sense makes it clear that  removing a duly elected President demands that those arguing for  conviction meet a high standard.   As an example, for good reason there has never been a Presidential  impeachment that didn't allege a crime. In the Clinton impeachment, the  independent counsel concluded that President Clinton committed not one  but two crimes. In this case, no crime is alleged. Let me repeat. In  the two Articles of Impeachment that came over to us from the House,  there is no criminal law violation alleged. Although I don't think that  that is always necessary--there could be circumstances where a crime  isn't necessary in an impeachment--without a crime, it is even a higher  bar for those who advocate for a conviction, and that high bar is not  met here.   What is more, even though it was delayed, the President ultimately  did provide the needed military assistance to Ukraine, and he provided  it before the September 30 budget deadline, and the requested  investigations by Ukraine were not undertaken. It is an important point  to make. The aid went. The investigations did not occur.   The military assistance is particularly important to me as a strong  supporter of Ukraine. In fact, I was one of those Senators who fought  to give President Obama and his administration the authority to provide  badly needed lethal military assistance to Ukraine in response to the  Russian aggression that came right after the Revolution of Dignity in  2014.   I must say, I strongly urged the Obama administration to use that  authority, and, like Ukraine, I was deeply disappointed when they did  not. I strongly supported President Trump's decision to change course  and provide that assistance shortly after he came into office. While  visiting Ukrainian troops on the frontlines in the Donbas region of  Ukraine, I have seen firsthand how much those soldiers need the  military assistance President Trump alone has provided.   Beyond whether the President's conduct met the high bar of  impeachment, there is also the underlying issue of the legitimacy of  the House impeachment process. The House Democrats sent the Senate a  flawed case built on what respected George Washington University  constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley calls ``the shortest  proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the narrowest  grounds ever used to impeach a President.''   Instead of using the tools available to compel the administration to  produce documents and witnesses, the House followed a self-imposed and  entirely political deadline for voting on the Articles of Impeachment  before Christmas. After the rushed vote, the House then inexplicably  stalled, keeping those articles from being delivered here in the Senate  for 28 days, time they could have used to subpoena witnesses and  resolve legitimate disagreements about whether evidence was privileged  or not. They didn't even bother to subpoena witnesses they then wanted  the Senate to subpoena for them.    The House process was also lacking in fundamental fairness and due  process in a number of respects. It is incomprehensible to me that the  President's counsel did not have the opportunity to cross-examine fact  witnesses and that the House selectively leaked deposition testimony  from closed-door sessions.   Rushing an impeachment case through the House without due process and  giving the Senate a half-baked case to finish sets a very dangerous  precedent. If the Senate were to convict, it would send the wrong  message and risk making this kind of quick, partisan impeachment in the  House a regular occurrence moving forward. That would be terrible for  the country.   Less than a year ago, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: ``Impeachment is so  divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and  overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that  path.'' She was right.   It is better to let the people decide. Early voting has already  started in some States, and the Iowa caucuses occurred last night.  Armed with all the  [[Page S845]]  information, we should let the voters have their say at the ballot box.   During the last impeachment 21 years ago, now-House Manager  Congressman Jerry Nadler said:         There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an       impeachment substantially supported by one of our major       political parties and largely opposed by the other. Such an       impeachment would lack legitimacy.    In this case, the impeachment wasn't just ``substantially supported''  by Democrats; it was only supported by Democrats. In fact, a few  Democrats actually voted with all the Republicans to oppose the  impeachment.   Founder Alexander Hamilton feared that impeachment could easily fall  prey to partisan politics. That is exactly what happened here with the  only purely partisan impeachment in the history of our great country.  For all of these reasons, I am voting against the Articles of  Impeachment tomorrow.   It is time to move on and to move on to focus on bipartisan  legislation to help the families whom we represent. Unlike the House,  the Senate is blocked from conducting its regular business during  impeachment.   My colleague from New Jersey asked a moment ago, how do we heal? How  do we heal the wounds? Our country is divided, and I think the  impeachment has further divided an already polarized country. I think  we heal, in part, by surprising the people and coming out from our  partisan corners and getting stuff done--stuff that they care about  that affects the families we were sent here to represent.   While in the impeachment trial, we were prevented from doing the  important legislative work our constituents expect, like passing  legislation to lower prescription drug costs, like rebuilding our  crumbling roads and bridges, like addressing the new addiction crisis-- the combination of synthetic opioids like fentanyl and crystal meth,  pure crystal meth coming from Mexico. It is an opportunity for us to  strengthen our economy with better skills training, including passing  legislation to give workers the skills they need to meet the jobs that  are out there. Those are just a few ideas that are ready to go--ideas  the President supports, Republicans support, and Democrats support.   I have been working on bipartisan initiatives like the JOBS Act to  provide that needed skills training, the Restore Our Parks Act to deal  with the infrastructure that is crumbling in our national parks, the  Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, which promotes  energy efficiency--something we should be able to agree on across the  aisle. All of these have been sitting idle this year as we have  grappled with impeachment.   How do we heal? How do we heal the wounds? In part, let's do it by  working together to pass legislation people care about.   Back home, I have seen that the impeachment process has, indeed,  further divided an already polarized country. A conviction in the  Senate, removing Donald Trump from office and taking his name off the  ballot, would dangerously deepen that growing rift. That is one reason  I am glad we are not likely to see a conviction because I do care about  our country and bringing it together.   Instead, my hope is that lessons have been learned; that we can heal  some wounds for the sake of the country; that we can turn to the  bipartisan work most Americans expect us to do; and that we can allow  American voters, exercising the most important constitutional check and  balance of all, to have their say in this year's Presidential election.  I believe this is what the Constitution requires and what the country  needs.   I yield back my time.
