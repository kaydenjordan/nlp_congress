 Mr. President, I often come to the floor of the Senate  to talk about one particular item as I want to be able to walk through  what we are going to do to be able to solve it.   Honestly, today, it is a little different for me. In some ways, I  feel a little bit like Will Rogers with his statement, the famous  Oklahoman, who said that all I really know is what I learned from  reading the newspapers, which is an alibi for my ignorance.   Today, I want to just be able to talk about random stories that I  have read lately that are kind of in the ``you can't make this stuff  up'' column. It has been frustrating for me.   Right now, 7 in 10 Americans feel like America is on the wrong  track--7 in 10. I mean, I don't know why, but they just feel like  something is not going right, like things are out of control. It has  been frustrating to me to be able to go through so many news stories  lately and to be able to say: If I put this in front of 7 in 10 or  maybe 9 in 10 Americans, they would say, ``Why are we doing this as a  nation?''   Now, I understand a lot of the issues we face are complicated. Yet,  quite frankly, some of these issues are not complicated; they are  common sense; they become political only in this city. But for most of  America, it is just not that complicated. Sometimes I just get  frustrated with the language and the things that are coming out of not  just the administration but with the things that are happening in our  Federal Government right now that, I think, just need to be called out  and for us to say: Let's as a Senate sit down and talk about some of  these complicated issues. Instead of knee-jerk political reactions,  let's try to solve some of these hard things because we are currently  talking about it, and things are going sideways instead of things being  solved.   Over the past 5 days, we have watched the collapse of the Silicon  Valley Bank and Signature Bank--a big bank in San Francisco and a much  smaller bank in New York. For both of them, we have now had the FDIC  step in, and they are going to save every single person in the bank and  make sure they are whole. Now, that is very different than cyclical.  Most Americans know you are insured up to $250,000, but the Biden  administration stepped in and said: Oh, no. Everyone is going to be  kept 100-percent whole.   The comment that has come out of it has been: Well, we are going to  make sure no taxpayers have to be able to cover this bill. Then, if you  listen closely, the very next statement is that it is going to come  from an assessment on the banks instead.   Let me tell you what that means.   As one of the wealthiest banks in America, which has mostly  millionaires who actually bank there--in fact, to show that, for 90  percent of the depositors in Silicon Valley Bank, their deposits exceed  $250,000--OK?--90 percent. That is not normal for a bank. For that bank  in San Francisco, all of their depositors are going to be bailed out,  and the way that they are going to be bailed out is they are going to  put a special--what they are calling--assessment on banks across the  country.   So let me tell you what is happening in the next few months.  [[Page S759]]    Banks in Oklahoma, in rural towns, are about to pay a special fee to  be able to bail out millionaires in San Francisco. Now, what Oklahoma  banks and bankers had to do with that bank failure in San Francisco I  have no idea, but the comments being made over and over again are that  no taxpayer is going to be affected by this. I am sure my bankers will  be glad to know that they don't pay taxes anymore, apparently, and I am  sure every person who banks there will be interested to know when their  bank fees go up and their interest rates go down so as to be able to  cover what happened in San Francisco.   Listen, I don't want to see a contagion of banks either, but let's be  honest. What is really happening is a backdoor tax increase on every  single American. They are just not using the IRS to do it. They are  using community banks to do it all over the country--to charge them a  quick higher fee, which they know will mean a higher fee to the people  who are members of their banks. That is how it is going to get covered  rather than the typical way this would get covered--by actually taking  that bank, actually doing an auction and auctioning it off to other  banks to be able to take it in.   I look at that and say: You can't make this stuff up, in some ways,  to be able to say no taxpayer is going to be affected, but quietly  taxpayers across the country are going to be affected by this.   Mr. President, I was surprised when I saw the President's budget come  out, when he said this is a new budget and a new way to be able to  reduce deficits, when the budget proposal he had was $6.8 trillion.  That is the spending number--$6.8 trillion. To put this in perspective,  in just 2019--4 years ago--the total spending for the Federal  Government was $4.4 trillion. That was the last year before COVID--$4.4  trillion. Now, post-COVID, the President's budget is $6.8 trillion in  new spending.   Mr. President, I visited with some folks on immigration recently, and  it was interesting. In January, the numbers went down a little bit for  illegal crossings, so the Department of Homeland Security immediately  put out ``numbers are down.'' Even before the month was done, the  numbers came out that the numbers were down in January. Now it is the  middle of March, and we can't seem to get the numbers for February  because the best guesstimates we have is that they have skyrocketed  back up again, so the DHS is no longer talking about it.   They have released a new proposal, though, to be able to expedite  individuals on asylum, to be able to get through under asylum here,  which is a good thing, by the way; but with their current structured  proposal, they will do about 500 people a month through this new asylum  process and procedures when we actually have 5,000 people a day  illegally crossing. So their new proposed answer is how to expedite  hearings for 500 people a month when the problem is 5,000 people a day.   In addition to that, the Biden administration just released a new set  of rules on what will constitute, as they say, ``violent crimes.''  These are individuals who are illegally present in the country who are  due to be deported. They are trying to redefine what ``violent crimes''  mean and who is eligible for deportation in the country. Part of what  they are redefining is, Who are sex offenders and how would you define  a ``sex offender'' and who would be guilty of that?   Can I just tell you? I won't find very many Americans who would say:  We only want part of the illegal sex offenders in the country. Yet the  Biden administration is quickly trying to redefine what equals a sex  offender and who actually has to be deported from that group.   Mr. President, I met with the Director of the FBI last week and had a  conversation about a memo that the FBI put out just a month ago, saying  that there is a threat of terrorism coming from traditional Catholics  and that they need to have further investigation.   To their credit, the FBI pulled that back quickly after they released  it, after the Director saw it, and the Director, unequivocally,  distanced himself from it. But why did that ever start in the first  place? Why was there an office in the FBI that considered traditional  Catholics to be a threat to the country?   In the Federal workforce--it was interesting--just about a month ago,  there was a big to-do. As a matter of fact, there were some here, even  in this room, who made a big to-do about how the IRS is doing so much  better. The literal statement was made: After we pass the Inflation  Reduction Act, the IRS now has a much higher percentage of answered  calls. And there was a celebration on the floor here.   Well, I have to tell you, that is a good thing to be able to answer  more calls because there have been millions of unanswered calls from  the IRS. So I went to check the data because so many people were saying  the percentage of calls answered is much higher than what it was last  year, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act. I went and pulled the data  on it to be able to look at it and to see what that was, just to be  able to check the facts.   Here are the actual facts: Half as many people called the IRS last  year as did the year before. In fact, the IRS actually answered 100,000  fewer calls than they did the year before. It is just that so many  millions of people stopped calling them, knowing that they are not  going to get an answer at all. The percentage looks better because  fewer people were trying, but the actual number of answered calls  actually went down. Literally, you can't make this stuff up. We need to  stop celebrating better percentage when the real facts are fewer calls  were actually answered by the IRS.   In the category of ``you can't make this up,'' the Office of  Personnel Management, who runs the Federal hiring process--I just wrote  a letter to them a few days ago because two of their leadership  individuals and senior management team are now going to need to be  fired because in their previous employment, they had credible  accusations of harassment. This is the office that is designed to be  able to oversee hiring in the Federal Government that failed to do  background checks on senior management they were hiring.   In the category of ``you can't make this stuff up'' in the Inflation  Reduction Act again, there was a lot of to-do about drug pricing and  them saying we are now going to control drug pricing. Here is what also  has occurred with that: Four drug manufacturers have now pulled new  cancer drugs from the American market. Just in the last 6 months, four  new cancer drugs have been pulled because they are saying they can't  make it work with the new Inflation Reduction Act law.   If I want to stack on top of the Inflation Reduction Act, there was a  huge section on green energy within the Inflation Reduction Act--which  is really what the act really was, was a new Green New Deal bill. There  was a huge section all about how we are going to do more energy  production, more battery production for electric batteries. The future  of green energy is going to be in America; and as the President said  over and over again, it is going to be made in America.   In fact, I sat in on the President's State of the Union Address, and  this is what the President said during the State of the Union Address.  The President said:         Folks, I know I have been criticized for saying this, but I       am not changing my view. We are going to make sure the supply       chain for America begins in America. The supply chain begins       in America.        So when we do these projects--and, again, I get criticized       about this, but I make no excuses for it--we are going to buy       American. We are going to buy American, folks. And it is       totally--it is totally consistent with international trade       rules. Buy American has been the law since 1933, but for too       long, past administrations--Democrat and Republican--have       fought to get around it but not anymore.    That is what the President said down the hall at the State of the  Union Address.   What has happened in the last 3 weeks? The President's team has  actually worked with Japan to create a false free-trade agreement  because there is an exception in the Inflation Reduction Act that if  you want to do green energy production, you have to do it in North  America or you have to have a free-trade agreement. We don't have that  FTA with Japan, so they are creating a type of FTA with Japan so Japan  can sell us batteries. So much for ``the previous administrations are  the ones that tried to work around that.''   I would love to say it is isolated, but they just did the same thing  with Germany, to create a workaround in the  [[Page S760]]  Inflation Reduction Act's MADE in America Act so that the MADE in  America Act and Produced in America Act will now also include Japan and  their production, will now also include Germany and their production.   May I just say to you, one of the largest new North American battery  manufacturers for EV just got moved to Canada, not the United States-- so much for ``past administrations have fought to get around it, but  not anymore.'' This administration is working around the MADE in  America, Buy American Act right now for green energy. Where did they  get their supplies and their critical minerals? It is not from the  United States; it is from China.   In the energy environment--while I am still talking through that as  well--the Willow Project has been talked about greatly with Alaska and  saying that now ConocoPhillips is going to be able to produce off three  platforms more oil coming from Alaska. That is good, by the way. We  have a steady supply of oil that can come for a very long time from  Alaska, and it has been blocked off over and over and over again, when  the law states that property is set aside for energy production.   But in the process, the Biden administration not only allowed three  platforms to start producing oil, but then they blocked off 3 million  new acres from production--3 million.   There was recently, in the United Arab Emirates, a set of meetings in  the Middle East dealing with the Abraham Accords. It is interesting,  when I am traveling around that absolutely beautiful country and  seeing the wealth that is there, I couldn't help but think, this is  what Alaska would look like if the Federal Government would actually  allow energy production there like there is energy production in the  UAE. But our Nation won't allow it. Instead, we are still buying from  other nations rather than allowing full production on our own. You  can't make this stuff up.    If you talk to a developer right now, they will tell you it is very  hard to develop new neighborhoods and new locations because they can't  get transformers, those little boxes that sit on the edges of  neighborhoods. Some of those are the transformers that are up high.  Those transformers have a 99.55 percent efficiency--99.55 percent  efficiency. I wish I had that layer of efficiency.   The Biden administration just put out new rules for those  transformers--that are very hard to get right now because they are  back-ordered--to add a 0.1 percent new energy efficiency requirement on  them. Remember, they are already 99.55 percent efficient. They want  them to be 99.65 percent efficient, so they are moving just that little  decimal right there. To do that, it is going to slow down production of  the transformers again--could be up to 16 months slower--and it will  increase the cost by hundreds of millions of dollars.   So when your electricity bill goes up and they are not able to  continue building an expansion, that is not the fault of your electric  company; that is the fault of your Federal Government right now so they  can brag about increasing production by 0.1 percent on something that  is already 99.55 percent efficient.   Put this on top of the Biden administration's new exploration to be  able to cut off gas stoves. They initially announced from two different  Agencies that they are going to try to end gas stoves in America and  then quickly pulled that back and only said: Oh, no, we are just going  to study gas stoves in America, and we are going to look at trying to  be able to shut those off in the future, but we are not going to do  that right now leading up to the election because there are millions  and millions of people who use gas stoves, which, by the way, have been  studied for years across the country.   This is not an issue about particulates in the house; this is an  issue about an administration that doesn't care about the cost to the  consumer, as long as they can say they got their way.   It is the same exact issue on the EPA's heavy-duty electric vehicle  emissions rule. That rule is rightly being addressed by my colleague  from Nebraska, who is going after a very simple thing that the EPA is  trying to be able to do in this Biden administration that will raise  the cost of trucks up to $8,000 per vehicle. Listen, there are a lot of  long-haul folks who cannot afford $8,000 per vehicle just to be able to  follow a new Biden administration policy.   Listen, I put all these things together because as I read the news  and as I go through the different things that I go through on a daily  basis and be able to read through things, at some point, I look at it,  and I think, Who says this makes sense? Where are these things coming  from? If I pull any one of these out and put them in front of the vast  majority of people in Oklahoma and ask, Is this the direction the  country needs to go, they will say no.   This Senate needs to talk about the direction the Nation is going  when you put controls around Agencies, that they just can't make up the  rules based on their own preferences.   This is not just an issue for our consumers; this body had a wake-up  call this weekend when we watched China broker a deal between Saudi  Arabia and Iran, and the U.S. State Department was not at the table  because our foreign policies are collapsing around the world. That is a  threat to American national security. It is not just an absence of  American policy making a difference, it is an absence of our American  values. When China's values are on the move worldwide, that is not a  safer world that we are living in. We need to shift the direction this  is going. And it needs to be soon.   With that, I yield the floor.
