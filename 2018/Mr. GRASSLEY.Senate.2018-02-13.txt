Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  about 15 minutes as in morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                               False Claims Act     Mr. President, I am going to address, as I do often on  the floor, problems with the False Claims Act. As author of the False  Claims Act of 1986, I want to say upfront, before I talk about some  problems, that this is a piece of legislation that has brought into the  Federal Treasury $56 to $57 billion of fraudulently taken money.   Each year, the Department of Justice updates the amount of money that  has come in under the False Claims Act, about $3 billion to $4 billion  a year. We are talking about a piece of legislation I passed more than  30 years ago, that had been good for the taxpayers, to make sure their  money is handled the way the law requires. Obviously, if it is taken  fraudulently, it isn't handled the way the taxpayers would expect.   With that introduction, I want to bring up some problems with the  False Claims Act. Today, there are some troubling developments in the  courts' interpretation of the False Claims Act. To understand these  developments, I want to review a little history.   In 1943, Congress gutted the Lincoln-era law known as the False  Claims Act. At that time, during World War II, the Department of  Justice said it needed no help from whistleblowers to fight fraud. The  Department of Justice said, if the government already knows about the  fraud, then no court should even hear a whistleblower's case. In 1943,  Congress amended the False Claims Act to bar any whistleblower from  bringing a claim if the government knows about the fraud.   Looking back at World War II, we know what they did to the False  Claims Act was a big mistake because the bar led to absurd results that  only hurt the taxpayers. It basically meant that all whistleblower  cases were blocked, even cases where the government only knew about the  fraud because of the whistleblower. In other words, whistleblowers are  patriotic people when they are reporting fraud, but it didn't make any  difference because of the way the law was amended in 1943.   In 1984, the Seventh Circuit barred the State of Wisconsin from a  whistleblower action against Medicaid fraud. Even today, Medicaid fraud  is a major problem. We have ways of getting at it now, but in 1984 they  didn't. In this case in Wisconsin, that State had already told the  Federal Government about the fraud because it was required to report  that fraud under Federal law. Because of the so-called government  [[Page S893]]  knowledge bar enacted in 1943, whistleblower cases went nowhere and  neither did prosecution of wrongdoers.   Getting back to what I was involved in, in 1986, I worked with many  of my colleagues--particularly a former Democratic Congressman from  California by the name of Mr. Berman--to make it possible for  whistleblowers to be heard again. In other words, these patriotic  Americans just want the government to do what the law says it ought to  be doing and money spent the way it ought to be spent. They want people  to know about it so action can be taken.   In 1986, for whistleblowers to be heard again, that included  eliminating the so-called government knowledge bar. Since then, what  the government knows about fraud has still been used by defendants in  false claims cases as a defense against their own state of mind. Courts  have found that what the government knows about fraud can still  undercut allegations that defendants knowingly submitted false claims.  The theory goes something like this: If the government knows about the  defendant's bad behavior and the defendant knows the government knows,  then the defendant did not knowingly commit fraud. That doesn't make  sense, does it? Once you wrap your head around that logic or puzzle, I  have another one for you.    In 2016, the question of what the government knows about fraud in  False Claims Act cases began to take center stage once again. In  Escobar, the Supreme Court rightly affirmed that a contractor can be  liable under the ``implied false certification'' theory. That means a  contractor can be in trouble when it doesn't make good on its bargain.  And it doesn't matter whether the contractor outright lies--a  misleading omission of its failures is enough.   Unfortunately, parts of the Court's ruling are getting some  defendants and judges tied in knots. Justice Thomas wrote that the  false or misleading aspect of the claim has to be material to the  government's decision whether to pay it. Justice Thomas said that one  of several ways you can tell whether something misleading is also  material is if the government knows what the contractor is up to and  pays the claim anyway. That is a good way for people to commit fraud.  At first glance, I suppose that kind of makes sense. If someone gives  you something substantially different in value or quality from what you  asked for, why would you pay for it? But if the difference really isn't  that important, you might still accept it.   Even if that is true, the problem here is that courts are reacting  the way they always have. They are trying to outdo each other in  applying Justice Thomas's analysis inappropriately or as strictly as  possible, to the point of absurdity. In doing so, they are starting to  resurrect elements of that old government knowledge bar that I worked  so hard to get rid of in 1986. And remember, that government knowledge  bar goes back to the big mistake Congress made in 1943 by eliminating  it from the False Claims Act.   Justice Thomas actually wrote:         [I]f the Government pays a particular claim in full despite       its actual knowledge that certain requirements were violated,       that is very strong evidence that those requirements are not       material. Or, if the Government regularly pays a particular       type of claim in full despite actual knowledge that certain       requirements were violated, and has signaled no change in       position, that is strong evidence that the requirements are       not material.    Justice Thomas did not say that in every case, if the government pays  a claim despite the fact that someone, somewhere in the bowels of  democracy might have heard about allegations that the contractor may  have done something wrong, the contractor is automatically off the  hook. Think about that. Why should the taxpayer pay the price for  bureaucrats who fail to expose fraud against the government? That is  why the False Claims Act exists--to protect taxpayers by rewarding  whistleblowers for exposing fraud.   Justice Thomas said that the government's actions when it has actual  knowledge that certain requirements were violated are evidence of  whether those requirements are material. What does it mean for the  government to have actual knowledge? Would it include one bureaucrat  who suspected a violation but looked the other way? Would that prove  the requirement was material? Courts need to be careful here.   First, this statement about government knowledge is not the standard  for materiality. The standard for materiality is actually the same as  it has always been. The Court did not change that definition in  Escobar. Materiality means ``having a natural tendency to influence, or  being capable of influencing, the payment or receipt of money or  property.'' The question of the government's behavior in response to  fraud is one of multiple factors for courts to weigh in applying the  standard.   Second, courts and defendants should be mindful that Justice Thomas  limited the relevance here to actual knowledge of things that actually  happened. There are all sorts of situations where the government could  have doubts but no actual knowledge of fraud. Maybe the government has  only heard vague allegations but has no facts. Maybe the rumors are  about something that may be happening in an industry but nothing about  a particular false claim by a particular defendant. Maybe an agency has  started an inquiry but still has a long way to go before that inquiry  is finished. Maybe someone with real agency authority or responsibility  hasn't learned of it yet. There are a lot of situations where the  government might not have actual knowledge of the fraud.   Third, even if the government does pay a false claim, that is not the  end of the matter. Courts have long recognized that there are a lot of  reasons why the government might not intervene in a whistleblower case.  There are a lot of reasons why the government might still pay a false  claim. Maybe declining to pay the claim would leave patients without  prescriptions or lifesaving medical care. Paying the claims in that  case does not mean that the fraud is unimportant; it means that in that  moment, the government wants to ensure access to critical care. That  payment cannot and does not deprive the government of the right to  recover the payment obtained through fraud.   Can you imagine if that were the rule? Can you imagine if providers  could avoid all accountability because the government decided not to  let someone suffer? Then fraudsters could hold the government hostage.  They could submit bogus claims all the time with no consequences  because they know the government is not going to deny treatment to the  sick and the vulnerable. That is just not what the False Claims Act  says. Courts should not read such a ridiculous rule into that statute.   Fourth, courts should take care in reading into the act a requirement  for the government to immediately stop paying claims or first pursue  some other remedy. There could be many important reasons to pay a claim  that have nothing to do with whether the fraud is material. Further,  there is no exhaustion requirement. The False Claims Act does not  require the government to jump through administrative hoops or give up  its rights. And that would be an unreasonable burden on the government,  in any event.   We have decades of data showing that the government cannot stop fraud  by itself--hence the importance of whistleblowers; hence the importance  of the False Claims Act. I also know from many years of oversight that  purely administrative remedies are very time-consuming and often  toothless.   The government should be able to decide how best to protect the  taxpayers from fraud. The False Claims Act is the most effective tool  the government has. The government should be able to use it without the  courts piling on bogus restrictions that are just not law.   I started with the importance of the False Claims Act. It has brought  $56 billion to $57 billion into the Treasury since its enactment in  1986. Each year, the Department of Justice updates the law, usually  reporting $3 billion or $4 billion coming in under that act in the  previous year.   I hope the courts understand that every bureaucrat in government has  to have the opportunity to report what is wrong so that we make sure  the taxpayers' money is properly spent.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.  [[Page S894]]    The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Cruz). Without objection, it is so  ordered.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for months, Senators have been  clamoring for a floor debate on DACA, border security, and other urgent  issues pertaining to immigration. We have certainly had ample time to  prepare.   The week we set aside for this debate has arrived--the week my  Democratic colleagues insisted that we dedicate to this issue. The  clock is ticking, but the debate has yet to begin. That is because our  Democratic colleagues have yet to yield back any of their postcloture  time so we can begin this important debate. If we are going to resolve  these matters this week, we need to get moving. In my view, the  proposal unveiled yesterday by Senator Grassley and a number of other  Senators offers our best chance to find a solution.   I have committed that the amendment process will be fair and both  sides will have the opportunity to submit ideas for debate and votes.  For that to happen, our colleagues will have to actually introduce  their own amendments, rather than just talk about them.   My colleague, Senator Toomey, for example, has done just that. He put  forward an amendment to address one of the most glaring aspects of our  Nation's broken immigration system--sanctuary cities. I see no reason  to further delay consideration of this and other substantive proposals.  Let's start by setting up a vote on his amendment and an amendment from  my Democratic colleagues--an amendment of their choosing, not mine,  with their consent. With their consent, we can start the debate and  have the first two amendment votes.   Mr. President, consistent with that, I ask unanimous consent that at  2:15 p.m. today, the motion to proceed to H.R. 2579 be agreed to. I ask  unanimous consent that Senator Toomey, or his designee, be recognized  to offer amendment No. 1948 and that the Democratic leader, or his  designee, be recognized to offer an amendment; further, that the time  until 3:30 p.m. be equally divided between the leaders or their  designees and that following the use or yielding back of that time, the  Senate vote on the amendments in the order listed, with 60 affirmative  votes required for adoption, and that no second-degree amendments be in  order prior to the votes; finally, that if any of the amendments are  adopted, they become original text for the purpose of further  amendment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Mr. President, about 20 minutes ago, our majority  leader, Senator McConnell, tried to move debate along on an immigration  bill, and I am puzzled that our minority leader, Senator Schumer,  objected. The reason I am puzzled is, for a long period of time--maybe  10 years--some of the Senators on the other side of the aisle and even  some Senators on our side of the aisle have been advocating for giving  certainty to the young people who have been brought here by their  parents whom we call either Dreamers or DACA people. They have been  advocating for giving them legalization.   The majority leader, 2 weeks ago, promised the minority an  opportunity to have a debate on that issue--the first debate on  immigration since 2013, I believe. The majority leader, today, tried to  carry out that promise and get this bill moving, and we had this  objection. It is very puzzling.   I think it is legitimate to ask the minority leader, in his objecting  to a unanimous consent agreement, why the objection is coming with  regard to the very debate that he has, on his side of the aisle, been  demanding of the majority for a long period of time. Hasn't the  minority leader and the entire Democratic Party been asking for this  debate? Yes, they have been.   Leader McConnell has honored his commitment and allowed us to have an  open, fair immigration debate this week. The key words are an  ``immigration debate,'' not a DACA-only debate, not an amnesty-only  debate but an immigration debate. An immigration debate has to include  a discussion about enforcement measures. An immigration debate has to  include a discussion about how to remove dangerous criminal aliens from  our country. A real immigration debate has to include discussions about  how to protect the American people.   The leader has asked unanimous consent to allow us to start debating  these issues, and the Democrats are refusing. Puzzling, I say it is,  because they have been the ones to demand this debate. Why don't they  want to debate things like sanctuary cities, as one example, which was  asked for? Are they unprepared to discuss the vital public safety  issues or is it more likely they are worried that some bills on  enforcement on this side of the aisle could actually pass? Maybe that  is the case, but it is no reason not to allow this body to start debate  on this very important issue.   The American people deserve a real immigration debate about the four  pillars we agreed to at the White House and not just a debate about the  Democrats' preferred policy preferences. Yes, DACA is an important part  of that discussion, but it is only one part. If the Democrats are  insisting that we debate their preferred policies only, that is not a  real debate at all.   We have filed an amendment that takes into consideration the four  pillars that were agreed to at a bicameral, bipartisan meeting at the  White House, with the President presiding on January 9. Those four  pillars include: legalization and a path to citizenship, border  security, the elimination of chain migration, and, fourthly, the  elimination of the diversity visa lottery. Those all fit in, maybe not  in detail and exactly the way the President might want it, but they fit  into the four pillars as to which he said he would sign a piece of  legislation.   I suggest to my other 99 colleagues that there is a provision that  can pass the U.S. Senate, pass the House of Representatives, and be  signed by the President of the United States because he has said he  agrees with those principles. Other people have bills but not bills  that can become law based upon what the President will sign or not  sign.   Again, I think it is very puzzling that the Democratic leadership  will not allow this debate to go forward, for it is something they have  been asking for. More importantly, maybe it is quite the surprise that  the majority leader would allow this debate to move forward, but that  is how a consensus was met about 2 weeks ago on the issue of opening up  government and having this debate and moving forward to a budget  agreement. Those things have been done. Now the leader is carrying out  his promise. I hope the other side will agree to move ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess as under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:28 p.m., recessed until  2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Mr. Portman).                            ____________________
