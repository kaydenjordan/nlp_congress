 Mr. Speaker, I can tell you it won't take 2 minutes to  say what I have to say.   I certainly want to thank each side of the aisle for supporting H.R.  1123, the Divisional Realignment for Eastern District of Arkansas Act  of 2019.   I want to thank Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Collins for  marking up this important legislation.   Following the Federal Judiciary's efforts to reduce space, the  Federal courthouses in Batesville and Pine Bluff, Arkansas, were  closed. However, the Eastern District of Arkansas has been required to  maintain the organizational divisions mandated by the statute.   This bill simply corrects that disparity and reduces divisions in the  Eastern District from five to three, aligning divisions with remaining  courthouses.   The new districts have been carefully designed to maximize access to  justice, considering highway access, geography, and case load history.  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.
