 Mr. Speaker, on Friday, May 3, I attended the  visitation of 5-year-old Andrew ``AJ'' Freund. His mother and father  are awaiting trial for his murder.   Our community is in mourning. AJ's death is heartbreaking, and so is  the system that failed him. But one key part of the foster care system  is stretched beyond capacity.   In the county where AJ lived, 40 percent of children must leave the  county to be placed in foster homes, which can have adverse impacts.  The need for foster care in Illinois grew by 20 percent between 2017  and 2018, while the number of foster homes is decreasing at the fastest  rate in the country.   Local agencies are reviewing the policies surrounding AJ's death, but  Congress must act as well. Here are two things that I am doing and that  our colleagues can do as well to prevent another tragedy like AJ.   First, join me as a member of the Congressional Foster Youth Caucus  to support people to become foster parents and to place children into  stable homes. Second, seek data-informed solutions.   This week, I championed a bipartisan amendment to the Child Abuse and  Treatment Act, CAPTA, to study the effect of parental substance use  disorders on children removed from a family.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting foster youth and  families across this country. We must all work to ensure tragedies like  AJ's death never happen again.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this coming Sunday, millions of  Americans will celebrate Mother's Day. While I look forward to  celebrating Mother's Day and honoring my own mom, I know that mothers  deserve more than to be celebrated. They deserve safe pregnancies and  births, and healthy lives for themselves and their babies.   In the 14th Congressional District of Illinois, we are committed to  this cause. This past weekend, I joined constituents and Medela  employees in McHenry County at the March for Babies 5K, which raised  tens of thousands of dollars to improve the health of moms and babies.   This could not come at a more critical time. The maternal mortality  rate in the U.S. has more than doubled over the last 30 years. It is a  crisis.   Underlying this crisis are alarming disparities. Black women are  nearly four times more likely than White women, and more than twice as  likely than women of other races, to die from preventable, pregnancy- related complications.   This week, I joined Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley and my Black  Maternal Health Caucus cofounder, Congresswoman Alma Adams, to address  this crisis by introducing the Healthy MOMMIES Act.   The Healthy MOMMIES Act would expand access to essential health  services to improve outcomes for mothers and eliminate disparities in  morbidity and mortality for moms.                            ____________________
