 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for doing this. I  found this the most healing experience since John's loss.   Madam Speaker, as we approach the end of our life, it is fitting to  think about how we will be remembered. Will they say: Was he brave? Was  he kind? Was he humble? Was he honest?   But time wipes all memories away, and what is left? What impact did  we have on the lives of others, of the people to come?   John Lewis is the best of men, the most Christ-like person I have  ever known, and he changed the personal trajectories of tens of  millions of people.   Born into poverty and racism, John has become the desperate hope that  we need. Hammarskjold wrote that all life asks of us is that we live it  with courage. I grieve, we all grieve deeply this most courageous man,  and thank God for his life.
