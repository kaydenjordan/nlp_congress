 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last night, most of America was tuned in  to the President's State of the Union Address, and I attended it with  most of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate.   The State of the Union Address is an opportunity for the President,  once each year, to speak directly not just to Congress but to the  American people. The President had an opportunity last night to bring  us together and to talk about ways we can solve the challenges facing  our great Nation. Sadly, time and again, the President chose to use  divisive language when he could have used unifying language.   What is the state of the Union under this President?   Affordable health insurance is at risk. Last night, President Trump  said he wanted to protect healthcare for people with preexisting  conditions like cancer, diabetes, asthma, and heart disease. What he  did not say was that at this very moment, his administration is trying  to eliminate those protections for people with preexisting conditions.  That is right. A lawsuit--filed by Republican attorneys general, led by  the Texas Republican attorney general--is supported by the  administration and the President, and it would declare the entire  Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, including those provisions that  protect people with preexisting conditions. The President can't stand  before us and give a speech to the American people and say: I am all  about preexisting conditions--and then tell his Attorney General to  join in a lawsuit and try to eliminate that protection. That is exactly  what is happening at this moment.   Last night, President Trump said he wanted to help people with HIV/ AIDS and children with cancer. Who could argue with those goals? But  people with HIV/AIDS and children with cancer are some of the people  who stand to lose the most if President Trump sabotages the Affordable  Care Act.   Let me say a word about the childhood cancer issue. What a  heartbreaking, tender moment it was to look up into the Gallery and see  that little girl, that 7-year-old girl, who, fighting a brain tumor,  was still out raising money for St. Jude's Hospital. It was beautiful,  and she was just as pretty and loveable as any child can be as she  applauded everyone and had what is clearly the night of her life to be  at that joint session. I looked up there, and I am sure every parent  and grandparent in the audience saw in her exactly what we love about  little children.   Let's be honest about what the President said last night. When he  said he wanted to fight childhood cancer, he said how much he would  spend. That is an important thing because your values in Congress and  in the government are often measured by how much you are willing to  invest in your values.   The President suggested that he wanted to spend $500 million on  childhood cancer. That is breathtaking, $500 million, until you listen  to the rest of the sentence--over 10 years, so $50 million a year. To  the outsider, that may seem like a significant amount of money, but in  the context of medical research, it is not.   The annual budget for the National Institutes of Health, the major  medical research organization in the world, nears $35 billion; $50  million against $35 billion pales in comparison. Look at this. Each  year, the National Institutes of Health spends almost $500 million on  childhood cancer. I want to make sure they pay more, spend more,  research more.   I thank Roy Blunt, the Senator from Missouri--Republican Senator from  Missouri; Lamar Alexander, Republican Senator from Tennessee; and, of  course, Patty Murray, our champion when it comes to medical research on  the Democratic side. What they have done for 4 successive years is have  a 5-percent real increase in medical research. That is amazing. That is  almost 30 percent more being spent on medical research because this  bipartisan team--which I am a cheerleader for--has done that kind of  investment   So when the President talks about, now he is going to tackle  childhood cancer, I can't wait to see the next budget for the National  Institutes of Health. It is Congress that has been pushing the 5- percent real growth every year, not President Trump.   So, yes, I am glad he is on board for childhood cancer. If we can  help that little girl, and so many others like her each year who are  battling cancer, we need to do it and put party aside, but $50 million  a year is hardly a moonshot against cancer when it comes to children.  If we are going to make a massive investment to make this work, it will  take a lot more of an investment than that.   For the past 2 years, President Trump has proposed cuts--cuts--in the  National Institutes of Health. Mr. Mulvaney, who is now his Acting  Chief of Staff, is pretty good as a budget cutter. He is not very good  when it comes to investing in research. He suggested an 18-percent cut  and a 6-percent cut to the very Agency responsible for medical research  increases. Thank goodness, the team of Senators I mentioned to you  earlier ignored the President's request and Mr. Mulvaney's directive to  cut spending when it came to medical research. We need to make sure we  invest in medical research for the future, finding new cures for  diseases and conditions, including childhood cancer and HIV/AIDS.  [[Page S883]]    The basic services of our government are at risk, unfortunately,  despite the President's statement last night. You see, the President  authored the longest government shutdown--35 days--in the history of  the United States, and after he relented and allowed the government  Agencies to go back into business and pay their employees--some 800,000  Federal employees--he dangled again the possibility that next week he  will do it all over again, shut down the government again, God forbid.  We have seen enough of this.   My guest last night was from Illinois. His name is Toby Hauck. Toby  is head of the air traffic controllers in our State. We have almost  1,000 or more across our State. When they reached a point of 35 days  with no pay, the air traffic controllers announced they would have to  slow down air traffic operations across the United States.   I believe that was the decisive moment in the government shutdown. It  was shortly thereafter that the President relented and said he will  allow the government to reopen again. Now, he says if he doesn't get  his way about his almighty wall, he is going to do it all over again. I  hope he doesn't. For the good of this Nation, I hope he doesn't. For  air traffic controllers, and for people who work at the Food and Drug  Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental  Protection Agency, and so many other Agencies, not to mention TSA, I  would hate to see them face another period of not being paid while  being called into work.   Our national security is at risk at this moment too. When you look  for the reasoning behind it, you can see the President's view of  foreign policy is part of the problem.   I was glad to stand last night when the President recognized the  heroes of World War II. Those three men--in their nineties, I am sure-- really were a part of the ``greatest generation.'' The sacrifices they  made for America, the sacrifices they made to defeat the forces of  authoritarianism in Germany, Italy, and Japan have left a better world.  It also led to the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  after World War II. The nations that were victorious in World War II,  led by the United States, came together and said: Our goal is never to  have another World War; to stop a war from breaking out again in  Europe, as it had twice in the last century. The North Atlantic Treaty  Organization was the organization they chose to make sure we were  prepared to fight communism or other forces that might lead to war. It  has been dramatically successful not just in keeping the peace but in  building a community of interest between the United States and Europe,  which endures to this day.   I don't disagree with the President. Those who are allies should pay  their fair share for NATO, but, clearly, many of those countries in  Europe today wonder if the United States still has an interest in their  future, as it once did many years ago. That uncertainty, when it comes  to dealing with Russia, is emphasized on a daily basis as we try to  understand this President, who one day is admonishing the Russians for  failing to live up to a nuclear arms treaty and the next day is  ignoring Russia's cyber act of war as it tries to take over the  election process in the United States. I can't follow where this  President stands when it comes to Russia, and a lot of our NATO allies  are curious, too, as to what he is trying to achieve.   It isn't just NATO. Beyond that, we know the President walked away  from this nuclear agreement with Iran. He talked about it last night. I  couldn't disagree with the President's position more. When we had the  major countries on Earth come together and devise a way with inspectors  to make sure Iran did not develop a nuclear weapon, that made the  Middle East safer; that made Israel safer. The President opposed it  from the start. Despite his opposition, President Obama was able to get  it through, approved in Congress, and it became the law of the land.  When the reports came back, Iran was complying with the nuclear  agreement. They weren't developing nuclear weapons. They were  destroying centrifuges and other equipment that could lead them to  develop a nuclear weapon. Unfortunately, the net result of it was  destroyed when the President stepped away from this treaty. Iran still  lives by its terms, but we don't know what tomorrow might bring.   The nuclear arms race with Russia is on again because of their  violation of a nuclear arms treaty that dates back to President Reagan.  Instead of negotiation, we walked out and said we are just not going to  live by it anymore. We need to stop a new arms race, and we need to  engage China, as the President suggested last night, in that process.   I also want to say the state of our Union sees our planet at risk.  This President withdrew the United States from the Paris climate  accord, an agreement signed--listen carefully--by every country in the  world, but it doesn't include the United States. The rest of the  world--those who are political foes and friends alike--came together  and said: We have to do something to make sure this planet is loveable  for our children and grandchildren but not President Trump. He walked  away from that. As a consequence, the United States is not doing what  it should to show leadership in this critical life-or-death issue.   Finally, when it comes to America's confidence in our government, it  has been shaken by a President who refuses to disclose his tax returns,  refuses to be open about his business dealings around the United States  and around the world, and, unfortunately, has seen a Cabinet riddled  with corruption and conflicts of interest. We have never seen anything  quite like this. In the 8 years of President Obama, there were no  scandals that even came close to match what is happening under the  Trump administration. Is it any wonder that people are skeptical about  their leadership and their commitment to the common good as opposed to  their own personal gain?   The last point I will make is our economy. It is true, there are more  jobs. We have had economic growth since President Obama brought us out  of the worst recession since the Great Depression, and that growth and  job creation is a good thing for America. I applaud it. I want to see  it continue, but when we had a chance to rewrite the Tax Code in a way  to help working families and those who are in the lower and middle- income categories, this Congress and this President did just the  opposite, creating massive tax breaks for the wealthiest people in  America. I know it is part of the Republican playbook that if the rich  can just get a little bit richer, America will be better off, but it is  counterintuitive. Too many working families across the United States  have seen their wages--their real wages--fall behind, even though  productivity and profits in corporations have increased. We have to  make sure this is a fair economy when it comes to our workers and our  taxpayers. Unfortunately, the President's position on taxes has not  helped that in any regard whatsoever.   So last night's State of the Union Address, unfortunately, divided us  instead of united us. It didn't point out the real challenges we face  and need to deal with. I hope still that we can come together,  Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the House, to deal with the  major challenges it faces--the challenges we were elected to confront  and deal with.
