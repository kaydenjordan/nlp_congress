 Mr. Speaker, after a decade of inadequate  economic growth across America, there is new growing optimism that our  economy is about to be set free again. Consumer confidence in the  economy is the highest it has been since 2000. Why? I believe this is  because the American people expect us to reform our broken Tax Code,  and they are excited about it.   Our outdated and overly complex Tax Code has held our economy down  for the past decade. It is time we fix this and empower working  families in America.   Real tax reform will be the best way to help America climb up the  economic ladder. A stronger economy will bring higher wages and better  jobs. The goal is to make our Federal Code simple and to make it fair.                                time  1730    The Tax Code, as it is, only benefits the rich and well-connected who  can  [[Page H7962]]  hire an army of lawyers to protect their interests. This is why  Republicans are looking to enact real reform for all Americans. The  argument against tax reform is this: the plan is just a tax cut for the  rich.   The reality is, this tax reform framework is focused on helping  middle class families. The tax system is laid out by Republicans that  allows low- and middle-income workers to keep more of their hard-earned  paychecks in order to save for their children's college, for their  retirement, or any other things that they want.   I implore my colleagues across the aisle to do what is right and help  to fix our antiquated Tax Code.
