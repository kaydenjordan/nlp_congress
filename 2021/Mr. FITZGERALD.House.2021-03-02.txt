 Madam Speaker, I rise in objection to H.R. 1, the so- called For the People Act.   Contrary to the title, the bill puts politicians ahead of the  American people and codifies nationwide election changes made last year  that shook the faith of Americans in the integrity of our elections.   When Americans vote, they put faith in the idea that our system of  government gives them a voice in our democracy. If this faith is  betrayed and Americans become skeptical of their vote, the trust our  system is built upon collapses, and they do not want it to collapse.   The bill would take us down this very path of losing trust by taking  constitutionally granted authority out of the hands of the States and  local officials and destroying the safeguards of election integrity.   For example, not only would this bill do nothing to address ballot  harvesting, but it would take the practice nationwide. We have seen the  irregularities created by this practice and how ballot harvesting  allows manipulation and intimidation in several elections across this  country.                                time  1115    In the 2020 election, this happened in Wisconsin, where ballot  harvesting is not supposed to be permitted. In those instances, voter  registration and absentee ballots were completed and collected in  unsecured outdoor areas prior to the date allowed under State law.   I am also proud to have implemented strong voter ID laws during my  time in the Wisconsin Legislature. Unfortunately, over the past year, I  saw those protections steamrolled under the guise of the pandemic,  allowing over 200,000 voters to submit a ballot without showing an ID.   This bill would permanently open the floodgates by forcing States to  allow individuals to vote without an ID simply by signing a statement,  effectively banning State voter ID laws.    As elected officials, we have a duty to maintain the  faith of our voters in the integrity of our elections.   Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.
