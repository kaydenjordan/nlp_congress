 ROSE of Tennessee. I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Today I rise in opposition to H.R. 693, the PAST Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Congressional Record a letter from the  Kentucky and Tennessee Farm Bureau Federations opposing the PAST Act.                                            Kentucky Farm Bureau,                                                      July 23, 2019.      Hon. Members of Congress,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Members of Congress: Please accept this letter as a       statement of opposition to H.R. 693, the Prevent All Soring       Tactics (PAST) Act by the Kentucky Farm Bureau and Tennessee       Farm Bureau.        The PAST Act is misleading in its strategies and purpose       and sets a dangerous precedent for animal agriculture. Please       take the time to review it closely and understand this       initiative and the agenda of the Humane Society of the United       States (HSUS). While the PAST Act expressly targets Walking       Horses, this push by the HSUS brings to question which       segment of animal-based agriculture will be targeted next.        Supporters of the PAST Act argue the bill will ``eliminate       soring'' within the Walking Horse Industry. However, soring       is essentially nonexistent today. The bill professes to end       soring by banning hoof pads and action devices which are used       in Walking Horse performance shows, and implies such items       cause soring. Hoof pads and action devices do not cause       soring. Hoof pads are used to provide protection from ground       force, to accentuate movement, and balance motion. These pads       are used in many breeds other than the Walking Horse       including the American Paint Horse, American Quarter Horse,       American Saddlebred, and Morgan breeds. An action device is a       band/chain weighing six (6) ounces or less. We are not aware       of a study that indicates action devices or pads produce pain       or cause tissue damage.        The Tennessee Walking Horse is the most inspected horse in       the world. The industry and its shows maintain a compliance       rate with the Horse Protection Act that averages 92-95%. This       rate is significant considering the inspection process today       is almost 100% subjective.        The PAST Act eliminates the organizations established by       Congress in the original  [[Page H7373]]       Horse Protection Act called Horse Industry Organizations       (HIOs). These independent organizations provide inspectors       for shows and are trained and certified by the U.S.       Department of Agriculture (USDA). Without HIOs, the PAST Act       requires an increase in the USDA's workforce as well as       additional employees for the U.S. Department of Justice. The       Congressional Budget Office numbers reflect this cost.        We urge you to not accept the mistreatment claims from       years past as true today. Visit a Walking Horse farm and see       the horses. Visit with a horse owner, trainer, farrier and       their veterinarians. Contact your state Farm Bureau, the       Tennessee Farm Bureau or the Kentucky Farm Bureau if you want       assistance arranging a visit or tour.        We urge you to oppose H.R. 693.        Thank you for your consideration of this information.            Sincerely,      Jeff Aiken,        President, Tennessee Farm Bureau.      Mark Haney,        President, Kentucky Farm Bureau.     ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, as an eighth-generation  farmer and Tennessean, the grand tradition of Tennessee Walking Horses  is among my earliest and fondest memories. We take great pride in the  Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, drawing neighbors and  tourists alike to Shelbyville, Tennessee, every year for our world- class showcase.   However, this grand tradition is not unmarred by a few bad actors  looking to gain at the expense of innocent exhibitors. Soring has been  investigated and debated, and both Congress and industry leaders have  put forth their best efforts to end this horrible practice.   Tennessee Walking Horses are regal and strong, but the ones that  suffer from soring are harmed in ways that are cruel and unjust. The  bad actors who are soring compromise fair competition and the integrity  of this great tradition, but most importantly, they endanger our prized  Tennessee Walking Horses.   I can assure you we in Tennessee stand against this vile practice. My  strong opposition to soring is why I rise today in opposition to the  PAST Act. It is my belief that this bill is not the best solution to  this cruel practice.   While I appreciate the sincere motives of those who support this  bill, I call on my colleagues to consider another, better solution. I  am a cosponsor of H.R. 1157, the Horse Protection Amendments Act,  authored by my colleague from Tennessee, Congressman DesJarlais. This  bill works to end soring in a way that is fair to those acting properly  and humanely and provides timely consequences for those who are not.   Inspections must be objective, but the PAST Act does not correct the  current subjective process that is used. My colleagues' bill, H.R.  1157, creates a framework for consistent, scientific, and objective  inspections.   H.R. 693 does not solve the real issue here: soring. Industrywide,  the current compliance rate is between 92 and 95 percent. In fact,  Tennessee's celebration had a compliance rate of 96 percent last year.  These compliance rates are based on the USDA standards.   As the Farm Bureau has pointed out, the Tennessee Walking Horse is  the most inspected horse in the world. Overall, the industry has a USDA  compliance rate higher than even the food industry. With that, the rate  of catching bad actors at this point is, of course, extremely low.   These low rates mean we must be vigilant if we are going to find and  stop bad actors. Vigilance will require a new system. The PAST Act does  not create a scientific, objective process for inspections, and until  we have that, the remaining bad actors will continue to go under the  radar, while those acting with integrity could be treated unfairly.   It is because of these concerns that I will oppose the PAST Act  today. I call on my colleagues to oppose the PAST Act and, instead,  stand with me in truly stopping soring by supporting H.R. 1157.
