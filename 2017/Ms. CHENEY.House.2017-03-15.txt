 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Colorado and my  colleague from Maryland for their support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 648 so that we could begin the work  necessary to increase the active storage capacity of the Fontenelle  Reservoir. As a headwater State, Wyoming takes care of its water, and  we know that water is our most important natural resource. Water uses  currently at this dam span the gamut from irrigation, domestic,  industrial, municipal, fish and wildlife, and recreation. Power  generation is a secondary purpose at the dam, and current uses also  include industrial capacity for our trona miners, fertilizer producers,  and fulfillment of a range of energy needs.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would simply authorize the Bureau of  Reclamation to enter into a cooperative agreement with the State of  Wyoming so that we could begin the process to study, design, and  construct increased capacity for the reservoir. This is a process, Mr.  Speaker, that has been held up previously by onerous NEPA requirements,  and we need to move quickly so that we can begin to increase this  capacity.   Currently the reservoir has 265,000 acre-feet to accommodate water as  active capacity. This legislation would potentially add an additional  80,000 acre-feet of existing reservoir space. This bill would provide  an affordable and efficient way to add more usable storage in the  Colorado River Basin  [[Page H2065]]  and would accomplish these goals without contemplating the construction  of a new dam. The bill has the support of the Wyoming Water Development  Office and the Wyoming Water Development Commission, which develops our  State's water resources for conservation, storage, distribution,  recreation, and other public interests. Our Governor Matt Mead included  this concept in the 2015 Wyoming water strategy.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will empower Wyoming to better utilize our  water allocation and improve our water storage, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend  and former Member of this House, John Wold, of Casper, Wyoming, who  passed away on February 19. Congressman Wold was a member of the  Greatest Generation serving as a naval engineer during World War II. He  also served Wyoming in our State legislature and as our Member of  Congress. He was a leader and pioneer in the energy field, and he made  numerous contributions, along with his incomparable wife, Jane, to our  civic life and as a philanthropist.   I knew John my whole life. The friendship between our families goes  back even farther. John was the oldest living former Member of  Congress, and I was honored to receive his advice and counsel over the  years.   I will never forget attending his 100th birthday this past summer in  Casper and seeing the joy it brought him to be surrounded by so many of  his wonderful children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.   We will miss him, but the impact Congressman Wold had on our State  and our Nation and the legacy of leadership and honor he leaves behind  will continue to be an inspiration for generations to come.                            ____________________
