 Mr. President, Ron Chernow is well known as a historian  and prolific writer who has written biographies of some of the most  amazing people who have lived in our country. One, of course, is on the  Founding Father, George Washington, and another which received acclaim  even on Broadway in New York is the well-known biography of Alexander  Hamilton, which inspired Mr. Miranda to write a musical, which is  probably the most successful musical of our time.   Mr. Chernow has also written another book, which I am working my way  through very carefully, the biography of Ulysses Grant. It is about 900  pages long. It is a heavy book to carry  [[Page S7109]]  from one living space to another as a U.S. Senator but well worth the  effort. It tells the story of this man who came to lead the Union Army  to victory in the Civil War and ultimately became President of the  United States. As I have read this biography of Ulysses S. Grant, I  couldn't help but be struck by the fact that one issue emerged after  the Civil War, which was probably one of the most challenging of all,  the issue about the right of African Americans to vote in the South  after the Civil War--the so-called period of Reconstruction.   I also commend to those who are interested in the issue this book by  Carol Anderson, entitled ``One Person, No Vote.'' Carol Anderson is a  professor at Emory in Atlanta, GA. She wrote an earlier book, which I  also recommend, called ``White Rage.'' This book, ``One Person, No  Vote,'' really tries to describe throughout history, particularly after  the Civil War, efforts at voter suppression and their impact on our  democracy.   Professor Anderson was kind enough to ask me to write the forward to  this book, which I was happy to do. I am happy to read this book as  well because it went into the detail about what happened after the end  of the Civil War, when African Americans were legally and  constitutionally declared to be citizens of the United States and then  set out to exercise their right to vote. Initially, there was some  success, but over time the White population in the South started  suppressing that right to vote, passing laws that demanded literacy  tests of those who would show up to vote, constitutional tests, poll  taxes, and the like. Over time, it dramatically diminished the African- American vote in the South, and that diminishment led many Blacks to  pick up and leave in the great migration north. Their departure from  the South to the North was to the benefit of States like Illinois,  where many thousands came to find work and an opportunity to exercise  their own freedom, which they thought had been won by the Civil War.   How important is this right to vote? Well, in the words of John  Roberts, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, at his hearing in  2005, he said that the right to vote is ``preservative of all other  rights''--preservative of all other rights. It is that fundamental to  our democracy that we allow those who are eligible to step forward and  to express their will when an election is called and choose the  candidates of their choice.   Over the period of time after the end of the Civil War, there were  extraordinary efforts taken to suppress the right of African Americans  to vote. I say, with some embarrassment but in reality, those were  largely promulgated by people who described themselves as Democrats in  those days. They were the ones largely in control of the political  infrastructure of the South who did their best to limit the right of  Blacks to participate.   One of the noteworthy events in this history occurred in 1890 in  Mississippi, when they passed the Mississippi Plan. In Carol Anderson's  words, ``a dizzying array of poll taxes, literacy tests, understanding  clauses, newfangled voter registration rules, and `good character'  clauses--all intentionally racially discriminatory but dressed up in  the genteel garb of bringing `integrity' to the voting booth. This  feigned legal innocence was legislative evil genius.''   She goes on to explain how the so-called Mississippi Plan became a  template for other Southern States to try to find ways to pass local  and State laws making it increasingly difficult for individuals to  vote, particularly African Americans and people who did not have great  wealth. It was a success for many years, and the participation of Black  voters diminished dramatically as a result of it.   I know this has sounded like a history lesson to this moment, and it  would be but for the fact that we are facing this issue again in a vote  we will face this week in the U.S. Senate.   There is a nominee for the Federal Court in the Eastern District of  North Carolina named Thomas Farr. Mr. Farr's participation in voter  suppression is well documented. In fact, the Congressional Black Caucus  has described Mr. Farr as ``the preeminent attorney for North Carolina  Republicans seeking to curtail the voting rights of people of color.''   Mr. Farr worked as legal counsel for the 1990 campaign of Senator  Jesse Helms. That campaign engaged in well-documented, deeply  disturbing tactics aimed at suppressing the Black vote in North  Carolina.   As an example, the Helms campaign sent out over 100,000 postcards to  mainly African-American voters warning that they might be ineligible to  vote for residency reasons. The postcards from the Helms campaign,  which Mr. Farr worked on as legal counsel, warned that the Black  recipients might be arrested for voter fraud if they came to the polls  to vote.   Mr. Farr initially told the Judiciary Committee, in which I serve,  that he did not participate in any campaign meetings in which this  mailing was discussed. However, news reports then indicated that Mr.  Farr did, in fact, participate in an October 1990 meeting that included  discussion about mailings that challenged voters' residency.   Mr. Farr, this nominee for a lifetime appointment to the Federal  court in North Carolina, later admitted participating in the meeting,  despite what he had said earlier. A former Justice Department attorney  told the Raleigh News & Observer in 2009 that Mr. Farr ``was certainly  involved in the scheme as it was being developed.''   Mr. Farr also represented North Carolina in litigation over a  notorious voter suppression law that the Fourth Circuit struck down in  2016. So his experience in this earlier Helms campaign was not confined  when it came to voter suppression; by 2016 he was at it again. The  Fourth Circuit found that the law--which Mr. Farr defended in court-- had ``target[ed] African Americans with almost surgical precision'' and  that the legislature had ``enacted . . . the law with discriminatory  intent.''   That was the very law that Mr. Farr defended before the court.   This man, who now seeks this lifetime appointment to the Federal  bench, has not just a history but a pattern of voter suppression. This  phrase--that the law he was defending ``target[ed] African Americans  with almost surgical precision''--has probably been repeated more than  any I can remember in recent memory on this issue.   Additionally, Mr. Farr represented North Carolina in litigation  related to racial gerrymandering and violations of the National Voter  Registration Act.   It is particularly troubling that Mr. Farr has been nominated for a  judgeship that, as the minority leader mentioned earlier, was denied  during the Obama administration when they submitted two African  American nominees. The Republican Senators from North Carolina kept the  seat vacant and would not allow an African American to fill it. Though  President Obama tried twice, they objected to the nominees. Republicans  held this seat vacant for years, clearly with the intention to fill it  with someone like Mr. Farr.   Let me quote what the Reverend William J. Barber II, a prominent  civil rights leader in North Carolina, wrote about Thomas Farr in TIME  magazine recently:         I know Farr. I know what he's done, what he stands for and       just how detrimental he will be to his constituents if       confirmed.    There are many conservative lawyers in North Carolina who could serve  as Federal judge who do not have the blemished record of advocacy for  voter suppression that Mr. Farr brings to the Senate. As Reverend  Barber wrote in TIME magazine: ``Being a conservative is not the same  thing as spending almost 40 years fighting to block full citizenship  for all Americans.''   Given his decades-long history of supporting and defending efforts to  restrict the right to vote, I must oppose Mr. Farr's nomination.   I must ask: In this moment in time in the 21st century, as we still  battle over the issues that divided this Nation during the Civil War,  why would this Senate stand and give Mr. Thomas Farr a lifetime  appointment to the Federal bench in North Carolina? What does it say  about the majority in the Senate that we would give this man, with his  personal history of voter suppression, this opportunity?   The reality is this, and it is a grim reality: I believe the  Republican Party has decided that demographics are not on their side  and that the emerging minorities in the United States of America are  not likely to vote their way. So they have embarked on a national  program to limit the rights of people to  [[Page S7110]]  vote--a national program that I find disgusting. To think that the Koch  brothers finance ALEC--the American Legislative Exchange Council--and  that ALEC promulgates these State laws in an effort to continue to  suppress the vote carries on a sad and despicable tradition.   Back in the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, it  was the Democratic Party, which I belong to, that unfortunately was the  home for many of these bigots and led many efforts of voter  suppression. Today, sadly, it is the Republican Party--the party of  Abraham Lincoln--that is trying to suppress the vote of African  Americans with many overt, covert efforts. The appointment of Thomas  Farr to fill this vacancy is as overt as can be. We know who he is. We  know what he believes. We know what he stands for. And we know that if  he is given this lifetime appointment on the Federal bench, he is  likely to continue his lifetime history of trying to deny votes to  those who are African Americans.   This Chamber that I stand in, with some awe every time I enter it,  became the Senate legislative Chamber in January of 1859, even before  the Civil War began. It witnessed not only the departure of the  southern Senators who were loyal to the Confederacy; it witnessed even  Union soldiers coming in and camping out here, at times during the  conflict, when they needed a roof over their heads. It also witnessed  the battles over reconstruction when the so-called radical Republicans  were determined to make sure that African Americans would be given a  fighting chance in the south. It witnessed the impeachment trial of  Andrew Johnson, and it witnessed many other events that have led us to  this moment in time in the year 2018.   Many of the debates that took place on this floor, many of the  sentiments that were debated back and forth over the decades, continue  to this day to our generation, to our time, and to our Senate. When we  bring Thomas Farr for a vote this week in the U.S. Senate, I hope that  the party of Abraham Lincoln--the Republican Party of the United  States--will join Democrats in stopping this nomination. Can we send a  clear message, a bipartisan message from the Senate this week that  Thomas Farr and the voter suppression in which he has engaged  throughout his life is as unacceptable today as it was in the dark days  after the end of the Civil War? That is our responsibility.   This Senator will be voting no on Thomas Farr.   I yield the floor.
