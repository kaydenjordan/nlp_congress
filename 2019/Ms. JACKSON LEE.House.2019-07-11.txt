 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Oklahoma for  yielding, and I thank the chairman of the full committee, Chairman  Smith, for his important leadership, collaboration, and cooperation  with me on these amendments.   I also thank my colleague from Texas, Ranking Member Thornberry, for  his support and work on these amendments and on the work of the NDAA.   I thank them both for their important work on behalf of the men and  women of the United States military.                                time  2000    The Jackson Lee amendment No. 203 directs the Secretary of Defense to  promulgate regulations to ensure that candidates granted admission to  attend a military academy undergo screening for speech disorders and be  provided the results of the screening test and a list of warfare  unrestricted line officer positions and occupation specialists that  require successful performance on the speech test. Academy students  shall have the option of undergoing speech therapy to reduce speech  disorders or impediments.  [[Page H5670]]    Specifically, this amendment is intended to help military academy  candidates who have stuttering-related speech disorders.   Madam Chair, 5 to 10 percent of all children stutter. Boys are two to  three times more likely to stutter than girls. Approximately 75 percent  of children recover from stuttering, but the remaining 25 percent will  experience lifelong effects.   I learned about the issue of stuttering and its implications for a  successful military career through the experiences of a legislative  fellow currently serving in my Washington, D.C., office. He is a 2016  graduate from the United States Naval Academy with a degree in  operations research and a veteran naval officer who was separated from  the Navy in April 2019. His separation was not due to any fault of his  own but because of the current processes of the United States Navy and  the United States Naval Academy relating to speech fluency issues  relating to stuttering.   Let me also say that there was an ad that we have seen on television  about a young man who was confronting a doctor during World War I and  World War II. It had to do with ancestry. He was insisting that he was  in good health, and the doctor said no. The end of the story is they  showed that he prevailed, and he went to World War I or II and even won  a Purple Heart.   This Navy lieutenant's stuttering was not severe and undetectable to  most individuals who engage him in conversation. He went on to secure a  screening by the flight doctor. The flight doctor then administered a  speech fluency test. During the test, his speech fluency did not meet  naval standards, but he was an important contributor to the United  States Navy.   At the time, he advised the doctor that he might not be able to do  the surface war command officer that he had selected even though he  wanted to be an aviator. He then went on to another discipline, surface  warfare officer. Then after graduating from the United States Naval  Academy with an operations research degree, he served aboard the USS  Scout.   His captain said that he was able in every way. It was clear that he  might not be able to be a surface warfare officer, but he was able.   What happened was a tragedy. He went on to seek extra care. His  overall speech fluency improved. The captain decided that transferring  to a different community would be the best option. That was the  captain's decision.   Unfortunately, because of the speech impediment that could not be  heard, he was sent to a Probationary Officer Continuation and Retention  Board, the wrong board to be sent to, and a speech impediment was not  considered a medical issue. Therefore, he could not go before the  medical board.   This very fine African American graduate of the academy could not  serve because we did not do him service. We did not do him the kind of  service that he needed to have. Unfortunately, this board was not  really meant for someone who was capable, qualified, and ready. This is  one where you do not have a right to appeal, if you can imagine that,  and no one ever notifies you why.   I am here today to say that my amendment will, hopefully, have an  impact on the many different young soldiers who want to serve.   Madam Chair, can you believe a half million dollars was spent on his  education?   Let me indicate that this amendment is supported by the National  Stuttering Association. The National Stuttering Association says that  we support the Jackson Lee amendment No. 203 that allows for military  academy candidates to have access to, and options for, undergoing  speech therapy to successfully manage speech disorders or impediments  so that entry into officer or occupational specialist positions in the  military is possible. Military personnel who stutter can be and are  effective communicators, and stuttering does not limit military career  aspirations.   Jimmy Stewart became an aviator in World War II and reached the rank  of brigadier general on July 23, 1959, a little later than World War  II. He retired from military service on May 31, 1968.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter from National  Stuttering Association and the famous people who stutter.                                 National Stuttering Association,                                        New York, NY, July 11, 2019.      Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,      Washington, DC.        Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee: The National Stuttering       Association (NSA) is the largest non-profit organization in       the world dedicated to bringing hope and empowerment to       children and adults who stutter, families and professionals,       through support, education, advocacy, and research. We have       long worked with individuals and communities to increase       understanding of stuttering and to improve outcomes for       people who stutter in all aspects of their lives.        Over the last several years, we have enhanced outreach       efforts to raise stuttering awareness to colleges and       universities, employers and the military. A recurrent theme       we hear from young people and adults who stutter are barriers       to employment and career success based on false assumptions       about stuttering. To that end, we have developed and enhanced       educational outreach programs for employers, which of course       includes the military. Just last year, a stuttering support       chapter was launched at Wright Patterson AFB, at the request       of personnel who stutter.        We support Jackson Lee Amendment #203 that allows for       military academy candidates to have access to, and options       for, undergoing speech therapy to successfully manage speech       disorders or impediments so that entry into Officer or       Occupational Specialists positions in the military is       possible. Military personnel who stutter can be, and are,       effective communicators and stuttering does not have to limit       military career aspiration.        Thank you for alerting us to this important act. Feel free       to contact us anytime for additional support or resources.

Madam Chair, I include in the Record the actual  resume of Michael Pender, a graduate of Annapolis and an excellent  young man.                               Michael Pender         Michael Pender is a 2016 United States Naval Academy       graduate and a veteran naval officer who was separated from       the Navy in April 2019. His separation was not due to any       fault of his own, but because of the current processes of the       United States Navy and the United States Naval Academy       relating to speech fluency issues related to stuttering.        Lieutenant Pender's stuttering was not severe, and       undetectable to most individuals who engage him in       conversation. However,  [[Page H5671]]       for certain career opportunities in the military it matters a       great deal if someone has even a slight almost imperceptible       stutter.        Michael Pender's story began with his enrollment at the       Naval Academy in 2012. Mr. Pender dreamed of becoming a naval       aviator from an early age. During the naval aviation       screening during his junior year at Annapolis, the USNA       flight doctor reviewing his medical records and USNA       application and noticed that Mr. Pender had a history of       speech disfluency. The flight doctor then administered a       speech fluency test to Mr. Pender. During the test, Mr.       Pender's speech fluency did not meet the Naval Aviation       community's standards, and he was told that he was       disqualified from serving as an aviator.        Mr. Pender was disappointed with the determination. At that       critical juncture Mr. Pender was not informed about what       careers he could qualify to fill that would not be impacted       by the determination regarding his speech. He was given an       opportunity to take speech therapy, which he did until his       graduation.        Mr. Pender selected the only unrestricted line option       left--the Surface Warfare community. At the time, Mr. Pender       advised the flight doctor that the demands for speech fluency       would be more of an issue as a Surface Warfare Officer. His       concerns were not satisfactorily addressed nor was he       provided with counseling to assist him in selecting an       appropriate career following his graduation.        After graduating from the United States Naval Academy, Mr.       Pender served onboard the USS Scout (MCM 8) in San Diego,       where he began his training as a Surface Warfare Officer.       After serving diligently for 18 months and qualifying in all       required Surface Warfare watch-stations except for the       position of Officer of the Deck, it was clear that his speech       impediment would keep him from earning his Surface Warfare       Officer qualification.        An Officer of the Deck is the captain's representative when       the captain is not on the bridge of the ship. Officer of the       Deck gives verbal orders to sailors who drive the ship. It       was difficult for Mr. Pender to give orders in a timely       manner without delay due to his speech impediment. Mr. Pender       wanted to address the issue and sought out a speech therapist       who would accept TRICare insurance to improve his speech as       he pursued his Officer of the Deck qualification. His overall       speech fluency improved, but not enough to give the Captain       confidence to qualify Mr. Pender as Officer of the Deck. Mr.       Pender and his Captain decided that transferring to a       different community would be the best option.        Since stuttering is not classified as a medical issue, a       Medical Board was not an option to review his case. Once he       completed his education at Annapolis the options for career       change within the branch was extremely limited. In 2018,       after consulting with other officers, Mr. Pender's Captain       and Executive Officer decided that the best course of action       was to submit a redesignation package to the Probationary       Officer Continuation and Retention Board (POCR), with the       intention that he would re-designate into a different       community. In order to start this process, Mr. Pender's       Captain submitted a Surface Warfare Officer non-attainment       letter to the POCR Board. In that letter, Mr. Pender's       captain stated that Mr. Pender would not be able to qualify       as Surface Warfare Officer, not because of a lack of aptitude       or work ethic, but because of his speech impediment.        The POCR Board has the authority to reassign a Naval       Officer to another Naval Community, which the Navy's method       of reassigning personnel to a new job. The POCR Board got       back to Mr. Pender in September 2018 stating that he would be       removed from the Active Duty List and he would be retained on       the Reserve Active Status list, effectively separating him       from the Navy without any due process or a right to appeal       the decision.        It is disappointing that he had to separate from the Navy       for two reasons. First, he was not put into a position to       succeed coming out of the Naval Academy. His speech       impediment was a known condition at the Naval Academy, and       their service selection process should have evaluated Mr.       Pender's speech impediment to see if he would be successful       as a Naval Aviator or a Surface Warfare Officer. Second, he       should have been given a chance to serve in a restricted line       community. Even if his speech impediment was not caught until       he ultimately started his service as a Naval Officer, there       should be a process in place where officers who cannot       qualify in their respective unrestricted line communities due       to conditions that are not covered for Medical Boards are       given a fair chance to serve in one of the many restricted       line communities. The POCR Board process should only be       reserved for officers that were not able to qualify due to a       lack of desire or aptitude. In conclusion, there were plenty       of other communities in the Navy where Mr. Pender would have       been able to serve, and it is a shame that he is separated       from the Navy.    Madam Chair, let me also indicate that I am very  glad and grateful for amendment No. 201 that adds $10 million to  research dealing with triple negative breast cancer.   Between 10 and 17 percent of female breast cancer patients have this  condition, and I believe this is crucial to helping military women and  others.   Amendment No. 202 deals with PTSD. We have added $2.5 million. I am  grateful for this amendment. We are recognizing that more and more  young people coming out have a continuation of PTSD. Currently, there  are 31.3 million people in the United States being treated for PTSD.   Let me also say that I am grateful for the seven other amendments  that have been added.   Jackson Lee amendment No. 195 creates housing for disaster survivors.   No. 145 has the DOD engage in efforts to stop Boko Haram.   No. 147 has to do with recruiting students who go to the Defense  National Security Education Program. It prevents them from being  recruited by foreign governments.   Also, No. 148 deals with stopping a report on maternity mortality  rates.   Amendment No. 149 deals with the risk posed by debris in low Earth  orbit.   No. 160 deals with the idea of training in cybersecurity, cyber  defense, and cyber operations for elementary, secondary, and  postsecondary students.   Then, No. 620 deals with artificial intelligence education strategic  opportunities and risks.   Madam Chair, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Madam Chair, my remaining comments are to simply say  the amendment that is close to my heart is the one dealing with this  academy graduate, this Naval Academy graduate. We asked everyone to  give him another chance because the only thing that he was deficient in  is not in heart, soul, and willingness to serve, but it was because he  had a speech impediment.   How shameful for us to deal with our young men and women like that.   I thank my colleagues for supporting this amendment. I ask for a  ``yes'' vote on the Jackson Lee amendments and the Jackson Lee  amendment that deals with the idea of making sure young people have the  medical care, the service, and the ability to serve after graduating  from an academy with $500,000 invested in this young man, and all my  other underlying amendments.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support them.   Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry for  their work on this bill and their devotion to the men and women of the  Armed Forces.   I also thank them for including in this En Bloc ten Jackson Lee  Amendments.   My remarks will focus on three of the Jackson Lee Amendments and the  others are addressed in my statement for the record.   Jackson Lee Amendments No. 201, No. 202, and No. 203, make important  contributions to the bill.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 201 authorizes and encourages increased  collaboration between the DOD and the National Institutes of Health  (NIH) to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer;   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 202 authorizes $2.5 million in increased  funding to combat and treat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; and   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 203 directs the Secretary of Defense to  promulgate regulations to ensure that candidates granted admission to  attend a military academy undergo screening for speech disorders and be  provided the results of the screening test and a list of warfare  unrestricted line (URL) Officer positions and occupation specialists  that require successful performance on the speech test. Academy  students shall have the option of undergoing speech therapy to reduce  speech disorders or impediments.   Specifically, Jackson Lee Amendment No. 203 is intended to help  military academy candidates that have stuttering related speech  disorders.   Five to ten percent of all children stutter as they develop language  skills.   Boys are 2 to 3 times more likely to stutter than girls.   Approximately 75 percent of children recover from stuttering, but the  remaining 25 percent will experience life-long effects of stuttering.   There are many famous and accomplished persons who stutter.   One well known person who stuttered was Jimmy Stewart a much beloved  actor who also served in the Air Force during World War II.   Jimmy Stewart was a pilot during WWII and rose to the rank of Chief  of Staff of the 2nd Combat Wing, 2nd Air Division of the 8th Air Force.   As a member of the Air Force Reserves Jimmy Stewart continued his  military service.  [[Page H5672]]    On July 23, 1959, Jimmy Stewart achieved the rank of Brigadier  General.   He retired from military service on May 31, 1968.   Stuttering can make it difficult to communicate with other people,  which often affects a person's quality of life and interpersonal  relationships.   Stuttering can also negatively influence job performance and  opportunities, and treatment can come at a high financial cost.   I offer this amendment to help entrants into military academies, who  may have a related stuttering speech disorder, find the right career  fit for their military service after graduation.   I learned about the impact of stuttering may have on promising  military careers through the experience of a remarkable young man who  is currently serving as a Legislative Fellow in my Washington, D.C.,  office.   He is a 2016 graduate of the United States Naval Academy with a  degree in Operations Research and a veteran naval officer who was  separated from the Navy in April 2019.   His separation was not due to any fault of his own, but because of  the current processes of the United States Navy and the United States  Naval Academy relating to speech fluency issues related to stuttering.   This Navy Lieutenant's stuttering was not severe, and undetectable to  most individuals who engage him in conversation.   However, for certain career opportunities in the military it matters  a great deal if someone has even a slight, almost-imperceptible  stutter.   His story began with his enrollment at the Naval Academy in 2012.   He dreamed of becoming a naval aviator from an early age.

During the test, his speech fluency did not meet the Naval Aviation  community's standards, and he was told that he was disqualified from  serving as an aviator.   He was disappointed with the determination.   At that critical juncture he was not informed regarding the career  paths he was qualified to fill, notwithstanding his speech.   He was given an opportunity to take speech therapy, which he did  until his graduation.   He selected another unrestricted line option left open to him-the  Surface Warfare community.   At the time, he advised the flight doctor that the demands for speech  fluency would be more of an issue as a Surface Warfare Officer.   After graduating from the United States Naval Academy with an  Operations Research degree, he served onboard the USS Scout (MCM 8) in  San Diego, where he began his training as a Surface Warfare Officer.

The POCR Board got back to him in September 2018, stating that he  would be removed from the Active Duty List and he would be retained on  the Reserve Active Status list, effectively separating him from the  Navy without any due process or a right to appeal the decision.   The Medical Board findings returned in March 2019 and stated that it  was the stuttering that caused the anxiety order, and stuttering is not  an issue that is covered for Medical Boards.   It is disappointing that he had to separate from the Navy for two  reasons.   First, he was not put into a position to succeed coming out of the  Naval Academy.   His speech impediment was a known condition at the Naval Academy, and  its service selection process should have evaluated his speech  impediment to see if he would be successful as a Naval Aviator or a  Surface Warfare Officer.

In conclusion, there were plenty of other communities in the Navy  where he would have been able to serve, and it is a shame that he is  separated from the Navy.   I, and my Staff have benefited greatly from his insights on improving  the experience of military cadets as well as his commitment to public  service as a Legislative Fellow in my office.   I am sure he will find success in his next endeavor and I thank him  for his service to our nation.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 202 authorizes $2.5 million in increased  funding to combat and treat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.   Today, 223.4 million people, which represents seventy percent of  adults living in the United States, have experienced some type of  traumatic event at least once in their lives.   As many as 20 percent of those who experience a traumatic event  develop PTSD.   Currently, there are 31.3 million people in the United States being  treated for PTSD.   An estimated 8 percent of Americans or 24.4 million people at any  given time will be experiencing PTSD.   Nearly 50 percent of women and 60 percent of men will experience at  least one trauma in their lifetime.   For Veterans, this may mean surviving an IED explosion or an accident  during a training exercise or witnessing the death or injury of a  buddy.   Among people who are victims of a severe traumatic experience like  what may occur during military conflict, an estimated 60 to 80 percent  will develop PTSD.   Ten to thirty percent of combat veteran's lifetime will experience  PTSD at some point during their lives.   Studies estimate that 1 in every 5 military personnel returning from  Iraq and Afghanistan has PTSD.   20 percent of the soldiers who've been deployed in the past 6 years  have PTSD. That's over 300,000 soldiers.   17 percent of combat troops are women; 71 percent of female military  personnel develop PTSD due to sexual assault within the ranks.   I thank the Chair and Ranking Member for including this Jackson Lee  Amendment to combat PTSD for consideration of H.R. 2500.   This Jackson Lee Amendment provides authorization for a $10 million  increase in funding for increased collaboration with NIH to combat  Triple Negative Breast Cancer.   This Jackson Lee Amendment authorizes and encourages increased  collaboration between the DOD and the National Institutes of Health  (NIH) to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer.   ``Triple Negative Breast Cancer'' is a term used to describe breast  cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone  receptors, and do not have an excess of the ``HER2'' protein on their  cell membrane of tumor cells.   The lack of receptors in this form of breast cancer makes commonly  used test and methods to detect the disease not as effective.   This is a serious illness that effects between 10-17 percent of  female breast cancer patients and this condition is more likely to  cause death than the most common form of breast cancer.   Seventy percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast  cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed.   The Jackson Lee Amendment will help to save lives.   TNBC disproportionately impacts younger women, African American  women, Hispanic/  [[Page H5673]]  Latina women, and women with a ``BRCA1'' genetic mutation, which is  also prevalent in Jewish women.   TNBC usually affects women under 50 years of age and makes up more  than 30 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses in African American.   African American women are far more susceptible to this dangerous  subtype than white or Hispanic women.   The collaboration between the Department of Defense and NIH to combat  Triple Negative Breast Cancer can support the development of multiple  targeted therapies for this devastating disease.   Triple negative breast cancer is a specific strain of breast cancer  for which no targeted treatment is available.   The American Cancer Society calls this strain of breast cancer ``an  aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates.''   In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control predicted that that year  26,840 black women would be diagnosed with TNBC.   The overall incidence rate of breast cancer is 10 percent lower in  African American women than white women.   African American women have a five-year survival rate of 78 percent  after diagnosis as compared to 90 percent for white women.   The incidence rate of breast cancer among women under 45 is higher  for African American women compared to white women.   Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells account for between 13 percent  and 25 percent of all breast cancer in the United States and are  usually of a higher grade and size, are more aggressive and more likely  to metastasize, and onset at a much younger age.   Currently, 70 percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast  cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed.   African American women are 3 times more likely to develop triple- negative breast cancer than white women.   African-American women have prevalence for TNBC of 26 percent versus  16 percent in non-African-Americans women.   African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed with larger  tumors and more advanced stages of breast cancer.   Currently there is no targeted treatment for TNBC exists.   For this reason, I appreciate the support that the Armed Services  Committee has shown for this amendment by including it in En Bloc No.  8, and I ask my colleagues to support this Jackson Lee Amendment.    Madam Chair, the people of Iran do not want war.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from California for allowing us,  no matter what time of night it is, to stand on the floor and declare  that the people of Iran do not want war.   The people of the United States know that the Constitution says that  Congress has the right to declare war.   Madam Chair, I support this amendment, because it speaks to the  Constitution and our right to declare war and to stand against war and  sending our young men and women without the authority of the United  States Congress.    Madam Chairwoman, let me thank the gentlewoman from  Texas, Congresswoman Garcia, for her leadership. It can be seen that we  are intertwining on this issue, and I thank her for acknowledging the  fact that these children are unaccompanied.   We are not saying adults. We are not saying criminals. What we are  saying is they are children who are unaccompanied migrant children.  Many of them are unaccompanied because of the zero-tolerance policy  of this administration, the continued policy of separating children  from their guardian, from their grandmother, from their aunt.    How do I know this? Because I saw this firsthand this past Monday,  just 3 days ago, where unaccompanied children were held in a facility.   I asked the question: How are they unaccompanied? They are  unaccompanied because we took the adults away from them.   This is simple to say that these children not be held in Department  of Defense facilities. This does not undermine this bill. It simply  says that children are precious and should be handled in a manner that  provides them with the care, courtesy, and love of the right kind of  facilities.   But, most importantly, I support this amendment because I join my  colleague in saying that we do not accept zero tolerance in separating  children.   I support the amendment. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership  in taking these children out of the Department of Defense facilities.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman.   I think the process that the gentlewoman is advocating in this  amendment, which I support, is not militarizing the immigration system,  particularly since the immigration system is mostly civil.   Most of the migrants who are coming across the border are asking for  asylum. If we would simply put in place a process to be able to process  the asylum seekers and to increase the legal process for them, then we  wouldn't have to militarize the border by a deployment of troops or by  incarcerating individuals in military facilities.   That can be a bipartisan effort. If we join with my colleague to do  comprehensive immigration reform, then we will not need to utilize  these facilities. I agree that immigration does not equal defense or  criminalization.
