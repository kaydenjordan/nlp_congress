 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate a group that I  have worked with for some time, the Jersey City H.O.N.E.Y. Bees Double  Dutch team for their big wins at the American Double Dutch League's  44th international competition.   But tragedy intervened. Sadly, on October 28, one of the H.O.N.E.Y.  Bees passed away. I ask my colleagues to join me in honor and  remembrance of the life of Jeremiah Grant.   Jerry was a student at the Ollie Culbreth Jr. School in Jersey City,  New Jersey. He excelled in academics and in the world of competitive  jump rope. At only 8 years old, Jerry was the youngest member of the  H.O.N.E.Y. Bees. He was also the only boy on the team and was called  Prince Bee. Jerry was a winner, and his legacy of love will live on in  north Jersey.   May Jerry ``Prince Bee'' continue flying high in eternal peace.                            ____________________
