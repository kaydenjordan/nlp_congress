 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 967 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H.

The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of July 21, 2020.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Thursday, yesterday, the Rules  Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 967, providing for  consideration of H. Res. 965, authorizing remote voting by proxy in the  House of Representatives and providing for official remote committee  proceedings during a public health emergency due to a novel coronavirus  resolution; and H.R. 6800, the HEROES Act.   Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee met for over 9 hours. While there  are strong disagreements between Democrats and Republicans on these  matters, I want to say that the proceedings were civil, and I  appreciate that very much.   I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Cole, for the tone that he  set, not only yesterday, but in all of our hearings on issues where we  have common ground and on issues where we disagree.   The rule provides for consideration of H. Res. 965 under a closed  rule. It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules and  provides that upon adoption of the rule it shall be in order without  intervention of any point of order to consider the resolution.   The rule further provides for consideration of H.R. 6800 under a  closed rule, self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairwoman Lowey,  provides 2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations, and one  motion to recommit with or without instructions. The rule also provides  that upon adoption of the rule, it shall be in order to consider the  bill in the House without intervention of any question of  consideration.   Finally, the rule provides suspension authority through July 19,  2020, and same-day authority and recess instructions both through July  21, 2020.   Madam Speaker, let me begin with a snapshot of what we are seeing in  America today: a novel coronavirus that has infected more than 1.4  million people in this country and has taken the lives of close to  90,000 Americans already; more than 20 million jobs lost in the last  month; communities asked to stay home; businesses closed; an  unemployment rate that stands at 14 percent and growing; lines for food  banks that stretch for miles; and first responders working to the bone  to save lives.   People are struggling, Madam Speaker. We haven't seen numbers like  this since the Great Depression. This situation demands a whole-of- government response that matches the challenges that we face.   I am proud that this Congress has come together on multiple bills  that provide trillions of dollars in emergency aid. We knew then that  although those bills were a large investment, they were just the first  step in our response.   This rule will allow for consideration of the HEROES Act, a  comprehensive response to further help the American people. This bill  is named after the teachers, healthcare workers, and first responders  who keep us all safe. It puts these heroes front and center by  providing more than $1 trillion for States and localities to give them  the pay that they have earned.   The bill also establishes a Heroes Fund totaling $200 billion so that  the essential workers who have risked their lives during this pandemic  get the hazard pay that they deserve.   There is another $75 billion for coronavirus testing, treatment, and  tracing.   There is support here for workers, renters, homeowners, and small  businesses.   This legislation also protects our democracy by providing resources  to ensure safe Federal elections, an accurate Census count, and a  Postal Service that can continue its vital work.   I am especially proud to see provisions here to fight the growing  hunger crisis in America. That includes many of the ideas behind the  bipartisan, bicameral FEED Act, and a separate 15 percent increase in  the maximum benefit under SNAP, our Nation's premier antihunger  program. More than 40 million people relied on this program even before  this pandemic hit. So when people say they want to get back to normal,  I want to get back to better than normal because having 40 million  people in this country hungry even before this pandemic is  unconscionable. We need to do better.   Today, we see lines for food banks across the country that go for  miles and miles. Parking lots are so full at some of these places that  they look like some kind of gathering for a major sporting event.  Instead, it is people just trying to secure their next meal. This is  happening in the richest country on the face of the Earth, a country  [[Page H2009]]  whose President, by the way, was trying to weaken SNAP and slash its  benefits before COVID-19 hit. If he succeeded, that would have thrown  millions and millions of poor people off the program.   People are suffering, Madam Speaker. But just this week, Senate  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called this bill a messaging exercise.  I don't give a damn about sending a message, Madam Speaker. I want to  send help to those in desperate need.   As we act on this bill today, we are also moving forward as part of  this rule with temporary changes to ensure that Congress can continue  legislating throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. That includes enabling  virtual committee proceedings and remote voting on the House floor  during this emergency.   I don't suggest these changes lightly. I still believe that we do our  best work in person and side by side. But we must temporarily embrace  technology during this unprecedented time, the same way local  governments and countries around the world have, so we can continue  legislating as safely as possible.                                time  0915    Madam Speaker, the status quo has become dangerous and unacceptable.  We must act. Let's meet this moment. Let's honor our heroes, and let's  make sure that we can act throughout this pandemic.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this rule and  the underlying measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, H. Res. 965 was mentioned, and some  questions were raised about constitutional issues.   Madam Speaker, we have consulted with several constitutional  scholars: Erwin Chemerinsky, the renowned constitutional expert and  dean of the Berkeley School of Law; Deborah Pearlstein, constitutional  law professor from Cardozo School of Law and former clerk to Supreme  Court Justice John Paul Stevens; Sai Prakkash, a constitutional law  professor from the University of Virginia and former clerk to the late  Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia--all of whom have found that the  House has the constitutional authority to institute remote voting by  proxy.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Matsui), and also a member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, let me just say, it is absolutely  ridiculous for anybody to suggest that, under the process that we are  advocating, somehow you are ``giving away'' your vote. There is no  discretion at all involved in the process that we are putting forward.  My colleague sat through hours of hearings yesterday. I would maybe  suggest that he reread the bill.   Madam Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter from law  professor Debra Pearlstein in response to Mr. Mark Strand's article,  which my ranking member just submitted for the Record.                                                      CardozoLaw,                                                       May 15, 2020.        Dear Chairman McGovern: I read with interest an article by       Mssrs. Mark Strand and Tim Lang introduced into the record       during yesterday's hearing of the House Rules Committee on H.       Res. 965--Authorizing remote voting by proxy in the House of       Representatives. Having written elsewhere in detail about my       conviction that the rules change under consideration readily       passes constitutional muster, I am grateful for the       opportunity to explain why the Strand and Lang position fails       to persuade.        Mssrs. Strand and Lang offer no objection to the proxy       voting process as such, but rather argue that the       Constitution would permit votes by designated proxy only if a       quorum of Members is already physically present in the House       chamber as provided for under existing House rules. Their       objection is to the rule change proposed as part of H. Res.       965 that would allow Members voting by proxy to count toward       the establishment of a quorum ``to do business'' required by       Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution. The authors cite no       case law to support their view that the Constitution's Quorum       Clause requires Members' physical presence, relying instead       on two lines of argument: (1) the bare text of the Quorum       Clause, and (2) the interpretive claim that, because other       provisions of the Constitution refer to Members' ``presence''       or ``absence,'' it must be that the Quorum Clause itself must       be read to mandate physical presence. Neither argument is       persuasive.        In defining the scope of the quorum requirement, the Quorum       Clause itself says solely: ``a Majority of each shall       constitute a Quorum to do Business.'' The Clause does not       provide any method or test for determining the existence of a       majority. Neither does it define what measure each House must       use to establish the existence of a majority. The Clause       itself thus provides no basis for determining whether the       ``majority'' must be, for example, ``a majority of Members       present,'' or ``a majority of Members elected,'' or ``a       majority of Members able to vote,'' or some other metric       altogether.        The authors must instead rely heavily on their interpretive       claim that, because other provisions of the Constitution       refer to Members' ``presence'' or ``absence,'' the Quorum       Clause itself must be read to include an implied requirement       of physical presence, as if the Clause had been written to       mandate ``a Majority of members present shall constitute a       Quorum.'' That is, of course, not what the Constitution says.       On the contrary, the absence of the word ``presence'' in the       Quorum Clause cuts as much against the authors' argument as       in its favor. The framers of the Constitution knew exactly       how to require ``presence'' when they wanted to; they do so,       for example, just a few lines earlier in the text, in Article       I, Section 3, providing: ``The Senate shall have the sole       power to try all impeachments . . . . [N]o person shall be       convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the       members present.'' The failure to include such a requirement       in in the Quorum Clause, or indeed to modify or define the       Quorum Clause majority requirement in any way, suggests the       framers did not intend to include presence as such as part of       the quorum determination.        Particularly when coupled with the Clause immediately       following the Quorum Clause--according each House broad       discretion to ``determine the rules of its proceedings''--it       makes no sense to imagine the framers meant here to tie the       hands of future congresses from using what reasonable,       verifiable means might be available to adjust its procedures       to accommodate a crisis. On the contrary, as both judicial       opinion and the historical record referenced in my earlier       letter make clear, the House's discretion to adopt rules       reasonably adapted to suit changing circumstances is       precisely as broad as the Constitution's text suggests.        As ever, I thank you for your efforts, and for the       opportunity to share my views.            Sincerely,                                             Deborah N. Pearlstein,                                                  Professor of Law.     Madam Speaker, I will go into this later in much more  detail when we take up the resolution, but I would urge my colleagues  to read the response.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Shalala).                                time  0930     Madam Speaker, there is a lot that I could say, but let  me just say this: In the time of this incredible tragic health pandemic  and economic crisis, I don't think now is the time to kick poor people,  to beat up on people who are hungry in this country.  [[Page H2013]]    We ought to step forward, as the United States of America, the  richest country in the history of the world, and make sure that nobody  in our country goes hungry. It is shameful the way my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle demagogue this issue. It is shameful.   Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Correa).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am disappointed with the gentleman's statement. He referred to a  failed attempt three weeks ago to deal with the issue of remote voting.  There was no failed amendment. We pulled the bill to have discussions  with Republicans about how we can move forward. That is why we did  that.   And then the gentleman refers to all of these amendments that were  brought up in the Rules Committee, commonsense amendments. Yeah,  amendments on everything, including abortion, immigration, airline  travel. But the gentleman knows full well that many of the suggestions  that the Republicans offered during our negotiations we took into  account and are part of this proposal.   So I don't know what the gentleman is talking about, but I will tell  you this: That kind of attitude, that commentary, doesn't bode well for  future negotiations.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas).                                time  0945     Madam Speaker, let me clarify for the Record that it  only takes a majority to change the rules. Democrats have changed the  rules with a majority. The Republicans have changed the rules with a  simple majority, not two-thirds.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Hastings), an effective and distinguished Member of this  House and the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Underwood).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Madam Speaker, I am waiting for one other speaker, but  I don't think he has arrived, so I am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, let me begin by again thanking my colleague from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for the tone he set in the Rules Committee debate  yesterday and for his friendship and for always trying to be  constructive.   Madam Speaker, I began this debate by speaking about the challenge we  face today. And make no mistake, the list is long, but I have no doubt  the American people can rise to these challenges. They are resilient  and have shown again and again a perseverance that is no match for even  a global pandemic.   The question, quite frankly, is whether our elected officials are up  to these challenges; whether we are willing to rise above knee-jerk  partisanship of the moment and put what is best for our country and  this institution first ahead of the next great sound bite and before  the next election.   In all my time here, I have seen us do that again and again, whether  we face war or terrorism or natural disaster. I was proud of the way we  came together on prior coronavirus bills, too.   But I worry that something is changing on the other side. It is  deeply concerning to see the President throw up his hands and  essentially say, ``Enough.'' He has declared victory on testing,  despite it being out of reach for most Americans.   The Senate majority leader has essentially said he is hitting pause  on doing anything else related to this pandemic for the time being.   And there are some on the other side of this Chamber who want to  conduct business as usual around here as if nothing has changed. We  hear it today on the floor. Some Members get up and downplay this  pandemic like it is no big deal. It is like we are living in ``The  Twilight Zone.''   We are at the start of this pandemic, Madam Speaker, not the end, and  if we run into our respective partisan corners now, what example are we  setting? Things could get worse in the fall, and what then?   Madam Speaker, we need to act, and we need to act boldly and  immediately, and that includes passing this rule. It means passing the  HEROES Act, and it means making these temporary changes to allow for  virtual committee proceedings and remote floor voting during this  pandemic. This is what the moment requires.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 967         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 13. Notwithstanding any other section of this       resolution, an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members       present and voting, a quorum being present, shall be required       on adoption of House Resolution 965.                                time  1015     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 967, I call  up the resolution (H. Res. 965) authorizing remote voting by proxy in  the House of Representatives and providing for official remote  committee proceedings during a public health emergency due to a novel  coronavirus, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of a pandemic, the  likes of which the world hasn't seen in more than 100 years.   The question before us today is a simple one: Will this institution,  which has adapted to challenges and technology time and time again  throughout its history, adapt so that we can continue legislating  during this public health emergency.   Medical experts have told us that COVID-19 is up to three times more  contagious than the flu. That means, in a normal cycle of this virus,  just one person with coronavirus could kick off a snowball effect that  leads to up to 59,000 new infections.   Now think about that.   And then think about the way we normally operate here. Members travel  frequently from their home States, some of which are coronavirus hot  spots, to convene together here in the Capitol complex. Then we travel  back home at the end of the week. And we repeat this process month  after month after month.   Along the way, we come in contact with fellow travelers, colleagues,  the general public, press, and the hundreds and hundreds of people who  help make this House operate. There is no telling who among them could  have compromised immune systems, preexisting conditions, or other  heightened risks for illness. But we know just how easy this virus  spreads among those with strong immune systems.   That is why the choices that each one of us makes are especially  important--not just about protecting Members of Congress. This is about  protecting all of those who come in contact with us.   Now, any of us could have the virus and not even know it. We could be  asymptomatic but be carriers nonetheless. Convening Congress must not  turn into a superspreader event.   Technology has changed considerably over the last 231 years. There  are now tools available that make temporary committee proceedings and  remote voting on the House floor possible--not forever, just  temporarily during this emergency.   Now, some on the other side seem to think that temporarily embracing  technology during this pandemic is a radical idea.   Well, let me say this loud and clear to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker:  If anyone tells you you would be giving away your vote with remote  voting by proxy, this is just a lie. Plain and simple, it is just not  true.   What would be radical is if this House did nothing, if we made  Members decide between spreading a deadly virus or legislating for the  American people. That is a false choice. We can and we should do both.   At least 16 States, 10 countries, and the European Parliament have  all implemented some form of remote procedures to safely conduct  official proceedings during this pandemic. With this resolution, this  House can finally join them.   Now, let me repeat: We are not suggesting permanent changes. No one  believes we do our best work in person and side by side more than me,  Mr. Speaker. Remote legislating will only be utilized so long as this  pandemic continues.   Mr. Speaker, this is the type of adapting that this House has always  done. Our Founders did not vote by electronic device, but we do.  Constituents, decades ago, couldn't watch floor proceedings live on C- SPAN or listen to them on the radio, but ours can. Changes were made to  our quorum requirement time and time again, including most recently  after the September 11 attacks. And I could go on and on and on and on.   Believe it or not, adapting is action in this institution's DNA.  There are always those quick to proclaim that any change means ending  the House as we know it. But you know what, Mr. Speaker? The sky did  not fall, and the House continues its work.   So I don't say this to make light of what we are doing here today.  What we are doing is serious. It is a big deal. My State of  Massachusetts has one of the oldest legislatures in the country, but  even they changed their rules to allow for remote voting.   You can respect tradition without blinding yourself of the need to  make temporary changes when necessary, and today is one of those times.  This resolution comes after careful study, months of talks, feedback  from constitutional experts, and conversations among a bipartisan task  force. This resolution has been strengthened by this deliberative  process, and it contains many provisions suggested by my Republican  friends. It is now time to act.   Now, some communities have turned the corner with this virus, and I  hope that continues. Medical experts tell us, however, that a second  wave this fall could be even more damaging than what we are seeing now.  So as we hope for the best, we must prepare for the worst. Anything  less would be a dereliction of our responsibility.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join with us in  supporting this resolution. Let's adapt the way this institution has  always done. And let's make sure that we can continue legislating  during this pandemic, no matter what the future may bring.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  Erwin Chemerinsky, the renowned constitutional scholar and dean of  Berkeley School of Law, who actually wrote the book on constitutional  law, discussing his view that the remote voting process we are  considering today would be constitutional.                                                       Berkeleylaw,                                        University of California,                                                       May 13, 2020.      Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole: I have been       asked for my view as to whether the House of Representatives       could constitutionally adopt a rule to permit remote voting       by proxy. As explained below, I believe that this would be       constitutional and it is very unlikely that any court would       invalidate such a rule, especially in light of the current       public health emergency.        My understanding is that the system of remote voting by       proxy that is being considered would have some key features:        Low-tech remote voting process through proxy voting        Some number of Members would be present on the Floor for       debate and in-Chamber voting        Proxy would be used to establish a quorum and to register       the yeas/nays        The proxy holder would be another Member of the House        The proxy holder would have NO discretion on the vote.       Instead, the proxy holder would be required (through the rule       and accompanying regulations) to cast the vote in accordance       with the specific and exact instruction from the Member.        The Constitution bestows on each House of Congress broad       discretion to determine the rules for its own proceedings.       Article I, section 5 of the Constitution says: ``Each House       may determine the Rules of its proceedings.'' This authority       is expansive and would include the ability to adopt a rule to       permit proxy voting. Nothing in the Constitution specifies       otherwise.        Moreover, if this were challenged in court, it is very       likely that the case would be dismissed as a political       question. The Supreme Court has ruled that challenges to the       internal operation of Congress are not justiciable in the       federal courts. See Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649 (1892).       Indeed, I have written, the Court often ``has held that       congressional judgments pertaining to its internal governance       should not be reviewed by the federal judiciary.'' Erwin       Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies       Sec. 2.8.5 (6th ed. 2019).        Especially in the context of the current public health       emergency, it is highly unlikely that any court would review       and invalidate the procedures adopted by the House of       Representatives that would allow it to conduct its business       without endangering the health of its members and its staff.       Every branch of government is devising new procedures to       accomplish this. The Supreme Court, for example, will conduct       oral arguments by telephone for the first time in its       history. I am sure that the rules will ensure that the votes       cast by proxy are accurate and carefully recorded.        I hope that this is helpful. Please do not hesitate to let       me know if I can be of further assistance.            Sincerely,                                                 Erwin Chemerinsky.     Mr. Speaker, in the letter, the dean states: ``The  Constitution bestows on each House of Congress broad discretion to  determine the rules for its own proceedings. . . . This authority is  expansive and would include the ability to adopt a rule to permit proxy  voting. Nothing in the Constitution specifies otherwise.''   I also just say to my friend that the White House isn't operating as  business as usual. My understanding is that the Vice President has been  sequestered from the President. In addition to that, everybody in the  White House is being tested multiple times before they can even get  near the President. A lot of the work is being done by video  conference. So even they are doing things differently.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Peters).                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just say to the gentleman who just spoke, I am not  intimidated, and I am not afraid; none of us are here. This isn't about  any of that. This is about doing what is sensible, what is in the  public health interest. This is not about us. It is about the people  you all come in contact with.   Those who walk around and don't wear masks, somehow as a display of  how unafraid they may be, may be carriers who are asymptomatic  spreading this disease.   This is a public health crisis. This is different than what happened  on 9/11. This is a public health crisis; that is, somebody who is  carrying this disease can spread it in a very aggressive way.   So please spare me the self-righteous kind of indignation over this.  We are supposed to follow the medical advice. We are supposed to  practice social distancing.   And yet, the Rules Committee, which is the smallest committee in the  Congress, had to meet in the Ways and Means Committee room, and we took  up the whole room. We have 21 standing committees; I don't know how  many subcommittees. Where does the Armed Services Committee meet? Where  does the Transportation Committee meet? Maybe we can meet on the House  floor, maybe one committee at a time.   I mean, the bottom line is, if we are going to follow the medical  advice, we should not paralyze this institution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Gottheimer), a distinguished member of this Chamber and a co-chair  of the Problem Solvers.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman should be happy to know  under the proposal we have, he can come here anytime he wants. He can  be in his committee. He can be on this floor and debate. But this is  for those who are in circumstances where that is impossible. It  provides an opportunity for them to participate as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am happy to provide the gentleman who just spoke with the history  of the House of Representatives as to how voting rules have changed  repeatedly.   But this radical idea that we are talking about here today, just look  to the United States Senate. I mean, they just held a hearing in their  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions where some people  were present, and some were remote. The chair and ranking member were  remote, and administration witnesses were brought in through video  conferencing.   I mean, the Senate can do it. Maybe my friends are afraid of  technology. We will get you the help. We will get you the help to make  it comfortable for you. But the bottom line is, if the Senate can do  it, if it is okay for the United States Senate, why is it not okay for  the House of Representatives?   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is obvious that the gentleman who just spoke didn't read the bill.  Nobody is asking anybody to hand off their ability to cast a vote here.  There is no discretion involved. If he reads the bill, he will figure  that out.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a May 5 opinion piece published  in The Hill from Saikrishna Prakash, a constitutional law professor  from the University of Virginia and former clerk to the late Supreme  Court Justice Antonin Scalia.                        [From the Hill, May 5, 2020]                      One Virtue of a Virtual Congress                          (By Saikrishna Prakash)         The need for social distancing has led to new demands for       distant voting. With the coronavirus in the air, Congress is       awash with proposals to allow senators and representatives to       cast votes away from the chamber floors on Capitol Hill. It       is true that desperate times call for desperate measures, but       however extreme this reform may seem, remote voting would       indeed be allowed under the Constitution. This new practice       could also lead to the reform of one regrettable habit of the       legislative branch.        The Framers likely assumed that members of the chambers       would gather in a single room in order to conduct business.       References to ``assemble'' and ``attendance'' in the       Constitution suggest as much. Congress could easily satisfy       this narrow reading of these terms if each chamber met in       cavernous spaces. For instance, the Senate could meet in the       baseball stadium where the Washington Nationals play, while       the House could gather on the football field where the       Washington Redskins play. Then legislators could easily sit       several feet apart as they work.        But the chambers need not be so constrained. Laws can have       meaning and serve purposes without being tied to the       technology of a particular era. For instance, modem       presidents have signed legislation by autopen, even though       this technology is somewhat new. The justification for this       is that so long as the president makes a decision about       whether to approve a bill, the mechanics of putting pen to       parchment are irrelevant. The same holds true for the Supreme       Court. The justices have reached decisions by phone,       sometimes hundreds of miles away from Washington. Six       justices are necessary to conduct business, and they have       concluded that voting by phone on important matters satisfies       that requirement.        Congress could do something similar. The Framers perhaps       demanded no more than for legislators to debate and       collectively reach decisions in real time. The internet       permits that live discussion and passing laws, either by       voice vote or by roll call. With the advent of technology,       one chamber can ``assemble'' virtually on Zoom, while       legislators can also attend meetings in Google. A chamber can       sit to conduct business online.        The more general point is that if legislators are       monitoring proceedings in Congress online and can vote       remotely, they are in ``attendance'' and can be present for       quorums. What is good for the president and the Supreme Court       must be good for Congress. There are positives and negatives       of remote voting, so here are two potential disadvantages.        First, Congress will no longer have the excuse of being       unable to conduct business when members go back to their       constituencies. What was once a part time assembly may become       a full time legislature, where leaders call votes during such       inconvenient times for members. Many people do wish that       Congress would return to its roots as a part time       institution. To quote Will Rogers, ``This country has come to       feel the same when Congress is in session as when the baby       gets hold of a hammer.''        Second, though legislators do not have to pay attention to       floor debates even when they are physically present, one       might suppose that they will get more distracted if they have       two browsers open, one trained on the proceedings in Congress       and one centered on Sunday Night Football. A debate on a       motion to recommit would suffer compared to a drive down the       field in the final minute of the fourth quarter.        But there would be one positive that overwhelms these       drawbacks. Last week, six members exercised the collective       authority of the Senate and passed the $484 billion       appropriation. Though the Constitution declares that a       majority of each chamber would be a quorum to do business,       the Senate had nothing like a quorum for this vote. Under       current practices, however, both chambers assume a quorum, an       assumption that can be overcome only if some legislators will       call for it.        That assumption is almost as mistaken as supposing that       lobbyists exist to further the public good. The Constitution       decrees that the chambers can pass a bill only if there is  [[Page H2025]]       a quorum. Members cannot just avert their gaze from this       violation of the Constitution. The minimum mandate for       passing legislation is not waivable. To pass legislation in a       chamber, the presence of at least a majority of the voting       members is required.        With a move to virtual sessions, Congress could cut the       embarrassment of a handful of legislators passing       legislation. If bills are uncontroversial, the chambers can       meet online, and the majority in each can pass them. All in       all, the move to remote voting could generate a salutary       reform and also eliminate at least one excrescence of the       Constitution.    In his piece, the professor says: The more general  point is that if legislators are monitoring proceedings in Congress  online and can vote remotely, they are in `attendance' and can be  present for quorums. What is good for the President and the Supreme  Court must be good for Congress.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, let me remind my colleagues what the  minority leader did suggest, and that is that all of us get  preferential treatment, in terms of testing, that we all be tested  regularly when we come back here, like they do in the White House; that  even though our constituents can't get tested, even though our hospital  workers and those who work in homeless shelters and in food pantries  can't get tested, and our first responders can't all get tested, the  minority leader suggested that: You know, you are all so special here  that you should move to the front of the line.   Well, I don't know what people in your districts think, but my  constituents think that is tone-deaf, that, quite frankly, we don't  deserve preferential treatment. But that is what he suggested.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I include in the Record a letter from Deborah Pearlstein, a  constitutional law professor from Cardozo School of Law.                                                     Cardozo Law,                                                     April 16, 2020.        Dear Chairman McGovern: Thank you for your statement today       recommending the implementation of temporary remote voting       procedures in Congress during this tragic pandemic. As a       professor of constitutional law, and a scholar who has       written extensively on separation of powers issues in U.S.       Government, I believe adopting procedures to allow for remote       voting under these extraordinary circumstances is not only       lawful, but essential to the maintenance of our       constitutional democracy. Recognizing that specific       procedures for remote voting may still be in development, the       analysis offered here focuses foremost on the broad scope of       Congress' constitutional authority to regulate its voting       procedures.        As with much else in the Constitution, the description the       text provides of how Congress is to fulfill its legislative       ``duties'' once members have been elected is relatively       brief. Article I, Section 5 provides that there must be ``a       Quorum to do business,'' which the Constitution defines as       constituting simply ``a Majority'' of each House. The same       Section likewise specifies that each House must keep a       ``Journal of its Proceedings,'' which must be published       ``from time to time,'' and which may, if a sufficient number       of members desire, reflect how every member voted ``on any       question.'' The Constitution adds that neither House can       adjourn for more than three days, or move the session to some       other place, without the consent of the other House--a       provision designed to prevent a single House from thwarting       all congressional action by simply absenting themselves       indefinitely.        There can be little question that the Framers imagined the       legislature would do its work while assembled in some       physical location. In 1787 when the Constitution was drafted,       they could scarcely have imagined any other functional way of       proceeding. Various other constitutional provisions thus       refer to Congress as ``meeting'' (Art. I, Sec. 4) or       ``assembling'' (Art. I, Sec. 3), and one even provides a       mechanism by which members can compel ``the Attendance of       absent Members,'' (Art. I, Sec. 5) meaning presumably those       members not otherwise present where Congress is meeting. Of       course, none of the clauses in which those terms appear       address how Congress casts or counts its votes. Indeed,       neither the document itself nor any Supreme Court decision       defines what counts as ``attendance'' or ``assembling,'' much       less how such ``attendance'' may be taken, or such       ``assemblage'' may be accomplished. The Constitution equally       contains no specific requirement of physical presence for       Members to vote. What the Constitution does instead--as the       courts have repeatedly recognized--is leave it up to each       House of Congress to ``determine the Rules of its       Proceedings.'' (Art. I, Sec. 5) As the Supreme Court       explained in United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1 (1892), so       long as there is a ``reasonable relation between the mode or       method of proceeding established by the rule and the result       which is sought to be attained,'' the content of those rules       are ``beyond the challenge of any other body or tribunal.''        Indeed, it is just such constitutional flexibility that has       enabled Congress to embrace the various informal solutions it       has adopted over the years to ``do business,'' including       relying on members to give ``unanimous consent'' to a vote       even if something less than an actual majority of members is       physically present on the House floor. But while such well       settled procedures are surely constitutional, they may not       always function to advance the system of majority rule the       Constitution so plainly contemplates. As we recently saw when       Congress enacted a substantial stimulus bill just last month,       it is possible for one House member, acting alone, to single-      handedly defeat the manifest preference of the bipartisan       majority by insisting upon an actual demonstration that a       majority of members were ``present'' (a term contained in       House Rules, not in the Constitution itself). This forced       House leaders to make a choice the Constitution cannot be       understood to compel--between surrendering the will of the       majority to the demands of a single man, or insisting, as       they did, that Members jeopardize their safety (and thus       their ability to effectively represent their constituents       going forward) by defying lawful public health restrictions       to travel and meet in Washington, D.C.        It is precisely in order to avoid such absurd results that       Congress has embraced a variety of measures throughout its       history to adjust to developing technologies and changing       demands. Thus, for example, current House Rules provide that       in the event the existing electronic voting system is       ``inoperable,'' the Speaker may direct the vote to be       conducted through alternative methods, including through the       use of ``tellers'' designated by the Speaker to ``record the       names of the Members voting on each side of the question.''       The teller system was an innovation put in place before the       current electronic system was available, one among key       reforms designed to strengthen Congress' ability to maintain       a public record of Members' votes. The particular challenge       of ensuring that Congress could continue to operate during       the outbreak of infectious disease was indeed the subject of       one of Congress's first efforts to provide for alternative       rules of operation. Following Congress' return after the       yellow fever epidemic that devastated the then-capital of       Philadelphia in the summer of 1793, Congress adopted a law       providing that in circumstances when ``the prevalence of       contagious sickness'' made it ``be hazardous to the lives or       health of the members to meet at the seat of Government,''       the President could ``convene Congress at such other place as       he may judge proper.'' If Congress can delegate to the       President the power to move congressional operations       entirely, surely it can reserve for itself the lesser power       to make whatever far more modest amendment to process is       required to ensure Congress is able to vote in the same,       extraordinary circumstances.        Finally, the temporary remote voting procedures as you have       sketched them thus far appear to bear an entirely       ``reasonable relation'' to the goal you aim to achieve,       namely, ensuring that Congress preserves the ability to vote       in a way that maintains the institution's representative       character, protects the transparency of its operations, and       fairly and accurately reflects the will of the American       people. By keeping remote voting procedures tied as closely       as possible to the existing system, the proposed approach       protects Members' ability to participate in votes regardless       of geographic location, technical knowledge or means;       minimizes the risk of foreign or other unlawful interference       in the vote; and maximizes Congress's ability to fairly       reflect the will of the majority of the people even during       the present crisis. The proposed approach contains essential       safeguards to ensure that Members' preferences are fully and       accurately recorded; as you emphasized in your recent       statement, Members designated to submit voting cards on       behalf of other elected Representatives may only act pursuant       to the direct, express instruction of the elected       Representative, retaining no discretion in carrying out the       ministerial function they play in the modified voting       process. As ever, Members remain subject to all the       disciplinary powers the House possesses to ensure the       appropriate exercise of their duties.        In short, with limited reforms that maximize Members'       ability to represent the wishes of their constituents, while       minimizing disruption and confusion in House operations,       Congress can succeed in preserving the essential       constitutional function of the legislative branch even amidst       an unprecedented pandemic. It is a critically important       initiative in these extraordinary times.        As ever, I thank you for your efforts, and for the       opportunity to share my views.            Sincerely,                                             Deborah N. Pearlstein,                                                  Professor of Law.    In her letter, which I strongly recommend all of my  colleagues should read in full, she says: ``I believe adopting  procedures to allow for remote voting under these extraordinary  circumstances is not only lawful, but essential to the maintenance of  our constitutional democracy.''   The Constitution contains no specific requirements of physical  presence for Members to vote. What the Constitution does instead, as  the courts have repeatedly recognized, is leave it up to each House of  Congress to ``determine the rules of its proceedings.''   The gentleman refers to the Spanish flu. Let me just say that that is  not an example of something we want to aspire to. The Congress was  basically paralyzed. They couldn't even get together to pass a bill to  provide more doctors to rural areas where people were dying. They  couldn't even do that. And as a result of Congress' inaction, more  people died in that pandemic. So, please, I mean, let's get real here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Langevin).  [[Page H2027]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I insert in the Record letters and statements of support for H. Res.  965 from Chairman Pallone, Representative Thompson, and Representative  Peters.                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                       Washington, DC, May 14, 2020.      Re H. Res. 965.       Hon. James P. McGovern,      Chairman, Committee on Rules,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McGovern: I write to you in support of H.       Resolution 965, which would authorize voting by proxy in the       House of Representatives and provide for official remote       committee proceedings. By temporarily enabling committees to       convene official proceedings remotely, this measure ensures       that the Committee on Energy and Commerce can continue to       conduct its important legislative, oversight, and fact-      finding work during these extraordinary times.        I greatly appreciate the work of the House Rules Committee       under your leadership in drafting and putting forward this       very important measure. Our Committee will work diligently to       ensure that each of our Members can participate remotely, to       the greatest extent practicable, from different locations, at       our noticed committee and subcommittee hearings, markups,       depositions and other business meetings--some or all of which       may be virtual in nature.        Thank you in advance for any further support you can       provide us in the way of Committee-specific regulations or in       addressing any questions that surface as we implement and put       these temporary rules and regulations into practice.            Respectfully submitted,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                         House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, May 13, 2020.      Hon. Jim McGovern,      Chairman, House Committee on Rules,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McGovern: I write to express my strong       support for proxy voting and allowing for flexibility, during       these unprecedented times.        The COVID-19 pandemic has created never before seen       challenges to the operation of government and the ability of       the House to conduct business. Not only are Member's health       and safety at risk but the security and integrity of the       House of Representatives, is as well. I commend you and your       committee for diligently addressing these challenges with       integrity and the dedicated intent to ensure the House can       conduct the People's business in a safe and secure manner.        This pandemic has drastically changed how our communities       operate. Many local governments and small business have       adjusted their operations and the House of Representatives       must do the same. Again, I commend you and your Committee for       your work and I wholeheartedly support proxy voting and       allowing for flexibility, during these extreme times.            Sincerely,                                                     Mike Thompson,      Member of Congress.                                   ____                                         House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, May 13, 2020.      Hon. James P. McGovern,      Chairman, House Rules Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tom Cole,      Ranking Member, House Rules Committee,      Washington, DC.        Chairman McGovern, Ranking Member Cole, and Members of the       Rules Committee: Thank you for this opportunity to comment on       the very important proposals for remote voting.        Today we face a health crisis unknown in our lifetimes--a       virus that spreads easily among us, that can hide itself as       asymptomatic for a time can suddenly turn deadly. We have no       vaccine to create herd immunity, nor a treatment nor cure,       nor even enough tests to tell us who's got it and who       doesn't. So all we can do to protect ourselves now and for       the foreseeable future, and to keep our health care system       from being overwhelmed, is to separate ourselves. That's how       we lower the chance that the virus spreads. That's why       governors and mayors across the country have ordered us to       stay at home, to work from home, and to avoid travel if we       can.        That's exactly what Congress did when we passed the CARES       Act on March 27th. Our leadership from both parties worked to       pass the bill on unanimous consent, and when one member       objected, we achieved a quorum with members who could travel       safely, often by driving alone in their cars. We encouraged       other members to stay away from planes and airports and each       other. By the way, that conveyed to the public that we in       Congress understood the health challenge--we were aware that       every time Members of Congress travel from across the country       to Washington, DC, we put each other, our staff, Capitol       Police and other workers, our families and ultimately our       constituents at risk of infection.        Since then, conditions in Washington DC have become more       dangerous--it's one of our nation's COVID hot spots. It's       high time for us to do what we've asked--and others have       ordered--our constituents to do. Figure out how to work from       home.        I've heard the argument from Senate Leader McConnell and       from some Democrats that because we ask people on the front       lines to go to work, that we lawmakers have to show up in DC       to work. But that argument misses the point. Some people--      essential workers--can't stay home. If you are a doctor or a       nurse, or someone who cleans hospital rooms, you have to go       to the hospital to do your job. If you are a grocery clerk or       checker, you have to go to the grocery store to do your job.       If you are a fire fighter, or a police officer or an EMT, you       have to go where people are in harm's way to do your job.        But if you're an accountant, or a lawyer, or a billing       clerk or any other office worker--your job is still very       important--but we've ordered you to stay home, because the       technology available today makes it possible for you to do       your job from your home. It's not great, but it's a way       Americans have stepped up to make it work, and not to become       vectors for the spread of this disease.        We in Congress are not first responders. Fundamentally, we       have office jobs--very important office jobs that a lot of       people depend on--but office jobs, consisting of phone calls,       meetings, and more meetings. Like the rest of America, we can       have our meetings electronically. We should live by the same       rules we impose on other American office workers.        We are public servants, a concept reflected in the joint       statement by Speaker Pelosi and Leader McConnell to reject       the President's offer to supply Congress with test kits. Of       course, Congress should not take test kits from hospital       workers, first responders or grocery workers. Nor should we       continue to travel and meet in a way that heightens the risk       for those same people. We should follow the lead of American       businesses, nonprofits, religious institutions and families       who have found ways to communicate effectively and to make       decisions over the phone, or in a variety of computer forums.        Tradition can be honorable, as it is in Congress. But       tradition can be a dinosaur and can hurt and slow progress.       Some traditions  [[Page H2028]]       should never be abandoned. I would never give up the       opportunity in the ordinary course of our business to see you       all face to face, to work with you in committees, to see you       twice a day on the House floor, and even to grab dinner after       work. But in the face of this once in a lifetime global       pandemic, we need to overcome the default position--that the       way we've always done it is the only way it can be done.       Congress has adapted to jet travel, to electronic voting and       to making our work public on CSPAN. We can adapt to remote       work.        It will be difficult, but not as difficult as we might       imagine. Just look at how the remote skeptics propose we       conduct our business. We would fly from across the country,       making connections and taking transportation from Dulles       Airport or Baltimore Washington International. Then we would       isolate ourselves in our DC residences. Then, if we live too       far to walk or don't have a car in DC, we would take transit       or be driven to our offices, and we would isolate there. And       to participate in our committees, we would make a phone call       from our office in Rayburn or Longworth or Cannon to the       committee room. Yet all of us have phones in our homes in our       districts, and any of us could call the committees from       there.        We've also heard that in person committee meetings will       take up a tremendous amount of physical space. For our larger       committees, like Transportation and Infrastructure or Armed       Services, only the House chamber is big enough. If all of our       committees were to meet in person, it would be impossible for       them to meet at the same times. Remote participation is       probably the only practical way to allow all committees to       function at the same time, and thereby for all members to       participate in the legislative process on behalf or their       millions of constituents.        Remote voting is not cowardice. It's leadership. In the       face of this pandemic, getting Congress to work remotely is       an example for the rest of the country that meets this       moment. Let us live by the same rules we impose on our fellow       citizens. Let's find a way that allows all of our       constituents to have a voice. Let's show by our action that       we ourselves take this threat seriously.        I thank you for your leadership in this difficult moment.            Sincerely,                                                   Scott H. Peters,                                                Member of Congress.     Mr. Speaker, I am glad that the gentleman who  previously spoke says he wants to extend it for nurses, doctors, and  teachers. He has a chance to do that in the next bill we are going talk  about because there is money in there to provide them more assistance  in terms of testing and treatment and tracing and more money there for  PPE. But my guess is the gentleman is going to vote ``no'' on that.   The same people who are out here talking about being brave and  standing up with our first responders are the same people whose leader  has said that his proposal is to prioritize Members of Congress ahead  of all of our constituents in terms of testing so we can operate here.  I don't want to have anything to do with that. My constituents who are  on the front lines, the doctors, the nurses, the first responders  deserve to be tested before anybody in this House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts  (Mrs. Trahan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman will be happy to know he will have 2 hours of debate on  how to help our constituents. I have a feeling he is going to vote  ``no.'' He is going to vote ``no'' to help our teachers, our first  responders. He is going to vote ``no'' to help States, cities, and  towns. That is unfortunate, but we are going to move it forward.   Mr. Speaker, I insert in the Record letters and statements of support  for H. Res. 965 from Representative Kildee, Representative Jeffries,  and Representative Pocan.                                     Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, May 13, 2020.      Hon. Jim McGovern,      Chairman, Committee on Rules,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tom Cole,      Ranking Member, Committee on Rules,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole: We write       today in strong support of the H. Res. 965, which temporarily       implements remote voting in the full U.S. House of       Representatives and remote committee proceedings during this       public health emergency due to the coronavirus.        Members of Congress must continue to faithfully and safely       execute the duties of our office while acting in accordance       with the social distancing guidelines outlined by medical       experts. The suggested temporary rules would allow for       Members to proxy vote on behalf of those Members who cannot       safely travel to Washington, D.C. This proposed proxy voting       system strictly governs the rules where a remote Member would       send a letter to the Clerk designating a proxy. Members may       serve as a designated proxy for up to ten Members and must       receive exact written instruction on each vote. While there       is no precedent on the House Floor for proxy voting, there is       precedent in House Committees, where it was in place until       the 104th Congress.        The implementation of H. Res. 965 would allow committees to       hold virtual hearings, markups, and depositions enabling       Members to perform vital oversight, conduct fact finding and       bring legislation to the Floor. Especially during this       national emergency, Congress must continue to do the work of       American people, especially overseeing the trillions of       dollars allocated by the federal government so far to combat       the pandemic.  [[Page H2029]]       Members also have the responsibility to model compliance with       the guidelines recommended by the leading science and health       experts without dereliction of our duties. Proxy voting       allows for Members to be engaged in work at the Capitol while       ensuring their safety and those in their communities.        As the Congress continues to find innovate ways to remain       in service of the American people, I am supportive of the       provision in H. Res. 965 that will direct the Committee on       House Administration to study the use of technology to allow       Members to vote remotely in the House. After certification       has been completed determining secure and operable technology       for remote voting, the Rules Committee would issue guidance       and regulations for implementation that can be authorized by       the Speaker to allow Members to cast their votes remotely       during the time period covered by the resolution.        We appreciate your hard work on this and the solicitation       of advice and ideas from Members for many weeks, including       members of both parties. It is our hope that these rules are       only necessary for a short period of time and the House of       Representatives can return to their normal functions in a       safe manner to help families and workers impacted by this       terrible health crisis.        Additional Cosigners: Rep. Ed Perlmutter, Rep. Andy Levin,       Rep. Alan Lowenthal, Rep. Brenda Lawrence.            Sincerely,                                                  Daniel T. Kildee,      Member of Congress.                                   ____                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, May 13, 2020.      Hon. James P. McGovern,      Chairman, Committee on Rules,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McGovern: Thank you for your ongoing       leadership during this time of crisis. Please see my       statement below in support of remote voting by proxy:        As the House continues its work during this trying time, we       must have a safe, secure and reliable way of conducting our       most essential duty--passing legislation on behalf of the       American people. Remote voting by proxy offers a temporary,       commonsense solution that will allow the House to operate       safely and effectively during this crisis. The proposal       crafted by Chairman McGovern allows committees to continue       their important work remotely, while also providing Members       with the ability to vote on legislation without the threat of       hacking or undue influence from bad actors. I stand in strong       support of the proposal and believe it is the best path       forward as we continue to confront this pandemic.            Best,            Congressman Hakeem Jeffries,      Chairman, House Democratic Caucus.                                   ____                                         House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, May 14, 2020.      Hon. Jim McGovern,      Chairman, House Rules Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McGovern: I write in support of efforts to       ensure Members of Congress are able to vote on essential       legislation while not physically present in Washington, D.C.       during the coronavirus pandemic. Numerous states, including       the Wisconsin Legislature, and other nations, including the       British Parliament, have already instituted successful       virtual legislative meeting procedures.        While I intend to be physically present and voting this       week, I know several of our colleagues will be unable to vote       in person due to health or travel difficulties. Foreseeing       this eventuality, the Congressional Progressive Caucus issued       a Whip Question to its Members several weeks ago to measure       support for instituting virtual voting in the House of       Representatives. Responses from the Caucus were       overwhelmingly in support.        I support remote voting efforts in Congress in whatever       form they may take, and plan to vote in favor of implementing       legislation when it is presented to the full U.S. House of       Representatives. I thank you for your friendship and look       forward to continuing to work together on this and other       matters.            Sincerely,                                                     Mark Pocan,                                                 Member of Congress,                                      Co-Chair, Progressive Caucus.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I insert in the Record an April 14 AP news article entitled,  ``Wisconsin Assembly OKs Virus Bill in First Virtual Session.''                [From the Associated Press, April 14, 2020]         Wisconsin Assembly OKs Virus Bill in First Virtual Session                             (By Todd Richmond)         Madison, Wis. (AP).--The Wisconsin Assembly overwhelmingly       approved a sweeping coronavirus relief bill Tuesday during a       virtual session, the first time state lawmakers have gathered       since the pandemic began in the United States.        The session took place in the Assembly chamber as usual,       but due to concerns about spreading the virus nearly two-      thirds of the body's 99 members attended via videoconference.       The Senate was to hold a similar session on Wednesday to send       the bill on to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.        It marked the first time in Wisconsin's 172-year history       that lawmakers convened a session with members participating       remotely. Legislative rules require lawmakers to be present       to debate and vote on bills but a 2009 law allows for virtual       sessions during disasters.        One section of the Assembly gallery was open to the public,       with only 14 seats available and each spread out 6 feet       apart. Public seating, also 6 feet apart, was available in       the Capitol rotunda with speakers and TVs tuned to WisEye,       the Legislature's version of C-SPAN. Two large TV screens,       tuned to Skype, were set up on the Assembly chamber floor.       About 35 members sat in the chamber, all spaced several seats       apart. Many rows were empty. Several pages wore face masks,       as did Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz. He was the only       Democrat on the floor.        The session got off to a slow start as Chief Clerk Pat       Fuller tried to call the roll. Lawmakers joined from their       kitchens, Capitol offices and home offices and struggled to       unmute themselves and register their attendance before Fuller       moved on to the next legislator. Some seemed amused at the       setup, smiling and waving to the camera. Others initially       appeared befuddled, apparently unable to hear or to figure       out how to be heard. Roll call votes took minutes as Fuller       asked each lawmaker individually for his or her vote. In a       normal world voting is almost instantaneous as lawmakers       signal their votes from their seats with the touch of a       button.        Moments before adjourning for a 10-minute receess, Speaker       Pro Tempore Tyler August warned lawmakers not to touch their       laptops during the break because if they disconnected       themselves they wouldn't be able to log back in. Assembly       Speaker Robin Vos, one of the few legislators on the floor,       said setting up the virtual session was ``extremely       challenging'' and he hoped the Assembly would never have to       meet that way again.        The process smoothed out as the session progressed. The       chamber ended up approving the bill 97-2.        The legislation largely ensures that Wisconsin can capture       the $2.3 billion coming to the state under the federal       stimulus bill, including higher Medicaid payments and       unemployment benefits. The Legislature's budget committee       would be allowed to allocate up to $75 million in funding       during the public health emergency and up to 90 days after it       ends.        The measure also would waive the state's one-week waiting       period to receive unemployment for anyone who applies between       March and Feb. 7, 2021; ban certain insurers from prohibiting       coverage based on a COVID-19 diagnosis; ease licensing and       credentialing for health care workers; reduce nurse training       hour requirements; and render health providers immune from       civil liability for services provided during the pandemic.       Local municipalities also could choose to defer their       residents' property tax payments.        Evers' administration has been working closely with Vos and       Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald on the bill. The       governor did not say Monday whether he supported the bill,       saying he had not reviewed it, but  [[Page H2032]]       he hoped it wouldn't be the last action taken by the       Legislature to offer aid during the pandemic.        Nineteen states had allocated more than $3 billion to       respond to the pandemic as of Friday, according to the       National Conference of State Legislatures and the Wisconsin       Policy Forum.        As of Tuesday, COVID-19 had killed 170 people in Wisconsin       and infected more than 3,500. Among those who contracted the       virus and recovered is Democratic state Rep. David Bowen, of       Milwaukee.        Vos and Hintz were the only lawmakers who spoke about the       bill prior to the vote. Hintz said the Legislature should be       prepared to return to work on further legislation that helps       Evers deal with the pandemic.        ``We should make sure we are listening, enabling and       supporting and giving (the Evers administration) the       flexibility to manage this crisis,'' he said. ``I refuse to       admit this is all we can do as a state.''        But Vos cautioned against giving Evers ``blank checks'' as       the virus wreaks ``economic carnage'' on the state's       finances. He said he was disappointed the bill didn't freeze       state spending in fiscal year 2020-21 and lamented that state       workers will still get an automatic 2% raise.        ``We have to be just like a family were the credit card use       is limited,'' Vos said. ``Think before we spend. Make       investments that are wise but not wanting.''     Mr. Speaker, I insert in the Record a May 6 Boston  Globe article entitled, ``For the First Time in 400 Years, Mass.  Lawmakers Vote Remotely.''                    [From the Boston Globe, May 6, 2020]       For the First Time in 400 Years, Mass. Lawmakers Vote Remotely                              (By Matt Stout)         With lawmakers dialing in from across the state, the       Massachusetts House of Representatives on Wednesday voted       remotely for the first time in the body's near 400-year       history, and officially relaunched formal lawmaking amid the       novel coronavirus pandemic.        The historic session, which lasted roughly an hour,       included one substantive vote: a 157-0 roll call approving a       bill that would allow the state to borrow billions of dollars       over the next eight weeks to help pay its bills.        It came amid a surreal scene. As a smattering of people,       including House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo, held court in a       mostly empty chamber, dozens of representatives called in to       a network of conference call lines, where other lawmakers       gathered and recorded their votes.        A livestream offered a view inside, showing a half-circle       of stanchions surrounding the rostrum to separate DeLeo,       House clerk Steve T. James, a court officer, and others--all       of whom were wearing masks--from the rows of seats where       representatives would otherwise be stationed.        Where they actually were ran the gamut. Representative       William Driscoll Jr., a Milton Democrat, tweeted a photo from       his car parked in the Blue Hills Reservation, the livestream       playing from a phone propped up on his dashboard.       Representative Tram T. Nguyen shared a picture of her logged       in from a kitchen countertop. Representative Susannah Whipps       showed off a plate of vegetables on her Twitter feed.        House leaders discussed for weeks how to relaunch formal       legislative sessions amid the spread of COVID-19, after       spending the better part of two months moving bills through       informal gatherings with no debate and where a single ``no''       vote could stall legislation.        The set of emergency rules was approved Monday, but only       after a heated, partisan dispute that started when House       minority leader Bradley H. Jones blocked the rules package,       arguing that it effectively limited how often most       representatives would be allowed to speak.        He had accused DeLeo of using the crisis to ``achieve more       power,'' while the Winthrop Democrat lashed out at what he       called the Republicans' ``recklessness and fiscal       irresponsibility.'' (The House couldn't pass the borrowing       bill unless the House held a formal vote.)        Jones and DeLeo ultimately agreed to a revision this week       that allows some Republicans, including Jones, more chances       to speak during legislative debates under the new rules,       which could remain in effect until as late as January.        Such back-and-forth was largely absent from Wednesday's       otherwise smooth session, though it included some awkward but       harmless hiccups as lawmakers adjusted to their new remote       reality.        Shortly before DeLeo opened the session, a voice fluttered       through on the livestream.        ``Hello?'' a lawmaker asked.        Another voice quickly cut in, informing him he had       accidentally called a number connected to a microphone within       the chamber. ``You're actually dialed into the rostrum       line,'' he was told.        Later, when Representative Denise Garlick called in to       speak on the borrowing bill, a delayed feedback from the       session was audible over the livestream--trailing the chamber       by several moments and causing Garlick to pause for several       moments after DeLeo recognized her.        When she wrapped her testimony, a long pause again settled       over the line, and the phrase ``[Audio difficulties]'' popped       up on the livestream feed.        ``Is the representative finished with her remarks?'' DeLeo       eventually asked.        ``Yes,'' Garlick said.        Representative Harold P. Naughton was the only lawmaker not       to cast a vote, but the Clinton Democrat had a good excuse: A       lieutenant colonel in the Massachusetts Army National Guard,       he was activated roughly a month ago and is reporting to       Hanscom Air Force Base through May 31, he said Wednesday.        ``I've been pushing back information that I feel my       colleagues need from the vantage point of the National       Guard,'' he said in a phone call, adding he did listen to the       session. ``It was pretty historic.''        The Legislature owes its roots to Colonial times, when the       ``General Court'' gathered for the first time in 1629 in       London and later became the government of the Massachusetts       Bay Colony. Amid its various iterations, members have met in       person to cast votes, and House leaders initially questioned       whether the state's constitution even allowed it to conduct       remote voting.        The House's emergency rules try to limit who could be in       the chamber to DeLeo and Jones; Aaron Michlewitz, DeLeo's       budget chairman; eight ``monitors'' who would tally votes       from members on conference call lines; and a few other       Republicans, Democrats, and staff.        The bill the chamber passed Wednesday allows the state       treasurer to borrow any ``necessary'' amount this fiscal year       and pay it back by June 2021. Donning a gray mask, Michlewitz       said from the House floor that the amount could be ``in the       range of $3 billion,'' though it will depend on how the       state's finances weather the pandemic.        The legislation was first filed by Governor Charlie Baker       amid fears the state could face a budget gap after pushing       its April 15 tax filing deadline into July, potentially       diverting huge chunks of money it would otherwise collect now       into next fiscal year.        That appeared to already be happening. Massachusetts tax       revenues plummeted last month, dropping more than 50 percent       below what the state collected at this time a year ago. The       $1.98 billion in taxes the state collected in April--      typically the biggest tax month--was more than $2 billion       below state projections.        ``A staggering number to say the least,'' Michlewitz said.        So, after Garlick and Representative Todd Smola, a Warren       Republican, spoke in support of the bill, DeLeo teed up a       roll call. Minutes later, he documented the 157-0 tally to       officially move the bill to the Senate, where leaders are       weighing their own rules to hold a remote session.        ``Congratulations,'' DeLeo said to representatives watching       and listening in. And he rapped the gavel to close the       session.     Mr. Speaker, I insert in the Record an April 1 Courier  Journal article entitled, ``Kentucky House Dramatically Limits In- Person Voting on Bills Due to Coronavirus Concerns.''            [From the Louisville Courier Journal, Apr. 1, 2020]    Kentucky House Dramatically Limits In-Person Voting on Bills Due to                            Coronavirus Concerns                               (By Joe Sonka)         Frankfort, Ky.--For the first time in the history of the       Kentucky General Assembly, a large majority of House members       voted on bills remotely by texting photos of their paper       ballot via phone.        The move is part of rule changes adopted Wednesday out of       concern about the coronavirus pandemic.        The change was agreed on by leadership of the Republican       majority and Democratic minority of the House in order to       keep members from being in close proximity on the floor of       the chamber, as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in       Kentucky continued to increase.        On Monday, lawmakers learned that a legislative staffer had       tested positive for the coronavirus, though no legislators       had announced testing positive as of Wednesday.        In a press release announcing the rules change shortly       before the House gaveled in on Wednesday, House Speaker David       Osborne, R-Prospect, said the pandemic is a historic       challenge to the state, and his chamber ``is willing to take       equally historic steps to meet our Constitutional obligations       to the people of Kentucky.''        ``I appreciate the support of our Caucus members, House       Minority Leadership, and our staff in making it possible to       use every tool available to us in order to finish our work''       Osborne stated.        In order to adopt the rules change to allow remote voting,       House leadership allowed members to enter in groups of 25 to       cast their vote as present and in favor of amending the       rules.        Under the rules change, members could text a photo of their       paper ballot vote to designated members of their party who       remained on the House floor and cast their votes.        Following the approval of the rules change, members voted       89-1 to adopt Senate Bill 249--freezing the pension       contribution rate of local government employers--in a nearly       empty chamber.        The three Democratic leadership members remained on the       floor as vote designates, while three Republicans remained as       vote designates along with Osborne and two other GOP members       of leadership.  [[Page H2033]]         Two Democratic House members--Reps. Terri Branham Clark and       Nima Kulkarni--were seen casting their votes on the bill from       their cars in the parking lot outside the Capitol Building.        Part of the reason Democratic leadership agreed to the       change was a pledge they received from Republicans that the       House would take up only vital budget and revenue bills on       the floor Wednesday, and not unrelated bills.        After the passage of SB 249, Rep. Chris Harris, D-      Pikeville, entered the chamber and spoke in praise of       Osborne's move to change the voting rules--noting that two       weeks earlier he spoke on the floor denouncing House       Republicans' decision to remain in session and vote on bills       that were not related to a state budget or responding to the       coronavirus crisis.        ``I thank you for taking these historic and unprecedented       measures to protect not only our members, but our families       and communities,'' Harris said. ``I was critical when I felt       you weren't getting it right, so I want to be just as vocal       in complimenting you today.''        The House later used the same voting method to approve a       one-year state budget for the executive branch and other       appropriations and revenue bills that passed the Senate       earlier in the day.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I insert in the Record an April 22 Washington Post article entitled,  ``U.K.'s Zoom Parliament Launches With a Few Glitches But Shows Virtual  Democracy May Work for a While.''                 [From the Washington Post, Apr. 22, 2020]   U.K.'s Zoom Parliament Launches With a Few Glitches But Shows Virtual                       Democracy May Work for a While                             (By William Booth)         London.--Britain's extraordinary first ``Parliament via       Zoom'' proceeded Wednesday in rather ordinary fashion, with       the usual barbed questions and artful evasion by politicians,       plus the addition of awkward views of oversize chins and       bookshelves staged as backdrops.        Everything was the same, and everything was a little odd.        Breaking 700 years of tradition, the British Parliament has       agreed to serve as a cradle of virtual democracy--to allow       members to continue to debate, vote and legislate, but via       video conferencing app, from the safety of their own homes,       for the duration of Britain's coronavirus lockdown.        On Wednesday, there were a few minor technical hiccups.       Some lawmakers' heads were cropped at the eyebrows by the bad       framing. Their mics were sometimes too close or too far away,       or the Internet connection bad, and so voices sounded tinny       or muffled or like Darth Vader.        But all in all, for no rehearsals? Not a bad opening       matinee.        For centuries, it has been essential for members of       Parliament to be present in the Houses of Commons or Lords to       vote. That's why special ``division bells'' ring out in       Westminster's offices and committee rooms--and many bars--      alerting lawmakers they have eight minutes to enter their       lobbies, before doors are bolted shut.        Now, instead, they will get a ping on their mobile phones.        Britain is trying out ``hybrid proceedings,'' where up to       50 lawmakers can be in the House of Commons--spaced six feet       apart on the green leather benches--while another 150 of the       650 members can join by Zoom.        Wednesday's premiere featured the weekly thrust-and-parry       session known as ``Prime Minister's Questions,'' or PMQs.        Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab stood at the despatch box in       place of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is recovering from       the bout of covid-19 that put him in the hospital for a week.        In the sparsely populated House of Commons, Raab was       quizzed by the new leader of the opposition Labour Party,       Keir Starmer, who was prosecutorial in his questioning,       insisting the government was slow to order a lockdown, slow       to do widespread testing for the virus and slow to get vital       protective gowns, masks and visors into the hands of front-      line medical workers.        Speaker Lindsay Hoyle called on lawmakers by swiveling his       head toward what appeared to be a TV monitor and shouting a       version of: ``We are now going over to Stephen Kinnock.       STEPHEN KINNOCK!''        Shouting at a television being a time-honored tradition       everywhere.        And then Kinnock, a Labour lawmaker from Wales, popped on       the screen for those watching on Parliament TV--including       Washington Post reporters--from their homes.        At one point, Hoyle shouted for David Mundell, a Scottish       Conservative, who didn't answer.        ``Unable to connect,'' the speaker said, perhaps creating a       new meme, like the famous ``orrrrrder, orrrrder!'' from past       days. So they moved on.        In another exchange, Peter Bone, a Conservative from       Wellingborough, was complaining about his constituents having       to live off their overdraft accounts. ``What on earth is       going on?'' Bone demanded. ``When are the banks going to work       in the nation interest and . . .''        Then his Zoom link went dead.        Raab said, ``I got the gist,'' and answered anyway.        Legislatures around the world are sorting out how to       proceed during the pandemic. Some--such as the German       Bundestag and Irish Dail--are continuing to meet in person       but with social distancing measures. Canada's Parliament is       trying a mix of in-person and virtual, while the U.S. House       of Representatives is fighting over a proxy voting proposal.        The Brits showed that it was possible to carry on.        The Guardian newspaper's Andrew Sparrow observed: ``PMQs       without 400-odd MPs in the chamber makes everything quieter,       calmer, more intelligible and more grown-up. . . . Without       the jeering and the aggro, it lacked gladiatorial edge, and       frankly it was probably a bit more boring than the old PMQs.       But boring is a much underrated virtue in governance.''        Raab was questioned pointedly about the government's       performance during the outbreak.        Labour lawmaker Barry Gardiner stated that the government's       scientific advisory group on emergencies recommended a       lockdown at the end of February. ``The government claims it       has followed scientific advice,'' he said. ``But it hasn't,       has it?''        Starmer asked Raab how it will be possible to go from the       current 18,000 coronavirus tests a day to the 100,000       promised by the government by the end of the month.        Raab sought to correct Starmer, pointing out that the       ``capacity'' stands at 40,000.        Starmer wasn't having it. ``I didn't need correcting       because I gave the figure for actual tests being carried out,       which is 18,000,'' he said.        At the end of the session, Raab was asked by a Labour       lawmaker if Britain would be ``drawn into the U.S.       president's disgraceful vendetta against the World Health       Organization.''        President Trump has cut off funding to the WHO because he       says the international body sides too closely with China,       where the virus first exploded onto the scene.        Raab said Britain supported international efforts and was a       ``leading player, whether it's on vaccines or supporting       vulnerable countries, in helping to get through what is a       global crisis.''        He said the WHO has ``has a role to play. It's not perfect,       no international institution is--we do need to work to reform       it. But we made clear we consider it an important part of the       international response.''    Mr. Speaker, breaking 700 years of tradition, I also  insert in the Record a March 26 Politico article entitled, ``Corona-era  European Parliament: Empty Chamber and E-Voting.''                     [From the Politico, Mar. 27, 2020]         Corona-era European Parliament: Empty Chamber and e-Voting                           (By Maia De La Baume)         The chamber was almost empty, even for a presidential       address. One lawmaker wore a face mask. And deputies voted       remotely for the first time in the assembly's 62-year       history.        Welcome to the European Parliament in the age of social       distancing.        The Parliament's special one-day plenary session on       Thursday, held to pass a series of corona virus emergency       measures, was a mixture of the strange, the surreal and the       historic.        Only a handful of the Parliament's 705 members sat in the       hemicycle chamber in Brussels. The rest were scattered across       the  [[Page H2034]]       Continent, following via video-link and voting by email from       their home countries.        When European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen       delivered a speech chastising EU member countries for       thinking only of themselves at the start of the crisis, she       stood meters apart from any aides and MEPs.        Parliament President David Sassoli, back in the building       following a fortnight working from home after a visit to his       home country of Italy, called the session ``special and       atypical.''        ``It is the first time that a democratic parliament uses       remote participation, this has never happened before,''       Sassoli told MEPs after a first round of emailed votes. ``The       European Parliament is called on to experiment with things in       this way at a moment for great danger for our citizens.''        As experiments go, this one was quite radical.        The Parliament's regular plenary venue of Strasbourg has       been abandoned for the next few months, at least. As much as       the Parliament has a physical home at all right now, it's       Brussels.        Plenary sessions are normally four days long. But on       Thursday everything was crammed into a one-day marathon to       push through three coronavirus-related measures, including       freeing up 37 billion in EU funding for member governments       and temporarily allowing airlines not to use their slots at       airports.        Some of the Parliament's usual quirks were suspended--such       as the ``catch the eye'' procedure whereby MEPs signal to the       president that they wish to speak, and the blue cards raised       to indicate a wish to question a fellow member.        Fewer ushers than usual roamed the chamber and they kept       their distance from one another. Interpreters sat alone in       their booths, rather than being crammed in with colleagues.       Journalists were advised to stay away and watched via video       stream.        Among the few MEPs who attended in person, Fulvio       Martusciello of Italy wore a large white face mask. A Spanish       MEP sported a new beard, perhaps a result of personal       confinement.        In the Parliament, MEPs usually vote by raising their hands       or by pushing a button on their desks to give their verdict       on dozens or more amendments before adopting a final       legislative proposal.        But on Thursday they considered only a few amendments as       legislation was rushed through under an emergency procedure.       And they voted from all across Europe by printing out a form,       then signing, scanning and emailing it to the Parliament.        For some, such technological advances were long overdue.

For some, such technological advances were long overdue.        ``Corona drags the European Parliament into the 21st       century,'' tweeted Dutch center-left MEP Lara Wolters, above       a picture of her smiling as she signed a ballot paper.        Bulgarian center-right MEP Eva Maydell also endorsed the       innovation. But, she added, ``this way of voting is only       feasible for single votes. We need another solution for       longer votes.''        Some MEPs apparently doubted their colleagues were up to       the challenge of the new system. German Green MEP Rasmus       Andresen asked his fellow lawmakers on Twitter not to ``send       your votes to all colleagues (dont push the ``reply all''       Button). It's good to be transparent, but i dont want to       receive about 2000 emails with your votes in my inbox       today.'' (No older MEPs shot back by criticizing his lack of       apostrophes or use of upper and lower case letters.)        Other MEPs complained about formatting issues with the       first ballots that were sent to them, including trouble       converting the documents into a PDF if they were using Apple       devices.        Dita Charanzova from the centrist Renew Europe group told       POLITICO the Parliament should have gone entirely digital and       regretted that staff such as ushers had to attend, given that       people are meant to be staying at home for health reasons.        ``We are now a digital Parliament, no one should have to       take a risk just for a few members in an empty room,''       Charanzova said. ``It's ridiculous to see the Commission       there, and some MEPs. We should have gone completely digital       for this plenary and for all future plenaries until the       crisis is over.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have been inserting various articles into the Record  showing other States and other parliaments and congresses across the  world operating remotely to prove a point that it can be done.   I don't know whether my Republican friends are just intimidated by  technology. I mean, listening to some of them, I think they think  bifocals are a radical idea. But the bottom line is: We can do this.   The United States Senate had a remote hearing, and it worked out just  fine.   The bottom line is that we are in the middle of a health crisis, a  pandemic, and we need to make sure that we can continue to do our work  in a safe and orderly way.   I mean, if I were cynical, I would think the reason my Republican  friends are against this is to make sure we don't do anything. And I  get it. They may not like the fact that we are trying to address the  needs and the concerns of the American people, but we are going to do  this, and I hope we get a bipartisan vote on this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), our distinguished majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a May 13 letter from Norman  Ornstein, a current resident scholar at the American Enterprise  Institute in support of our plan here.                                                      May 13, 2020.        Dear Chairman McGovern: I want to commend you for the       careful and thoughtful report you have issued and on which       the House will soon act to provide the first important and       meaningful steps to allow the House to operate during a dire       emergency that may leave large numbers of members unable to       work and be present in the Capitol to meet, vote and do other       important business, including crafting and marking up       legislation and doing important oversight.        As you know, I have been focused since 9/11 on making sure       we have a functioning Congress at times of emergency;       Congress is the first article in the Constitution, the first       branch, for a reason, and it is essential for our freedom and       our system of democracy that it be working and acting at all       times, but especially during crises. The alternative is       government by executive fiat, or no government at all. That       spurred the creation of the Continuity of Government       Commission, co-chaired by the late Lloyd Cutler and former       Senator Alan Simpson, and which I have served as senior       counselor.        My first interests, of course, stemmed from the terrorist       attacks in 2001, but they were broadened by the anthrax scare       that followed shortly thereafter. If it had been more       directed and concerted, it could have resulted in widespread       deaths and incapacitations of lawmakers in the House and       Senate, meaning no quorum to meet the express Constitutional       requirement and therefore no Congress for months or longer.       That set of events also meant that in our Continuity of       Government Commission, we had to consider the possibility of       a crisis that could include a bio-attack, a pandemic, or a       natural disaster. One of the things we discussed and       considered, especially reflecting the interest of your       colleague Jim Langevin, was the need to have a capability for       Congress to debate and vote remotely if members were       scattered across the country and could not meet together face       to face in the Capitol or another designated forum.        Unfortunately, Congress, in the nearly 20 years since 9/11,       took no significant steps to deal with these issues. Now they       are back in a very serious way. COVID-19 is deadly,       especially for older Americans and especially so when large       numbers of people congregate closely together physically,       which is a characteristic of Congress. As the congressional       physician noted, meeting together in the traditional way is       currently dangerous for lawmakers, their staffs, all those       working in the Capitol complex, and all those they come into       contact with. Travel on common carriers like airlines or       trains is also dangerous, and it is possible that airlines       will be shut down or curtailed enough that lawmakers back       home would not be able to get back to the Capitol if there       were an urgent need to meet to act for the benefit of the       American people.        So the steps you have proposed, along with Majority Leader       Hoyer and House Administration Chair Lofgren are thoughtful,       balanced and sensitive to the need to create a plan to meet       and vote remotely, while also understanding that this is a       big step, given both the traditions of the House and the       imperatives built into the Constitution. You commendably       recognize that this first set of steps should be temporary,       triggered only when absolutely necessary, and can and should       be followed by additional action when we are confident that       there are secure and usable technologies to allow remote       voting, remote debate and deliberation, remote markups in       committees, and so on. And you have pledged that you will       write regulations that will balance the needs of majority and       minority, be transparent, and avoid the kinds of manipulation       that can occur with unlimited proxy voting.        I hope the House, in a bipartisan fashion, will endorse       your plan and make sure we have a functioning House       throughout this terrible crisis, to do what the Framers       expected from the people's house, and to protect the       interests and liberties of all of us.        Sincerely,                                                Norman Ornstein,                                                   Resident Scholar,                                 The American Enterprise Institute.     Mr. Speaker, in response to the gentleman who just  spoke, I don't know what he is talking about, but there is nothing in  this package that we are presenting that would undermine minority  rights. I am happy to urge him to have his staff contact ours, but what  he is talking about has nothing to do with what we are discussing here  today.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the good news is that the gentleman  doesn't have to give anything up.   Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman just said that we had an  official virtual hearing in this House.   I want to know whether or not, under the rules that currently exist,  is it allowed for there to be official hearings virtually or remotely?    Mr. Speaker, I will take it as there was not a hearing.    Not a hearing.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The distinguished minority leader asked the question: Why should we  be treated differently from anyone else in this country? That is  actually a very good question, and that is why we rejected his proposal  and his idea that Members of Congress get preferential treatment, that  we move to the front of the line with regard to tests at a time when  our doctors and our nurses and our teachers and volunteers in homeless  shelters and in food banks can't get a test, but somehow we are so  special that we should move to the front of the line.   We rejected that. And quite frankly, it is one of the reasons why  people have a bad feeling sometimes about Congress because of when they  hear those kinds of suggestions.   Quite frankly, I am ashamed that even that idea was brought forward  in a serious way. I know they do this at the White House, but the idea  that we would step ahead of everybody else doesn't make any sense.   Mr. Speaker, to hear some of my Republican friends, you would think  this House conducts its business today, in 2020, just as it did in  1798. But that is just not true. A lot has changed these last 230  years, from the way we vote to the way we count a quorum. Americans are  watching and they are listening to this debate live right now because  of actions Congress took decades ago to adapt to new technology.   The changes that we are talking about here aren't permanent ones like  that. These are temporary, to be used only during this pandemic. Once  it is over, we go back to working side by side and in person.   State legislatures and governments around the world have already  acted to make remote voting possible. I really don't know why some  people here believe that this House is somehow different. We can't  afford to let this pandemic stop our legislative work in its tracks.   And I would say to the minority leader: We want to do our work, and  we want to do the oversight to make sure that the administration  appropriates the money that we fought to get to the American people the  right way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
