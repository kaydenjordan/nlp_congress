Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, every year under General Secretary Xi Jinping and his  Chinese Communist Party, between 60,000 to 100,000 young victims,  average age 28, are murdered in cold blood to steal their organs.   These crimes against humanity are unimaginably cruel. Ethnic groups  targeted for this mass harvesting include Uyghurs who suffer from Xi  Jinping's ongoing genocide and the Falun Gong, whose peaceful  meditation and exercise practices and exceptional good health make  their organs highly desirable.   The Chinese Communist Party has declared them to be an evil cult fit  for butchering.   Mr. Speaker, in May of last year, I chaired an absolutely chilling  congressional hearing at the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission titled  ``Forced Organ Harvesting in China: Examining the Evidence.''   The China Tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice--and this is the man  who prosecuted Slobodan Milosevic at the International Criminal  Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, a tribunal that I worked very hard  on and was very supportive of, as were other Members of this body-- conducted the world's first independent legal analysis of forced organ  harvesting from prisoners of conscience in China.   Sir Geoffrey Nice testified at my hearing and said, ``Forced organ  harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a  significant scale,'' and he said that ``. . . Falun Gong practitioners  have been one--and probably the main--source of organ supply.''   He said the Falun Gong and the Uyghurs in the PRC each qualify as a  ``group'' for purposes of the crime of genocide.   Ethan Gutmann, Senior Research Fellow in China Studies, Victims of  Communism Memorial Foundation, testified that the Kilgour-Matas-Gutmann  report of 2016 estimated China's total transplant volume--this is  forced transplantations--at 60,000 to 100,000 annually.   Mr. Gutmann also pointed out ``. . . at any given time since 2017,  there are approximately a million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and Hui in  the camps.'' These are the concentration camps, of course, made up  mostly of Muslims.                                time  1715    He said his estimate is that 25,000 to 50,000 camp detainees are  being harvested every year. Again, he says 28-year-olds from the  Xinjiang camps can be harvested for two or three organs each,  translating into a maximum of about 150,000 organs.   Another expert witness who testified at our hearing, Matthew  Robertson of the Australian National University, coauthored with Dr.  Jacob Lavee an examination of Chinese medical journal articles and  found that ``71 papers gave explicit descriptions of surgeons appearing  to violate the dead donor rule while procuring hearts from prisoners.  In plain language, the papers appear to show that the donors, who were  prisoners, were alive at the time of surgery and were killed by  transplant surgeons in the process of heart extraction.''   Their work, published last April in a top peer-reviewed U.S. medical  journal,  [[Page H1448]]  ``The American Journal of Transplantation'' provided additional  evidence of the People's Republic of China's egregious practices and  violation of international standards. These are, again, crimes against  humanity.   Robert Destro, the former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy,  Human Rights, and Labor testified that, ``The size and scope of the  organ harvesting and organ trafficking market are staggering.''   Mr. Speaker, we also know through open-source Chinese language media  that elderly, high-ranking Chinese Communist Party officials have  received replacement organs from the very people they despise, like the  Falun Gong, like the Uyghurs. There is one particular hospital, Army  Hospital 301 in Beijing, that excels at this.   While this still shocks me, and I know it shocks my colleagues, I  cannot say it surprises me.   Almost 25 years ago, I chaired a hearing. Doug Anderson, who is  sitting right here, was a part of that hearing as the top staff on the  committee. I chaired a human rights hearing with a Chinese security  officer who testified that he and other security agents were executing  patients with the doctors right there with ambulances ready to harvest  their organs after the bullets were fired.   Indeed, at last year's hearing, we produced a doctor who testified  that he had performed one such surgery on a victim--he was forced to,  he claimed--a botched execution who as he began cutting discovered that  the victim was in a state of shock--he wasn't dead yet--a live  vivisection on a living human being. He has nightmares to this day.   To combat these heinous and inhumane practices, the Stop Forced Organ  Harvesting Act of 2023, a bipartisan piece of legislation, amends the  Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require reports on forced organ  harvesting and trafficking in persons for purposes of the removal of  organs in foreign countries, including and especially in China; and the  imposition of serious sanctions on any person the President determines  funds, sponsors or otherwise facilitates forced organ harvesting or  trafficking for purposes of the removal of organs.   What does that mean? It means civil penalties up to $250,000 and  criminal penalties including a fine of up to $1 million and  imprisonment for not more than 20 years or both. So we are serious  about sanctioning this egregious practice.   Sanctions also include blocking and prohibiting all transactions in  property and interests in property and making such persons inadmissible  to the United States and ineligible to receive a visa.   State-sponsored forced organ harvesting is big business for Xi  Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party and shows absolutely no signs  of abating, which is why we and the rest of the world need to step up,  particularly the democracies of this world.   We must act, and we must act decisively.   I thank Chairman McCaul for his cosponsorship and his tremendous  leadership on this bill, as well as Ranking Member Meeks for his strong  support. I also thank our Democratic cosponsor, Bill Keating, as well  as Kathy Manning, for their strong support and cosponsorship of this  legislation. I extend a very special thanks to Mary Vigil; Janice  Kaguyutan, who is sitting over here on my right on the Democrat side;  Piero Tozzi, who is the staff director for the China Commission of  which I am the chairman; and Doug Anderson, who has done a wonderful  job throughout all of this; and Mary McDermott Noonan, my chief of  staff, all who have worked so diligently in such a cooperative and  bipartisan way to bring this piece of legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, March 17, 2023.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Jordan: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1154, the ``Stop Forced Organ       Harvesting Act of 2023,'' so that the measure may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on this bill into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, March 15, 2023.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write regarding H.R. 1154, the       ``Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act of 2023.'' Provisions of       this bill fall within the Judiciary Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction, and I appreciate that you consulted with us on       those provisions. The Judiciary Committee agrees that it       shall be discharged from further consideration of the bill so       that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee takes this action with the understanding that       forgoing further consideration of this measure does not in       any way alter the Committee's jurisdiction or waive any       future jurisdictional claim over these provisions or their       subject matter. We also reserve the right to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees in the event of a       conference with the Senate involving this measure or similar       legislation.        I ask that you please insert this letter in the       Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 1154 on the       House floor. I appreciate the cooperative manner in which our       committees have worked on this matter, and I look forward to       working collaboratively in the future on matters of shared       jurisdiction. Thank you for your attention to this matter.            Sincerely,                                                        Jim Jordan,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume for the purpose of closing.   I thank Ms. Wild for her strong support and for her wonderful and  strong remarks today in favor of this bipartisan legislation.   I do believe that we are really at a point now where if not us, who?  We need to speak, and we need to speak boldly. This legislation, again,  was crafted across the aisle. We have worked very closely together on  it. I believe this legislation will make a huge difference.   Not so long ago I was in the intensive care unit. I am fine now, but  when I was lying there, I kept thinking about this bill and some poor  28-year-old in the People's Republic of China who is not there being  treated in a benign way by doctors and nurses but is being strapped  down--not always anesthetized sufficiently--to steal their organs and  to kill them.   It is happening--as I indicated earlier, and this is a very reliable  number--between 60 to 100,000 times against 60 to 100,000 20-year-olds  each and every year.   This is Nazi-like.   Xi Jinping needs to be held accountable. The fact that he and the  high officials of the Chinese Communist Party are benefiting not just  with unbelievable amounts of money for the Chinese Communist Party and  for them personally, but also, if they need any organ, they turn to the  very people that they hate, especially Falun Gong and Muslim Uyghurs,  in order to procure their organs.   This must get strong support from this body, strong support from the  Senate, and I believe it will be signed by the President if we can get  it to his desk.   We need to make a difference.   Again, I urge Members to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1107) to direct the Secretary of State to take  certain actions with respect to the labeling of the People's Republic  of China as a developing country, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1107         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``PRC Is Not a Developing       Country Act''.       SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It should be the policy of the United States--        (1) to oppose the labeling or treatment of the People's       Republic of China as a developing country in any treaty or       other international agreement to which the United States is a       party;        (2) to oppose the labeling or treatment of the People's       Republic of China as a developing country in each       international organization of which the United States is a       member; and        (3) to pursue the labeling or treatment of the People's       Republic of China as an upper middle income country, high       income country, or developed country in each international       organization of which the United States is a member.       SEC. 3. REPORT.         Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate       committees of Congress a report identifying all current       treaty negotiations in which--        (1) the proposed treaty develops different standards for       the enforcement of the treaty based on the development status       of the member states of the treaty; and        (2) the People's Republic of China is under consideration       for becoming a party to the treaty.

(a) In General.--In any international organization of which       the United States and the People's Republic of China are both       current member states, the Secretary, in coordination with       the heads of other Federal agencies and departments as       needed, shall pursue--        (1) changing the status of the People's Republic of China       from developing country to upper middle income country, high       income country, or developed country if a mechanism exists in       such organization to make such a change in status;        (2) proposing the development of a mechanism described in       paragraph (1) to change the status of the People's Republic       of China in such organization from developing country to       developed country; or        (3) regardless of efforts made pursuant to paragraphs (1)       and (2), working to ensure that the People's Republic of       China does not receive preferential treatment or assistance       within the organization as a result of it having the status       of a developing country.

(2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of State.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim), who chairs the  Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Indo-Pacific and is the author of this  important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States and other developed nations of the  world need to stop underwriting the belligerent expansion of the  Chinese Communist Party's influence around the world.   Since 1978, the economy of the People's Republic of China has  reportedly grown 9 percent a year on average. Today, the PRC is the  world's second-largest economy and is a top goods exporter. Look at our  balance of trade. Its outward direct investment exceeds that of 32 of  the 36 OECD countries, and China's defense expenditures and number of  satellites in space are second in the world, only behind the United  States.   That is why it is ridiculous that the PRC is still considered a  developing country by international financial institutions, or IFIs,  and in various treaty provisions intended to benefit genuinely poor  nations. That designation allows the PRC to pay less in United Nations  dues and assessments; it allows them to avoid stricter requirements in  certain environmental agreements; and it allows the PRC to get  preferential loans from international financial institutions, which the  PRC then uses to offer predatory and unfair loans to actual developing  countries, countries such as Sri Lanka, Djibouti, and Uganda, which  have been placed into debt bondage by the PRC, often accompanied by  bribery and corruption of local officials.   This is just one way the PRC distorts the global economy through  unfair trade and lending practices while hurting countries that are  actually still genuinely developing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from California, Young Kim, who  chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific, for  introducing this bill. It is smart, targeted legislation. I thank Gerry  Connolly for his chief cosponsorship, as well.   This legislation clearly states that the PRC is no longer a  developing country and that the United States should seek to ensure  that any future treaties, conventions, or organizations we are a part  of do not treat the PRC as one.   The world must stop allowing the PRC to siphon benefits from other  nations by taking advantage of an outdated and inaccurate developing  country status.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.      Hon. Jason Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for agreeing to forgo       pursuing a sequential referral of H.R. 1107, the ``PRC is Not       a Developing Country Act,'' so that the measure may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor. As requested, the Committee       on Ways and Means has been added as a recipient of the report       required by this bill.        I agree that your forgoing action on this measure does not       in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of your       committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on       this measure or similar legislation in the future.        I will seek to place our letters on this bill into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                     Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul, I am writing with respect to H.R.       1107, the ``PRC is Not a Developing Country Act.'' As a       result of your having consulted with us on provisions on       which the Committee on Ways and Means has a jurisdictional       interest, I will not request a sequential referral on this       measure.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation, and requests your support for       such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 1107.            Sincerely,                                                       Jason Smith,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I urge unanimous support by  this body for this important legislation, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
