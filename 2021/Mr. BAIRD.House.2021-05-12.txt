 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in honor of National Police  Week, a week where we honor the men and women who risk their lives  every day to protect and serve our neighborhoods.   I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the great work  from  [[Page H2211]]  law enforcement in my district who are helping to keep their  communities safe.   First, there is West Lafayette Police Officer Brian Danosky who  risked his own life to provide lifesaving care to a 22-year-old who had  a gunshot wound.   In Frankfort, Indiana, Sergeant Chris Salaba was awarded Officer of  the Year last year for helping his department overcome challenges from  the COVID-19 pandemic.   In Putnam County, Sheriff Scott Stockton and his deputies kept deadly  drugs off of our streets by seizing 225 pounds of meth.   These are just a few of the examples of police officers working to  keep our neighborhoods safe.   I think it is important to highlight their work and remind citizens  that most police officers are good people who want to protect their  communities and serve the people within them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to show my support for our men  and women in law enforcement.   Unfortunately, there is a growing movement across this country that  is trying to defund police departments and disparage the character of  all of our police officers. This movement is having deadly consequences  on our communities.   We are starting to see what happens when we defund the police. For  the first time in decades, violent crime is rising in the United  States. Major American cities saw a 33 percent increase in homicides in  2020. Many of these cities took the advice from radicals and slashed  their police departments, with the ultimate goal of defunding them.   These reckless decisions didn't make our communities safer. Instead,  it only empowered criminals and put those most vulnerable in harm's  way.   All Americans want bad police officers to be held accountable, but  all Americans also want to be safe in their own communities. Police  officers risk their lives every day to try to make that a reality.  Congress should focus on making sure our police departments have the  resources they need to keep criminals off the street while implementing  the needed reforms to hold accountable bad officers.
