 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern)  for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 716 provides for the consideration of four  bills, including an irresponsible extension of the Federal debt limit  and two bills that would have questionable consequences for small  businesses.   I am most concerned about S. 1301, which serves as the vehicle for an  extension of the Federal debt limit until December 3. This accomplishes  nothing more than kicking the can down the road on something that  should be addressed now.   Given the majority's insistence on passing several multi-trillion- dollar spending packages--Democrats are now in control of the House,  Senate, and White House--they can pass a debt limit extension using  their majority since it is their policies that are requiring  substantially larger and earlier increases to the debt limit.   In the past, when Congress was required to raise the debt ceiling,  the two parties were able to negotiate a bipartisan path forward.  Democrats simply refuse to work with House Republicans, despite having  many opportunities to do so. Instead, they are determined to ram a $3.5  trillion spending bill checking off every item on their socialist wish  list.   I am equally incensed that Democrats won't even give the debt limit  extension a proper debate or vote on the House floor. Instead, this  rule will deem the debt limit extension passed. This is an insult to  the Members of this body who are being denied the opportunity to fully  consider the gravity of extending the debt limit to account for  increasing unnecessary spending. It is absolutely unacceptable to run  Congress in this fashion.   The second bill up for consideration under this rule is H.R. 3110,  the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act.   Nursing mothers deserve protections in the workplace, which is why we  already have strong laws in place to ensure reasonable break time and  access to private, non-bathroom locations. This bill imposes a one- size-fits-all requirement for employers and includes penalties for  employer violations.   Mr. Speaker, our small businesses have suffered through enough new  burdensome regulations as they fought to survive over the last year.  There is no need to duplicate existing law.   The third bill included in this rule is H.R. 3992, the Protect Older  Job Applicants Act, which expands the definition in the existing Age  Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to include applicants for  employment as a protected class.   To be clear, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act already  prohibits age discrimination in hiring, making this legislation  redundant and unnecessary. Under the scope of this new proposed  legislation, employers using common recruiting practices like  internships and job fairs could be accused of discriminating against  older workers, as older workers are less likely to participate in these  opportunities than young Americans entering the workforce for the first  time.    This bill is just a murky expansion of the Age Discrimination in  Employment Act. The only impact this legislation will have is on the  number of lawsuits brought against American businesses.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, the fourth bill up for consideration under this  rule is H.R. 2119, the Family Violence Prevention and Services  Improvement Act of 2021. The Family Violence Prevention and Services  program does critical work to support victims of family violence, and  many of my colleagues and I support reauthorizing this program in its  current form.   Unfortunately, this is another example of the majority working alone  to  [[Page H5616]]  draft legislation rather than working in a bipartisan fashion to put  together a bill we can all support.   Mr. Speaker, I am particularly concerned about a provision in this  bill that could allow funds from this program, funds that should be  going to support victims of violence, to be used for abortion services  now that the Hyde amendment was stripped out of the annual  appropriations bill. This is obviously troubling, and we cannot allow a  pathway for taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.   Mr. Speaker, there is much to be concerned about in these four bills;  most troubling of which is the temporary increase to the Federal debt  limit, which is happening for no other reason than the Democrats' own  mistakes.   They have worked alone on everything else. They have chosen not to be  bipartisan to resolve the issues facing our country. Instead, they have  chosen to push through partisan proposals while kicking critical issues  down the road.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule and the underlying bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind my colleague on  the Rules Committee that I stated very clearly that I was talking about  House Republicans. But I do want to point out that no Republican in the  Senate voted for this debt limit extension in addition to that, and I  appreciate the majority leader's words. He gave us a history lesson  about the debt limit and the votes and about not playing politics, but  I just want to, before we move on, remind everyone about a quote from  then-Senator and now President Biden. It was from 2004, during  President Bush's Presidency and then-Senator Biden said: ``My symbolic  vote against raising the debt limit would have been a protest of the  policies that brought us to this point, and I demand that we change  course.''   So this has not always been as bipartisan as the majority leader made  it appear.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Good).                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we hear so much about this wonderful bipartisan  history of this debt ceiling, I just want to point out that the last  five times Republicans controlled the House, Senate, and the White  House, the current Speaker and the entire current Democratic leadership  only voted to raise the debt limit one time. So I wish that we would  make sure that we point out the accurate history of how this has  happened.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Smith).                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Steil).    Mr. Speaker, I continue to hear from my colleagues  across the aisle this notion that debt limit votes are always  bipartisan.   I just want to point out again, however, that in the last 20 years  there were five occasions where the party in power had to pass the debt  limit through the Senate by themselves. This includes when then-Senator  Biden and Senator Schumer voted against raising the debt ceiling under  President George W. Bush.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I point out that my colleague from the Committee on  Rules points out that we did debate this bill, S. 1301, a couple of  weeks ago. But he also pointed out that there is a Senate amendment  that was added to it that we are not debating right now. So it is not  entirely the same bill that we talked about 2 weeks ago. I wanted to  make sure that was pointed out because it is not the same bill.   Mr. Speaker, obviously, there is lots of discussion and input that  people want to have on this debt ceiling issue, and I really do feel  the need to say it again: this is an irresponsible way to run Congress.  And the Democrats are not giving this debt limit extension the proper  debate. What we are actually debating right now is the rule. We are not  debating the actual issue of the debt ceiling and talking about it in  depth, as we should be. I wanted to make sure that the American people  understood that that is what we are doing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that, yet again, my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to operate  without input from the minority. Voting for increasing the debt ceiling  without proper consideration in the House is simply irresponsible.  These bills include troubling consequences for small businesses.   Given that the Democrats are unwilling to accept Republican input on  anything else they are working to pass, including but not limited to  stripping the Hyde amendment from all legislation possible, something  that is in moral opposition to millions of Americans, I see no reason  this should be any different. Again, Democrats can pass this extension  using their majority.   Mr. Speaker, we could have done so much good while addressing these  topics. I am deeply disappointed that the majority chooses to pursue  these bills without including House Republicans in negotiations. I ask  that, in the future, they give us all the opportunity to come together  for the good of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule; I oppose the underlying bills; and I  ask Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5627]]         Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
