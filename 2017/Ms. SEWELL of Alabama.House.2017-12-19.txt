 Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority is  ramming this tax bill through, calling it a Christmas gift to the  American people. I have never seen such intellectual dishonesty in my  life. It is more like the Grinch who stole Christmas.   In poll after poll and through elections in New Jersey, Virginia, and  my home State of Alabama, the American people continue to send a  message that they do not want this tax bill to move forward. But here  we are watching the fiscal hawks of the Republican Party blow through  every red light on the way off the cliff, adding $1.5 trillion to the  deficit.   What is the rush, I ask you. Last week, the American people in my  home State of Alabama spoke up and spoke out. We deserve to have our  duly elected Senator to vote on this bill.   What is the rush? Not one hearing, not one expert testifying, and no  regular order. I ask you, Mr. Speaker, what is the rush?   I believe the rush is because they know this is not tax reform. It is  a tax sham. The American people deserve better. My constituents from  Alabama deserve better. We should vote ``no'' on this tax bill.
