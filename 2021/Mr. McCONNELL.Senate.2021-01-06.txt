 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  majority leader and the Democratic leader be allowed to speak and that  following their remarks, the majority leader and the Democratic leader  each control up to 1 hour of debate time and be authorized to yield up  to 5 minutes of that time to any Senator seeking recognition. Further,  I ask unanimous consent that the Senators be permitted to insert  statements into the Record.    Mr. President, we are debating a step that has never  been taken in American history: whether Congress should overrule the  voters and overturn a Presidential election.   I have served 36 years in the Senate. This will be the most important  vote I have ever cast.   President Trump claims the election was stolen. The assertions range  from specific local allegations, to constitutional arguments, to  sweeping conspiracy theories. I supported the President's right to use  the legal system. Dozens of lawsuits received hearings in courtrooms  all across our country, but over and over, courts rejected these  claims, including all-star judges whom the President himself nominated.   Every election, we know, features some illegality and irregularity,  and, of course, that is unacceptable   I support strong State-led voting reforms. Last year's bizarre  pandemic procedures must not become the new norm. But, my colleagues,  nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale-- the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election, nor can  public doubt alone justify a radical break when the doubt itself was  incited without any evidence.   The Constitution gives us here in Congress a limited role. We cannot  simply declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids. The  voters, the courts, and the States have all spoken. They have all  spoken. If we overrule them, it would damage our Republic forever.   This election actually was not unusually close. Just in recent  history, 1976, 2000, and 2004 were all closer than this one. The  electoral college margin is almost identical to what it was in 2016. If  this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side,  our democracy would enter a death spiral. We would never see the whole  Nation accept an election again. Every 4 years would be a scramble for  power at any cost. The electoral college, which most of us on this side  been have defending for years, would cease to exist, leaving many of  our States with no real say at all in choosing a President.   The effects would go even beyond the elections themselves. Self- government, my colleagues, requires a shared commitment to the truth  and a shared respect for the ground rules of our system. We cannot keep  drifting apart into two separate tribes with a separate set of facts  and separate realities with nothing in common except our hostility  toward each other and mistrust for the few national institutions that  we all still share.   Every time--every time in the last 30 years that Democrats have lost  a Presidential race, they have tried a challenge just like this--after  2000, after 2004, and after 2016. After 2004, a Senator joined and  forced the same debate. And, believe it or not, Democrats like Harry  Reid, Dick Durbin, and Hillary Clinton praised--praised and applauded  the stunt. Republicans condemned those baseless efforts back then, and  we just spent 4 years condemning Democrats' shameful attacks on the  validity of President Trump's own election. So there can be no double  standard. The media that is outraged today spent 4 years aiding and  abetting the Democrats' attacks on our institutions after they lost.   But we must not imitate and escalate what we repudiate. Our duty is  to govern for the public good. The United States Senate has a higher  calling than an endless spiral of partisan vengeance.   Congress will either overrule the voters, the States, and the courts  for the first time ever or honor the people's decision. We will either  guarantee Democrats' delegitimizing efforts after 2016 became a  permanent new routine for both sides or declare that our Nation  deserves a lot better than this. We will either hasten down a poisonous  path where only the winners of elections actually accept the results or  show we can still muster the patriotic courage that our forebears  showed not only in victory but in defeat.   The Framers built the Senate to stop short-term passions from boiling  over and melting the foundations of our Republic. So I believe  protecting our constitutional order requires respecting the limits of  our own power. It would be unfair and wrong to disenfranchise American  voters and overrule the courts and the States on this extraordinarily  thin basis, and I will not pretend such a vote would be a harmless  protest gesture while relying on others to do the right thing. I will  vote to respect the people's decision and defend our system of  government as we know it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator  from Texas, Senator Cruz.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Texas    I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator from  Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator  from Oklahoma, Senator Lankford.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Oklahoma.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  majority leader and the Democratic leader be allowed to speak and that  the time not count against the 2 hours of debate in relation to the  objection raised on the State of Arizona.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    I want to say to the American people, the United  States Senate will not be intimidated.   We will not be kept out of this Chamber by thugs, mobs, or threats.  We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation.   We are back at our posts. We will discharge our duty under the  Constitution and for our Nation, and we are going to do it tonight.   This afternoon, Congress began the process of honoring the will of  the American people and counting the electoral college votes. We have  fulfilled this solemn duty every 4 years for more than two centuries.  Whether our Nation has been at war or at peace, under all manner of  threats, even during an ongoing armed rebellion and the Civil War, the  clockwork of our democracy has carried on.   The United States and the United States Congress have faced down much  greater threats than the unhinged crowd we saw today. We have never  been deterred before, and we will not be deterred today.   They tried to disrupt our democracy. They failed. They failed.   This failed attempt to obstruct the Congress, this failed  insurrection, only underscores how crucial the task before us is for  our Republic.   Our Nation was founded precisely so that the free choice of the  American people is what shapes our self-government and determines the  destiny of our Nation--not fear, not force, but the peaceful expression  of the popular will.   We assembled this afternoon to count our citizens' votes and to  formalize their choice of the next President. Now we are going to  finish exactly what we started. We will complete this process the right  way, by the book. We will follow our precedents, our laws, and our  Constitution to the letter, and we will certify the winner of the 2020  Presidential election.   Criminal behavior will never dominate the United States Congress.  This institution is resilient. Our democratic Republic is strong. The  American people deserve nothing less.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Democratic leader.    Mr. Vice President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator  from Oklahoma, Senator Lankford.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Oklahoma.

The question is, Shall the objection submitted by the gentleman from  Arizona, Mr. Gosar, and the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz, and others be  sustained?    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?   There is a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.   The result was announced--yeas 6, nays 93, as follows:                         [Rollcall Vote No. 1 Leg.]                                  YEAS--6       Cruz      Hawley      Hyde-Smith      Kennedy      Marshall      Tuberville                                  NAYS--93       Baldwin      Barrasso      Bennet      Blackburn      Blumenthal      Blunt      Booker      Boozman      Braun      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Daines      Duckworth      Durbin  [[Page S32]]        Ernst      Feinstein      Fischer      Gillibrand      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Hoeven      Inhofe      Johnson      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Lankford      Leahy      Lee      Loeffler      Lujan      Lummis      Manchin      Markey      McConnell      Menendez      Merkley      Moran      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Paul      Peters      Portman      Reed      Risch      Romney      Rosen      Rounds      Rubio      Sanders      Sasse      Schatz      Schumer      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shaheen      Shelby      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young   The VICE PRESIDENT.
