 Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week, a time  to express our enduring gratitude for the incredible bravery and  sacrifice of American law enforcement officers across the country. I  stand here today to honor our men and women in law enforcement in the  well of the U.S. House of Representatives because we must never forget  all they do to keep Americans safe.   Recently, an NYPD officer from West Islip in my district showed us  all what it means to protect and serve. When gunfire rang out in the  middle of Times Square, Officer Alyssa Vogel, a neighborhood  coordination officer, immediately rushed to the aid of an injured 4- year-old girl. Officer Vogel quickly applied an emergency tourniquet to  the young girl's leg, gathered her in her arms, and ran her to safety  where the girl's injuries were treated in a nearby ambulance.   Officer Vogel is a 4\1/2\-year veteran of the NYPD. She is a wife, a  mother, and, as is evident by her bravery and quick thinking, she is a  hero that Long Islanders can be proud to call their own.   This is just one example of the extraordinary acts that police  officers in my district and across the country do every single day in  the line of duty.   May God bless and watch over them as they serve.                            ____________________
