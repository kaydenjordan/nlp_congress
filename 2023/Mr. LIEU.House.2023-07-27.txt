 Mr. Speaker, today Bloomberg reported that U.S. GDP growth  accelerated to 2.4 percent blowing past economists' estimates.   Consumer confidence is also at the highest level in over 2 years, and  inflation has now declined for 12 consecutive months to a low of 3  percent. The United States has the highest GDP growth and the lowest  inflation of all the G-7 countries.   So growth is up, consumer confidence is up, and inflation is down.  This is Bidenomics, and it did not happen by accident.   When Democrats were in control last term, we passed numerous laws to  grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out. We passed the  American Rescue Plan, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and  Science Act, and the infrastructure law. All those laws have now grown  our economy and grown the middle class.   What are Republicans focused on?   Putting women in jail for concealing abortions.                           Artificial Intelligence     Mr. Speaker, as a recovering computer science major, I am  excited about artificial intelligence. AI has moved society forward and  will continue to do amazing things in the medical field and many other  fields.   At the same time, there are potential risks to artificial  intelligence, and we need to make sure we can harness the benefits of  AI and reduce these risks.   That is why I have proposed a national AI commission that is a  bipartisan blue ribbon commission that will make recommendations to  Congress as to what kinds of AI we should regulate and how we might go  about doing so.   This legislation is coauthored by Republican Congressman   Ken Buck  with Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, and on the Senate side it will be  carried by Senator Schatz.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker to put this legislation on the floor  for a vote.   In addition, AI can also destroy the world. We can never ever let AI  control nuclear weapons. I have also introduced bipartisan legislation  that would  [[Page H4039]]  prevent AI from ever launching a nuclear weapon by itself. We need to  have meaningful human control.   Mr. Speaker, I also request the Speaker to allow that bill to be  voted on on the floor.                            ____________________
