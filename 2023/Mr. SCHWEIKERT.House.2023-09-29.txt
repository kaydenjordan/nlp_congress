 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. Grothman) for a memorial.    Mr. Speaker, I apologize to everyone as we are sort  of organizing the slides here.   Mr. Speaker and anyone that is listening, okay, so the House is in a  fairly cantankerous spot right now. Part of my frustration and part of  the reason for actually grabbing this hour is--what is a more elegant  way to use the words ``I need to stop the lying.'' Actually, I don't  think we are supposed to say that on the floor--the people just making  crap up.   Let's actually have an educational discussion here. If you don't like  math, please just turn off your television and stop watching because  this is becoming a math-free zone around here.   Why is there fighting here on the House floor? What is the fussing?  You do understand every dime a Member of Congress votes on now is all  borrowed money. There is a very good chance--we will know actually next  week when the final Treasury data is posted that for this fiscal year,  the 2023 fiscal year which ends this weekend, we will borrow--and I am  sorry, but this is how you need to think about it--we will borrow,  functionally, 9 percent of GDP.   So 9 percent of the entire economy will be just the borrowed money.  Not the spent money, the borrowed money. We are hitting numbers that  should be terrifying. I don't know why they are not terrifying to the  folks on the left. You just saw it. They just came to the microphones  saying we want more money. Where does it come from?   Let's actually walk through some basic facts. This isn't Republican  or Democrat math, it is just math. My family motto is ``math will  always win.'' It may take a while, but the math will always win.   The reason for this chart, Mr. Speaker, is--one more time try to  visualize--this is the 2023 budget. In that 2023 budget here is what we  call discretionary spending. This is defense and nondefense.   We have 1.7 on this chart. It is actually closer to $1.8 trillion.  This wedge over here is actually--let's just call it Medicare. Social  Security still has its own trust fund, which is out in 9 years. When  you hear Democrats saying, well, we don't borrow anything for Social  Security, you shouldn't be talking about it. Well, the trust fund is  gone in 9 years, and the recapitalization of it is brutal.   Once again, my brothers and sisters on the left don't want to  actually deal with the math because it is such a great campaign hit on  anyone that actually cares about not doubling senior poverty in 9  years.   Back to this chart. When you look at this, you have to understand,  this blue wedge is all we get to vote on. All the red, the 72 percent  of spending we call mandatory is on autopilot. You get that benefit  because you worked your 40 quarters. You earned your Social Security  benefit. You worked a certain amount. You have paid into your Medicare.  You turned 65. You get that benefit when you hit a certain age. That is  the vast majority of the spending, and it is also--if you go from today  through the next 30 years, it is 100 percent of the future debt.   It is demographics. I say this over and over and over and over. The  idiot  [[Page H4902]]  class around here who wants to say, no, it is Republicans not willing  to tax people more, stop it.   I am going to walk you through all the Democrat tax proposals and  show you how little of GDP it creates even at tax maximization. There  is this concept of at this rate you maximize tax receipts without  rolling over the economy and rolling over the fall of receiving less  tax receipts.   I am going to show you the math on maximizing. It is nowhere near  what the Democrats keep telling you, and it is really crappy economics.   One more time, this board is incredibly important. You want to know  why there is fussing around here? It is all borrowed now. And what has  happened in the last couple of months interest rate-wise? Think of this  as just a thought experiment. August 1 until today, the movement in  interest rates--just that movement in interest rates is about $50  billion of interest next year.   We are borrowing over $6 billion a day. That is functionally--let's  take a look here. If you take a look at our borrowing over the last 12  months, it is $72,932 a second. $72,000 a second. That is why the  idiocy here of people who say, well, I am going to save a million  dollars here. That is real money, great. But let's see, if you're  borrowing $72,000 a second, that is how many seconds did you just  cover?   The $300 million that was stripped out of one of the bills, okay,  fine, but it is 57 minutes of borrowing over an entire year. There is  this delusion--every dime, I believe, of foreign aid is--I used to say  12 days of borrowing. Someone pointed out it is actually closer to 9  days of borrowing.   For us in the political class, math is hard. Our audience often  doesn't want to hear it because it doesn't satiate the feelings. We  make public policy now by feelings, not a calculator. So you have a  world now where you get up and say, hey, it is demographics.   We got old. Healthcare costs are the primary driver of debt, and they  look at you and say, no, it is waste and fraud and foreign aid. You  show them the little chart that says, okay, I can get maybe a couple  weeks of borrowing eliminated, what would you like to do with the rest  of the year, and people look at you with daggers.                                time  1430    Then you have the left who just makes crap up. I don't think it is  meant to be evil. I think it is just that you get something in your  head and you repeat it over and over and over, and the math is  delusional.   I am going to walk through some boards here. When we get to them,  some of these are really complex, but I am going to do my best so they  make sense.   How do you save this republic if you have a bunch of people who can't  even agree on the most baseline? This was on the CBO, Joint Tax,  basically their datasets. No one reads their reports.   The Joint Economic Committee, which I chair the Republican side, we  did a brilliant report 2 months ago. We gave actually options where you  could save this country. It is crazy stuff. If you could actually  eliminate, moderate, take on, do the moral thing with our brothers and  sisters and talk about diabetes and obesity, it is a few trillion  dollars over 10 years. It would require complex policies and decisions  to do things that are difficult.   The only reason I hold that board up, this board is from 3 weeks ago  and it is already out of date. What does this board say? It basically  says next year, interest will pretty much equal the defense budget.  Interest will equal the defense budget. The reason it is out of date is  just the movement of interest rates in the last 3 weeks. On the U.S.  10-year sovereign, interest will be more than the entire defense budget  next year. If it continues, if the trend line continues, there is a  very good chance that interest isn't going to be $800 billion, $830  billion; it could be starting to approach a trillion dollars next year.   Why is that a big deal? Well, let's do something else interesting.  For people who have never really thought about it, how does the United  States finance itself? Remember, 30 cents out of every dollar we spend  is borrowed. Where does that 30 cents come from? We issue bonds. Every  couple weeks, like 3 days ago, Treasury issued $30-plus billion of 5- year instruments. It went out at the very top of the range price-wise.   You sit there and have to calculate. Coverage was a little  disturbing. It was only like 2\1/2\ coverage. I know that doesn't mean  anything. It basically means the huge lines to buy U.S. bonds weren't  there. The line is getting shorter and shorter, interest to buy our  debt, which often means the interest rates are going to go up.   What happens to bonds that were sold in previous years? Because the  last three Treasury Secretaries, Republicans and Democrats, did  something stupid and we couldn't get them to change it because it  benefited them politically that week, is they went very short-term on  the bonds. I am going issue 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, when interest  rates were almost basically free.   Guess where we are at right now? Those bonds are coming due. In the  next fiscal year, if we bring $2 trillion of new virgin issue--that is  the borrowing for next fiscal year. Remember, this year we are going to  borrow 2.3, 2.4, but let's just pretend next year is about 2. We have a  little problem. There is about $9.6 trillion of borrowing coming either  as virgin issues or refinance next year, and it is all at these higher  interest rates.   Your government is functionally an insurance company with an army and  a budget problem. What do we look like at the end of 2024 when we have  just refinanced a little bit under $10 trillion at these higher  interest rates?   It basically means that dystopian number you use to go into the 2025  budget cycle of a trillion dollars interest coverage, if you are into  the military, interest buys you how many new weapons? If you are into a  social justice agenda, interest buys you what? This is what we are  doing to ourselves, and it is the reality, and the interest rates keep  moving away from us.   Let's continue on some of the more difficult stuff. Just simple math.  We are going to spend some time talking about how do you fix things  when you can't even get the other side that you need--we have to do  this together. It is complex. It is hard. It is politically brutal  because this place has functionally lied to the public for decades.   Let's use the most optimistic--and I believe at least one side of  these numbers is absolutely wrong. It is basically saying next year,  the projection months ago was the 2024 budget year was only going to  borrow about $1.7 trillion. I think that is wrong. I think we are going  to 2, but let's say it is 1.7.   Let's say we did the most confiscatory tax ever. We basically took  every American, if you make $500,000, every dime you make above that,  we take all of it. Every dime belongs to the government and people keep  working. The basketball player, the scientist, the entrepreneur just  keeps working. They say, well, I made my $500,000; the government is  going to take every other dime; I am just going to keep working and  paying it all into the government, which is a fantasy. That is not how  economics work. Just for a math experiment, let's say we are going to  confiscate every dime of people over $500,000. You raise about $1\1/2\  trillion.   Did I mention the borrowing from CBO months ago was projected to be  $1.7 trillion? You can't even cover the deficit if you had a fantasy  number of taking every dime of those high-income earners.   Yet, I will show slides like this at certain townhalls where I have a  number of Democrat activists, and they look at you and go, well, that  is Republican math. No, actually, I think this one came from Cato, but  I have some that are from OMB, CBO, progressive budget priorities. It  is all the same. We are living in a mathematical fantasy world.   I am going to go out of sequence here, because I am angry that I saw  a California Member on CNN a little while ago basically holding a  little white board and completely lying to the press, because it is  such good politics: Republicans shouldn't talk about Social Security.  It doesn't add anything to the deficit. Absolutely true, because there  is a trust fund that has cash in it for 9 more years.   What happens in 9 years? Here is the reason we want to talk about it,  to save it. In 9 years, the average couple on Social Security gets a  $17,400 cut. You double the poverty of seniors in America in 9 years.  It is absolutely immoral. The recapitalization of this is going to be  complex, because that first  [[Page H4903]]  year--so 9 years from now, the first year shortfall is $616 billion.  Okay. Do this with me. You don't have to be good at math for this. This  isn't that hard. Nine years from now, boom, the trust fund is gone. You  have got a $616 billion shortfall in 2033. Okay. Big deal. You don't  care. It is 9 years from now.    Here is the Democrats' policy. We are just going to raise taxes on  those who make $400,000 and up. The Democrats' piece of legislation is  $400,000 and up, you are going to pay the 12.4 percent FICA tax, all of  it. Great, okay. Raise the taxes, every dime, you get no benefit from  it.   Let me slow down and let me explain. Today, you pay your FICA tax up  to, what is it, $160,200, and then it stops. You don't pay the Social  Security tax above that because you don't get any benefit for it.   You create this doughnut hole under Democrat policy and then you  start paying the tax again when you hit $400,000. That produces $86.3  billion in 2033, 2034. Let's use 2033, because that is the year that  Social Security is gone.   Can anyone do the math with me? $86 billion of new taxes, $616  billion shortfall. Anyone notice a math problem? You are covering one- seventh of the shortfall. That is the Democrat solution.   Let's actually do the grander one. I will get people who say: Well,  David, we will be just fine. Just eliminate that cap and make people  pay the full 12.4 percent Social Security tax on every dime. If a  person makes a billion dollars, they pay it on that. They get no  benefit, no benefit for those higher taxes. People say that solves the  problem.   Then you show them this. Remember, the first year is a $616 billion  shortfall. Eliminating the Social Security cap produces 164,700. You  are basically covering 20 percent of the shortfall. This is the  Democrats' grand solution.   This is why, for those who own a calculator around here and have a  soul of not wanting to double senior poverty, we are willing to get the  crap kicked out of us by the activist left saying: But you are talking  about social security; you are not allowed to do that.   We are trying to save it. We are trying to save it, because you have  people manipulating you and lying to you about the math. This is  immoral. In 9 years, you double senior poverty in America, and their  solution only covers one-seventh or 20 percent. This is what you have  been given.   Then you wonder why there is friction. What if you have friction  because some people want to tell great stories and some people would  actually like to save the country?   Let's walk through a few more of these.     Mike Kelly, Congressman from Pennsylvania, is my senior so he sits  to my left in the Ways and Means Committee, which annoys me. I need to  explain part of the inside joke. In Congress, there is only one  committee that is solely by seniority. It is called the Ways and Means  Committee. When people to your left retire, quit, go away, you move up.  If they are on this side, that makes no difference to your life. He is  senior to me.   Mike Kelly also chairs the Tax Subcommittee.   No one else has been willing to do this math. Our brothers and  sisters on the left keep saying we will tax our way out of the crisis.   The first chart, I was trying to be somewhat brutal, saying, okay,  tax revenues versus expected deficits under different wealth models.  Here is actually the deficit. This is the baseline deficit number. Here  is what you got. The Sanders wealth tax, I understand, is probably  unconstitutional. This is where they would come in and say, even though  this isn't your income, we are confiscating some of your wealth. The  big one they are pushing right now is the oligarch tax, where they are  going to come in and say if you are really rich, we can come in and  every year take 8 percent of your wealth.   The problem is, I have got $1.8 trillion, and this thing is basically  covering what? $230 billion of shortfall? It also blows up the economy,  and it doesn't get you anywhere.   I am not here to defend really, really rich people. I am here to  defend math.   Mr. Kelly has a personality. I am like a walking calculator. Tell me,  why am I failing to communicate the reality that the proposals we are  getting are absurd? They only cover a fraction of the shortfalls.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly)  for a colloquy.    It is worth pointing out, for everyone looking at  that, you see that chart of defense and let's call it nondefense.    It is all borrowed. Every dime of that today is on  borrowed money.    Plus another $400 billion of the mandatory.   So many of our brothers and sisters around the country don't  understand. It is so out of whack now because all--look. The number one  growth is healthcare cost, but that is sort of on autopilot because  every time we try to fix it, the lobbyists, the Democrats, lose their  minds. We are just trying to save the country.   We end up having the fights that are going on right now over that  $0.14.  [[Page H4904]]  There is waste, fraud, and things that we need to fix, but it is a  fraction of the budget, and it is all on borrowed money, which adds the  additional stress of there is a morality of squeezing everything we can  out of it.    In other words, you are telling people the truth: I  drive you nuts.    They are paying the interest on it now.    $800 billion next year.    I think in some ways you just described why the  fussing over the budget documents is going on.   We put together some interesting slides here that we have never  presented before. We took these from a researcher at Manhattan and a  couple of other places. Then Joint Economics, some of my economists,  did some math here. We set this for 2033. We actually had a year that  is 10 budget years from now. We did not put in the fact that the Social  Security trust fund is gone, and there is $616 billion that needs to  somehow be recapitalized. That is actually not in this deficit number.   We also rolled the number. The baseline for anyone that is really  geeky out there, we ran this to the standard debt-to-GDP number.   There is a new update on what debt will be 9 years from now that is  now $3.1 trillion. If interest rates stay as high as they are spiking  right now, it could be as high as 3.7. We are going to use the $2.5  trillion.   The reason this board exists is we took--and I have a bunch of slides  we are going to walk through, but I need to set up the pitch first.   If we took every tax that our Democrat colleagues talk about in the  Ways and Means Committee and did what they call a revenue-maximizing  rate, there is a rate that you can charge that the economists--this is  economic modeling where you maximize tax collections before it rolls  over and people change their behavior and the tax collections go down.   We actually added it up--maximize estate taxes, maximize income  taxes, maximize corporate taxes, maximize capital gains taxes. We  maximized everything, and then we also came back and said, all right,  here is the maximum number taxing the rich. This is the top 2 percent.  If you make $400,000 or higher, you are part of the top 2 percent of  income in America. You have to understand that.   Then we also did if you did the economic effect, what they call the  dynamic score, which is always the real number we get.   So here is our $2.5 trillion borrowing. If you did the full max on  Democrats and got every dime, you get about $700 billion.   If you actually do the real number where the dynamic score comes in  about $450 billion, you have just maximized all taxes. It gets you a  fraction of the talking points.   My reason for going through these boards--how do I say this politely  without sounding like a jerk? Our brothers and sisters have to decide.  They may actually believe these numbers, but they are not real.   How do you make public policy that saves this country when half of  your brothers and sisters here say: No, we just tax people over  $400,000. We will be fine.   You show the slide, and it is nowhere near that. It is the  unwillingness to deal with the reality of the math.   This is one you and I have talked about a couple of times where if  you basically look at our history--go back to 1950 because, actually,  what is fascinating is from 1950 until recently, you actually have  history where sometimes we have had really, really high marginal tax  rates, 90 percent for the top income earners.   After tax reform, you are lower, but you took away a bunch of the  deductions. You took half of society and removed them from the tax  rolls. They don't pay income taxes.   We actually built lots of charts that sort of show, during times of  high tax rates, you get pretty much the same part of the size of the  economy in taxes. Low marginal tax rates, you get the same part of the  economy in taxes.   There is this concept that it always goes back to the mean, so the  way you get more tax receipts to government is growth in the economy.  That is the magic. That is how you get more tax receipts. It is growth.   When we have really high marginal rates, chart after chart shows you  get the mean. When you have had very low, you get the mean, but it is a  bigger pie because the economy starts growing again.   You show this to our Democrat brothers and sisters, and they will  often say: I have seen that, but my voters don't like that because it  doesn't satiate the feeling of punishing.    You are not going to do movie reviews, are you?    Yes.    Mr. Speaker, in some ways, Mr. Kelly and I are the  yin and yang of districts. I have a very highly educated district, a  fairly prosperous district. I represent Scottsdale, Phoenix. I am  blessed to have grown up there. I have to accept that the economic  experience that a lot of my people have is going to be very different  than his, but we are all in the same boat.   Let's get back to trying to help people understand the reality. I do  need to amend something Mr. Kelly is saying, though. We used to talk  here that this debt is an existential risk to our grandkids. I am  sorry. It is a risk to your retirement. There is the reality and the  math. If you are retiring anytime now and in the near future, you have  to understand that we are heading toward the time when we are going to  have to turn the printing presses on. When we turn on those printing  presses, we wipe out your savings.   Besides the misery we create for the devaluing of the dollar,  devaluing of every bit of your savings, making it so our kids can never  afford--high interest rates out to the future, but it is not a crash.  It is actually an extension of potentially decades of misery.   Folks don't think this way. I keep coming back to trying to make the  tax collection argument. Let's talk about why this is so important.   Here is the 1950s, when we had a 90.5 percent tax on the top income  earners. Here is a deep secret: The tax code today is more progressive  than it was back then because they had the lower middle class pay  income taxes back then. Today, they are off the tax rolls.   Back then, 7.2 percent of the economy came in in income taxes, even  though we had 90 percent. You go over all the years there has been tax  reform, so 2020, let's do that year, we functionally had a mean tax of  37 percent, not 90 percent as that high part of the marginal tax rate,  but we are getting 9.2 percent of the economy.   Most people have no idea what I am talking about, but here is the  economy, and here is a really high marginal tax rate. We have a history  of this, and repeatedly, you are only getting about 7 percent of the  economy in taxes. We lowered the marginal tax rate for these top  brackets, and now we are getting over 9 percent. We get dramatically  more because the economy got bigger.   Show this to our brothers and sisters on the left, and they will  often say, yes, I know, but it doesn't feel like I am punishing people.  The amazing irony is that the highest income Americans vote for  Democrats, not Republicans. It is the bizarreness.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Kelly to ask how many billionaires he  thinks are in his district.    Mr. Speaker, there is a path where this works, and I  want to double down on something. I want to make it perfectly clear: We  are not defending rich people, not defending poor people, not defending  the middle class. We are just trying to tell the truth.   This is how it works. This is about a society that prospers.  Prosperity is moral, and we first need to shut down the excuses for not  actually doing anything, saying oh, don't worry.   Democrats do it. They had all sorts of chances to do it before this  session. They knew the math was a fraud, but it makes for great talking  points because then they can get on MSNBC or CNN and say we should just  do this and we will be fine. It is not true.   There doesn't seem to be a reporter in this city who owns a  calculator. This is one Mr. Kelly and I have actually touched on. What  happens when you have really high capital gains rates or really low  capital gains rates? It turns out, when you raise capital gains rates  really high, like some of our Democrat proposals, you actually get less  revenues. We have charts of this going back to '54 when we started to  play with some of those rates.   I am going to show some numbers here when we get ready to close that  if everything was at revenue maximizing, whether it be capital gains,  estate, income, even corporate, take a look and you are only going to  get about 1\1/2\ percent of the economy in additional revenues,  additional receipts.   This year, we are borrowing 9 percent of the entire economy, and  there is the elegance of really good pro-growth tax policy.   I have been on this floor dozens of times, and Mr. Kelly and I have  talked about this for a couple of years now. There are things you can  do to crash the price of healthcare--the adoption of technology and  taking on something that is very uncomfortable, obesity and diabetes.  We need to take on things that are killing our brothers and sisters.    Remember, in the last 4 years, life expectancy in America has gone  down. Next decade, we have more deaths than births in America. How do  you help people understand? It is beyond just those of us who are math  and budget geeks. The morality is what Mr. Kelly talked about, which is  why I asked him to come share this time with me.   I need someone like him who is able to talk to people's hearts  because sometimes I don't think I do it well. I sound like an  accountant on steroids.   The morality of opportunity, the morality of prosperity, the morality  of our brothers and sisters--and I don't care if you are one of my  Tribal communities, your rural communities, an urban community, take a  look at the statistics of our brothers and sisters who are dying of  diabetes and other diseases when we actually can have incredible impact  of having them be healthy.   How do you get this body to see that, sometimes, great math is also  great morality?  [[Page H4906]]         They are not allowed to actually see them react to  you.    I am sorry you have to hear it all the time sitting  next to me, but the math will win. The math will always eventually win.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I am going to run through a couple of  boards real quick. It is going to be a little thick. I am going to do  them quick, and we will put these up on the website. If anyone really  wants to dive into this, I believe Brian Reedle about 2 weeks ago  published a fairly substantive--with amazing footnotes, so if you  actually care about the subject, get it, read it, pull out your  calculator. You will see it proves out.   I am going to blow through this real quick to sort of help people  understand why some idiot on the floor of the House is walking people  through maximum sustainable revenue calculations. I am trying to make a  point that there isn't an easy fix here.   If we do a deficit commission or something of that nature, it turns  out it is going to be complex. You are going to have to deal with  things that don't seem interrelated but are. You are going to have to  talk about immigration, technology, maybe AI, maybe a tax code that  promotes growth. You are going to have to talk about changing the way  we finance parts of healthcare. You have to do it all at the same time.  You have seen this place. We are having trouble walking and chewing gum  at the same time.   Let's blow through this real quick. Part of the studies out there,  and this is from CBO, OMB, and also the Tax Policy Center and the U.S.  Treasury have all confirmed these numbers. If you did a maximum  sustainable revenue from taxing the rich--let's first do individual  income taxes.   If you took the rich and said you are the top 2 percent income  earners--this is functionally anyone over $400,000--we are going to put  a tax rate that maximizes receipts before the calculations say revenues  would roll over. For some of those, that is like adding another 10  points on top of it. Then you actually tax some other parts of estate,  put a bunch of money into enforcement. You do all the things.    These are all the Democrat proposals added up. You are picking up  another half a point of GDP or so. I have a board where I add it all.   Then we added in maximizing corporate taxes. Looks like we can get up  to about another 0.8 percent of GDP if you maximize taxes because we  have a little problem in the United States. You go up to like the 28  percent corporate tax rate, the next increment, and you see a bleed  saying: Well, screw it. We are just going to recharter the headquarters  in Ireland.   You hit this point where you start to roll over. This is in the  liberal models, conservative models, people that just do models. You  walk through everything, from the corporate tax hikes that Biden has  been promoting, even the new international tax that Secretary Yellen  has been pushing, do the additional corporate savings by IRS  enforcement mechanism, add that all up, and what do you get from that?   Then, you go in and actually add in investment taxes. We are going to  raise capital gains up to like 39.6 percent, which we know at that  point you hit a wall and actually get less money in the taxes.   You close all the loopholes. You actually remove the ability to roll  over certain assets--1031 exchanges, in kind. You take those all away.  You basically say we have done everything to start to maximize income  taxes from the rich. It is a lot of money.                                time  1515    You actually take a look--sorry, we had very little time, we took  these directly from the report. You can get up to--if you do what they  call static--no economic effects, that is about 2 percent of the  economy in new taxes.   Then when you do the actual, okay, people, stop working, it changes  investment and people basically hunker down. So the economic models,  you actually get about 1.1 to 2 percent, so a mean of 1\1/2\ percent.  That is a lot of money. That is 1\1/2\ percent of the economy in new  taxes.   Did I mention we are borrowing 9 percent of the economy just this  year?   The utopian tax, everything of that $400,000 and up, you have  maximized every single tax. We are borrowing 9 percent of the economy  just this year and every tax proposal will get you another point and a  half.   Does anyone see a little problem?   We are living in this fantasy world.   God knows, I love my charts and I sometimes feel guilty for all--but  this one is actually really important, particularly if you are one of  my progressive left acquaintances and you care about income inequality  and progressivity and all those kinds of things.   Today's income tax code is the most progressive in U.S. history. The  top percent of income earners now pay more of the Federal income tax  than at any time in U.S. history. This is after our tax reform that Mr.  Kelly and I worked on.   Yet, I promise you today and tomorrow someone will come to that  microphone and say, well, the Republicans give it away to rich people.  Except we are taxing them more as a percentage of the tax collections  because we removed so many of our brothers and sisters, the 50 percent  of folks in the--economic term--lower quartiles who don't pay income  taxes now.   Here is the problem, it grew the economy right up to the time of the  pandemic, then we started spending money like crazy on corporate  subsidies--Democrat proposals. It is fascinating.   They accuse us of liking Big Business, yet they are the ones giving  hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out as subsidies to  corporate  [[Page H4907]]  America. At the same time, our tax receipts are falling when they are  doing it.   It is the weirdest economy you have ever seen. It basically shows  monetary policy, their Keynesian economics, have fallen flat on their  face.   Last board. Even when you start to do the adjustments for what they  call income inequality--you normalize those. We have a more progressive  tax system today than we ever had before. When a Member of Congress  looks at you in the eyes, and says: Well, we are just going to tax  people over $400,000, that solves the problem.   I showed you the boards, it doesn't come close to solving the problem  of saving Social Security in 9 years. It is only 1\1/2\ percent of GDP  when we are borrowing 9 percent.   Mr. Kelly, you have been here longer than I have. Do we have anyone  we work with that owns a calculator that is willing to save this  country?   I will let you do the close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
