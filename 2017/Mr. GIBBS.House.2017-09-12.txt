 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment prohibits the Department of  Labor and OSHA from implementing a burdensome rule dealing with  reporting workplace injuries and illness.   The OSHA rule requires all businesses with more than 250 employees to  file all illness and injury reports in a publicly available database.  It would also be a requirement for any business with more than 20  employees in certain industries such as manufacturing or agriculture.   This online filing requirement raises serious privacy concerns. While  employers were previously required to collect this information, it was  never open and available to the public.   The rule risks the confidentiality of personally identifiable  information for those injured on the job.   Additionally, a provision in the final rule declaring automatic  postaccident drug testing is now considered an unreasonable procedure,  a provision that conflicts with multiple States' workers' compensation  laws.   While the Trump administration has wisely delayed the implementation  of the regulation, it is important to prevent any future development of  this rule.   I encourage my colleagues to adopt this amendment, which rolls back  another one-size-fits-all regulation from Washington, D.C., that  potentially interferes with the privacy of employers and employees for  the entirety of fiscal year 2018.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, employers will still be required to keep  this information on record. Any OSHA inspector can come in and inspect  those records. So the idea that there is no documentation of any  workplace injuries or illnesses is still there.   The problem here is that it is put on a website, that could have  issues with FOIA requests, also publicly available. Businesses will be  forced to sensitive information and confidential information that will  be public information that risks the identity of many employees out  there.   OSHA has historically recognized the sensitive nature of this data  and sought to protect this information being released on, as I said,  the Freedom of Information Act request.   Furthermore, OSHA has failed to demonstrate any evidence that this  rule will effectively reduce workplace injuries and illnesses. I think  the point to remember here is that employers are required to keep the  records of that, and OSHA inspectors can see that. So when OSHA comes  in and inspects a business entity, they can look at those records and  see what the workplace injuries are and red flag them, and they have  that ability. But personal information should not be at risk to the  public and risk people's identities and their personal health issues  for illness and work injuries.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask support of my amendment to make sure  that we protect the private health records of our employees at the work  site and any illnesses that they might have. I don't think we should  risk that.   As I said earlier, I think OSHA inspectors have the ability to come  in and inspect those records on the workplace site. Putting it out on  the internet doesn't make a lot of sense.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  2200
