 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support my bipartisan amendment, introduced with Representative  Gottheimer and Representative Sinema.   This amendment would expand opportunities for Active-Duty military  men and women to learn career skills and provide education that would  assist them as they transition back to civilian life.   The current United Services Military Apprenticeship Program is an  effective program that provides this employer specific training. But,  that program is only offered to the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast  Guard, which is less than half of our uniformed services personnel.   This amendment expands the program to offer it to any member of U.S.  uniformed services--Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard,  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Public Health  Service.   We should make it easier for these brave men and women who have  served to transition to civilian life with a steady job, and, at the  same time, infuse our workforce with the strong leadership skills that  the military can provide.
