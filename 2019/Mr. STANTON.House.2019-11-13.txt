 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4258) to authorize the Marshal of the Supreme Court and the  Supreme Court Police to protect the Justices, employees, and official  guests of the Supreme Court outside of the Supreme Court grounds, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4258         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Reauthorizing Security for       Supreme Court Justices Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. PROTECTION AUTHORITY OF MARSHAL OF THE SUPREME COURT                     AND SUPREME COURT POLICE.         Section 6121 of title 40, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) in paragraph (2), in the matter preceding subparagraph       (A), by striking ``any State'' and inserting ``any       location''; and  [[Page H8797]]         (B) in paragraph (3)--        (i) by striking ``violation of federal or state law'' and       inserting ``violation of Federal or State law''; and        (ii) by striking ``regulation under federal or state law''       and inserting ``regulation under Federal or State law''; and        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) by striking paragraph (2);        (B) by striking ``Additional Requirements'' and all that       follows through ``Duties under'' and inserting       ``Authorization To Carry Firearms--Duties under''; and        (C) by striking ``any State'' and inserting ``any       location''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to thank Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Collins for  moving H.R. 4258, the Reauthorizing Security for Supreme Court Justices  Act of 2019, through the Judiciary Committee in a swift manner.   I would also like to thank my friend and fellow member of the  Judiciary Committee, Congressman Steube, for joining me in introducing  this important piece of legislation.   The Supreme Court Police currently has permanent authority to protect  Justices on Supreme Court grounds; however, its authority to protect  them outside of the Supreme Court grounds is temporary and has been  reauthorized in a bipartisan manner since 1928. H.R. 4258 is a  bipartisan bill that will permanently reauthorize the ability to  protect the Justices outside of the Supreme Court grounds.   With the increase of potential threats against the Justices of the  Supreme Court in recent years and the current authorization set to  expire on December 29 of this year, this bill is needed to remove the  threat of disruptions and security gaps caused by the temporary  authority.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4258. I hope the Senate acts  swiftly and considers this bill. It is critically important that we  protect the Justices of the highest court in our land.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
