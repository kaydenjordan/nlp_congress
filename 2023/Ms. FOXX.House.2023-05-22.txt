 Mr. Speaker, next Monday, we will pause and pay tribute to  the men and women who have died in service to our Nation.   It is a solemn time: one for deep reflection, patriotism, and  gratitude. This upcoming Saturday, members of the High Country chapter  of the Military Officers Association of America will be honoring  deceased military veterans for Memorial Day by placing 600 flags on  their gravesites.   Joining them will be members of The American Legion, ASU military  staff, as well as local Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. Mr. Speaker, seeing  members of the High Country come together in this fashion is  heartwarming.   Let us never forget that we are blessed to live in the freest,  greatest country in the world and that the selfless sacrifices made by  those who have served should always be revered and recognized.                            ____________________
