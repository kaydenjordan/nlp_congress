 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Oak Ridge National  Laboratory Director Dr. Thomas Zacharia, who will retire at the end of  this year, concluding an exemplary career.   Throughout his 35 years at ORNL, Dr. Zacharia has delivered  groundbreaking scientific and technical accomplishments for energy,  national security, and economic benefit to the Nation. Through the  1980s and 1990s, his extraordinary vision served as the guide for  establishing a world-leading computing institution at Oak Ridge.   His visionary leadership has resulted in the deployment of four  number one computers in the world since 2009, with the Frontier  supercomputer breaking the exascale barrier in May 2022. As laboratory  director, Dr. Zacharia has expanded ORNL's scientific impact in  national security, isotopes, biology and environmental systems science,  and energy technologies.   Dr. Zacharia's extraordinary journey from postdoctoral researcher in  1987 to lab director from 2017 to 2022 is well recognized. I thank him  for his service, and I wish him well in his future endeavors.                            ____________________
