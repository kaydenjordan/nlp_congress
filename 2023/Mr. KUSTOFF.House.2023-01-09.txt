 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Family and  Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act.   This new Republican majority is focused on protecting taxpayers and  small businesses from overreach and abuse. Blocking the Biden  administration from unleashing 87,000 new IRS agents on taxpayers is a  crucial first step toward fulfilling our commitment to America.   This legislation will prohibit the IRS from using new funds to target  lower- and middle-class families and small businesses with more  burdensome and intrusive audits.   As households grapple with a struggling economy, the last thing they  need is more harassment from a supercharged IRS.   Republicans are unified in our effort to bring economic relief to  Americans, not more government overreach and hardship.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and  stop the administration's weaponizing of the IRS.
