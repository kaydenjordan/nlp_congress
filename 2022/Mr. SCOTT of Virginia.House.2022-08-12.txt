 Mr. Speaker, with the passage of this bill,  Medicare will finally be able to negotiate for lower drug prices. The  bill extends the American Rescue Plan's reduction in the cost of  insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which has helped us reach the  lowest number of uninsured people ever.   The bill will make the largest ever investment to address climate  change. I am especially pleased with the bill's provisions to  turbocharge the development of offshore wind.   As chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, I am encouraged  by the permanent extension of the black lung excise tax. The extension  will fund future benefits in healthcare for miners in southwest  Virginia and across coal country who are suffering from black lung  disease. Extending the tax will protect the long-term sustainability of  the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund by ensuring that the coal industry  does not shift the cost of benefits from coal companies to miners,  families, or the taxpayer. All of this while simultaneously reducing  the Federal deficit.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.                                time  1215
