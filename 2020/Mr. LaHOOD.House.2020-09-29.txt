 Thank you, Congressman Davis, for yielding.   It is a pleasure to be here tonight with my colleagues to honor    John Shimkus. I obviously echo the remarks of everyone who spoke before  me.   We have heard about John's service, obviously his service at West  Point and his service to the Army, 28 years serving us in the military,  retiring as a lieutenant colonel. But as the newest member of the  Republican delegation, coming in 5 years ago, I just want to comment on  what   John Shimkus has meant to me as a new Member coming in on a  special election in September of 2015.   John is the head of our delegation, was there for me, as he has been  for so many of us here in the Congress. John's friendship, his  mentorship, his example that he has set for us has been invaluable. He  really has set the gold standard for being a legislator, and my  colleagues have talked about that.   He showed the importance of good constituent service, being a  cheerleader for your district, and making the Federal Government work  for the people that you represent. John has been in Congress for all  the right reasons and, as has been articulated by my colleagues, shown  how much he cares for his family, his faith, and the constituents he  represents in southern Illinois.   John, you are going to leave an indelible mark here in the Congress  on the work you did on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and in  the people's House here. Illinois and this country owe you a sincere  thanks for your selfless service, not only to Congress, but to the  Army.                                time  2115    We will miss you in the Illinois delegation, but we know that Karen  and your three sons will be happy to have you home.   Madam Speaker, I also want to mention, putting Congressman Davis  aside, John has hired very good staff in his time in Congress, and I  mean that. If you look at the people that have worked for   John  Shimkus that have come through his organization, they are people that  have gone on to do great things back in Illinois and here in  Washington, D.C., and that is another testament to   John Shimkus and  his team.   Madam Speaker, I have to give a shout out to Craig Roberts, his long- time staffer. He and John have done a remarkable job leading this  delegation and doing so much for their district and the people of  Illinois.   So, John, I want to congratulate you on a well-earned retirement and  thank you for everything you have done for me and our country, and  Congress is a better place because of your service.
