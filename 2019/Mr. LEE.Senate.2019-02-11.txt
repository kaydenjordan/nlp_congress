 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, a little over a month ago, I stood before  this body to object to the massive public lands package that it was  poised to pass. This bill, some 680 pages long, was released at 10 a.m.  that morning--that very morning when they first wanted us to pass this.  My staff and I had not seen it beforehand, and we had been given no  time to read it. This is, of course, really bad process--terrible  process. This is not the way legislation should be written. It is not  the way legislation should be debated. It is, of course, never ever the  way legislation should be passed. In addition to the bad process, I  objected at the time because I suspected that it also contained bad  policy--bad policy that would disproportionately and negatively affect  my State of Utah.   Now we find ourselves today, more than a month later, at a moment at  which we are considering the bill. During that time period, I have, of  course, had time to read the bill. Unfortunately, those suspicions that  I had  [[Page S1157]]  about the bill have since been confirmed. This bill perpetuates a  terrible standard for Federal land policy in the West, particularly for  the State of Utah.   To give one some background, the Federal Government owns more than  640 million acres of land. This is a staggering amount of real estate-- an amount of land that in its totality is larger than the entireties of  France, Spain, Germany, Poland, Italy, the United Kingdom, Austria,  Switzerland, and the Netherlands combined--all of them. I don't mean  the national parks of those lands combined. I don't mean the government  lands owned by those respective nations. I mean the entirety of those  countries combined. That is how much land the Federal Government owns  just within the United States. That is a problem, especially because of  the way it is distributed.   Do you see this? Federal public land is not distributed evenly across  the entire country. It is distributed in such a way that the West bears  a disproportionate burden. In fact, my home State of Utah is a place  that itself bears a disproportionate burden, a disproportionate share  of that land, with two-thirds of the land being owned by the Federal  Government. You will see, on this map, we have Federal land marked in  red, and land that is not owned by the Federal Government is marked in  white. You will see there is a big difference, as you move from west to  east, in the amount of Federal land that exists.   I remember when Eliza, my daughter, was about 8 years old. It was the  first time I ever showed her this map. As best I could, I explained it  to her, an 8-year-old.   At the time, she looked at the map and said:         Look, Daddy. They own Utah.    I said:         Yes, Eliza, you're right. They own Utah.    In every State east of Colorado, the Federal Government owns less  than 15 percent of the land. In many of those States, it is in the low  single digits as a percentage of the total land in a State that is  owned by the Federal Government. In Colorado or in every State west of  Colorado, the Federal Government owns at least 15 percent of the land,  and in many of the States, like mine, it is a lot, lot more than that.  This is, of course, an enormous amount of land. Make no mistake--it  imposes an enormous burden on my State. In light of this, what are my  objections to this bill? Well, there are a few.   First, this bill permanently reauthorizes something called the Land  and Water Conservation Fund, or the LWCF, as it is sometimes  abbreviated. Passed in 1964 by Congress, the LWCF was enacted to  promote and preserve access to recreation opportunities on public  land--to promote and preserve access to recreation opportunities. This  is an admirable and worthy goal, so the fund was set up to be the  principal source of money for new Federal land acquisition and to  assist the States in developing recreation opportunities.   As originally conceived and passed by Congress, it directed 60  percent of its funds to be appropriated for State purposes and 40  percent for Federal purposes. Unfortunately, the program has since  drifted from its original intent and from its original wording, and it  has been a program that has been rife with abuse. I understand that in  some States, people like it, and I understand that in some States, this  is a program that is well regarded. It is not the case in every State.   To be clear, in 1976, the law was amended, and it was amended to  remove that 60-percent State provision, stating simply that not less  than 40 percent must be used for Federal purposes. Then it was silent  on whether a State would, in fact, receive a penny.   The result? Well, it has been used for more Federal land acquisition  than to actually care for, access, and manage the land that we already  have, and 61 percent of funds have historically been used for  acquisition, compared to the 25 percent that has historically been  allocated to State grants. So millions of acres of land have been added  to the Federal Government's already vast estate solely through the LWCF  program.   Not surprisingly, the Federal Government has not always been a good  steward of this land, and that is putting it mildly. Look, the sheer  magnitude of unfunded needs on Federal lands is itself staggering. Now,  this shouldn't be surprising. The Federal Government is run by human  beings, and the Federal Government owns an enormous amount of land--a  staggering amount of land. So for any one entity to own and manage that  much land is going to be a daunting task, and I am not just talking  here about neglect of garden variety BLM lands--those managed by the  Bureau of Land Management or one of the other land management agencies  of the Federal Government. A lot of those lands that comprise what we  might describe as the crown jewels, even of our National Park System-- those parts of the Federal public lands that the American people know  and enjoy the most and identify most closely with what they like about  Federal land management--even many of those have been neglected.   Take, for example, Grand Canyon National Park. We have deferred  maintenance costs there of over $329 million. Yellowstone National Park  has deferred maintenance of over $515 million. That is an enormous  amount of land that is not being properly maintained. So in  Yellowstone, here you have a picture of a road going through the park,  and that road is completely pockmarked and made dangerous--in some  places almost unusable--by potholes that haven't been repaired.   No American would necessarily want to drive down a road that looks  like that. This is some of what happens when you continue to acquire  more when you can't manage what you have.   Here in the Grand Canyon, we have a picture of a pipe that has sprung  a leak and is leaking quite dangerously.   So what we have is a situation that, according to a 2017 CRS report,  has resulted in a maintenance backlog of Federal lands totaling $18.6  billion.   Wildfires have run rampant in parts of the country, especially in the  West, which the government has failed to prevent, and it is not just  that they have failed to prevent those wildfires. It is not just that  the Federal Government is not always well equipped to either prevent  them in the first place or to fight them because of the vast inventory  of lands that it has. In many instances, poor land management processes  have resulted in severe environmental degradation that has itself been  the predictable cause of widespread environmental catastrophe within  Federal public lands.   To cite one of many examples, there is an infestation of a certain  type of bark beetle within a certain area of federally owned forest.  Locals understand that it is coming and ask the Federal Government to  abate the nuisance, to address the infestation. The Federal Government  refuses. The State and local authorities come back and say: OK, will  you at least let us deal with the nuisance, get rid of the bark beetle  so it doesn't destroy the trees, because if it destroys the trees, it  is going to create a local environmental and economic catastrophe for  our people. The Federal Government says no. So the bark beetle does its  damage and destroys hundreds of thousands of acres of wooded area. It  kills the trees. The trees then die.   The local populations go back to the Federal Government and say:  These trees are dead. Will you cut them down so that we don't have this  massive tinderbox of forest fire waiting to happen?   The Federal Government says no.   The people come back, those who live around the area, and say: Can we  cut them down because, otherwise, this is going to be a tinderbox.  There is going to be a fire. People are going to get hurt, and it is  going to wreak havoc on our local environment.   The Federal Government still says no.   Then, guess what happens. Those trees catch on fire. They burn down,  creating environmental catastrophe, disrupting the watershed, and this,  in turn, leads to floods.   All of these things connect back up to poor Federal land management  processes, and those poor Federal land management processes are the  result of the fact that we have too much Federal land in the inventory  to begin with.   Meanwhile, we have ill-kept roads and trails that, in some cases,  have actually kept people away from our national treasures rather than  allowing them to access them.   Furthermore, none of the current LWCF funds--not any of them--are  directed toward maintenance or upkeep  [[Page S1158]]  of these lands, including within our national parks.   But for years now, Congress has perpetuated the status quo of this  broken, dangerous, and environmentally reckless program by  reauthorizing it in giant omnibus spending bills or continuing  resolutions without even the slightest incremental, modest reform.  Worse still would be making reauthorization permanent. Indeed, it would  deny us any regular opportunity as a Congress to actually reform and  improve the program.   Second, the bill creates another 1.3 million acres of wilderness in  the West--half of that being in Emery County, UT.   Now, at the outset, I want to say that wilderness designations might  sound like a good thing, and sometimes they are. But this highly  restrictive designation limits far more activities than is necessary in  many, many instances to actually protect the land.   In fact, a wilderness designation prohibits almost all human  activity. This land usually cannot be used for any commercial activity  or any infrastructure. It cannot be developed for recreational purposes  or traveled across by car, bus, automobile, or even a bicycle--even a  bicycle made for that specific purpose--to say nothing of any type of  agricultural development or timber harvesting. In a State like Utah,  where the Federal Government owns more than two-thirds of the land,  these designations have big consequences, especially for the poor and  middle class in my State.   The amount of Federal land in Utah already sets out a great  disadvantage to the people of Utah to begin with. While private  landowners would pay property taxes on this land, and those taxes would  go to the State and its political subdivisions, the Federal Government  does not. It does not pay property taxes. So Utah is deprived of what  should be and otherwise would be a huge source of revenue and of  opportunity.   What does that mean? Well, as a result, our schools are underfunded,  local governments are crippled, fire departments are, ironically,  depleted and, therefore, unable to properly take care of the lands they  are charged to protect in the first place, and many times strapped in  their ability to provide basic services to those most in need.   With so much of this land in the grip of Federal bureaucrats, it is  again limited in its use, in its opportunity, in its potential for use  for development, for infrastructure, and for jobs that are essential to  our State's economy--jobs that would be essential to any State's  economy.   But with further wilderness designations by Congress, this is an even  tighter grip. As the LWCF perpetuates the acquisition of even more  Federal public land, communities like those throughout my State start  to suffer even more. Citizens, you see, in this type of an environment  have to go to the Federal Government, cap in hand, to ask permission  for the use of any of the land at all, for access to any of the land at  all, whether that means to dig a well, to build a road, to bury a  cable, or to do virtually anything on it at all.   So designating more than 660,000 acres of wilderness in Emery County  is of no small consequence.   I understand that a lot of people here like the fact that we are  doing that. Make no mistake. They are not the people who live in Emery  County. They are not the people who live within hundreds or even  thousands of miles of Emery County.   Finally, this bill does nothing to address the imminent threat that  Utah faces from unilateral Executive land grabs through the Antiquities  Act.   To be clear, anything and everything that is designated as red on  this map may be designated as a national monument overnight, at any  moment, solely at the discretion of the President. Anything here is  fair game to any President, at any time, to say: I now make you a  monument.   Now, the Antiquities Act, passed in 1906, was intended to give the  President of the United States the power to declare land that is  already owned or controlled by the Federal Government as a national  monument and to do so by Executive fiat. This was done in order to  protect specific historic and cultural objects in the case of an  emergency where they couldn't otherwise be protected. But instead of  reserving the smallest area compatible with the proper care and  management of the objects to be protected, as the law itself requires  and as the text of the Antiquities Act itself mandates, Presidents in  more modern times have designated enormous, million-acre monuments far  beyond the scope of the objects in need of immediate protection.   These monument designations--perhaps the most restrictive of all  Federal land designations--often do more harm than good. They radically  undermine a State's economy by prohibiting energy production, mining,  fishing, ranching, recreation, and a myriad of other uses.   Furthermore, without allowing Congress or the State legislature any  actionable input in a decision like this, they effectively silence and  disenfranchise the voices of the people closest to and most affected by  and connected to the lands in question, depriving them of any say in  the process. This is not fair. It is wrong, and it is something that  needs to be addressed.   Take, for example, the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument,  designated by President Clinton in 1996. The Clinton administration  designated 1.7 million acres of land--or about 67 percent of Kane  County, UT, for the monument, all the while claiming that grazing would  remain at historical levels.   But this promise, of course, was not kept. Since then, the BLM has  revoked permits and closed much needed range land. You see, the men and  women of the Bureau of Land Management, while well educated, well  intentioned, and perhaps hard-working in many instances, are not from  Utah. They don't respond to or stand accountable to anyone who is from  Utah. They don't come from these parts of the country or from my State,  where people's day-to-day livelihood and their ability to access their  own land for their own purposes and to make a living--they don't have  anything to do with this land. So why would they care? They don't.   Today, grazing is down almost one-third from what it had been more  than two decades ago when the Grand Staircase-Escalante National  Monument was proclaimed by President Clinton--proclaimed and designated  as such, by the way, without any advance notice to the people of Utah,  without the President even entering the State of Utah to do it.   Now, ranchers were hit hard. Many of them lost their ability to fence  in water resources and maintain roads around them. In some cases, they  could no longer bring water to their cattle, and many families were  forced to reduce their herds, sometimes by half. This may not sound  like much to someone who doesn't understand ranching or doesn't know  anyone who makes their living off of ranching, but this means all the  world to those people whose families for generations have supported  themselves through ranching and ranching in that area where they are  deeply connected to this land.   Of course, there was the designation of the Bears Ears National  Monument by President Obama. The citizens of San Juan County, UT,-- incidentally, Utah's poorest county--woke up on December 28, 2016, to  find out that the Obama administration had unilaterally designated 1.35  million acres for that monument overnight, even though they had  specifically pleaded against that.   Keep in mind that San Juan County has historically had some  divisions--some of them along political lines, between Republicans and  Democrats, and some of them along ethnic lines, between those who are  Native American and those who are not.   This was an issue that united Democrats and Republicans alike in San  Juan County. It united Native Americans in San Juan County and non- Native Americans in San Juan County like few issues ever have in San  Juan County and few issues ever will in San Juan County. This brought  them together because people from all walks of life opposed this if  they lived in San Juan County.   President Obama, at the time he declared it, claimed this to have had  the overwhelming support of Native American populations. What was often  left out of that discussion is they were not the Native American  populations in Utah. They were not the people who lived in San Juan  County. They were people outside of this area, most of them out of  State, who supported it.  [[Page S1159]]    Yes, it is easy to designate something as wilderness or a national  monument when it is not in your land, when it is not in your community,  when it doesn't affect your way of life. That is what happens when we  abuse Federal public land ownership. That is what happens when you take  one State and decide the Federal Government is going to own more than  two-thirds of the land in that State.   Imagine if in your State--or in any other State--any other land  owner, whether an individual, a for-profit corporation, a nonprofit  foundation, or anything else, owned more than, let's say, 5 percent of  the land. People would be understandably, justifiably concerned that  that person or that entity or that nonprofit, or whatever it was, could  have a disproportionate, outsized impact on that State's economy.   Imagine if that number were increased to include not just 5 percent  of the land in your State, but 10, 15, 20, 25 percent of the land. As  you rounded the corner of 30 percent, people would start to get freaked  out. Imagine if that number then soared above that--35, 40, 45, 50  percent--until it got up to nearly 70 percent of the land in your  State. Imagine further that, at that point, that landowner declared  itself exempt from all forms of property taxation. That would create  problems for your State.   This is what I beg and plead for my colleagues from around the  country, particularly those who live east of Colorado, to understand.  It is really easy to support these things when it is in somebody else's  State. It is really for people on the northeastern seaboard to look at  Utah and say: Well, it is just one of those square States. They have  plenty of land out there. They have plenty of room. They don't need to  worry about it.   Try living there. Try earning a living there for your family. It is  not right. This goes against so much of what we believe in, in this  country.   Federal land ownership is not the only unfair thing about this.  Again, Federal land ownership makes possible the designation  unilaterally, by one person, of a national monument, and if that one  person happens to decide that a particular State ought to be the next  victim, that person will make it so.   It just so happens that, just as Utah has a disproportionate share of  Federal public land in its State, so, too, is it a disproportionate  victim under the Antiquities Act. Since the passage of the Antiquities  Act, Presidents have designated 77.85 million acres of land as national  monuments, and 87 percent of that has been designated in the last 40  years. Of the land that has been designated as a monument over the last  25 years, 3.23 million acres, or 28 percent, are in Utah. All of the  land in the United States designated as a monument in the last 25  years, that portion--nearly 30 percent--is in my State. Why is that  fair? It is not, especially when you consider the harm done to the  economies, the disruption that takes place as a result of these  designations, the widespread opposition from Democrats and Republicans  alike, and in San Juan County the Native American population and the  non-Native American population alike are overwhelmingly against this.   What was intended to be an act of cultural preservation has, sadly,  deteriorated into a greedy, harmful Federal land grab. As it currently  stands, there is always the threat of a decision coming down from on  high that will utterly decimate the livelihoods of people in Utah.  There is no good reason for this.   Already, two other States have felt the abuse of the Antiquities Act  within their borders, and they have received relief. In the 1950s,  Wyoming and Alaska successfully called on Congress to grant them  Antiquities Act protections. Why? Because they had been  disproportionately burdened by this law. As a result of their efforts,  in Wyoming, any monument designation must be approved by Congress, and,  in Alaska, any designation made by Presidential fiat that exceeds 5,000  acres must be approved by Congress.   To be clear, in both of these States, Congress still has the power to  designate this. It is just that they are saying, for those States where  it has been abused in the past, Congress as a whole--people's elected  lawmakers as a whole in Congress--ought to be the ones designating,  rather than putting it in the hands of one person.    There is no reason why the people of Utah, who have suffered more  under the Antiquities Act than any other population in the entire  country, should be treated any differently. There is no reason Utahns  should live under this constant threat of abuse. That is why we have  offered an amendment that would remedy this.   With permanent authorization of the LWCF, which will result only in a  greater Federal land footprint, and with the roughly 660,000 acres of  new wilderness designation in Utah, I fear my State is at even greater  risk for yet another monument designation. Thus, at a bare minimum,  Utah deserves the same protection Wyoming has received. Our amendment  would add just two words: ``or Utah.'' Without it, I simply cannot vote  for this bill. With it, it gives us the protection we deserve and  protection that other States like ours have already received.   In a day and age when we have to deal with 680-page bills dropped on  our desks at 10 a.m. on the day we are asked to pass it or a 2,232 page  spending bill, as we faced last March for the omnibus spending package,  a bill that is not two pages long, but just two words long, should be  welcomed.   There is much that is wrong with our Federal land policy in the West,  and, unfortunately, much of that is something that this bill fails to  correct. Utahns, and Americans, deserve better than the stranglehold  that the Federal Government is exercising over so much of our country's  lands. Yet Washington greedily continues to grab more, year after year,  imposing tighter and tighter restrictions, all the while failing to  maintain the lands that it already owns. These lands will not be  national treasures for everyone if we can't take care of them in the  first place. Indeed, they will be treasures for no one if we continue  along this same pattern of willful neglect.   Let me be very clear. My opposition today is not about whether our  national treasures or parks or monuments or lands should be protected.  It is not about whether they should be, but how to do that and who is  best equipped to do that and who is most knowledgeable to do it well.   What I am asking for is for Utah's elected leaders--its elected  lawmakers in Congress--to at least be given a chance to weigh in on  these matters before they become law, rather than to have those  decisions being made from thousands of miles away by just one person.  Indeed, the very best way to ensure that these national treasures are  protected and recreation available is to empower our States and our  local communities, which understand and appreciate their backyards  best. They know which land to prioritize, and they know how to make  that happen.   Just look at the State and local ballot initiatives in the last few  decades to see the evidence. Since 1988, these State initiatives have  approved over $72 billion in combined expenditures for recreation and  conservation. These things matter to States and local communities, and  they have already raised huge funds and found ways to preserve and  competently manage their public lands.   Protection of our lands will happen without the Federal Government's  thumb on the scale, and it will happen in a way that actually makes  these treasures more available for future generations. We will not be  helping them preserve them, however, by denying access to the people  who are in the best position themselves to preserve them; that is, the  people who live and work and recreate on them, the people whose lives  are interwoven with them and have been for generations. And we will not  be helping the American people by depriving them of their livelihoods.  That is why I have introduced amendments that would make reforms and  improvements to the LWCF, the Emery County wilderness designation bill  and other provisions in this package--amendments that would steer our  lands policy in a better direction, at least as a starting point.   These are conversations worth having. They need to be had, and we  ought to have them. But at a bare minimum, with the least shred of  compromise, we could add just those two words--``or Utah''--to give  Utahns justice, to give them a voice in managing and caring for their  lands.  [[Page S1160]]                         Amendment No. 187 to Amendment No. 112     Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 187 to amendment  No. 112.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading  of the amendment be dispensed with.
