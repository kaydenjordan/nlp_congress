 Mr. Speaker, President Trump's Department of  Justice letter seeking the invalidation of the entire Affordable Care  Act by the Fifth Circuit is nothing short of self-sabotage.   The Trump position in Texas v. United States would deny coverage for  those with preexisting conditions, dismantle protections on out-of- pocket costs and the ban on annual and lifetime caps, and the return of  the notorious donut hole for seniors on expensive medications would  come forward again.   I support this resolution. It is important that we band together to  protect the Affordable Care Act and its protections against junk  insurance policies.   The American people deserve to know whether their Representative is  going to fight for them and vote to condemn the DOJ's actions or if  they will simply fall in line behind this President on his thoughtless  and heartless mission to destroy access to the healthcare system for  millions of Americans.
