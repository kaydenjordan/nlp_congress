 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    ``Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or  abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.'' Most  Americans believe that the Equal Rights Amendment is part of our  Constitution today, but it is not.   Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated:         Every Constitution written since the end of World War II       includes a provision that men and women are citizens of equal       stature. Ours does not.    The State of Maryland has a provision very similar to that in its  State constitution. Many of our States have acted on the Equal Rights  Amendment, but, as Justice Scalia said, ``Certainly the Constitution  does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. The only issue is  whether it prohibits it. It doesn't.''   We need to pass the Equal Rights Amendment in the Constitution of the  United States for many reasons. The most basic reason is that it  provides additional protection against discrimination against women. It  has a higher standard to prevent discrimination. It shows America's  leadership globally on human rights.   In 1972, Congress started the process by passing the Equal Rights  Amendment. We passed it in 1972. Now, of course, it requires 38 States  to ratify it before it can become law. To date, 37 States have ratified  the Equal Rights Amendment. We are one short of accomplishing our  objective of putting the Equal Rights Amendment at long last in the  Constitution of the United States. But there is an additional potential  hurdle; that is, when Congress passed the resolution in 1972, it put a  7-year time limit for the States to act. They extended that to 10  years. This is strictly a provision that is discretionary to Congress.  Article V of the Constitution puts no limit on the time for  ratification of a constitutional amendment proposed by Congress for the  States to ratify. In fact, the 27th Amendment was ratified in 1992.  That  [[Page S6589]]  deals with congressional pay raises. It was first proposed in 1789 to  be part of the Bill of Rights, and over 200 years later, it was  ratified. So there is no time limit in the Constitution for the  ratification of a constitutional amendment.   To remove any doubt, Congress should extend the time, as it did once  before. In order to accomplish that, I joined with Senator Murkowski,  the Senator from Alaska, in a bipartisan effort on S. Res. 6 that  removes the deadline, the time limit on the passage of the Equal Rights  Amendment.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record an op-ed piece written by Senator Murkowski and myself in regard  to why we need to get that resolution passed.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Washington Post, Jan. 25, 2019]            It's Time To Finally Pass the Equal Rights Amendment                     (By Lisa Murkowski and Ben Cardin)       Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, represents Alaska in the       Senate. Ben Cardin, a Democrat, represents Maryland in the       Senate.         Men and women should be treated equally under the law. It       seems pretty basic, right?        As we approach the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage,       it comes as a shock to so many that the U.S. Constitution       does not guarantee women the same rights and protections as       men.        We come from different ends of the political spectrum, but       we agree that this needs to change. Women compose a majority       of the American population but continue to be       underrepresented in government, elected office, the courts       and business world. A level playing field should not be a       euphemism but rather a reality for women (and men) from       Anchorage to Annapolis and everywhere in between.        ``Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or       abridged by the United States or by any State on account of       sex.''        This is the full substance of the Equal Rights Amendment.       It's a little less than a tweet, but it will make a positive       difference in the lives of millions of women.        Why is this still necessary? During a 2011 interview,       Justice Antonin Scalia summed up the need for an Equal Rights       Amendment. He said: ``Certainly the Constitution does not       require discrimination on the basis of sex. The only issue is       whether it prohibits it. It doesn't.''        On the other side of the spectrum, Justice Ruth Bader       Ginsburg laid out the rationale for the ERA in simple terms:       ``Every constitution written since the end of World War II       includes a provision that men and women are citizens of equal       stature. Ours does not.''        Why has it taken this long? Per the Constitution, an       amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the states to       be enacted. While most amendments are put forward without a       time limit, this one came with a seven-year deadline. The       original was extended to 10 years, but still, only 35 states       had ratified the ERA by 1982.        While the clock stood frozen at the federal level, today,       nearly half of the states--including Maryland and Alaska--      have a version of the ERA written into their constitutions.       Gender-based equality represents the present-day views of the       vast majority of people across the United States, and is the       spirit that underpins our bipartisan legislation.        The deadline passed in 1982, so isn't this effort futile?       Not at all.        Nationally, momentum began to shift about two years ago, as       women across the country began to raise their voices again in       calls for solidarity and equality. The ERA had never gone       away, but the #MeToo movement gave it a jolt of energy and a       new spotlight for inequalities in U.S. law.        In March 2017, 45 years to the day after Congress       overwhelmingly approved the ERA, Nevada became the 36th state       to ratify the amendment. And then, in May 2018, Illinois       became the 37th.        What had for years been referred to as a three-state plan--      working to have Congress remove the ratification deadline so       that three more states could ratify the ERA, and it would       become enshrined in our constitution--had suddenly become a       one-state plan.        Earlier this month, Virginia started the ratification       process in their state legislature. Alabama, Arizona,       Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri,       North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah could also       become state No. 38. Congress can do its part by explicitly       removing the deadline it once set.        Article V of the Constitution contains no time limits for       ratification of amendments. The states finally ratified the       27th Amendment in 1992 regarding congressional pay raises       more than 200 years after Congress proposed it in 1789 as       part of the Bill of Rights.        The original deadline for ERA ratification was not in the       amendment itself but only in the text of the joint resolution       proposing the amendment. This is to say the amendment itself       has no arbitrary deadline attached.        Whether on purpose or not, Congress handcuffed itself at       the time it passed the ERA. But this Congress can and should       easily amend that language to remove the deadline for       ratification.        We are proud to work together on a bipartisan basis to move       this essential legislation over the finish line and finally       make the ERA part of the Constitution--guaranteeing equality       under the law for women.        Women should not be held back or provided less opportunity,       respect or protections under the law because of their gender.       This is not a partisan issue but one of universal human       rights. Gender equality should be an explicit, basic       principle of our society.    Madam President, on November 13, the House Judiciary  Committee took up a very similar resolution, H.J. Res. 79 by  Representative Jackie Speier, and it has now been reported out  favorably. So we now have moving through the House of Representatives a  resolution that would remove this time limit that was imposed in the  1970s on the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.   What I am imploring upon my colleagues is, we are very close to  getting this done. We know there was a change in leadership in  Virginia. Virginia could very well be the 38th State. But let's remove  the ambiguity as to a time limit.   We will celebrate in this Congress the 100th anniversary of the  passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the women's suffrage  amendment that passed in 1920. Why did it take so long for women to  have the right to vote? Well, people are asking: Why is it taking so  long to put the Equal Rights Amendment into the Constitution of the  United States?   We have a plan to get this done by passing the resolution I talked  about, the 38th State to ratify it, and that at long last, the United  States will provide the leadership on universal human rights by placing  the Equal Rights Amendment in our Constitution.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, it is with great pride that I name  K. Neal Truck and Bus Center the United States Senate Small Business of  the Week.   K. Neal Truck and Bus Center is a family-owned business based in  Hyattsville, MD. Following a decades-long career in the grocery  business, Stephen Neal purchased a trucking business and renamed it  after his son, Korey Neal.   Together, the father-son team has turned K. Neal into the second  largest minority-owned truck and bus supplier in the country, with more  than $100 million in annual revenue and just under 100 employees.   On the Senate Small Business Committee, we often speak of small  businesses as drivers of economic growth and innovation, but they are  often also pillars in their communities, and K. Neal is no exception.   I had the privilege of meeting with Stephen, Korey, and several K.  Neal executives last month, and I was impressed by the company's  commitment to empowering all its employees and investing in its  community.   Half of the executives at K. Neal are women, and for the past 5  years, the company has partnered with the Prince George's County  Economic Development Corporation to train workers from underserved  communities to become diesel technicians. I am proud to share that 14  individuals have completed the program, and 8 of them are currently  employed by the company. The company also voluntarily banned  [[Page S6603]]  the box for returning citizens convicted of nonviolent crimes.   Thanks to K. Neal's history of business success and commitment to  investing in their community and their neighbors, the U.S. Black  Chambers of Commerce presented its 2019 Emerging Leaders & Influencers  Award to the company.   I applaud Stephen and Korey for building a successful company and  using their company to make a positive difference in the lives of so  many. They have truly made Prince George's proud.                            ____________________
