 I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate  amendment to H.R. 7776 with an amendment numbered 6526.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for up to 6  minutes of debate equally divided.    I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of myself and  Senator Cruz. I want to say I appreciate Senate leadership for allowing  this amendment. I appreciate, as does Senator Cruz, the conferees'  willingness to consider or repeal the vaccine mandate, which they  didn't include. We truly appreciate that.   This amendment reflects the fact that we don't think the vaccine  mandate went far enough. So our amendment is pretty simple, it  immediately ends the vaccine mandate, whereas what is in the bill  allows it to continue for 30 days.   It prohibits DOD from imposing a future COVID-19 vaccine mandate  without the express authorization of Congress. It prohibits DOD from  taking any adverse action against a servicemember solely for refusing  to get the COVID-19 vaccine.   It allows the servicemember to be reinstated with backpay if kicked  out of the military solely for refusing the vaccine. And it redresses  any other types of adverse actions the DOD took against a servicemember  for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine.   People serving in our military are the finest among us. Over 8,000  were terminated because they refused to get this experimental vaccine,  and so I am urging all of my colleagues to support the Senators and my  amendment.    Mr. President, how much time do I have left?    I would argue that it is not a lawful order because the  executive order required that the vaccine be fully FDA-approved. In  August of 2021, the FDA did something very strange: They extended the  emergency use authorization for the vaccine available in the U.S. and  granted approval on Comirnaty. But that, to my knowledge--and I have  asked repeatedly--none of that has been made available to our members  of the service. So it is not a fully FDA-approved product. And the FDA  is completely ignoring its own safety surveillance systems on VAERS.  There have been over 32,500 deaths reported worldwide. Twenty-six  percent of those deaths are occurring on a zero, 1 or 2 following  vaccination. There are all kinds of different, scary safety signals  that are being ignored. It was not unreasonable for people to refuse  this experimental gene therapy.    Yes.                                Vote on Motion     I ask for the yeas and nays.
