 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, today I rise in honor of the brave men  and women in blue who serve and protect us each and every day. I am  proud to be able to be part of this Special Order remembering  Washington State law enforcement, and I am proud to share this Special  Order with most all of the delegation of the great State of Washington.   According to statistics released by the FBI, intentional killings of  law enforcement in the year 2021 were the highest in 20 years. Already  this year--and we are only in April--there have been more officers shot  and killed than all of last year.    Every day, police officers across central Washington, across my  State, and across the United States put on a badge and go to work  knowing they face extremely dangerous situations exacerbated by  significant economic uncertainties, open border policies, and the  raging opioid crisis.   Let me be clear: Nothing justifies the targeting and the murdering of  law enforcement. Whether on regularly scheduled patrol duty or  answering an urgent call for help, law enforcement officers put on  their uniforms every day with no guarantee they will return home  safely.   Just 3 weeks ago, Madam Speaker, Pierce County Sheriff's Deputy  Dominique ``Dom'' Calata, a 35-year-old Army veteran, who had been with  the force for the past 6\1/2\ years, made the ultimate sacrifice while  protecting his community. While assisting the South Sound Gang Task  Force and serving a warrant for second degree assault, Deputy Calata  was shot and killed. The deputy leaves behind his wife and a 4-year-old  son.   Tragically, during his memorial service 2 weeks ago, Everett police  officer Dan Rocha was killed during a run-in with a suspect who shot  and killed him before running over his body while fleeing the scene.  His memorial service took place just this afternoon. Officer Rocha  leaves behind his wife, as well as two children.   Madam Speaker, I would ask for a moment of silence for both of these  brave officers.                                time  1945    We all owe a debt of gratitude to these individuals who risk their  lives to enforce the law and to protect our communities.   Law enforcement officers take time away from their families, their  loved ones, often without the thanks that they deserve, and often,  putting themselves in harm's way. Our men and women in law enforcement  deserve nothing less than our full support.   I am deeply concerned, frankly, with the anti-police policies that  our State has implemented and continues to consider. While there may  have been positive steps taken to roll back this legislation this past  session, there is still much progress to be made, both in Washington,  and at the Federal level.   We have to fully fund our police departments. We have to provide them  with the necessary resources to do their important jobs.   Over the past several years, I have had many opportunities to meet  with police officers, with sheriffs, first responders, all across  Central Washington in my district. I participated in ride-alongs with  officers, from Pasco and from Sunnyside to see firsthand how they  interact with their neighbors and local businesses.   And I regularly meet with law enforcement officers in each of our  counties to learn how I can help them in Congress to make their  policing efforts much more effective.   I am constantly in awe of the great work that these officers are  doing to engage with families that are in need, or at-risk children, as  well as students, and individuals who may be in danger. They do all of  this with the goal of making our Central Washington communities a  better, safer place to live and work; and for that I am truly grateful.   Police officers around the country are dedicated to protecting us and  defending the liberties that we hold dear. Law enforcement officers  selflessly put themselves in harm's way to protect Americans, preserve  the peace, and maintain law and order. They are truly heroes in blue,  and we owe them our respect and our support.   Today, I remember Deputy Calata and Officer Rocha, and offer my  sincere condolences to their family, their friends, and the departments  that they left behind all too soon.   I commit to continuing to fight for the men and women in law  enforcement and their families who sacrifice so much to keep our  communities safe. Today, as well as every day, we offer our  appreciation and our respect for law enforcement officers across this  great Nation.   Madam Speaker, as I said, I am honored and delighted that we have  many members of the Washington State delegation to share in this  Special Order this evening, to share their thoughts and their  observations about what is going on, not only in our State, but States  across the country.   I first want to turn to my neighboring district, to my east and thank  her for being part of this Special Order.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Spokane, Washington,  (Mrs. Rodgers).  [[Page H4149]]         Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks;  heroes, I couldn't say it better.   Now I yield to the gentlewoman from the west side of my district in  Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler), my good colleague and friend.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments.  I thank her for adding to the list. The list is far too long for us to  list everyone, unfortunately. And it is like the gentlewoman said: I  wish we were here for a happier occasion, but this is an important one  and I thank the gentlewoman for her contributions.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the Eighth  Congressional District of Washington (Ms. Schrier), another neighbor. I  am surrounded with good Members of Congress. I believe she lives in the  town of Sammamish.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's remarks  for a very special occasion here.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Medina, Washington, (Ms. DelBene), my  friend. We used to work together in Olympia, serving as cabinet members  together.    Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. DelBene for those great  words.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen),  from the city of Everett, one of our longer-serving colleagues and a  very well-respected Member of Congress.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Larsen for  personalizing this. This is your hometown, and this is real stuff. Like  Ms. Herrera Beutler said, I wish we were here for a more celebratory  cause, but this is very important. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Strickland), from the city of Tacoma, one of our newest colleagues in  the House of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Strickland for making this  very special. Pierce County is a huge and important part of our State.  Unfortunately, one of the most recent tragedies was in Pierce County,  and I thank the gentlewoman for being part of this Special Order and  recognizing that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer),  my final speaker today. He may be the last but certainly one of the  best, and he is a good friend, who I served with in the State  legislature, from Gig Harbor.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Kilmer for his great words  and for putting some specifics around what we can do to help the men  and women in blue and green and brown keep our communities safe.   Madam Speaker, the cost, as you know, of keeping our communities  safe, keeping us safe, is great. The people who pay the price of that  cost are very dedicated, special people. It truly is a solemn honor for  all of us to be able to pay tribute to, and to thank, the men and women  who work every day to do just that, keep us safe.   As Mr. Kilmer just said, we should be committed to doing all we can  to provide all they need for them to be able to do their jobs.   Madam Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues from the State of  Washington, and I thank the men and women who do their jobs without  thinking twice, who are dedicated to protecting us, to keeping our  families and communities safe. We owe them a great deal.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
