 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good  friend and colleague from New York, who is the ranking member on Small  Business, as an outstanding leader on Puerto Rico, on business, on  women, and in so many areas. I rise today and join my colleague on the  other side of the aisle, Ann Wagner, in strong support of H.R. 6729,  the Empowering Financial Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act.   This bill cracks down on human traffickers and human trafficking in  general, which is one of the worst crimes imaginable. This bill will  save lives by cracking down on human trafficking.   Human trafficking is the fastest growing criminal enterprise in the  world. It already generates over $150 billion in profits every year.  There are only two crimes that generate more revenue, and those are  selling drugs and selling guns. But in human trafficking, you can sell  the body over and over again, usually until they die.   The $150 billion is an astonishing amount of money, and that is why  it is so important to make sure that financial institutions have access  to high-quality, up-to-date information on human traffickers and the  companies and individuals involved in this terrible trade.   This bill would ensure that financial institutions get the  information they need about trafficking so that they can take  appropriate action to protect both themselves and the sufferers of  human trafficking.   The bill would give qualified nonprofits a legal safe harbor when  they share information about human trafficking with financial  institutions.                                time  1645    And it is not-for-profits that have been the most successful in  combating and stopping this horrible crime.   The nonprofits would have to be registered with Treasury in order to  qualify for the safe harbor and would have to abide by any safeguards  Treasury establishes to ensure that the information they are providing  is credible and accurate.   So the bill would not open the door to blatantly false or malicious  accusations being made. To the contrary, it would help nonprofits who  are actively engaged in stopping human trafficking around the world.   Without this safe harbor, these nonprofits would be afraid to share  the information they have about traffickers with banks out of fear of  being sued.   This bill is supported by law enforcement. This bill will allow a  cracking down on this terrible, terrible crime that costs the lives of  thousands of our young people. It is important.   This bill will save lives. That is why I support it, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.
