 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Doug Martens of Rosebud County for his years of service to  his community and being elected to serve as president of the Montana  Association of Counties.   Doug raised is family in Montana and is a proud husband, father, and  grandfather. Before serving 10 years as a commissioner in Rosebud  County, Doug was a fire warden and president of the Montana Fire  Wardens Association. Doug is a dedicated public servant, and at the  same time, he runs his  [[Page S7421]]  family farm and ranch operation outside of Forsyth, MT.   Doug has also been an outspoken advocate for Montana energy and coal  jobs. He has been a passionate leader in this space and continues to  help educate Montanans on the importance of coal including the jobs it  creates and the energy it produces throughout our Nation.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Doug for his lifetime of service  to the people of Rosebud County. I have no doubt his dedication and  hard work will continue to serve his community and the Montana  Association of Counties exceptionally well.                            ____________________
