 Mr. Speaker, it is past time for Congress to exert  our authority over the questions of war and peace; and I am proud to  vote for this concurrent resolution to invoke the War Powers Act in  order to restrain this reckless President.   This vote would halt military operations and force the President to  come to Congress to authorize any further acts of war.   The President, remarkably, said: ``All is well.''   Well, Mr. President, it is not well. Iran announced that it would  withdraw from the nuclear agreement and will begin to resume its  nuclear weapons plan. The United States has been forced to stop its  actions against ISIS. Iraq is likely to expel the United States from  its country, fulfilling what has been a dream, actually, of Soleimani.   Our European allies are angry because they were not alerted, and our  actions have united the people of Iraq against us, and the people of  Iran are together now.   Mr. President, America is not safer because of what you have done.  And we must pass this resolution.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 535, the  PFAS Action Act, sponsored by Congresswoman Dingell and Congressman  Upton.   The EPA has acknowledged that PFAS chemical exposure can lead to  adverse health effects for human beings, but it has been very slow to  do anything about it.   PFAS chemicals present a clear and present danger to communities all  over the United States. They are linked to cancer, can cause birth  defects, disrupt thyroid hormones, and affect the immune system.   Beyond the military, where it is all over our bases, the chemicals  can be found in food packaging, commercial household products, our  workplaces, and our drinking water; and certain PFAS chemicals are so  dangerous that they are no longer manufactured in the United States.   Mr. Chair, we need to pass this bill, as we have done once before.
