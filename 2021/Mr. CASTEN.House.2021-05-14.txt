 Madam Speaker, wildfires, flooding, and superstorms are  the most tangible signs of a warming planet, but the climate crisis is  not just about weather. It is about wealth.   A recent study by Swiss Re found that if we remain on our current  trajectory, global GDP will fall by 18 percent by 2050. Investors  understand this. They care about climate change because it is in their  economic self-interest.   As BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said, ``Climate risk is investment  risk.'' Main Street investors have put $37 trillion, roughly one-third  of all assets under management, into climate-focused ESG investments.   Unfortunately, our regulation has not kept up with that demand. There  is no consistent definition of how to quantify a firm's contribution  to, or protection from, a warming globe. Left to choose from a menu of  methodologies, companies often just pick what is most favorable to  them.   We don't allow companies to pick their own financial accounting  standards. Investors are asking us to provide the same consistency for  their climate accounting. That is why I introduced the Climate Risk  Disclosure Act, which directs the SEC to create consistent mandatory  climate reporting standards for all public companies.    This will allow companies to compete for capital on a level playing  field, providing investors with the certainty they need to hedge their  financial risk. Yesterday my bill passed committee and will now come to  the floor.   The right time to safeguard our financial system against climate  change was decades ago, but our last chance is now.                            ____________________
