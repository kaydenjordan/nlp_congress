 Madam Speaker, any man's death diminishes me. We will never  forget, the world will never forget, as we watched as a police officer  knelt on George Floyd's neck for more than 8 minutes.   George Floyd cried out for his mother, saying ``Mama, mama, mama,  mama, mama, mama, mama, I can't breathe. I love you. Tell my kids I  love them. I am dead.''   As he was murdered by an officer sworn to protect and serve,  Americans of all races and backgrounds flooded the streets all across  this Nation, demanding long overdue accountability so that no one has  to live in fear of the police.   They demanded that we recognize George Floyd's death and the deaths  of so many others at the hands of the police. These killings have left  the Black community and, much more importantly, our entire community  traumatized and scared. Wounds cannot heal without accountability.   This is not an anti-police bill. The George Floyd Justice in Policing  Act is for Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, and  so many more.   Any man's death diminishes me.
