 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life and legacy of my friend, Dr. Donald H. Tucker of Greenville,  North Carolina.   An altruistic and humble husband, father, and friend, Dr. Tucker was  considered by many to be the gateway to healthcare in eastern North  Carolina.   Dr. Tucker completed his undergraduate and medical studies at Duke  University, and following completion of his residency in internal  medicine at Cornell, he then returned to Duke for a cardiology  fellowship.   Dr. Tucker then would serve as the director of the cardiopulmonary  catheterization lab at the Portsmouth, Virginia, naval hospital,  earning the rank of lieutenant commander.   Dr. Tucker then returned home to Greenville and eventually opened up  a multispecialty physician clinic called Quadrangle Physicians, which  eventually turned into Physicians East, the largest multispecialty  private group in eastern North Carolina.   Dr. Tucker was a pillar of our community, a leader in his church and  multiple charitable organizations, and a leader who helped bring a  medical school to rural eastern North Carolina. Dr. Tucker advocated  for all those around him and unfailingly strived to advance the well- being of our State and community.    Madam Speaker, I was honored to know Dr. Tucker as a friend and  physician colleague. I ask that everyone today please join me in  honoring the incredible life of Dr. Donald Tucker.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this so-called  competition bill proves just how feckless Democrats are about  confronting our biggest adversary, the Chinese Communist Party. Why is  this President so afraid to call out China? They are our greatest  generational threat to democracy, human rights, and the American way of  life. China will stop at nothing until they have world domination.   Confronting Communist China should be a clear bipartisan priority. As  Secretary Pompeo recently said, the Chinese have infiltrated our  schools, businesses, and politics, and will stop at nothing until they  have world domination.   We should be coming together on a strong consensus framework that  holds China accountable and strengthens our national security. Instead,  Speaker Pelosi offers more poison pills that will be dead on arrival in  the Senate. Let us stop the nonsensical leftist Progressive messaging  and be serious about our jobs.   Democrats have steamrolled Congress with yet another multi-billion  dollar package, thousands of pages long, without proper analysis. Our  Nation now hits a $30 trillion debt mark this week.   Madam Speaker, I refuse to support another package that sends hard- earned taxpayer dollars to the Chinese Communist Party. Please, I urge  my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the America concedes to China act.
