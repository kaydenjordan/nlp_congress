 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Ceole Speight.   Elta Ceole Branam Speight was born on June 8, 1928, and was reunited  in Heaven with her husband of 63 years, Joseph, on January 24, 2022.   As a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 455,  Ceole was appointed as the volunteer and programs director at the  Harris County  [[Page H951]]  AFL-CIO in 1968. She would go on to give 40 years of dedicated service  to the labor movement in Houston and in Texas.   She will be remembered by many as a strong, Democratic woman who  fought for what she believed in, who always saw what was wrong and  tried to make it right. I will remember her as a hard worker, whose  hard work was really infectious. You simply could not sit by when Ceole  was around. She guided, she pushed, she advised, she poked, she served  as a role model for all of us.   Our thoughts are with Ceole's family and the countless friends and  allies whose lives she touched with her time and her generosity on this  Earth.   Rest easy, dear friend, you will be missed.                            ____________________
