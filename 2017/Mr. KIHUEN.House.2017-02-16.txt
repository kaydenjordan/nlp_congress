 Mr. Speaker, the question that I have heard many times  from my constituents deserves to be answered: With respect to General  Flynn and Trump campaign aides, what did President Trump know, and when  did he know it?   How high does this go up?   Now he is calling this fake news.   Mr. President, this is not fake news. This is real.   The American people deserve a transparent, independent investigation  into Russia's involvement with the White House and President Trump.   President Trump continually says he wants to protect our national  security, but he ignores the real security threats within his  administration.   Even my colleagues across the aisle would rather focus on taking away  health care from millions of Americans and thousands of Nevadans  instead of investigating the clear and present danger in the Trump  administration.   Enough is enough. Protecting our national security is not a  Democratic issue or a Republican issue. It is an American priority.                            ____________________
