 Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of H.R. 3537, which was received from the House.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a  third time.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on this bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.
