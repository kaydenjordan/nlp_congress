 Mr. Speaker: ``We turned a promise broken into a promise  kept.'' That is what President Biden said to union members and retirees  about his bailout of union-run multiemployer pension plans.   These plans need reform. But instead of reform, we got a bailout. Is  this really a promise kept?   The most recent bailout will disburse $90 billion to multiemployer  pension plans. This is a short-term fix, one that fails to address the  possibility of future  [[Page H6513]]  insolvency and hurts taxpayers in the process.   It seems the left would rather dump taxpayer money into a broken  multiemployer pension system to appease unions than do the hard work of  drafting bipartisan legislation.   In fulfilling this promise to his union buddies, President Biden  ignored his responsibility to safeguard American taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, last time I checked, the President serves all Americans,  not just union bosses. Perhaps his memory has failed him yet again.                            ____________________
