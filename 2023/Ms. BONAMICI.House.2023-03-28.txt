 Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1,  which should be called the polluters over people act. This is a  critical moment. Just last week, the United Nations Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change released its sixth and final assessment, which  presents our most comprehensive understanding of climate science to  date. It is not, as my colleague suggested, that you can go outside and  breathe fresh air and decide that there is no climate change.   Scientists have made it abundantly clear, there are two options:  significantly cut emissions now or face catastrophic challenges ahead.   Future generations will look back and scrutinize the decisions we  make as leaders. Did we have the political courage to take action or  did we ignore science, stifle the most vulnerable voices in our  community, and leave a climate catastrophe for our children and  grandchildren?   In northwest Oregon, my home, smoke from raging wildfires made the  air unhealthy to breathe, and in the summer of 2021 hundreds of people  in the Pacific Northwest died from a 1 in 10,000 year heat dome event  where temperatures reached 118 degrees.    Acidic oceans are harming our fishing industries. That is from carbon  pollution. Droughts and extreme weather patterns jeopardize the  livelihoods of our farmers. Warmer temperatures in the Columbia River  are further endangering salmon that are so vital to the region and  indigenous peoples.   H.R. 1 is a dangerous move in the wrong direction under the guise of  promoting lower energy costs. It would do no such thing, and the  American people will not be fooled. Instead, this bill is a package of  anti-climate and anti-public lands policy that would undermine recent  environmental protections, destroy the National Environmental Policy  Act, and take a significant step back in the fight against climate  change.  [[Page H1499]]    The bill will also raise, not lower, costs for working families by  repealing tax cuts the Democrats passed last year for home efficiency  upgrades. It even repeals the methane emissions reduction program.   While Americans faced higher gas prices, make no mistake, the top  five big oil companies made record profits--more than $196 billion last  year--that is more than the economic output of most countries.   These companies abuse billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded  subsidies, stockpiled thousands of unused leases on millions of acres  of public lands and engage in price gouging at the pump.   This bill? It advances policies that allow Big Oil to increase their  profits, even more at the expense of our constituents. The bill would  expedite dirty mining operations, exempt oil, gas, and drilling  industries from adhering to important environmental regulations,  shorten public review timelines, and limit public engagement.   We must protect our bedrock environmental laws that safeguard  communities and allow the public to have a say in local projects. We  must continue the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, which  finally, after so many years, will make significant investments we need  to save our planet.   Addressing the climate crisis cannot be delayed. We must defeat this  bill and turn our attention to investments that create jobs.    Madam Chair, we must defeat this bill and turn our  attention to investments that create jobs, cut costs for working  families, and grow our clean energy economy for the sake of our planet,  our vulnerable communities, and for future generations to come.                                time  1615
