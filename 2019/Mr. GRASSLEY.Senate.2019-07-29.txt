 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 30 seconds.    Mr. President, there is a bad practice in  pharmaceutical pricing called spread pricing. Spread pricing has  historically siphoned money from the State Medicaid Programs and given  it to pharmacy benefit managers or what we call PBMs. Drug payments and  Medicaid should focus on the beneficiary, not the PBMs.   The bipartisan prescription drug legislation I introduced this month  with Senator Wyden bans spread pricing. This will refocus the system on  paying for costs associated with prescribing a drug instead of gaming  the system to reap a profit at the expense of the taxpayers.   Medicaid funding should go to patients, not to the pockets of  healthcare middlemen.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
