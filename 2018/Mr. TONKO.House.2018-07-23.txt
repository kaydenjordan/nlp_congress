 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3994, the Advancing Critical  Connectivity Expands Service, Small Business Resources, Opportunities,  Access, and Data Based on Assessed Need and Demand Act, or in short,  ACCESS BROADBAND Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and ranking member for moving this  measure forward, and offer special thanks to my friend, Representative  Lance, for partnering with me on this legislation. I also thank the  bipartisan group of Members who have cosponsored this legislation,  including 14 members of the Energy and Commerce Committee who have  worked together and who agree that these are vital steps worth taking.   This bill is about serving the people. My own constituents continue  to reach out about their limitations of access to broadband internet  throughout the capital region. Some of these areas are rural and many  are underserved and unserved entirely.   Other areas are underserved with a few houses having access, while  many others are left with no affordable options in sight.                                time  1530    Constituents ask: When will we get access? What about western  Schenectady County? What about Amsterdam? What about Berne? What about  Fort Johnson? What about western Saratoga County in the 20th  Congressional District?   I have heard from doctors who depend on broadband internet to read X- rays when they are on call. I hear from librarians who find students  sitting in the library parking lot after hours so that they can access  the internet and finish their homework assignments. I hear from workers  who are forced to leave home to find high enough internet speed that  they can upload or download large files. They all ask: When will we  have access?   As a Congress, we owe these folk an answer. A lack of access to  broadband internet in the capital region is one of many reasons I  pushed to join the Energy and Commerce Committee and  [[Page H6610]]  why I have worked to advance this legislation.   This bill is the first part of that answer. H.R. 3994, the Advancing  Critical Connectivity Expands Service, Small Business Resources,  Opportunities, Access, and Data Based on Assessed Need and Demand Act,  the ACCESS BROADBAND Act, would establish a coordinating office for  Federal broadband resources.   It would use existing resources to streamline management of Federal  broadband resources across multiple agencies and simplify the process  for small businesses and local economic developers to access them.   Currently, there is no comprehensive system that tracks where Federal  dollars are going and how the funding is impacting communities.  Investments are made with little accountability and oversight on behalf  of the taxpayer.   ACCESS BROADBAND, as an act, would begin to address the issues. This  bill would track Federal broadband dollars and streamline management of  Federal broadband resources across multiple agencies. Most notably, it  would simplify the process for small businesses and local economic  developers to access them.   There is still much more work to be done on this issue. I do hope  that this can serve as a starting place for us to open doors of  opportunity and access for the millions of Americans who require the  better and improved outcomes by investing in broadband expansion.   I thank all of the members and staff working together on ACCESS  BROADBAND, helping ensure that our communities can access the broadband  resources they need to grow and to prosper.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on my side. If the  other side is ready to close, I yield back the balance of my time.
