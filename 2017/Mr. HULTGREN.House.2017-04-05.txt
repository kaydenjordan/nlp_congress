 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Colorado.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the rule providing for  consideration of H.R. 1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act of  2017. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation that has seen  productive debate and almost no opposition when it was considered by  the House Financial Services Committee. The House considered a very  similar bill last July that received 388 votes here in the House in  support.   Congressman Patrick McHenry has been steadfast in his dedication to  finding opportunities to update our securities laws so we can harness  the true power of our capital markets. In recent memory, this started  with the JOBS Act, which was very bipartisan and has been crucial to  reinvigorating our capital markets. However, there is still more we can  do.   The Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017 increases the limit  on the number of individuals who can invest in certain venture capital  funds before those funds must register with the SEC as investment  companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Currently, the act  limits the number of investors in an investment company fund to 100 if  the fund is to be exempt from registration with the SEC. This  registration is an extremely costly regulatory requirement that is not  always appropriate.   The Chamber of Commerce describes this as a fix to what has come to  be known as the ``99 investor problem,'' that is, the requirement that  certain venture capital funds register with the SEC once they reach  their 100th investor. Increasing this low threshold, originally set in  the 1940s, would allow venture capital to continue to play the  important role in the economy that it has in the past.   Unless Congress updates this threshold, startups, the driver of job  creation and economic growth in our districts, will continue to be  choked off from what should be easily accessible and affordable  capital.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support  this bipartisan legislation.
