Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on S. 4949.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of S. 4949, the National Cemeteries  Preservation and Protection Act introduced by my Senate counterpart,  Chairman Tester.   One of the features or bugs of the Senate--depending on your  perspective--is that one single Senator, no matter their party, can  hold up meaningful and needed legislation in order to satisfy their own  aims. It is incredibly frustrating, especially in the veterans' policy  space.   We work closely with our veteran and veteran service organization  stakeholders on everything we do, and there is always something quite  sad when we tell these stakeholders that very worthy policy is being  held up because so-and-so is making a demand that may not be related to  veterans issues at all.   So, often we are brought to the brink where good legislation may not  make it over the finish line, and this year was no exception. We held  our breath while waiting to see if legislation related to helping  survivors of military sexual trauma, disabled veterans, and student  veterans would survive the Senate hotline.   Luckily, it appears much of it did, and I am appreciative of Chairman  Tester and Leader Schumer's efforts to push those bills through.   I want to note that here in the House things have worked out a bit  differently. Things move forward based on consensus building and  efforts to find common ground, and I am proud of the bipartisan work my  committee has achieved.                                time  1615    We have worked across the aisle when possible, and when we couldn't,  I hope there was an understanding that sometimes there are critical  policy priorities that must transcend bipartisanship. But, without a  doubt, every effort is made to try to find a solution that most can  agree on.   I want to point out that the bill before us--certainly a worthy one-- was sent to us at the last possible moment with no consensus built in.  It took a significant effort to build consensus in a short period of  time when the holiday season made it difficult to reach people and  engage on complicated issues. But I and my staff are always willing to  put frustration and annoyance aside in pursuit of a worthy goal.   However, I hope in the future that there is more of an effort to  build consensus early so that we are not put in a position where  measures may fail because the upfront work was not put in.   Mr. Speaker, this bill makes several small but important changes to  how our national cemeteries are administered, provides for the transfer  of land for national cemetery expansion, and also clarifies eligibility  for burial benefits for these veterans buried in Tribal cemeteries.  Native veterans serve at the highest rates of any other community in  this country, so ensuring that they receive the honors they are owed is  very important.   Our national cemeteries are an important part of the benefits  provided to veterans, and it is our obligation to maintain these sacred  grounds not only so that veterans may choose these cemeteries as their  final resting places, but so that all Americans have a visual reminder  of the service and sacrifice we are given from those who wear the  uniform of our country.   I do want to make one note of clarification on congressional intent  with  [[Page H10040]]  respect to one of the land transfers in this bill.   Specifically, regarding the Department of the Interior lands  available for transfer under section 5 of the bill, it is the intent of  the committee and the bill sponsor that only Department of the Interior  Bureau of Land Management lands managed under the Federal Land Policy  and Management Act of 1976 be available for potential inclusion in any  transfer authorized under this bill. This transfer is not intended to  be made for Park Service land.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I urge all my colleagues to do the  same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. Again, I ask my  colleagues to join me in passing S. 4949, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
