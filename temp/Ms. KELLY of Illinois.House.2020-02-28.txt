 Madam Speaker, as chair of the Congressional  Black Caucus Health Braintrust, I rise to express my support for H.R.  2339, the Protecting American Lungs and Reversing the Youth Tobacco  Epidemic Act of 2019.   This critical legislation will protect young people, especially young  people of color, from a lifetime of nicotine addiction. Simply put,  prohibiting menthol and other flavored tobacco products will save  lives, especially Black lives.   Opponents of the legislation assert that because 85 percent of the  African American smokers use menthol products that it would  disproportionately harm communities of color. This logic only  perpetuates the cycle in which many members of the African American  community are already trapped. Tobacco companies specifically marketed  menthol cigarettes to Black communities because they are more  addictive. Opposing this bill only continues this shameful past.   We must pass H.R. 2339 and ensure the tobacco industry can no longer  target minority communities to the detriment of public health.
