 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I will  speak longer than I usually do on these bills because I both want to  persuade people to support the bill and also provide important  information to the entire House that will be part of the legislative  history of this bill and is designed to guide the SEC in issuing  appropriate regulations.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 945, the Holding Foreign  Companies Accountable Act. I thank Chairwoman Waters and her staff for  working with my office, and all the members who have been involved in  this bill and making this issue a priority.   Mr. Speaker, I believe this will be perhaps the most significant  piece of investor protection legislation that the Congress adopts this  Congress because it applies to some 224 publicly traded companies and  assures investors of the financial statement integrity that they expect  from all companies that are traded in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, let's go back in history a bit. For well over a century,  investors in corporations have insisted that the financial statements  they get are audited by an independent auditor. But at the beginning of  this century, we learned that that was not enough. We saw Enron and  WorldCom. We passed the Sarbanes-Oxley bill, and created the PCAOB so  that we have a system where not only are the companies' financial  statements audited, but the audit is subject to being audited by a  governmental entity. That is essential in this century to have  investors adequately protected. So when we are dealing with 224 public  companies with $1.8 trillion in capitalization, we need that level of  protection.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio (Congressman Gonzalez)  for joining me in leading on this issue in the House. I thank my good  friend and cochair of the bicameral, bipartisan CPA Caucus, Mike  Conaway, who has been working on these issues for many years. And I  thank Senators Kennedy and Van Hollen for their leadership in advancing  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, currently the PCAOB, the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board, is unable to inspect the audit work and practices of  certain audit firms in a handful of jurisdictions. Today, that includes  Belgium and France to some degree, but, primarily, the issue is China.  In most cases, audit firms in those jurisdictions cite local laws  related to data protection or national security as a reason for being  unable to provide the PCAOB with the information they need.   Accordingly, as I mentioned before, the PCAOB has noted that the  auditor for some 224 U.S.-listed companies with a combined total  capitalization of $1.8 trillion is not subject to the enhanced  oversight that this Congress has insisted upon since 2002.   Since it was created, the PCAOB has established a formal cooperative  relationship with foreign audit regulators that have allowed it to  conduct inspections of firms in more than 59 U.S. jurisdictions.  However, the PCAOB and the Securities Exchange Commission have tried to  engage with Chinese regulators for over a decade in an effort to reach  a similar cooperative agreement and are still not able to conduct  inspections with regard to China or Hong Kong.   Mr. Speaker, our legislation will bring an end to this sort of risk  for investors in U.S. markets by requiring the SEC to stop trading in a  company's stocks if the PCAOB is unable to inspect the audit report and  the audit work papers for a period of 3 years.   Mr. Speaker, this is an investor protection bill. I am chair of the  Investor Protection and Capital Markets Subcommittee. This bill is not  anti-China, and it is not designed to prohibit the trading of Chinese  companies. Rather, it provides a 3-year window, during which we expect  China will enter into a reasonable agreement with the SEC and the PCAOB  so that we have the additional level of protection for investors that  we expect and have demanded since we passed the Sarbanes-Oxley bill in  2002.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say that the House has already passed  this legislation in similar--and actually, superior--form as an  amendment to the 2001 NDAA, National Defense Authorization Act. It is  the intention of the authors of this Senate bill to achieve exactly  what that language--approved by the House earlier this year--sets  forward. And that amendment to the NDAA is part of the legislative  history of this bill and our consideration of it today.   Mr. Speaker, in order to guide the interpretation of this bill,  Senator Kennedy and I have a statement, and I include in the Record  that statement.                                                United States Senate      Statement: S. 945--Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.           Considered on Friday, December 2, 2020        Madam Speaker, I write to submit a statement for the record       to address S. 945, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable       Act.        It is the intent of this legislation to provide the       Securities and Exchange Commission with the discretion       necessary to determine how much of a company's total audit       must be performed by a firm beyond the reach of PCAOB       inspections before trading in the company's securities is       prohibited by the Commission. Consistent with our work with       the Securities and Exchange Commission on this legislation,       it is our expectation that the Commission will not prohibit       trading in  [[Page H6034]]       the securities of companies under this act, as long as not       more than one third of a company's total audit is performed       by a firm beyond the reach of PCAOB inspections. This       legislation provides the Commission with the authority to       determine how an audit would be measured, whether that be       total revenue, assets, or another metric.        Furthermore, the scope of this legislation is not intended       to be limited to public companies which rely on foreign audit       firms that have some form of ownership relationship with a       PCAOB-registered public accounting firm. Specifically, it is       intended to also encompass public companies which rely on       foreign audit firms that are affiliated with or maintain some       form of affiliation agreement with a PCAOB-registered public       accounting firm.                                                      John Kennedy,                                                      U.S. Senator.    Mr. Speaker, I will read it so that it is before the  entire House.   ``It is the intent of this legislation to provide the Securities and  Exchange Commission with the discretion necessary to determine how much  of a company's total audit must be performed by a firm beyond the reach  of PCAOB inspections before trading in the company's securities is  prohibited by the Commission. Consistent with our work with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on this legislation, it is our  expectation that the Commission will not prohibit trading in the  securities of companies under this act, as long as not more than one- third of a company's total audit is performed by a firm beyond the  reach of the PCAOB inspections. This legislation provides the  Commission with the authority to determine how an audit would be  measured, whether that be total revenue, assets, or another metric.   ``Furthermore, the scope of this legislation is not intended to be  limited to public companies which rely on foreign audit firms that have  some form of ownership relationship with a PCAOB-registered public  accounting firm. Specifically, it is intended to also encompass public  companies which rely on foreign audit firms that are affiliated with or  maintain some form of affiliation agreement with a PCAOB-registered  public accounting firm.''   Mr. Speaker, one particular comment to draw your attention to is that  it is not the intention of this bill to cover firms that have some  small part of their audit being done in China, perhaps one subsidiary  in China, but is rather designed to apply when a third or more of the  audit is not subject to PCAOB inspection. And how you define one-third  of the audit, whether that is the audit of one-third of the revenues or  one-third of the assets, or some other metric, is left to the SEC.   As House sponsor of this legislation, I have cosigned the statement I  have just read, prepared by Senator Kennedy, but would have the  following additional remarks:   I will take this opportunity to make clear, it is not the intention  of this legislation that every public company, which is a client of an  audit firm with a branch, office, or affiliate in a jurisdiction beyond  the reach of the PCAOB inspections, be subject to a trading  prohibition.   Instead, the trading prohibitions required under this bill are  intended to be applied when a significant portion of the audit is  prepared by an audit firm or the branch, or office, or affiliate of an  audit firm which the PCAOB is unable to inspect, and the SEC has the  authority to interpret this provision.   As chair of the Investor Protection and Capital Markets Subcommittee,  I appreciate how critical it is for investors on U.S. stock exchanges  to have the additional protection that the financial statements have  not just been audited, but that that audit is subject to review by the  PCAOB.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues for their support of this  legislation, and look forward to its passage here today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me enough time to  both describe the major parts of the legislation and also make it clear  to the regulators what expectations the House and Senate have for the  regulations that they will issue.
