 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor the CEO of the Frank Callen Boys & Girls Club, Vincent DelMonte.   Vincent has been a leader for the Boys & Girls Clubs for nearly 20  years and, with his retirement, leaves behind a legacy of selflessness  and service.   The Boys & Girls Club's mission is to enable all young people to  reach their full potential. Vincent certainly did that, and more.   Vincent assumed his role during a time of severe financial turmoil.   Vincent was able to navigate these troubles carefully and eloquently,  making the Frank Callen Boys & Girls Club one of the Nation's top  clubs.   With renewed finances and a heightened status, the club went on to  improve the lives of not only its many members but the communities they  serve under Vincent's guidance.   We hope Vincent truly enjoys his retirement. After what Vincent has  done for the Frank Callen Boys & Girls Club, he has certainly done more  than his fair share for our community.   Vincent is the type of man many should strive to be, someone who  leaves the community he loved better than he found it.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Vincent on his well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
