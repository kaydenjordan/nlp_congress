 Mr. President, I was happy to join with both Senators  [[Page S4744]]  Grassley and Cornyn on the EB-5 reform bill. Senator Cornyn has worked  very hard on this, Senator Grassley has, and I have, and it was truly a  bipartisan bill. It had widespread support of EB-5 stakeholders--those  who responsibly welcomed changes to the program that would improve  oversight and accountability.   Senator Grassley and I have been working for years to reform the EB-5  visa program. We wanted to reduce the fraud that has occurred in  several EB-5 projects, including one that occurred in my own State of  Vermont.   This legislation--again, bringing Republicans and Democrats across  the political spectrum together--reflects a careful and thoughtful  compromise to both keep the EB-5 Program alive and curtail the worst  abuses it has. There is actually only a small minority that wants to  keep the program operating without these improved standards and  oversight.   I wish they would be willing to come here and bring it up, vote it up  or down, and be on the Record saying how they are going to vote,  because opposing our effort on this is a vote that allows the EB-5  Program to lapse. It will have untold economic consequences throughout  the communities that rely on the program for development projects, like  those that the Senator from Texas just mentioned.   I wish that Senators had supported Senator Grassley's consent  request. But I will take a moment to say I thank Senator Grassley for  working with me over the years to find a bipartisan compromise to  reform this. Hours have gone into that. He and Senator Cornyn and I and  others have worked hard to have a compromise. I am sorry that the  unanimous consent was objected to, especially as it means this will  expire, and we won't have votes on improvements that could take place.  I think it is a wasted opportunity.    Mr. President, there are some people who leave an  indelible mark on your life, from the moment you meet them. On June 7,  the Saint Michael's College community lost one such person with the  passing of Father Raymond Doherty. As an alumnus of Saint Michael's  College, I was shaped by the academic experience and lasting tight-knit  community that a small college provides and will always feel a deep  connection to the school. As a fellow alumnus, Father Doherty was a  [[Page S4762]]  pillar of the Saint Michael's community and played a fundamental role  in guiding and molding not only the College but its students for  decades.   Raymond J. Doherty was born and raised in Newton, MA, and in 1948 he  enrolled as a student at Saint Michael's College in Colchester, VT, a  journalism student and skilled pitcher on the varsity baseball team.  Upon his graduation in 1951, Father Doherty served his country as a  staff sergeant and combat correspondent in the U.S. Marine Corps during  the Korean war.   In 1953, Father Doherty returned to Vermont and joined the Society of  Saint Edmund at the Edmundite Novitiate in Putney, where he took his  first vows in 1954. Father Doherty was ordained into the priesthood in  1958 at the Cathedral of Immaculate Conception in Burlington, VT. As an  Edmundite priest, Father Doherty spent the subsequent decades working  throughout Vermont, New England, and across the South during the civil  rights era, where he preached, served the community, and worked to  further the cause of social justice.   Although his assignments pulled him to different corners of the  globe, his home was always Saint Michael's. After many terms as a  member of the staff and Campus Ministry at Saint Michael's throughout  the 1960s and 1970s, Father Doherty returned permanently to Saint  Michael's in 1985. His career at Saint Michael's spanned a variety of  roles in the admissions office, athletics department, and as campus  chaplain. Until his passing, Father Ray, as he was affectionately  known, remained deeply involved on the Saint Michael's campus and in  the surrounding community.   He leaves behind a life and legacy that should be an inspiration to  many. Father Ray, through his compassion, humility, and commitment to  serving his community, exemplifies what it means to be a Vermonter and  a true leader. He led by example and inspired his students and those  around him to strive to understand and address the needs and  circumstances of all, to lead with grace, and to tirelessly work to  improve the lives of others.   Father Ray once told me that when the time came for him to be called  home, he hoped to fall asleep here and wake up there. That stuck with  me. It is a comfort to know that wish came true. Like the extended  Saint Michael's College community, I will miss Father Doherty. His  legacy will live on in the students he taught, the lives he impacted,  and the words he preached. Father Ray will be deeply missed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  acknowledge the efforts and contributions of a longtime friend and  advocate for dairy farmers in Vermont and across the country, Bob Gray.  As he retires later this month, he leaves an enduring imprint on  Vermont's bedrock agricultural sector.   I first met Bob in 1978 when he joined the staff of Vermont Senator  Jim Jeffords, who passed away in 2014. Bob and Jim were an unstoppable  force, pushing in the late seventies for Federal legislation that  eventually became the 1981 federal Farmland Protection Policy Act. Bob  understood the growing urgency of protecting the Nation's working  landscapes from development, fragmentation, and speculation--and  especially for rural States like Vermont. He also understood that, so  long as farmers had a voice and a seat at the table, conservation and  agriculture could be mutually reinforcing, not adversarial.   Bob's love for the land and those who steward it comes naturally,  having been raised on a dairy farm in Cayuga County, NY. After earning  his bachelor of science degree in animal science at Cornell University,  he served the Nation as an Army officer in the First Infantry Division  out of Fort Riley, KS, before joining the New York National Guard and  serving for 3 more years, rising to the rank of captain.   Since 1990, Bob has led the Northeast Dairy Farmers Cooperatives, a  trade association representing dairy farmers in Vermont and the region.  Throughout the decades of challenging policy discussions and many farm  bills, I could always count on Bob to provide me with sound counsel,  always keeping the interests of Vermont's dairy farmers first and  foremost. That counsel has always been especially important to me  during challenging years for dairy, like this one has been. Dairy  farmers across the United States are much stronger than they would now  be were it not for Bob Gray's work.   Bob's immeasurable contributions to the dairy industry and our  decades-long friendship are strong enough that I have welcomed him to  join me at farm shows and agricultural fairs in New England, despite  his unmitigated and puzzling cheerleading for the New York Yankees.   When Bob announced his retirement, I made sure to join his final  board meeting with the Northeast Dairy Farmers Cooperatives. The  farmers whom he has worked with and industry leaders who have relied on  his expertise, including myself, will certainly feel his absence and  miss his kindness. Beyond his advocacy, Bob has always been a good  friend to Marcelle and me for so many years--something we will always  cherish. As he embarks on this next and exciting part of his life, I  want to acknowledge Bob's work and thank him for his decades of support  for Vermont's dairy farmers and the U.S. dairy industry and wish him  the best of luck.                            ____________________     Mr. President, lost in the continuously emerging world of  social media is the iconic bedrock of community news: radio. I would  like to take a moment to celebrate a milestone in Vermont radio: 90  years on the air for WDEV. At 5:50 in the morning of Thursday July 16,  1931, the broadcasters at WDEV turned on their microphones for the very  first time. Ninety years later, WDEV remains a Vermont institution,  bringing colorful conversation, sports commentary, and great music to  thousands of listeners every day. Growing up in Central Vermont, I have  always enjoyed tuning in to WDEV. Throughout my time in the Senate, I  have spoken to anchors and morning show hosts at WDEV more times than I  can recall.   WDEV has been independently owned and operated by Radio Vermont since  1935. Radio Vermont was founded by Lloyd Squier, who ran the company  for 44 years, until his death in 1979. From then until 2017, Lloyd's  son, Ken, has been at the helm. Beginning in 1966, Ken has hosted the  Saturday morning classic and a personal favorite: ``Music To Go To The  Dump By.'' Ken still cohosts the program--what he calls the  ``children's program for adults.'' ``Music To Go To The Dump By''  provides a fun, thoughtful and lighthearted weekly digest of the  goings-on throughout the State, with commentary from its panel of hosts  and their wide array of guests.   Whether it is ``Music To Go To The Dump By,'' the ``Vermont  Viewpoint,'' or a race at Thunder Road, we Vermonters can always turn  to WDEV for fresh and interesting programming that keeps us all  smiling, engaged, and informed. While it is certainly challenging to  catch a broadcast from here in the Nation's Capital, I am eager to  listen in once I am back home in a few weeks' time. Congratulations to  WDEV and the team at Radio Vermont on 90 years of community radio. Keep  up the great work, and I look forward to calling in soon.                            ____________________
