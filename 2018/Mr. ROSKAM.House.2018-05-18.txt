 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I will yield myself 30 seconds because I have  got to watch this clock sort of tight.   So here is the situation: Animal fighting is inappropriate and wrong  no matter where it happens. It is against the law in the continental  United States, and, I should say, in all 50 States, and what we are  proposing is to make that a standard in the territories as well.   There are some elements of animal fighting that is illegal in  territories, but not altogether. This has been a long journey. It is a  40-year journey in this country. It reached a crescendo about 10 years  ago when a standard was created in all 50 States. What this amendment  does, Mr. Chairman, is very simple: it proposes to do the same thing in  the territories.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Knight).    Mr. Chairman, although I don't like what she is about to  say, in courtesy, I yield 1 minute to the Resident Commissioner of  Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chairman, I thank the  chairman for yielding.   We would never have had this debate if we had had an opportunity to  have a public hearing on the issue. So I oppose this amendment because  this is more Federal regulation for the territories.   Cockfighting is already a highly regulated industry in Puerto Rico.  Originally regulated in 1933, then in 2007. We actually have offices  regulating this issue that creates an $18 million industry on our  island with 27,000 direct and indirect jobs. Already the farm bill  permits that cockfighting will be prohibited in the States and  interstate commerce, but can be legal if the State or the territory  authorizes and regulates the event.   That is the situation with the territories; we regulate the event.  Actually, this proposed legislation will cause a highly regulated  industry to go underground and go to the streets where there is no  control at all.   Our constituents were never heard on this issue, and we are looking  for that opportunity. I do believe that we are not having the  opportunity to be treated equally. That is the reason I oppose this  amendment, and we should have at least a public hearing on this issue.  [[Page H4223]]         Mr. Chairman, this is a heartfelt issue obviously, but we  are talking about rough stuff. We are talking about stuff that attracts  gangs. We are talking about stuff that attracts drug trafficking. We  are talking about stuff that attracts violence. We are talking about  things that you would be ashamed to bring a child to. We are talking  about things that if it were to happen in the well of this Chamber,  many of us would look away because we would be shocked at the  gratuitous violence.   To characterize this as a cultural norm that we should just walk away  from is a misrepresentation, in my view. It is not persuasive to me. It  is wrong. It is wrong if it happens in the 50 States, it is wrong if it  happens in the territories, and we ought not be complicit in it.   The notion that this is going to drive this activity underground is a  hackneyed old argument. We heard that before as it relates to the 50  States. That wasn't persuasive. We know what this activity is. We ought  not be complicit in it.   Mr. Chairman, we should pass this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
