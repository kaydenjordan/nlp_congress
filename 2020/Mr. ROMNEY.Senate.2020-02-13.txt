 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I rise to mark the 150th anniversary of  the first ballot cast by a woman in the United States under an equal  suffrage law. I am proud that this remarkable milestone occurred in my  home State of Utah.   The fight for the right to vote for all Americans, regardless of  gender, race, or class, was achieved through efforts, large and small,  and through great sacrifice.   Suffrage is the freedom to vote, to reaffirm the solemn duty of the  citizen in a representative democracy. When I vote, I remember the  sacrifice of men and women in uniform--of those who have won and  preserved freedom for us in the past and of those who preserve it for  us today. My vote is a recognition of that sacrifice. It is right and  fitting that every American, male and female, has that same privilege.   Our great State of Utah was settled by pioneers like Brigham Young,  who led his people to a new land in search of liberty and freedom from  oppression. While the pioneers and settlers of Utah secured freedom of  territory, religion, and thought, the voices of women were still not  heard when it often mattered most--during the democratic selection of  their government leaders.   Seraph Young, like her granduncle Brigham Young before her,  endeavored to chart a different course. In the early morning of  February 14, 1870, she became the first woman to vote in the United  States of America. On that election day in Salt Lake City, 24 other  women joined Seraph Young in casting their ballots. Then, in the next  election, 2,000 more women followed their lead and exercised their  equal suffrage rights. The voices of the few set in motion a monumental  shift in our Nation's history.   Twenty-four years before the 19th Amendment to grant equal suffrage  for women was ratified, Utah once again made history by electing the  Nation's first female State senator, Martha Hughes Cannon. Cannon did  not hesitate to pursue her own path. After receiving her undergraduate  degree in chemistry, she went on to earn degrees in oration, medicine,  and pharmacy at a time when few women pursued advanced education. As a  physician, church leader, suffragist, and mother, she defeated her own  husband at the ballot box to become the first female State senator in  U.S. history.   Soon, we will honor the tremendous contributions Martha Hughes Cannon  and all women suffragists have made as we welcome her as a new addition  to Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol.   The symbols we choose to represent us and our State matter a great  deal, and the bronze rendering of Cannon will serve as an enduring  tribute to the efforts of all suffragists.   To all the women who have led and who continue to lead by example, we  thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res.  475 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
