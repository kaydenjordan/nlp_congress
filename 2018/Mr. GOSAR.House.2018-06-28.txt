 Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today in insisting that  the Department of Justice fully comply with Congress and provide the  requested documents, including subpoenas related to the potential FISA  abuse.   The Department of Justice has done nothing but divert and block  Congress from documents that are well within our rights to receive.  They have repeatedly insisted that they have complied with the document  request when they clearly have not.   The Department of Justice Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has  been the major player in stonewalling Congress. The longer they stall  this process, the more the American people lose faith in our justice  system. That is a threat to our country's future.   I stand here today calling for transparency, answers, and  accountability so that we can get to the truth. The American people  deserve the accountability. The time to act is now.   If the DOJ fails to comply, then we will be forced to take it to the  next level, to hold Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in contempt,  as my previous speaker has spoken, or even to impeach, which would be  my preferred course of action right now.   It is very simple. Comply with the law, do your job, or get out.   I support this resolution.
