 Mr. Speaker, as a proud American and a Member of Congress,  I rise today on the floor of the House of Representatives to celebrate  the life and career of the Honorable James Tormey III, one of my  constituents.   Judge Tormey was a beloved father and husband. He was a distinguished  judge and an honorable public servant who passed away far too early on  June 22, 2019, just 4 days ago.   A 1972 graduate of State University of New York College at Cortland  and a 1976 graduate of Syracuse University College of Law, my alma  mater as well, Judge Tormey committed much of his life to public  service.   Serving on the Onondaga County Legislature for 10 years and, later,  as a Syracuse City Court judge, supreme court justice, and district  administrative judge for the Fifth Judicial District of New York, Jim  Tormey earned the respect, praise, and trust of many in our community.   Over the course of his esteemed judicial career, Judge Tormey took a  measured approach in upholding the law and applying it fairly. He  firmly believed in the justice system and worked to ensure everyone had  access to it.   As a district administrative judge, his most recent job, Judge Tormey  supervised the operations and schedules of more than 300 judges serving  in the Fifth Judicial District, many of whom, since his passing this  week, have shared stories of his strong leadership, his commitment to  ensuring justice, and his respect for all. They have spoken of his  commitment to continued legal education and pro bono work and,  importantly, of his friendship, mentorship, and distinguished  leadership.   Judge Tormey was committed to making central New York a better place  to live and work, and the impact of his work went far beyond the  courtroom. He used his role to address some of the most pressing issues  plaguing our community, overseeing the establishment of local drug  courts, which are very successful, the opioid courts, human trafficking  court, youthful offender court, and community court for lower-level  offenders.   His dedication to central New York was visible in all of his actions,  and he will be truly missed.   Above all, though, and far more important to the judge, he was a  family man. He deeply loved his wife, Susan; their children, Andrew and  Colleen; and his grandchildren.   Susan is now left to carry on the great traditions that she and her  husband forged with their children and others in the community. Sue is  a successful person in her own right, having a long and storied career,  including, most recently, at Onondaga Community College.   To Sue, I say Godspeed. Keep your chin up, cherish your children and  your grandchildren, and continue to carry on the legacy that your  husband forged in this community.   I ask my colleagues, in closing, to keep them in mind as we honor and  remember the life of this devoted civil servant, Judge Tormey.                            ____________________
