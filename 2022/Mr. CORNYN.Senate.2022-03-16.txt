 Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of the EB-5  program, which has been a significant economic driver in Texas. This  merit-based immigration program has created thousands of American jobs  and brought billions of dollars in investment to urban and rural areas  across Texas and the U.S.   While it was unfortunate that the authorization for the EB-5 Regional  Center program was allowed to lapse on June 30, 2021, I am pleased to  have worked with my colleagues, Senators Chuck Grassley and Patrick  Leahy, on the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act, which was included as part  of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022.   The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act reauthorizes the regional center  program through September 30, 2027, and implements meaningful reforms  and integrity measures that will ensure the viability and security of  the program for the coming years.   This legislation provides the first multiyear authorization for the  regional center program since 2015, so that regional centers, which  have been in limbo for nearly 9 months, will have much-needed stability  going forward. There is also a 60-day implementation period to allow  USCIS to begin processing EB-5 petitions and applications that have  been on hold since the lapse. Following that initial period, existing  regional centers will be able to immediately get back to work driving  investment into the U.S. and facilitating the creation of jobs across  the country.                            ____________________
