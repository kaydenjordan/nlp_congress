 Mr. Speaker, I rise to call attention to the  rule that the Trump administration is expected to release shortly,  which will allow fake, short-term health insurance plans to be sold.   During the 115th Congress, the Republican majority has taken every  action possible to undermine and sabotage the Affordable Care Act. I  expect these new regulations will be no different.   No matter how the Trump administration and our majority try to sell  short-term insurance plans to the American people, the devil is in the  details. These junk plans are just that: junk.   According to the Kaiser Family Foundation report, these plans are  likely to exclude coverage for preexisting conditions and not cover  essential services such as maternity care, mental health, and substance  abuse treatment and prescription drugs. The people need to know what is  covered when they buy that insurance and what is not covered when they  get sick.   AARP, the American Heart Association, the American Medical  Association, and many other health and patient advocacy organizations  have urged the President to withdraw this proposed rule. I ask my  colleagues to join me and ask President Trump to withdraw this harmful  rule.                            ____________________
