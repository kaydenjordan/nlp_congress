 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of  my opening statement at the Senate  [[Page S4623]]  Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                        Lower Health Care Costs Act          Today we are voting on three bills:        First, the Poison Center Network Enhancement Act, offered       by Senators Murray and Burr, to reauthorize and update the       national network of poison control centers.        Second, the Emergency Medical Services for Children Program       Reauthorization Act, offered by Senator Casey and me, to       ensure that, from the ambulance to the emergency room,       emergency health care providers are fully prepared to treat       children, who typically require smaller equipment and       different doses of medicine .        Third, the Lower Health Care Costs Act--a package of 54       proposals from 65 senators--29 Republican and 36 Democrat,       including nearly every member of this Committee--that will       reduce what Americans pay out of their own pockets for health       care.        The Lower Health Care Costs Act will reduce what Americans       pay out of their pockets for health care in three major ways:       First, it ends surprise billing. Second, it creates more       transparency--there are twelve bipartisan provisions that       will: eliminate gag clauses and anti-competitive terms in       insurance contracts, designate a non-profit entity to unlock       insurance claims for employers, ban Pharmacy Benefit Managers       (PBM) from charging more for a drug than the PBM paid for the       drug, and require that patients receive more information on       the cost and quality of their health care. You can't lower       your health care costs until you know what your health care       actually costs. And third, it increases prescription drug       competition--there are fourteen bipartisan provisions to help       more lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs reach patients.        This legislation also extends mandatory funding for       community health centers, and four additional public health       programs, to ensure the 27 million Americans who rely on       these centers for primary care and other health care can       continue to access care close to home, offered by Senator       Murray and me, along with Senators Casey, Cramer, Klobuchar,       and Murkowski.        We have paid for this extension for five years with savings       from other parts of the larger bill, which will prevent the       uncertainty and anxiety of short-term extensions.        The Managers Amendment we are voting on today includes two       additional, significant provisions: First, a bill from       Senators McConnell and Kaine that will raise the minimum age       for purchasing any tobacco product from 18 to 21. This has       also been a priority of Senators Young, Romney, Roberts,       Murkowski, Collins, Schatz, and others.        And two, from Senators Grassley and Leahy, and many others,       the CREATES Act, which will help bring more lower cost       generic drugs to patients by eliminating anti-competitive       practices by brand drug makers.        Altogether, this legislation will help to lower the cost of       health care, which has become a tax on family budgets and on       businesses, on federal and state governments.        A recent Gallup poll found that the cost of health care was       the biggest financial problem facing American families. And       last July, this Committee heard from Dr. Brent James, from       the National Academies, who testified that up to half of what       the American people spend on health care may be unnecessary.        Over the last two years, this Committee has held 16       hearings on a wide range of topics related to reducing the       cost of health care--specifically, how do we reduce what the       American people pay out of their own pockets for health care.        Last December, I sent a letter to experts at the American       Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution, and to       doctors, economists, governors, insurers, employers, and       other health care innovators, asking for specific steps       Congress could take to lower the cost of health care.        We received over 400 recommendations, some as many as 50       pages long. In May, Senator Murray and I released for       discussion the Lower Health Care Costs Act. Since then, we've       received over 400 additional comments on our draft       legislation, and last Tuesday, we held a hearing to hear       additional feedback.        Last Wednesday, Senator Murray and I formally introduced       the Lower Health Care Costs Act--a bipartisan package of 54       proposals from 65 senators that will reduce what Americans       pay out of their own pockets for health care.        At our hearing on this legislation last week, Ben Ippolito,       an economics and health fellow at the American Enterprise       Institute, said:``Together, the provisions in this bill would       meaningfully increase competition and transparency in health       care markets. If enacted, this legislation would lower       insurance premiums and drug prices for consumers, and would       ensure patients are no longer exposed to surprise medical       bills. By lowering costs, this bill would also improve access       to health care.''        We also heard from Fredrick Isasi, Executive Director of       Families USA, at our hearing, who said:``The Reducing Lower       Health Care Costs Act is an ambitious piece of legislation--      particularly so as a bipartisan bill in these most       contentious of times.''        And Avik Roy recently wrote in Forbes:        ``Overall, its provisions could be thought of as       incremental in scope. But some--especially those around       transparency--could have a significant impact.''        Here are a few of the ways this legislation will lower       health care costs:        Ensures that patients do not receive a surprise medical       bill--which is when you unexpectedly receive a $300 bill, or       even a $3,000 bill, two months after our surgery, because one       of your doctors was outside of your insurance network.        Senators Cassidy, Hassan, and Murkowski have done valuable       work to solve surprise medical billing by proposing a       solution last fall and again this spring, and lighting a fire       under Congress to end this harmful practice.        I thank them for their dedication to this issue, and for       working with Senator Murray and me to reach a result that       protects patients.        Senator Murray and I have agreed on a recommendation to our       colleagues that the best solution to protect patients from       surprise medical bills is to pay doctors and hospitals that       are out-of-network the median contracted rate that in-network       doctors and hospitals receive for the same services in their       local geographic area, known as the benchmark solution.        This is a change for me because I was inclined to support       an in-network guarantee since I believe it is the simplest       solution.        Some of my colleagues are inclined to support a new       independent system of dispute resolution, known as       arbitration. The Congressional Budget Office has indicated       that the benchmark solution is the most effective at lowering       health care costs and Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member       Walden have recommended this proposal to the House of       Representatives.        We have also extended this protection to air ambulances,       because according to the Government Accountability Office,       nearly 70 percent of air ambulance transports were out-of-      network in 2017 and the median price charged by air ambulance       providers was about $36,400 for a helicopter transport and       $40,600 for a fixed-wing transport.        It is time to stop studying the issue of exorbitant air       ambulance charges and take action.        Our legislation will treat air ambulances the same as       health care providers--by using the local, commercial market-      based rate for in-network health care.        This legislation will bring more generic and biosimilar       drugs to market faster and lower the cost of prescription       drugs by: Helping biosimilar companies speed drug development       through a transparent, modernized, and searchable patent       database. Senators Collins, Kaine, Braun, Hawley, Murkowski,       Paul, Portman, Shaheen, and Stabenow worked on this       provision.        Improves the Food and Drug Administration's drug patent       database by keeping it more up to date--to help generic drug       companies speed product development, a proposal offered by       Senators Cassidy and Durbin.        Prevents the abuse of citizens' petitions that can       unnecessarily delay drug approvals, from Senators Gardner,       Shaheen, Cassidy, Bennet, Cramer, and Braun.        Clarifies that the makers of brand biological products,       such as insulin, are not gaming the system to delay new,       lower cost biosimilars from coming to market, from Senators       Smith, Cassidy, and Cramer; and Eliminates a loophole that       allows drug companies to get exclusivity--and delay less       costly alternatives from coming to market--just by making       small tweaks to an old drug, a proposal from Senators       Roberts, Cassidy, and Smith.        Modernizes outdated labeling of certain generic drugs,       offered by Senators Bennet and Enzi.        This legislation creates more transparency by:        Banning gag clauses that prevent employers and patients       from knowing the true price and quality of health care       services. This proposal from Senators Cassidy and Bennet       would allow an employer to know that a knee replacement might       cost $15,000 in one hospital and $35,000 at another hospital;        Requiring health care facilities to provide a summary of       services when a patient is discharged from a hospital to make       it easier to track bills, and requires hospitals to send all       bills within 45 calendar days to protect patients from       receiving unexpected bills many months after care, a       provision worked on by Senators Enzi and Casey; and        Requiring doctors and insurers to provide patients with       price quotes on their expected out-of-pocket costs for care,       so patients are able to shop around, a proposal from Senators       Cassidy, Young, Murkowski, Ernst, Kennedy, Sullivan, Cramer,       Braun, Hassan, Carper, Bennet, Brown, Cardin, Casey,       Whitehouse, and Rosen.        It will support state and local efforts to increase       vaccination rates, and will help prevent disease outbreaks,       through two proposals worked on by Senators Roberts, Peters,       and Duckworth.        There is a provision to help communities prevent and reduce       obesity, offered by Senators Scott and Jones.        A provision from Senators Schatz, Capito, Cassidy, Collins,       Heinrich, Hyde-Smith, Kaine, King, Murkowski, and Udall will       expand the use of technology-based health care models to help       patients in rural and underserved areas access specialized       health care.        And there is a proposal to improve access to mental health       care led by Senators Cassidy and Murphy, building on their       work in the HELP Committee that became law as part of the       response to the opioid crisis.  [[Page S4624]]         There are other proposals:        For example, banning anti-competitive terms in health       insurance contracts that prevent patients from seeing other,       lower-cost, higher-quality providers. The Wall Street Journal       identified dozens of cases where anti-competitive terms in       contracts between health insurers and hospital systems       increase premiums and reduce patient choice.        Banning Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or PBMs, from charging       employers, health insurance plans, and patients more for a       drug than the PBM paid to acquire the drug, which is known as       ``spread pricing.''        Eliminating a loophole allowing the first generic drug to       submit an application to the FDA and block other generic       drugs from being approved.        Provisions to improve care for expectant and new moms and       their babies.        Provisions to make it as easy to get your personal medical       records as it is to book an airplane flight.        And provisions to incentivize health care organizations to       use the best cybersecurity practices to protect your privacy       and health information.        I hope we will today vote to approve this legislative       package so we can present it to Majority Leader McConnell and       Minority Leader Schumer for the full Senate to consider next       month and would expect that other committees will have their       own contributions.        Since January, Senator Murray and I have been working in       parallel with Senator Grassley and Senator Wyden, who lead       the Finance Committee.        They are working on their own bipartisan bill, which they       plan to markup this summer. The Senate Judiciary Committee is       marking up bipartisan legislation on prescription drug costs       tomorrow. And in the House, the Energy and Commerce, Ways and       Means, and Judiciary Committees have all reported out       bipartisan bills to lower the cost of prescription drugs.        Secretary Azar and the Department of Health and Human       Services have been extremely helpful in reviewing and       providing technical advice on the various proposals to reduce       health care costs.        And the president has called for ending surprise billing       and reducing the cost of prescription drugs. The       Administration has also taken steps to increase transparency       so families and employers can better understand their health       care costs. The Lower Health Care Costs Act is just one       example of this Committee reaching a result on a difficult       issue.        We did that with fixing No Child Left Behind, with the 21st       Century Cures Act, with user fee funding for the Food and       Drug Administration, and most recently, with our response to       the opioid crisis that included input from 72 senators of       both political parties.        We reached those results in the midst of the argument       Congress has been locked in for the last decade about where       six percent of Americans get their health insurance.        Especially for Americans without subsidies, the cost of       health insurance remains way too expensive. But the reality       is we will never have lower cost health insurance until we       have lower cost health care.        That is why I am especially glad that 65 Senators,       including nearly every member of this Committee, have worked       together on the Lower Health Care Costs Act which takes       needed steps to actually bring down the cost of health care       that Americans pay for out of their own pockets.                            ____________________
