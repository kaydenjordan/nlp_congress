 Madam Speaker, what an amazing day: 100 years ago,  the Congress voted out a resolution to empower women with the right to  vote.   What is interesting, the last day, the last State, Tennessee, when  the vote was taken, or when it was about to be taken, the then-Speaker,  who was against it, wearing a red rose, said: We have got the votes.   But there is nothing like the power of a woman and the power of a  mother. And a young legislator got a letter from his mother that very  morning that said: Son, be a good boy, and vote to let women vote.   And, lo and behold, Tennessee ratified that right because that 24- year-old voted to let women vote.   It is an important time now for women to be empowered, because the  States of Alabama and Texas and Mississippi and Missouri and others are  now trying to reign back the rights of women and the right to choose.   We respect other values. We respect the Constitution and the Ninth  Amendment, but Alabama and Mississippi and Texas and Missouri, we are  not going back, because women got the right to vote. And just like that  young man, be a good boy and leave women alone, for them to choose  their own right, the right to vote.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, as a long-time advocate for veterans'  well-being  [[Page H4041]]  and resources, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2333, the  ``Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act.''   I support H.R. 2333 because this legislation will provide much needed  assistance to the VA to reduce the incidence of suicide among our  veterans. The ``SPCA'' provides DVA suicide prevention coordinators  with the resources needed to effectively do their job of providing  veterans with critical mental health resources to veterans in need.   Madam Speaker, veteran suicide is a pervasive and critical issue,  threatening, and in to many heartbreaking cases, taking the lives of  many of our heroes.   Although, the Department of Veterans Administration has screening  protocols designed to aid veterans and to stage suicide interventions,  about 6,000 veterans fall through the cracks of this system annually,  finding themselves without the necessary aid and resources that were  promised to them.   Many suicide prevention coordinators and offices specializing in  veterans affairs report being overworked and unable to keep up with the  demand for their services.   On average, about 20 veterans die every day by suicide and since  2017, 25 veterans have taken their lives on the grounds of Veterans  Affairs hospitals, including seven this year and at least four last  month. These veterans were actively seeking help from an unprepared and  under resourced agency before they took their lives.   It is long past time for Congress to provide the help needed to  address the troubling increase in veteran suicides and help improve  suicide prevention and mental health resources at the at DVA.   It is imperative that the DVA has the tools it needs to serve every  veteran that walks through the door.   The ``Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act'' would require the  Comptroller General to assess the responsibilities, workload, and  vacancy rates of the Department of Veterans Affairs Suicide Prevention  Coordinators and report it to Congress within one year, on the ability  of the DVA to detect and protect veterans from self-harm.   It is critically important that we provide suicide prevention  coordinators with the resources needed to successfully combat the  troubling trend of veteran suicide, and I believe this bill is a  necessary step in the right direction.   Madam Speaker, it is unconscionable that a veteran will commit  suicide every hour.   The fact that veterans make up just 20 percent of the male  population, yet veterans make up close to 32 percent of all male  suicides is shocking and must spur our action.   It does not have to be this way, Madam Speaker, and we can do  something about it, starting with the passage of H.R. 2333, the  ``Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act.''    Madam Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this  legislation for really tapping into something that every single Member  must face with their veterans, and certainly those who have been out of  the military for a period of time, and then all of our new veterans who  are coming in from some of the more recent conflicts that we have had,  and wars that we have had.   Just about a week or so ago, I was meeting with veterans from a  certain battalion that had flown into Houston to share with us their  concerns about the state of mind and the increasing amount of suicides  among veterans, but, in addition to those conversations and ones that I  have had, the idea of a Veterans Economic Opportunity and Transition  Administration and the Under Secretary of Veterans Economic Opportunity  and Transition of the Department of Veterans Affairs to oversee  vocational rehabilitation employment, educational assistance, veterans  housing loans, and the verification of small businesses.                                time  1715    I think this is important because veterans want to know that they can  fully integrate into society when they return home.   One of the initiatives that I had was to ensure that their service- related professions, whatever their assignments were in the military,  would equate in civilian life and that they would be respected for  their hierarchy of rank and also responsibility.   Having an office like this one helps those veterans with creative  minds who want to start small businesses.  [[Page H4048]]  When we had the impact of Hurricane Harvey, one of the hardest hit  groups were small businesses. We carved out dollars to help small  businesses by grants and not loans because that is the economic engine  of this Nation.   With respect to veterans, they are very creative. They see solutions  where there are problems. To have an office that would focus on their  vocational rehabilitation, employment, and giving them educational  assistance, that is also very important.   I have gone to my college campuses and met many, many, many veterans  who are using some of the dollars that this House provided for them  back during the first time Speaker Pelosi was Speaker, when we voted on  major reformation of the process of giving dollars to veterans for  their educational assistance, a great bill dealing with Iraq and  Afghanistan veterans that has helped them a lot.   I see the impact that getting a home has on veterans as well, and I  have been involved in projects where organizations are in the business  of donating homes to disabled vets. What a difference it makes in their  lives.   Madam Speaker, I applaud the author of this legislation and the  Veterans' Affairs Committee as well because you are now looking  holistically at these veterans and giving them a hand up, as they want,  and not a handout.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  courtesies.   Madam Speaker, I rise to support this bill, H.R. 2045, because, as I  have said, whether it is a homeless vet, whether it is a vet who has  been a veteran for a long period of time or those in the recent  conflicts or those coming home today, this is a package that they need.   This is what Members of Congress try to help them with, in their  offices. If we knew that we had an office in the Veterans Affairs  Department that deals with education, vocational rehabilitation, and  small business, and it is a one-stop shop, I think that our veterans  will appreciate that very much.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I ask my  colleagues to support H.R. 2045.
