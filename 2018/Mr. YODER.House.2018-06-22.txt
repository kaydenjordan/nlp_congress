 Mr. Speaker, there are no words to describe the tragedy  that occurred in my district in Kansas last week. Two Wyandotte County  deputies, Theresa Sue King and Patrick Thomas Rohrer, lost their lives  while transporting an inmate for a court hearing on Friday.   This is, tragically, not the first time in recent history that law  enforcement men and women in our community have made the ultimate  sacrifice to keep the peace. We are reminded that we owe our police  force, their deputies, and their loved ones a debt of great gratitude  that we will never be able to repay.   We pray for their families at this time, and we pray for Sheriff Ash,  Kelli Bailiff, and Chief Ziegler as they lead their departments through  this tragedy.   Mr. Speaker, may God bless Deputy King and Deputy Rohrer. May they  rest in peace.   Mr. Speaker, along with our colleagues from Kansas, Ron Estes and I  ask for a moment of silence for Deputy King and Deputy Rohrer and all  of our fallen police officers.                            ____________________
