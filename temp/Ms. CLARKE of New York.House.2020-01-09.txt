 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address what I  believe is in the best interests of the American people, the Iranian  people, and our global community to say: No war with Iran.   As an early opponent of the Iraq war back when I served in the New  York City Council, I know we cannot afford to make reckless,  irresponsible, violent decisions that put the lives of our servicewomen  and -men, diplomats, and the people here and in the Middle East in  danger of death and destruction.   We must exhaust all diplomatic means and put our political  differences aside to stand for peaceful resolutions to human conflict  before taking the ultimate step of engaging in war.   For close to 20 years now, our Nation has been engaged in low-grade  war games in the Middle East with the constant threat of putting our  children, our families, and our civil liberties at risk. We must oppose  senseless acts of violence that take us many steps away from our  progress.   When we look back in our history books and tell the next generation  stories of 2020, I want us to be able to say with pride that we kept  the interests of our Nation we loved at heart without provocation,  without the death and destruction of war.   Madam Speaker, I stand before you today opposed to these efforts, and  I support the War Powers Resolution, H. Con. Res. 83.                            ____________________
