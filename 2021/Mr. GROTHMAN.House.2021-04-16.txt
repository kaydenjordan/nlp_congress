 Madam Speaker, just prior to coming to Washington this  week, I spent a couple of days down at the Mexican border to see for  myself exactly what was going on down there.   I visited the El Paso sector. I would like to thank the Border  Patrol, ICE, the ranchers, and local law enforcement for being so  helpful and informative to the nine Congressmen who were in the El Paso  sector over the weekend.   Our goal was to see over the last few months how things have changed,  and in the last 5 months, things have changed dramatically at the  border.   For one thing, illegal apprehensions are way up. In March, we had  172,000 illegal apprehensions, and that doesn't include, of course, the  people who snuck across without being apprehended. This time last year,  in March, there were 34,000 illegal apprehensions. What could cause an  increase from 34,000 to 172,000?   It was painful not only to hear about the numbers but to see row  after row of young children on mats just waiting for something to  happen.   Now, what has happened? What happened at the border to get a fivefold  increase in 1 year, as well as seeing all these children in almost  inhumane conditions waiting to be taken away to somebody who they hope  will take care of them?   First of all, this administration got rid of the migrant protection  protocol. Donald Trump, I am sure in very difficult negotiations, had  Mexico agree to hold people south of the border pending hearings for  asylum. That was a huge benefit.   Secondly, we had agreements with Central American countries so that  when people came here from other Central American countries or South  America, they would be held south of the Mexican border.   Third, we changed things to the old-fashioned catch and release,  where we touched people, but then when we are dealing with families, we  let them in the United States pending a hearing on immigration. We  changed title 42 to allow more people to come into this country,  whether or not they have COVID.   Finally, we have a President who, during the campaign, made many  different statements indicating that illegal immigration was not going  to be a problem during his administration, whether he was promising  free medical care, supporting sanctuary cities, ending the public  charge rule. And President Trump had said: Immigrants coming here, we  don't want you here if you are going to wind up on welfare.    It is no wonder they were wearing Biden T-shirts. We make stimulus  payments to people who are here illegally.   Given all these changes, is it a surprise that so many people want to  come here? In addition to the fact that the changes in the laws  themselves cause people to get to the Mexican border to come here, it  is advertising to the world that the United States does not care about  immigration laws.   Now, we have to do something. We have dug ourselves a deeper hole in  our relations with both El Salvador and Mexico. It is important to  treat our Latin American cousins with respect. But in February, the  President of El Salvador, President Bukele, was not given an audience  when he showed up in this country in February. Is that the type of way  we should treat our Central American allies when we want people held  south of the border?   The Mexican President feels that President Biden has made himself out  to be the migrant President. Mexico does not like this free-for-all at  our  [[Page H1887]]  southern border in which we are strengthening the control of the drug  cartels.   But, again, our relationship is going south there. The migrant  protection protocol, in which we are holding prospective applicants for  asylum south of the border, has ended.   Another thing that I think is causing this problem is the actions of  the President and Vice President. Three weeks ago now, our Vice  President was appointed to be in charge for the administration on what  goes on at the southern border. She hasn't been there yet. This has to  raise red flags all over the world.   Do the Vice President and the President get along? Right now, it is  not hard to find articles by talking heads. Did the Vice President want  this position? Has she accepted the position with any enthusiasm? Why,  for 3 weeks, in what to me is probably the second biggest crisis, maybe  the biggest, at least the second biggest crisis the United States has  undergone in the last 6 years, why do we have a person in charge of the  crisis who has not gone down to the border? Does she consider this a  serious problem or not?   I would love it if she gave a speech, a wholehearted speech, saying  that she does believe we have a problem on the border, and she is going  to do something.   I am going to divert a little bit from my discussion on what is going  on at the border. I want the Biden administration to also give a little  thought to how this looks to other countries around the world. I don't  like the United States to have enemies--and I don't consider these  countries necessarily enemies--but there are times when, clearly, we  are being challenged by Russia, China, Iran, and other countries around  the world.   How does the United States look to other countries when we can't even  secure our southern border, when it looks like we are not even trying  to secure our southern border? I want the Biden administration to think  that the complete inaction at the southern border, allowing tens of  thousands of people to cross every month, sends a message around the  world that this administration is not yet fully engaged.   The Vice President has said she wants to deal with root causes. If  root causes mean people making less money than in the United States, I  mean, we are going to have open borders forever.   We have something great here in the United States, and if we feel  that some people would rather live here, or they are not materially as  well off as in the United States, I will tell you, if we are not going  to secure the border until that is solved, we are not going to solve  this problem until we have over a billion new people in this country.   We noticed other things on the border. We noticed the stopping of  building the wall. It is not until you are down there that you see all  the planks that are supposed to be put together on the wall just  sitting there in the sun. Somebody presumably paid for these things. I  don't know why, since we had all the pieces for a wall down there, that  we didn't at least try to build it for another month or 6 weeks so that  the material down there could at least have been used.   I want to point out, by the way, with regard to the wall, because  some people think it cost money, compared to the alternative, not only  people coming in this country using the services we provide, but we  were told at the southern border that when you have the old-fashioned  barbed wire, you maybe should have two or three Border Patrol agents  per mile. But when you have the wall, you need one agent for every 2  miles. There is a tremendous savings in the number of people you need  in Border Patrol at the border if you had the wall.    The idea of stopping it mid-construction, where you have all these  metal beams spread out just lying in the southern sun, is very  frustrating.   Another thing to point out is that we met with ranchers down there.  How difficult it must be for ranchers to see members of drug cartels  walking across their land. Wouldn't that just scare you to death? A  horrible thing.   We look at the human toll of people sneaking into this country  because they are escorted into the country by the drug cartels. A lot  of people don't realize this. Another reason so many people are pushed  across the border, and another organization that will educate people  around the world that you ought to come to the United States, is the  Mexican drug cartels.   Why do they do that? They do that because they are charging 3,000  bucks a head for every Mexican person who comes across the border. They  are charging $5,000 a head for every Central American. They are  charging $8,000 to $10,000 a head for every Brazilian.   As long as the drug cartels are making money at the border, is it any  surprise that we have such a surge here, as they attract people or  encourage people to come to the United States?   I want to make another point about these poor children at the border.  What goes on right now is that the children come to the border. If they  are unaccompanied, we hold them, looking for somewhere to put them in  the United States. It is very heart-rending to see all these kids  without anybody there.   But right now, under the current protocols, if you have a child who  has parents in Honduras, but you give them a piece of paper saying that  he has an aunt and uncle in New York, rather than send that child back  to his parents, they send them to the aunt and uncle in New York, who  are here illegally.   Does that make any sense? That is what is going on.                                time  1445    One thing that really irritates the Border Patrol down there is they  know that if American parents were to send a 5-year-old child, let's  say, and drop him off at the Milwaukee airport and hope he shows up in  the airport in Miami the next day, Child Protective Services would be  there saying: What is wrong with the parents?   Here at the southern border, we are co-conspirators on these  dangerous trips for the children, some of which wind up dying, and many  of them wind up being sexually assaulted, which is just a horrible  thing.   Another thing that we found out at the border is that the amount of  hardcore illegal drugs is rocketing up. I know some people may say that  is an old story. The week before I went to the border, I happened to  visit with the DEA in Milwaukee. Last year alone, in Milwaukee County,  540 people died of illegal drug overdoses. When I talked to the people  at the DEA in Milwaukee, they felt it was entirely possible that all  540 people were poisoned to death with drugs either brought across the  southern border or ingredients for drugs brought across the southern  border.   Madam Speaker, look at the skyrocketing number of people who are  dying of hardcore drugs.   Why is that?   We should have anticipated it.   The powerful Mexican drug cartels are going to make money. There was  a time, maybe 10 years ago, when marijuana coming across the southern  border was common. But now as more American States legalize marijuana-- Washington, Colorado, and what have you--there is so much marijuana  being produced in the United States that there is no money to be made  by importing marijuana from Mexico.   I heard an anecdote of marijuana being brought here from Mexico, and  it was being carted around the Southern United States, looking for  somebody to take it. Nobody would take it because you can have higher  quality marijuana growing legally here in the United States.   So what are the Mexican drug cartels going to do?   They are going to import in this country more heroin, more meth, and  especially more fentanyl. That is what we are seeing at the border.   So rather than being a time to cut back and saying that we don't care  as much about the border, now is the time with the increasing number of  fentanyl deaths--540 in Milwaukee County alone last year from fentanyl  and the other drugs, which is a shocking number--now is the time to  dial up enforcement at the border. But instead, it seems, we are going  the opposite way.   I don't know what is going on that you want to let more fentanyl in  the country, Madam Speaker. I know there are some people who say that  it is a victimless crime or what have you, but you tell that to the  families of the 540 people who died last year in Milwaukee County. That  is another result of this lax, devil-may-care attitude, as far as what  is going on down there.  [[Page H1888]]    So the question is: What to do?   Maybe Mexico will not go back to the old agreement, but I think the  President should beg Mexico to go back to the migrant protection  protocol where one more time we are allowed to hold people on the  Mexican side of the border pending hearings as to whether they are  eligible for asylum.   Secondly, we have to hire more Border Patrol.   I want to go back and explain something. I talked about the 170,000  people in March who are touched by the Border Patrol. That doesn't  include people whom they don't catch. The more the Border Patrol has to  deal with the children on the southern border, the less time they have  to guard the border. So there is clearly a significant increase in  people crossing the border because they know the Border Patrol is no  longer there. They are dealing with paperwork for the children that  they have to process, and that has to be the priority.   If you are going to go down this path, President Biden, and not care  about the southern border or not reinstate the migrant protection  protocol with Mexico, at least hire more Border Patrol agents so we can  process the people you are letting in this country; and don't leave  these huge swaths of the southern border wide open.   Because of that, people I have talked to guess--this is a guess--that  whereas, last year, maybe 10,000 people a month were crossing the  southern border without the Border Patrol touching them, now it is more  like 30,000 people a month. What a disaster.   We should amend the Flores agreement, which is what is requiring us  to take so many of these children and ship them around the United  States. We should be able to send them back to their native country.   We should try to undo the damage we have done with the way we have  treated the El Salvadorean President and see if he can, one more time,  assist us in preventing people from all around the world coming up from  south of Mexico.   Since the metal beams used to put together a wall are just sitting  there in the hot sun, we should at least, at a minimum--it would be  great to build a whole wall--use up the raw materials for the wall that  are sitting down there. Actually, it is more than a wall; it is a whole  wall system. Just don't have those metal beams just sitting there in  the desert forever.   Above all, President Biden and Vice President Harris, show you care.  Show you care. Let the world know that the United States does not have  an open border for anybody to come across the border, be they criminal,  especially people coming across with that fentanyl. Show that you care.  Hold a press conference.   It would be nice if Vice President Harris would show that she  accepted her new job with some enthusiasm. Again, the talking heads I  read right now imply that maybe she didn't even want the job.   So, please, President Biden, show you care before we have 200,000  people a month coming in the country. Show you care a little about the  fentanyl crisis, as we are approaching 90,000 people a year dying in  this country of illegal drugs, most of which come across the southern  border. Show you care about those little children sitting in row after  row of mattresses on our southern border. Show you care about the drug  cartels and the way they are corrupting the Mexican Government and  beginning to corrupt the United States. Say you want to stop the system  in which they are able to make so much money sneaking people in this  country. Show you care about the poor ranchers on the southern border,  who have been there for generations and now have to be scared to death  to go out late at night and can't let their children ride their horses  on their land for fear of what will happen to them.    If you won't do it, we have to call upon the public and other Members  of Congress to let the Biden administration know that the current  situation is completely untenable. You have to step up to the plate and  do something.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
