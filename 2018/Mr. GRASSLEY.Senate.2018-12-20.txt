 Mr. President, yesterday one of my colleagues came to  the floor to talk about my objection to the unanimous consent request  relating to the nomination of William R. Evanina.   When I noticed my intention to place a hold on this nominee back in  June of this year, I made it very clear to the public and to the  administration my reasons for doing so, and I put my statement of those  reasons in the Record. I have done that consistently, not only since  the rules of the Senate require every Member to do that but even before  that rule was ever put in place. When I put a hold on a bill or a hold  on a nominee, I don't ever want anybody to, say, put the adjective  ``secret'' before the word ``hold'' because there is nothing secret  about what I do when I place a hold on something.   The Judiciary Committee has experienced difficulty in obtaining  relevant documents and briefings from the Justice Department and the  Office of the Director of National Intelligence.   For example, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein personally  assured me the Senate Judiciary Committee would receive equal access to  information that had been provided to the House Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence with regard to any concessions in its  negotiations regarding pending subpoenas from that committee related to  the 2016 election controversies. I have not received equal access, as  promised, on that front.   On August 7 of this year, I wrote to the Justice Department and  pointed out that the House Intelligence Committee had received  documents related to Bruce Ohr that we had not received. The Department  initially denied those records had been provided to the House  Intelligence Committee. After my staff confronted the Department on  that misinformation, we eventually received some Bruce Ohr documents.   In that 2018 letter I have referred to, I asked for documents based  on my equal access agreement with Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein,  and as you might expect, I have not received a response to date.   This morning, I had Acting Attorney General Whitaker in my office for  issues he wanted to bring up, but I also had an opportunity to present  him with three pages--fairly finely printed--that had a multitude of  requests for information that in my constitutional role of oversight of  the Justice Department, they should be providing to me. Some of them  have nothing to do with this hold, but the Department does have a  pretty good record of not responding to this chairman of the Judiciary  Committee on things I have a constitutional responsibility to do.   I also have a promise from these Department heads that they will  supply information when Congress asks for it. Since that 2018 letter, I  have learned the Justice Department has taken the position that  Director Coats has prohibited them from sharing the requested records  with the committee.   In addition to the records that were requested in May of this year,  the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department  provided a briefing in connection with a pending House Intel subpoena  to which no Senate Judiciary Committee member was invited. Thus far,  the committee's attempts to schedule any equivalent briefing have been  ignored. The administration's lack of cooperation has forced my hand.  So then, I continue to press for this hold on this nominee.   My objection, if there were ever a request for a unanimous consent to  move ahead, is not intended to question the credentials of Mr. Evanina  in any way whatsoever. However, the executive branch must recognize it  has an ongoing obligation to respond to congressional inquiries in a  timely and reasonable manner.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now I would like to speak to the issue  and several issues that deal with international trade.   During the last 2 years, there has been more talk about international  trade in this town than at just about any other point since this  President has been President or, you might say, over a long period of  time in Washington.   When I was elected to the Senate in 1980, the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT, was the main guiding document on  international trade. GATT was signed by 23 nations in Geneva on October  30, 1947, a little more than 2 years after the destruction of World War  II. It remained the institutional foundation for global trade until  January 1, 1995. That day is when the World Trade Organization--we  refer to it as WTO--was born with 81 charter members, including this  great country of the United States. The WTO has been in place now for  24 years, serving as the clearinghouse for our rules-based  international trading system.   Since the start of the WTO, international trade volumes have  increased by 250 percent. Countries representing 98 percent of global  merchandise trade are currently members of the WTO, with 22 more  countries officially working toward joining. Over all, the WTO is  moving global commerce forward just as planned. The rules-based trading  system it promotes has been very successful, integrating people across  the world into the global economy.   I also must acknowledge that international trade can, at times, be  disruptive. There are regions of the country that have been  disproportionately impacted by job losses, at least in part, to foreign  competition over the last several decades. Those losses become  especially problematic when they are the result of market forces being  overwhelmed by foreign government intervention--any foreign government,  as far as that is concerned. President Trump has rightly pointed that  out and has delivered on his promise to make trade fairer for workers  across our country, for agriculture and international trade is the  bridge to the world's customers.   In Iowa, we export every third row of soybeans. Some people like to  say that God made Iowa for the growing of corn and soybeans, and I  agree. Iowa also has significant pork and beef exports as well.  American farmers produce more than we can possibly consume here in  [[Page S7975]]  the United States, so we understand then why the ability to trade and  the freer trade, as well, is very important to us. So we rely on global  customers. Export markets are and will continue to be vitally important  to Iowa's farmers. I will make it a priority, as I resume chairmanship  of the Finance Committee. After about 12 years of not being the  chairman, I am going to concentrate on gaining access to new markets.   The United States must continue leading the world on trade and  economic issues. The U.S. market is one of the most open in the world.  Unfortunately, other countries throw up numerous barriers to our  exports.   President Trump and Ambassador Lighthizer are working to correct  these injustices. I intend to assist them in this fight, with the  understanding that creating market barriers of our own, like tariffs,  is not a long-term solution.   One of the top issues Congress needs to address next year is  implementation of the recently signed United States-Mexico-Canada  agreement, which updates NAFTA for the modern economy.   The new trade deal with Mexico and Canada make significant updates to  the original NAFTA, with new sections on digital trade, currency  manipulation, and State-owned enterprises. It goes further than any  other trade agreement in protecting intellectual property rights and  makes important changes to market access for agricultural products.   While I commend the President for following through on his promise to  renegotiate NAFTA, there are a few areas of concern. Those concerns go  beyond just the Canada-Mexico agreement. As long as 232 tariffs on  steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico remain, the U.S.  farmers and others facing retaliation, along with the American  businesses that rely on those imports, will be unable to realize the  full potential benefits of the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement.   This is why I urge the administration to consult with Congress, as  intended by the trade promotion authority, to ensure a clear path  forward for the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement.   I intend to work with members of the Finance Committee and, of  course, with the Senate leadership to move the United States-Mexico- Canada agreement quickly in the new Congress as soon as the President  submits it. But I can't do it without a strong commitment from the  administration that we will work together.   The Constitution tasks Congress with the authority to regulate trade  with foreign countries. We collectively--meaning the President and  Congress--have a responsibility to ensure that U.S. farmers, ranchers,  and businesses face minimal uncertainty from the updating of the United  States-Mexico-Canada agreement.   Building on the success of this new agreement, we must continue to  play offense and pursue new market access opportunities. That is why I  am happy the administration is pursuing new agreements with Japan, the  European Union, and the United Kingdom. The economies of those  countries account for 27 percent of global GDP. Having more access to  those markets will help U.S. farmers, ranchers, and businesses for  generations to come.    I expect the agreement with the European Union and with the UK, when  ready, to address agriculture. There is some talk that the Europeans  don't want to talk about making any agreements on agriculture. The  notion that some people in the EU think there could be an agreement  that doesn't address the many ways they block our good agricultural  products from being sold in Europe is outright ridiculous.   While I agree with the President that we must have fair trade that  benefits Americans, I want him to know, as well--and I have told him-- that I am not a fan of tariffs. Put simply, tariffs are taxes on U.S.  consumers and businesses.   The Constitution grants Congress authority over tariffs and  international trade, but Congress has delegated some of its authority  to the President through legislation. To some extent, I think,  particularly in the 1963 legislation, too much authority was delegated.   I am no novice when it comes to understanding the delicate balance  between congressional and executive authority over international trade.  In fact, I was the leader in renewing trade promotion authority as the  ranking member of the Finance Committee in 2002. In addition to that,  and more recently, I strongly supported its renewal under the  leadership of Chairman Orrin Hatch in 2015.   What was important then and remains truer now is that Congress plays  a central and pivotal role in crafting trade policy. Our Founding  Fathers were very explicit in placing this responsibility with Congress  in article I of the Constitution. We must remain vigilant to ensure  that the aspects of trade authority that Congress has delegated are  used appropriately and in the best interests of our country. I am  certainly not opposed to being creative in negotiations with other  countries, but I strongly disagree with the notion that imports of  steel and aluminum, automobiles, and automobile parts somehow could  pose a national security threat, as the President's actions have  stated.   So I intend to review the President's use of power under section 232  of the Trade Act of 1962, which grants the President broad legal  authority to impose tariffs in the name of national security. Senator  Portman and my colleague, Senator Ernst, and others have already  introduced legislation to narrow the scope of how an administration can  use the power that Congress authorized in 1962 under the influence of  the Cold War. Maybe, considering 1962 and the issue of the now- forgotten Cold War, there may have been reasons for Congress at that  point to overdelegate power to the President, but I am not sure that  those conditions exist today.   I believe these efforts to restrain delegation of the authority to  the President serve as a prudent starting point for the discussions we  need to have on section 232 authority in the next Congress. The tariffs  against products from China that were imposed as a result of U.S. Trade  Representatives' findings under section 301 investigations are not  ideal, but I do agree with the reasons that have been applied.   The President is absolutely right to confront China regarding section  301 findings. I am glad that he had a successful meeting with President  Xi at the G20 summits last month. My hope is that the ensuing  negotiations will result in a change in China's discriminatory policies  and practices and an easing of tariffs and tensions.   I recommend that everyone read the findings of the section 301  investigation that were published in March of this year. That report  outlines in detail many of the ways that China abuses American  businesses and workers and steals, or forces the transfer, of U.S.  intellectual property. American businesses that are able to access the  Chinese market are, as a result of these Chinese policies, often forced  to participate in joint ventures with Chinese firms and turn over the  details of their technologies. No one can call that a level playing  field.   The Chinese claim is that this simply represents the cost of market  access. My answer to that is hogwash. That is not how members of the  WTO should act. It is an organization you join based upon respect for  other people's rights, but the most important thing is to respect the  rules of trade.   I voted in favor of China's accession into the WTO. In many ways, I  regret that vote. China has not lived up to its obligations or honored  its promises, yet it enjoys many of the benefits that come with  membership in the WTO.   Part of the reason, in my view, that China gets away with so much is  that the WTO systems we rely on have failed and are in great need of  reform. The fact that China, the world's most populous country and the  second largest economy on Earth, can self-certify as a developing  economy--that is a term used in the WTO documents--is extremely  frustrating to me. Can you imagine the world's most populous country  and the second largest economy in the world is still somehow a  developing country?   I know many of my colleagues here in the Congress share that  frustration.   I have great interest in the WTO reform process that has begun.  Reform and oversight are critical to the proper functioning of  institutions. That is true whether we are talking about a Federal  agency or the WTO. I will also continue conducting rigorous oversight  as chairman of the Finance Committee.  [[Page S7976]]    The United States has free-trade agreements in place with 20  countries. One problem we have had with our agreements is that other  countries don't always live up to the text and spirit of the agreement  they signed. I will work with the administration to hold our partners  accountable in order to improve outcomes for American businesses and  consumers, but most important to American businesses and consumers is  to get the proper respect for the rules of trade that come as a result  of the WTO.   In short, the Finance Committee has its work cut out for it and for  us on the committee next year. International trade is a force for good.  Farmers and businesses in Iowa and across the country have benefited  tremendously from international trade and are better off because they  can sell their products around the world. I am committed to making sure  they have access to open markets with the guarantees of fair treatment  and enforceable protections.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I now would like to go to a final set of  remarks--probably the final set of remarks for this Congress as we draw  to a close--to summarize some of the work of the Judiciary Committee,  as I have been chairman for the last 4 years.   I have served on the Judiciary Committee for each of my 38 years in  the Senate. Four years ago, I became chairman. Senator Leahy, my  colleague from Vermont, who served as chairman before I took the reins,  marked the occasion by presenting me with a larger than life gavel. Of  course, that was a lighthearted moment, and I appreciated his gesture  of good will and collegiality. It is this spirit of camaraderie that  sustains the Senate and has guided the bipartisan accomplishments of  the Judiciary Committee.   The work we do on the Judiciary Committee shapes our way of life in  America to a great extent. Its legislative jurisdiction includes  constitutional amendments, bankruptcy laws, civil liberties,  immigration, patents, copyrights and trademarks, antitrust laws,  juvenile justice, criminal laws, and more. The committee conducts  oversight of the Justice Department, including the FBI and sections of  the Homeland Security Department. It also handles consideration of  judicial nominees.   As chairman, I put forth a number of legislative priorities. I wanted  to increase oversight efforts to hold government accountable and  advance judicial confirmations. I wanted to strengthen whistleblower  protections and increase competition in the pharmaceutical markets to  lower the cost of prescription drugs. I wanted to enact juvenile  justice reform and update our criminal justice system. I wanted to  protect election integrity and bolster victims' rights. At the close of  this Congress, I am happy to report that the committee has made  progress in all of these areas.   This week, the Senate passed the FIRST STEP Act, a historic criminal  justice reform bill that had overwhelming bipartisan support in  Congress and the backing of the President.   Earlier this month, the Senate unanimously passed bipartisan juvenile  justice legislation, which legislation hadn't been updated since 2002.   The Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act, the Missing  Children's Reauthorization Act, and Kevin and Avonte's Law to help  families locate people with dementia and others who wander and go  missing all became law during the 115th Congress.   Overall, 61 bills were reported out of committee, all of them  bipartisan. Of those bills, 45 were passed in the Senate, and 29 became  law in the past two Congresses under Presidents Obama and Trump. And if  the House passes our criminal justice reform bill today, that figure  will be 30 bills that have gone through Congress. Again, I want to  emphasize that all were bipartisan.   The committee also delivered on judicial nominees. This wasn't so  bipartisan. The Senate confirmed a historic number of lifetime  appointments to the Federal bench this Congress. That includes 53  district court judges, 30 circuit court judges, and 2 Supreme Court  Justices--85 Federal judgeships in the last 2 years. This reflects an  alltime record for the first 2 years of any Presidency. These lifetime  appointments will uphold the rule of law and preserve freedom and  liberty for generations to come.   These accomplishments weren't easy. There was contention, and there  was rigorous debate and, as I said, plenty of disagreement.   The confirmation hearing for Justice Brett Kavanaugh was the height  of discord on the committee. As chairman, I was determined to uphold  order and the rule of law, protect due process, and maintain  credibility in our constitutional responsibility of advice and consent.  I took the allegations that were brought forth very seriously. The  committee conducted the most thorough, comprehensive, and transparent  confirmation process in history. And if that word ``history'' bothers  you, it is numerically justifiable by saying that we had more documents  on Kavanaugh than we had on the previous five Supreme Court Justices  combined. So I hope, after half a million documents, it is shown that  we left no stone unturned. In the end, another extremely well-qualified  Justice was confirmed.   However, the divisions that defined the Kavanaugh hearings do not  define the body of work produced by the committee this Congress. The  Judiciary Committee passed seven bipartisan bills to help families,  healthcare professionals, and law enforcement address the opioid crisis  in their local communities. The President signed these measures into  law with the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. We also passed  the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in 2016 to rapidly respond  to the opioid crisis and prevent others from falling into addiction.   With hearings and legislation, the Judiciary Committee also worked  toward ending the pervasive problem of human trafficking. In all, the  Senate adopted a series of five bills that were signed into law to  enhance Federal efforts to protect victims and prevent and prosecute  enslavement for forced labor and sex trafficking.   As a committee, we have made great progress on behalf of the American  people. We tackled the priorities I outlined at the beginning of my  chairmanship and achieved success on a bipartisan basis. That is what  our constituents expect from those of us who are Senators. That is what  I strive to deliver every day.   The 115th Congress is drawing to a close. Although I won't serve as  chairman during the next Congress, I have every confidence that my  friend Senator Graham of South Carolina will build upon the successes  we have accomplished. I look forward to continuing my service on the  Judiciary Committee in the next Congress, and I am thankful to all of  my colleagues on the committee and even some off the committee for  their hard work and cooperation on behalf of the American people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, oversight is one of the most important  responsibilities of this legislative branch. The Constitution requires  it.   Without oversight, the Members of this body cannot legislate in the  best interests of their constituents, nor can they ensure the  government is accountable to the taxpayers.   In whatever capacity I have served my own fellow citizens of Iowa  over the years, I have always strived to faithfully carry out my duty  to conduct oversight.   The same is true of these last 4 years that I have been honored to  serve as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.   The agencies under the committee's jurisdiction are some of the most  powerful and most consequential in the executive branch.   Our Nation's law enforcement agencies have the authority to seek to  search and seize our property and review our communications.   When warranted, they may bring charges that can result in  disgorgement of financial resources or loss of personal liberty.   That is because these agencies have the equally weighty  responsibility to protect us from criminal and intelligence threats of  all stripes.   These agencies help protect the taxpayer from fraud, hunt down  violent offenders and fugitives, protect our senior leaders and judges,  and dismantle illicit networks that traffic in illegal drugs,  endangered wildlife, and worst of all, human beings.   They safeguard our borders, secure our transportation and cyber  networks, and return kidnapped children to their families.   That is just a fraction of the many responsibilities of the  Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.   I am grateful for the faithful public service of thousands of law  enforcement agents, analysts, lawyers, engineers, scientists, officers,  managers, and other employees who make up these agencies.   That includes especially those individuals who have not only done  their jobs, but have truly gone above and beyond.   A lot of times, they don't like being called whistleblowers because  they never meant to be whistleblowers.   But these employees, hundreds of them in the last 4 years, have  courageously raised their hands and disclosed waste, fraud, abuse,  mismanagement, and all sorts of misconduct.   I could not have fulfilled my oversight responsibilities without  them.   Because of whistleblowers, the committee: uncovered a pattern of  wasteful spending at the U.S. Marshals Service.   Turns out, the Marshals Service spent $22,000 on a conference table  for the Asset Forfeiture Division's headquarters in Arlington, VA, and  $50,000 a month on a lavishly furnished training facility in Houston,  TX, that was used for only a few weeks out of the year.   Thanks to the whistleblowers and the work done by this Committee, I  am happy to report that the Marshals Service closed that facility  earlier this year.   Whistleblowers have also highlighted examples of gross mismanagement  within the agency.   For example, we know that, last year, roughly 2,000 deputy marshals  were using expired or soon to be expired body armor. We also uncovered  instances of unfair hiring practices and other serious ethical  violations.   In total, over 100 whistleblowers from the U.S. Marshals Service  courageously came forward. I thank them for their bravery and  commitment to government transparency.   After supervisors ignored their warnings, whistleblowers at the  Department of Homeland Security came forward to raise awareness on how  smugglers prey on unaccompanied minors and migrants.   A courageous whistleblower told my office that Health and Human  Services were not conducting thorough background checks on sponsors  before they took custody of the children.   Now, all sponsors and those living with sponsors, are fingerprinted  before they can bring a child home. This whistleblower also reported a  dangerous tactic used by smugglers to pair kids with unrelated adults  to create the appearance of family units.   Smugglers would use kids like pawns in an effort to help adults avoid  detention when coming across our border. Now, U.S. Government officials  are working with their counterparts in Mexico to investigate and crack  down on the smuggling that occurs on the lengthy journey to the United  States.   Whistleblowers also contacted my office during the Obama  administration about criminals who should be ineligible for DACA, but  due to an oversight by the Department, were still receiving benefits,  like work authorization. Scrutiny of the program led to more thorough  recurrent vetting by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.   Thanks to more than 10 whistleblowers at the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco, and Firearms who courageously reported that their sexual  harassment claims were being buried internally, then-Attorney General  Lynch updated the sexual harassment policy and a problematic official  in internal affairs was replaced.   The GAO is currently assessing how reports of abuse are reviewed and  adjudicated at ATF.   I have also had the pleasure of working with a number of  whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs who have had the  courage to stand up and do what is right.   Most recently, my office worked with Brandon Coleman after he was put  on administrative leave for more than a year and kept from running an  addiction treatment program for veterans.   Brandon's only ``mistake'' was to point out poor treatment of  suicidal veterans.   Eventually, after a concerted effort by my office, Senator Johnson,  and the Office of Special Counsel, Brandon was provided a new position  within the VA's Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection.  That is how it should be done.   Although the False Claims Act isn't new, I want to point out that is  still working hard for the taxpayers.   Because of the 1986 amendments to the act and all of our efforts to  strengthen it, whistleblowers were empowered to help the government  fight fraud.   In the last 4 years, thanks largely to whistleblowers, the government  has recovered $17 billion under the False Claims Act.   That makes $56 billion since the 1986 amendments.   These are only a few examples of what has been achieved because of  whistleblowers. They have saved our money, made us safer, and held our  government accountable.   Our oversight efforts have also helped us write better laws.  [[Page S7983]]    Through my investigations, I learned about problems with how the  Department of Veterans Affairs reports veterans to the national gun ban  list, called the NICS list.   Once you are on the list, you can no longer own and possess a  firearm.   And there is an unfair double standard at work here.   The VA never determines a veteran to be dangerous before taking away  firearms, but to get their firearms back, the veteran is required to  prove that they are not dangerous.   The Obama Social Security Administration created a rule that would  allow it to report beneficiaries to the NICS list without ever finding  the beneficiaries to be mentally ill or dangerous--just like what the  VA does to veterans.   If the Federal Government is going to attempt to take away a  citizen's fundamental constitutional right, it better have one heck of  a compelling reason to do so.   If a person isn't mentally ill, dangerous, or subject to some other  Federal restriction, then the government is on shaky ground.   This Obama Social Security regulation was a pure and simple  unconstitutional gun-grab.   So I worked to pass legislation with bipartisan support to terminate  the regulation, 57 to 43.   I have also worked to pass strong legislation to support the critical  work done by inspectors general. In 2016, a broad bipartisan coalition  of legislators passed the Inspector General Empowerment Act that  reiterated Congress's intent that IGs be able to access ALL agency  records.   It also gave IGs better tools that enable them to do their jobs more  effectively, including the ability to conduct investigations without  getting agency approval. It also strengthened public reporting  requirements to ensure as much transparency as possible.   I have also introduced legislation to create an IG for the Federal  judiciary to offer those employees the same rights offered to their  coequal executive branch counterparts.   After holding a full committee hearing on problems with rampant  sexual harassment in the judiciary and raising awareness on a lack of  an effective reporting mechanism, the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts took a step in the right direction by creating the Judicial  Integrity Office.   I hope through the establishment of this office, the AO will  recognize the importance of transparency and accountability.   Another example of where oversight led to a legislative solution is  the Public Safety Officers Benefit Program.   Enacted in 1976, this program provides survivor benefits to the  spouses and children of public safety officers who died in the line of  duty.   Despite the Department's own 1-year deadline to resolve all claims,  we found that over half of all death benefit claims were pending past  the 1-year mark. As a result, I introduced and passed bipartisan  legislation aimed at creating more transparency and accountability in  the administration of this program.   Oversight of the Justice Department also uncovered gross  mismanagement by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention, or OJJDP for short.   That office provides millions of dollars in grants to States to  assist them in addressing juvenile delinquency. Thanks to several  whistleblowers, we discovered that OJJDP was issuing millions of  dollars to noncompliant States.   I introduced bipartisan legislation which would require the Justice  Department to hold States more accountable for fulfilling these grant  requirements. A few days ago, this bill unanimously passed both  Chambers of Congress.   Oversight is a critical tool Congress must use to help hold the  Federal Government accountable to ``we the people''.   It is the job of Congress, which represents the people, to ensure the  government is operating above board, transparently, and as a good  steward of taxpayer resources.   Of course, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, over the last 4  years I have focused extensively on the Justice Department proper and  FBI.   Much of that focus has been on how the Department handled the Clinton  investigation and the Russia investigation.   With respect to the Clinton investigation, some of the most  problematic material discovered thus far is classified. However, as  many now know, the Department had personnel on the Clinton  investigation that exhibited extreme political bias against then- Candidate Trump.   My inquiry also found that the Department and FBI oddly limited the  scope of review to the time Secretary Clinton was Secretary of State,  even though evidence of obstruction would have occurred after she left  the State Department.   Perhaps defying all sense of legal logic, the Department and FBI  decided to write in the element of ``intent'' into 18 U.S.C. 793(f),  which covers the mishandling of classified information.   By the FBI's own admission, highly classified information transited  Secretary Clinton's unclassified nongovernment server that she used for  government business.   If any one of us did that to classified information, we would have  the book thrown at us.   Also, the Department and FBI used immunity agreements at an alarming  rate and then-Director Comey began writing an exoneration statement  before interviewing Secretary Clinton and 16 other witnesses.   That same exoneration statement labeled Secretary Clinton's actions  as ``grossly negligent,'' a criminal standard, which was later changed  to ``extremely careless,'' a noncriminal standard.   All told, the Clinton investigation was mismanaged to the detriment  of our country's faith in the FBI.   Perhaps the most breathtaking hypocrisy we identified in the Clinton  investigation is that Comey and other FBI officials were using private  email to conduct government business while they investigated Secretary  Clinton for doing the same.   Congress has an obligation to shine a light on wrongdoing, and I  certainly hope the Department and FBI have learned their lesson.   If not, eventually, Congress will find out. And let me say this: Our  patience is wearing thin.   Aside from the Clinton investigation, in 2015 I began looking into  the Foreign Agents Registration Act before it was made popular by  Robert Mueller.   FARA is a very important law. It requires agents of foreign  governments or enterprises to register with the Justice Department so  we know who they are and who they truly work for.   Sunlight is the best disinfectant. We ought to know where someone's  loyalty lies.   I held a hearing in July 2017 about the law and potential fixes to  it. As a result, I introduced the Disclosing Foreign Influence Act   That bill does two important things: No. 1, it provides the Attorney  General with civil investigative demand authority; and No. 2, it  creates oversight checks and balances on the use of that authority.   We must do whatever we can do identify foreign agents spreading  propaganda and lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.   During the course of my investigation into violations of FARA, I  became aware of a group of unregistered foreign agents lobbying for the  repeal of the Magnitsky Act. That law, passed by Congress in 2012,  authorized sanctions against a group of Russians responsible for a  particularly egregious case of human rights abuse.   I discovered that those involved in the anti-Magnitsky lobbying  effort were the same cast of characters who organized the now infamous  Trump Tower meeting in 2016. This prompted a full-scale investigation  into the meeting and the reasons behind it.   On May 16 of this year, I am proud to say that the committee released  approximately 2,500 pages of transcripts, written statements, and  exhibits collected during the course of this investigation, as well as  records produced by meeting attendees who were not interviewed. Taken  in their entirety, these materials provided the public with the most  complete picture of events surrounding that meeting to date.   In the end, the evidence supported what we had suspected all along-- that the meeting was just another attempt by this group of unregistered  foreign  [[Page S7984]]  agents trying to overturn a law that they didn't like.   I also conducted oversight into the FBI's handling of its  investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.   As a result of our and other committees' investigative efforts, we  now know that one of the documents used by the FBI to establish and  broaden its early investigation of President Trump was an  unsubstantiated political opposition research dossier, prepared by  Christopher Steele for the opposition research firm Fusion GPS and paid  for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee.   As Senator Graham and I described in our criminal referral of  Christopher Steele earlier this year, this dossier was used by the FBI  to help justify a FISA warrant to surveil a Trump campaign volunteer.   I am proud of the role that the committee has played in bringing  additional details about these events into public view, both through  the criminal referral of Steele and through the official release of the  committee's interview of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, which took  place last August.   My oversight work on this committee has also been bipartisan. Ranking  Member Feinstein and I shared equally in the questioning of witnesses  involved in the Trump Tower meeting, and we worked together to release  the results of the Committee's investigation in May of this year.   Even though I am chairman of Judiciary, my oversight focus extended  to health care related matters.   Nonprofit hospitals have been a particular concern.   One nonprofit chain, called Mosaic Life-Care, had been suing low- income patients for debts that should have been covered by the  hospital. Tax-exempt hospitals cannot be in the business of profiting  off poor people.   After a 16-month inquiry, Mosaic finally changed its ways and  approved debt forgiveness for over 3,000 patients. That debt  forgiveness was worth approximately $16.9 million.   And when Iowans began contacting me about the rising cost of EpiPen,  I began to investigate. In 2007, a pack of two EpiPens cost $100. By  2016, the cost exploded to $600.   In a nutshell, Mylan had classified the EpiPen as a generic under the  Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rather than a brand name drug.   Because of this incorrect classification, Mylan only had to pay a 13- percent rebate instead of a 23.1-percent rebate.   I asked the Health and Human Services inspector general to look into  these practices.   The inspector general found that the taxpayers may have overpaid for  the EpiPen by as much as $1.27 billion over 10 years because of the  incorrect classification.   Eventually, Mylan settled a False Claims Act case with the Justice  Department for $465 million. Upon learning of that settlement, I  expressed my disappointment that it didn't seem the taxpayers had been  made whole.   On August 16, 2018, the FDA finally approved a generic EpiPen, which  gives consumers more purchasing options.   Simply stated, oversight works.   I also investigated, with Senator Wyden, Gilead's pricing decisions  for its hepatitis C drugs--Sovaldi and Harvoni. Our joint report was a  ground-level view of how a drug is priced and what steps some drug  companies will take to maximize profit possibly to the detriment of  patients in need.   Nursing home social media abuse has also been a focus of mine.   New technologies offer new ways for bad conduct to occur. Steps ought  to be taken to stop that.   After extensive communication with CMS about these issues, the  government issued a guideline that made clear that compromising photos  and recordings of residents is a form of abuse.   But, we didn't stop there.   After reading reports about spending and management problems at the  Wounded Warrior Project, I looked into that too.   Reports had shown Wounded Warrior was not spending 80.6 percent of  their programs expenses on veterans in fiscal year 2014. My  investigation found that Wounded Warrior had been incorporating donated  media and millions of dollars in fundraising to get to that 80.6  percent. A more accurate figure is about 68 percent.   Americans want the Wounded Warrior Project to be successful, and if  its current leaders are listening to this, I want to reiterate my best  wishes that it help as many veterans as possible.   I have also taken a keen interest in the Red Cross over the years.   Most recently, after reports of mismanaged spending after the  earthquake in Haiti, I decided it was time to look under the hood.   What I found was troubling, to say the least.   My inquiry found that the Red Cross did not track costs on a project  by project basis; instead, it used a complex and inaccurate process to  track spending. The Red Cross was simply unable to provide the exact  cost of each project and program in Haiti.   Worst yet, my inquiry found that the head of the Red Cross attempted  to terminate a review by the Government Accountability Office and lied  about it. I will continue to keep my eye on the Red Cross.   During my time as chairman of Judiciary, I have also conducted  extensive oversight of our broken immigration system.   For every major terror attack on American soil by a foreign national,  I reviewed just how the perpetrators entered the country in the first  place. What I found was that often these terrorists and other criminals  would lie or conceal information on their visa applications to enter  the country.   They often knew which visas to exploit to commit their crimes, which  ranged from espionage, to theft of trade secrets, to trafficking.   The committee has also looked into how Homeland Security and State  vet refugees, monitored the mass migration caravans, reviewed hundreds  of pages of visa and immigration documents, and repeatedly raised  concerns with the controversial EB-5 investor visa program.   When Congress created the program, the goal was to spur growth for  rural and underserved areas. Now, the EB-5 program has become an often  illicit funding source for big-moneyed interests in some of the largest  cities around the country. It is no surprise that the Fraud Detection  and National Security Directorate also raised national security  concerns about the program.   Since 2016, I have written eight letters, held three hearings, and  introduced legislation to remedy the glaring problems that plague this  program.   I wait with anticipation on the EB-5 modernization and reform  regulations the Department of Homeland Security promises to publish  very soon.   These are but a few examples of what I have tried to do right by the  people of Iowa and the taxpaying public.   Being chairman of the Judiciary Committee has been a rewarding  experience, one that I will cherish as some of the most productive  years of my career representing the great people and State of Iowa.   I look forward to continuing my oversight work both as chairman of  Finance and as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee in the next  Congress.   After all, as experience has shown, oversight works, and I will  continue to fight the good fight on behalf of ``We the people.''                            ____________________
