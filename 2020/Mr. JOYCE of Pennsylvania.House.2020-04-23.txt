 Madam Speaker, all of us want our small  businesses to survive this economic crisis. All of us want to save  American livelihoods. All of us want to get Americans back to work.   For weeks, I have talked to workers, small business owners, farmers  in Pennsylvania who are counting on the Paycheck Protection Act.   Today, we are offering these Pennsylvanians an opportunity to keep  their workers paid and emerge stronger on the other side of this  unprecedented challenge by protecting our workforce and safeguarding  our economy.   Truly these are difficult days, but we know there is light ahead.   The people of Pennsylvania are resilient. The people of our great  Nation are resilient. Together, we will weather the storm.   We cannot allow a virus to destroy the American Dream.                                time  1230
