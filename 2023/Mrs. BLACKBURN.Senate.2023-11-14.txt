 Mr. President, I ask that we vitiate the quorum call.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we  vitiate the quorum call so we can move to the funding of--the Israel  funding bill from the House.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hagerty  and myself, I want to congratulate our friend Butch Spyridon on his  induction into the JA Nashville Business Hall of Fame.   Before he retired this summer, Butch served for 32 years as the top  executive of the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp, NCVC. Under  his leadership, the NCVC transformed Music City into the commerce,  tourism, and entertainment hub it is today. Before Butch, the country  music lovers who crowd the famous honky-tonks of lower Broadway and the  classical music lovers who fill the Schermerhorn made their pilgrimages  to other destinations. Before Butch, corporations and nonprofits chose  other conference destinations; now, they compete for space at the Music  City Center. Today, music historians drawn to the city by the Bluebird  Cafe, RCA Studio B, and the Ryman Auditorium can also explore the  National Museum of African American Music, the Gospel Music Hall of  Fame, and the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum because Butch  understood the cultural importance of these interconnected genres. He  was a vital part of recruiting the city's professional sports teams and  pushed the effort to build massive sports complexes where they could  play. He turned Independence Day and New Year's Eve celebrations into  major tourism spectacles and, in 2019, welcomed the NFL Draft to lower  Broadway, the most successful draft event in League history.   In 2023, Butch received the 100th star on the Music City Walk of Fame  for his unparalleled contributions to the economic and cultural success  of Nashville, TN. It is our privilege to congratulate him once more on  this latest, greatest honor: Hall of Fame Laureate.  [[Page S5502]]                                ____________________
