 Madam Speaker, today, I urge my colleagues to pass the  Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act, which will close a loophole  that blocks pharmaceutical competition and prevents innovative  treatments for opioid abuse disorders from coming to the market.   The opioid crisis in this country, as you know, is very serious, and  the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the problem. Because the  pandemic and all of its underlying issues--fear of the virus, increased  economic hardship, and the challenges of staying at home and  maintaining a safe distance--opioid abuse disorders are skyrocketing,  and the epidemic has taken a toll on communities in every corner of the  country.   I am proud to co-lead this piece of legislation and that our  Democratic majority pushed ahead with bringing it to the floor again  for a vote amid last week's partisan attempts to hold this legislation  hostage, because fighting the opioid epidemic cannot wait any longer.   In the past 20 years, we have seen a drastic increase in opioid  addiction, with nearly every State in the Nation seeing a spike in  overdose deaths. Passing our Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act  will help curb the senseless loss of life by expanding treatment  options and driving down costs of new medicines.                            ____________________
