 Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor, I rise in  support of H. Res. 432, and I want to commend my good friend and  colleague, Mr. Kildee, for his leadership on this issue. I also want to  commend the incredible work of Chairman Engel for all he has done on  this issue, as well as Chairwoman Bass and Mr. Bilirakis and others  here.   Mr. Speaker, I am here today to express my unwavering support for the  people of Sudan in their long-held desire to live in a democratic  nation, a nation where all the Sudanese people live in dignity and  where their rights and freedoms are respected and protected.   For three decades, the people of Sudan have suffered under the  brutal, genocidal regime of Omar al-Bashir. They were murdered,  mutilated, bombed, starved, imprisoned, tortured, and raped by Bashir's  army, air force, police, intelligence unit, and paramilitary allies,  formerly known as the Janjaweed and now organized as the Sudanese Rapid  Support Forces.   Villages were burned to the ground, churches destroyed, radio  stations and the press shut down, protests violently repressed, and  food and medicine denied to populations at risk.   Last December, the people of Sudan rose up in massive protests across  the  [[Page H5792]]  country and said: Enough. No more. The time for change is now.   On April 11, Bashir was removed from office by the Sudanese military.  But instead of turning the government over to the civilian-led council,  they took power for themselves.   On May 16, 92 Members of Congress sent a bipartisan, bicameral letter  to the administration expressing support for a civilian-led transition  in Sudan and concern about the military's escalating violence against  the peaceful protesters, which I include in the Record.                                  Congress of the United States,                                       Washington, DC, May 16, 2019.      Hon. Mike Pompeo,      Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State,      Washington, DC.      Steven Mnuchin,      Secretary of the Treasury, U.S. Department of the Treasury,           Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mnuchin: We write to       express our deep concern about the current situation in Sudan       and our support for a rapid transfer of power to a civilian-      led transitional government committed to laying the       foundations for democracy in the country. This is a critical       moment for Sudan, one that came about because the Sudanese       people took to the streets to demand it. It is also critical       for the United States to support Sudanese citizen's demands       for real democratic change.        We welcome the April 18th statement by the State Department       supporting ``a transition to a peaceful and democratic Sudan       led by civilians who represent the diversity of Sudanese       society,'' and expressing support for the ``will of the       Sudanese people'' for ``a transitional government that is       inclusive and respectful of human rights and the rule of       law.'' We appreciate the efforts of the Africa Bureau to       update congressional offices about the changing situation in       Sudan. We also acknowledge the African Union's condemnation       of the military takeover as a coup d'etat and its demand that       the military ``step aside and hand over power to a       transitional civilian-led political authority, in accordance       with the will of the people'' by June 3rd. We also welcome       U.S. efforts to bring together like-minded nations and donors       to emphasize international support for a civilian-led       transition.        The military leadership who have taken power are attempting       to create the appearance of change, but elements and       structures of the old regime remain. The Transitional       Military Council (TMC) does not meet the aspirations so       clearly articulated by months of peaceful pro-democracy       protests that demanded an inclusive, civilian-led democratic       change. A government dominated by the military is not the       goal of the Sudanese people and the longer the protestors'       demands remain unfulfilled, there is increased probability of       conflict like the violence against protestors, deaths and       injuries that occurred this week.        We support your decision to continue Sudan's designation as       a State Sponsor of Terrorism (SST) and to suspend Phase II       discussions. Congress also has a role to play in law       regarding changes to Sudan's status as a state sponsor of       terrorism. We encourage close consultation with and the       consent of Congress should the Administration seek to alter       the SST designation or provide further economic relief to       Sudan, actions which at the current moment would be       inappropriate and premature. We understand that rapidly       changing events on the ground might require a corresponding       change in U.S. policy and we are ready to work as equal       partners in decisions that advance civilian democratic       governance, respect for human rights, including religious       freedom, and rule of law.        The United States must send a clear message that the path       to international credibility and American partnership will       only come through credible civilian leadership. We encourage       you to use all mechanisms and leverage to facilitate, as       quickly as possible, an inclusive civilian-led transition to       democratic governance. The United States should make clear to       foreign governments that have expressed support for the TMC       that a civilian transition that reflects the will of the       Sudanese people is nonnegotiable.        In this regard, we are dismayed by the announcement from       the Governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates       (UAE) that they intend to provide Sudan with $3 billion in       budget support and aid. We urge you to use all appropriate       diplomatic and political channels to discourage such a       transfer of funds. If funds are disbursed, this will likely       encourage the TMC to delay a civilian-led transition.        The Sudanese people will rightly determine matters of       justice regarding the crimes of the previous regime, given       the millions of people who suffered and perished under its       deliberate and repressive actions. It is important for you,       Mr. Secretaries, to emphasize that former President Bashir       and other officials and military officers of his regime are       internationally indicted for war crimes, crimes against       humanity and the crime of genocide. It is an urgent matter of       international law that they face trial and judgement on these       charges.        There are additional actions that we strongly encourage you       to take in your respective capacities as Secretary of State       and Secretary of the Treasury:        When a civilian-led transitional council is established--      one supported by the pro-democracy movement and the Sudanese       people--it is vital that the United States press for       unimpeded access by international humanitarian aid agencies       so that they may finally deliver, without interference or       conditions, emergency relief to populations in conflict areas       such as South Kordofan, Blue Nile and northern Darfur. We       understand this is also a current priority for the U.S. and       other aid donors, but unobstructed delivery of humanitarian       aid to these regions is likely to remain stalled until       inclusive civilian rule is established.        To support and increase the capacity of civilian leadership       and civil society, the United States should provide       transitional civilian authorities and entities with technical       and capacity-building assistance.        The United States, in consultation with Congress, should       signal its willingness to engage with and support       international financial institutions in aiding Sudan once       civilian-led transitional authorities are in place and       functioning.        The State Department should not issue visas to any Sudanese       official to travel to the United States until credible       civilian-led government is in place and functioning       independently. Nor should any Sudanese or TMC official be       issued a visa who has been internationally indicted, or who       might be subject to justice in Sudan for war crimes, crimes       against humanity or genocide.        Treasury, in consultation with the State Department and       relevant congressional committees, should continue to use the       sanctions authorities provided under the Global Magnitsky       program to target key Sudanese individuals, officials,       entities and networks.        Recognizing Sudan's extensive corruption, money-laundering       operations and theft of state resources, it is critical for       the United State to provide leadership on preventing funds       from being moved out of the country during this period when       the former Bashir regime is being pushed aside but current       regime structures remain in place. The Treasury Department       should issue public advisories to banks and other financial       institutions regarding the risk of such capital flight and       other high-risk transactions from Sudan, such as the gold       trade. This would be an action like the one taken by Treasury       in 2014 related to Ukraine. It is also critical that the       Treasury Department continue to track and respond       aggressively to similar transfers of funds that occurred       prior to Bashir's downfall.        Thank you for your attention to these urgent concerns and       recommendations. We look forward to working together and       developing a new policy framework consistent with American       values and the aspirations of the Sudanese people.

Just 2  weeks later, in a clear demonstration of how little has changed, the  Sudanese police and RSF, under the leadership of the Transitional  Military Council's second in command, General Hemeti violently attacked  the unarmed protesters, killing, wounding, and raping hundreds.   In an act of great cowardice and complicity, the Sudanese military  chose to withdraw from the scene or stood by and watched the attack,  doing nothing to protect the people. The Transitional Military Council  then shut down the internet so information about the massacre couldn't  come out. Last week,  [[Page H5793]]  they were forced to restore the internet, and the world has now seen  hundreds of videos documenting this heinous crime.   On Saturday, thousands demonstrated to mark the 40 days since the  deadly crackdown. Right now, African mediators are attempting to broker  the details of a power-sharing agreement between the forces of freedom  and change people's alliance in the Transitional Military Council.   I hope that they are successful in reaching a deal that guarantees a  genuine civilian-led transition and democratic governance, but I don't  want to see the civilian-led democratic reform movement undermined and  forced to accept a bad deal, one where power and the corrupt and brutal  structures of the former regime remain under military control.   Mr. Speaker, like so many of my colleagues, I have been engaged on  the issue of Sudan for nearly 15 years. On April 28, 2006, I led  Members of Congress, religious, and NGO leaders in an act of civil  disobedience at the Sudanese Embassy to highlight the atrocities taking  place in Darfur. It was my first of three such direct actions.   On May 1 of that year, I joined over 50 of those people on The  National Mall to protest the genocide in Darfur. I took my young son  and daughter to see how people from all walks of life came together in  solidarity with the people of Sudan and demanded action.   Mr. Speaker, my children are now grown and in college, so I am not  exaggerating when I say that what we are seeing happening today in  Sudan is a once-in-a-generation moment for the people of Sudan. We  cannot be silent.   Along with all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I want  the people of Sudan to know that we stand with them, that we have  always stood with them, and I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2037. I am very proud  to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I want to commend the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Malinowski), my good friend and colleague, for his  long commitment to human rights and his leadership on this issue. I  also want to thank Chairman Engel for working to ensure that this bill  came before the House for consideration.   Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly 10 months since Jamal Khashoggi, a  Saudi dissident, journalist for The Washington Post, and former general  manager and editor-in-chief of Al-Arab News Channel entered the Saudi  Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, and was never, ever again seen. He was  assassinated by agents of the Saudi Arabian Government. Despite having  arrested some of its own security personnel for this crime, the Saudi  Government continues to refuse to disclose the location of Khashoggi's  remains.   In June, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial,  summary or arbitrary executions concluded that Khashoggi was ``the  victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial  killing for which the State of Saudi Arabia is responsible.''   She called the trial in Saudi Arabia of the 11 suspects to be  suspended, saying it would ``not deliver credible accountability.''   ``The trial is held behind closed doors. The identity of those  charged has not been released nor is the identity of those facing the  death penalty. At the time of writing, at least one of those identified  as responsible for the planning and organizing of the execution of Mr.  Khashoggi has not been charged,'' she noted.   She also found there was ``credible evidence that Saudi Crown Prince  Mohammad bin Salman and other high-level officials were individually  liable.''   Not surprisingly, the Saudi Government, which denies the Prince was  involved, has rejected the report. Meanwhile, despite all the  international handwringing and denunciations, there has been little  effective international response.   This bill requires an intelligent assessment on responsibility for  Jamal Khashoggi's murder, and it would sanction those named by imposing  Magnitsky-style sanctions against them.   It also requires the Secretary of State to provide Congress with a  report on Saudi Arabia's human rights record, which, personally, I find  to be among the most egregious in the world.   Mr. Speaker, the U.S., Canada, France, and the U.K. all levied some  level of sanctions against 18 Saudis allegedly linked to the killing.  The Saudi Crown Prince is not among them. Germany, Finland, and Denmark  have canceled arms deals with Saudi Arabia. The U.K. was also forced to  cancel its armed sales to the Saudi Government, under court order.   The Senate and the House have voted to condemn Jamal Khashoggi's  murder and to end U.S. armed sales to Saudi Arabia because of Saudi  Arabia's role in the Yemen civil war.   President Trump has chosen to ignore the will of Congress, going so  far as to invoke an imaginary emergency in order to continue selling  arms to the Saudis. The Senate has voted to overturn those arms sales  by passing resolutions of disapproval, which the House will consider  later this week or next. I have introduced a bill in the House, H.R.  643, that would end U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia.   Now is the time for the House to act strongly and definitely. There  must be consequences for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Such a heinous  crime must not be met with impunity. H.R. 2037 is an appropriate step  in ensuring that those responsible are named and held accountable.   Again, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and  urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.
