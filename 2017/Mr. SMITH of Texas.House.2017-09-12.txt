 Mr. Speaker, President Trump's recent decision to  end the unconstitutional DACA program has received unfair criticism by  the liberal media.   When reporting on President Trump's decision to end the DACA program,  outlets such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CBS all  included former President Obama's criticism of the announcement. What  is not being reported is that then-President Obama stated over 20 times  before issuing DACA that executive amnesty is an overstep of executive  authority and is unconstitutional.   To use former President Obama's criticism of the termination of DACA  without also noting that he, himself, considered DACA unconstitutional  is biased reporting designed to promote a pro-amnesty agenda. It is no  wonder that the media's credibility with the American people is now at  a record low.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 314, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $30,200,000) (increased by $30,200,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Smith) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I support this bill and endorse  division C, the CJS appropriations bill developed by Chairman  Culberson. The appropriations included in division C implement the  Science Committee's authorizations that have been enacted into law or  passed by the House.   I offer an amendment today to simply increase physical and biological  science research by one-half of 1 percent, or $30.2 million, over the  current funding within the $6 billion National Science Foundation  research account. Total spending is not increased, as NSF will adjust  other areas of spending accordingly.   I ask the chairman and members to support the amendment and endorse  this increase for the basic research that produces the scientific  breakthroughs that fuel technological innovation, new industries,  economic growth, and good jobs.   I yield to the chairman, Chairman Culberson, for his support of this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Culberson for his  support and very much appreciate his help along the way.   On a separate matter, can the chairman assure me that the funding in  the bill is fully consistent with the Tsunami Warning, Education, and  Research Act enacted into law earlier this year?    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas,  the chairman of the subcommittee, for his support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).   The amendment was agreed to.              Amendment No. 113 Offered by Mr. Scott of Virginia    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 113  printed in House Report 115-297.
