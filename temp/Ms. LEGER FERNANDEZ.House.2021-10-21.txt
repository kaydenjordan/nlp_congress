 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, we are here today to talk about the  importance of this historic moment indeed, this historic moment of  where we will be investing--investing in our children, investing in our  planet, investing in our future. We are talking about the Build Back  Better agenda.   I want to begin by talking about my district, which is made up of  beautifully diverse rural communities. My district is the size of  Pennsylvania, but my communities in this district are rich in culture  and rich in love. You know what? They have also been historically left  behind with little investments made to improve their lives and to allow  them to thrive.   New Mexican values are rooted in caring for each other. We know that  we invest in what we care about. We know we invest in what we believe  in. Well, we must invest in addressing the climate crisis because, in  my district, we know that agua es vida, water is life. Our farmers and  ranchers are depending on us to act and preserve their water resources.   Communities along our rivers, along our acequias, need us to pass a  Build Back Better plan that tackles the crisis head-on so that we can  preserve the water flowing from our mountains and cascading along our  streams for decades to come--to feed our ranchers, to feed our farmers,  and to quench our thirst.   In these same communities, people often come back home to care for  their loved ones, their parents and grandparents. I have heard their  stories. We asked them: Why did you come back? It is because there was  nobody else available to care for my grandmother. There was nobody else  to care for my tia. And we know that that care is a full-time job on  its own.   What does it take to go to work in rural America? It is more than  just roads and bridges. It is comprehensive paid family and medical  care. It is investments in long-term care and affordable childcare.                                time  1630    In my State, 53 percent of people live in a childcare desert.  Seventy-one percent of rural families live in areas without enough  licensed childcare providers. We can change that.   The Build Back Better plan must invest in our rural communities. We  are talking about empowering rural regions, including our Tribal  nations, with the resources to grow their economies, expanding access  to affordable healthcare, lowering prescription drug prices, and making  housing affordable. We can do this for our communities now. We can make  this happen. We made progress with the American Rescue Plan, but we  cannot stop there. We must build back better.   It is not good enough to go back to where we were, because we know  that where we were wasn't good enough. So  [[Page H5771]]  we need to make sure that the child tax credit does not run out. We  cannot kick our children out who came out of poverty. Fifty percent of  the children in poverty in my State came out, and I am not willing to  tell them: I am sorry, the clock struck 12, and you must go back into  living in poverty.   No. We must include an expansion extension of the child tax credit in  the Build Back Better Act.   Mr. Speaker, those children who were living in poverty are coming  out. We also need to make sure that those children in rural America get  their early pre-K that they need, and that is what Build Back Better  will do.   So the question I ask is simple: Do we want to keep an economy that  serves only the wealthiest people and corporations?   Or do we finally give our families a fair shot to truly thrive?   As I said, we invest in the things we believe in. Well, we believe in  our youngest children. We believe in our workers. We believe in the  promise that lies in each of our communities.   I am glad to be on the floor with my Progressive Caucus colleagues  this evening to shine the light on the brilliance of the Build Back  Better agenda.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so much for  her words. I do think it is important to remember what it actually  means for a family.    In New Mexico, the average cost of infant care is $8,617. That makes  New Mexico one of 33 States and D.C. where infant care is more  expensive than college. The Build Back Better plan will limit that to 7  percent of your income.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson  Coleman) on Build Back Better and what we have been fighting for and  why we must get this done.    Mr. Speaker, I would also note that when we  adjust for the climate, we are also creating jobs. We anticipate there  will be 763,000 green jobs available to our communities when we pass  Build Back Better and address the climate crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Newman).    Mr. Speaker, I want to just touch on a few  points.   The gentlewoman mentioned the need for immigration. I would point out  that when we pass our comprehensive immigration reform, we would have a  $1.4 trillion benefit to our economy. We need immigrants to help care  for us. They help feed us. They are part of our communities, and the  Build Back Better Act, as the House is looking at it, includes  immigration reform.   Today, I was also reminded, during the remarks on something else,  what today is. Today is sadly, and I say sadly, today is Latina Equal  Pay Day.                                time  1645    I have introduced a resolution to acknowledge that it is Latina Equal  Pay Day, and what that tells us is that it has taken this long, into  the fall, into October, before a Latina earns the same as a White man.  That is simply wrong. And the other thing we know is that Latinas in  the recession, the shecession, that was caused by that pandemic, 20  percent unemployment, the childcare that my colleagues are talking  about, that would help those women get back to work. That would help  them when we make sure that they are also paid what they deserve for  the work they do, taking care of our children, putting food on our  plates, and just taking care of those we love.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley),  somebody who I have always looked up to and learned much from.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so much for  bringing to light and describing those individuals for whom we are  working today, but it is they who are us. We are part of their  communities and they have been telling us these stories and we are  responding now because now is the time for us to act.   I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Barragan), who  cosponsored the resolution I spoke of earlier for the Latina Equal Pay  Day. We care for each other. That is why we look after each other.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Representative for her  courage. She has raised the issues of environmental injustice since the  day I met her. I know she raised them and she leads them in the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and she has now described what it means  on the ground, what it means in terms of jobs, but also what it means  in terms of the life that you live, the air that you breathe. Because  we know that in our communities, our communities of color suffer from  higher rates of asthma. And when something like COVID comes about that  ravages the lungs when they have already been damaged, it hurts. And  that is why we saw the level of death and despair in the communities of  color, in the Native American communities and the Latino communities.   I would also point out that climate change is costly. When they don't  want to spend $3.7 trillion, or $2.5 trillion, let's remember that  failure to address climate change will lead to world instability. It is  estimated that we would lose $23 trillion, a $23 trillion impact on our  economy, our world economy by failing to address this.   I don't want to pass over the impact in terms of the creating jobs  for the people in our community, for the people in America. We know  that we are now coming back. The pandemic is hard. We are still pushing  out of it. Today we heard some great jobs numbers. 290,000 is below  what they had projected so we are feeling good. We know that the  pandemic is something that we are working on, that this President has  done such a great job working with Congress on that.   But still, it is estimated that the Build Back Better agenda would  create 4 million jobs. That is 1.1 million caregiving jobs. That is not  just a number. That is somebody that you are going to take your baby  to. And you know that what we are going to do is make sure that that  caregiver has the  [[Page H5774]]  kind of training that she needs or he needs to provide the best quality  care; that because we are providing assistance, that their caregiver is  going to be receiving the kind of pay that she or he deserves because  they are providing the most valuable thing to you. They are caring for  the most precious resource, our children. And that is what Build Back  Better will do.                                time  1700    It will also create 556,000 manufacturing jobs, and those are going  to be jobs with prevailing wages, good-paying jobs. That is what we  need. When we talk about needing to bring manufacturing back, let's  grow it here. And if you are for manufacturing in America, you have got  to be for the Build Back Better Act, because that is going to create a  half billion jobs. That is a lot of jobs.   But what does that job mean? It means that there is somebody who is  going to go to work, who has a family, or wants to start a family, and  is going to be able to buy a home. But we know that buying a home is  hard. So the Build Back Better Act is going to provide assistance for  those first-time home buyers. Because we know that the hardest thing  for buying a home is having that down payment, and we have down payment  assistance in the Build Back Better Act. That is what we are going to  be bringing.   We have looked at what are the different levers of our economy that  make a difference that are infrastructure, that help a community  thrive, not just survive. That is what is in the Build Back Better Act,  because we want our communities to thrive, not just survive.   Construction jobs, 312,000 construction jobs, doing the things that  we need in America, building those bridges, building those health  clinics, building those schools and those businesses. Because it takes  all of that; it takes an investment in us.   And we do pay for it. There is not a dime--this is not about debt,  because it is all paid for and it is paid for first by going after  those who fail to pay their taxes, even when due. So, tax cheats, yes,  we are going to make you pay your taxes, because that is only fair. We  are going to make those corporations who have paid less in taxes than  my child's schoolteacher, we are going to make them pay their fair  share.   Not a single family that is earning less than $450,000 a year--so if  you are earning half a million dollars a year, then you will see a  small increase in your taxes.   But if any of you are outside listening to this and saying, what will  it do to my tax burden? If you are earning less than a half a million  dollars a year, you are going to be just fine. In fact, you are going  to have a tax refund, because we have the child tax credit in there. We  are lowering taxes for working families and middle-class families.   We know that when we invest in creating jobs that pay fair wages,  that include benefits like healthcare, paid family and medical leave,  and retirement, we will help more people get those jobs and keep those  jobs. Because when they are able to go home and help somebody they love  who is ill in their family, then they don't have to leave that job.  That is what we should be caring about.   So when is the time to get this done? As I say in my Nuevo Mexico,  ahora es cuando; it is time now to get this done. Because that is  right, that is good for our communities, it is good for America, it is  good for our women, and it is good for our planet.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
