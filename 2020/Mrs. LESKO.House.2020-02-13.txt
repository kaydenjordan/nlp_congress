 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my home State of  Arizona's birthday and our 108th anniversary of statehood.   Since February 14, 1912, the great State of Arizona has welcomed  those who wish to experience a life of prosperity, opportunity, growth,  and a culture second to none.   Every year people from all the over the world come to Arizona to  experience our State's treasured beauty, and, of course, the five C's.   I know I speak for all of us who live in Arizona when I say we are  incredibly grateful to call the Grand Canyon State our home. Our State  motto means ``God Enriches.'' Arizona is proof of that.

But I oppose this bill for three  reasons.   First, the bill is not constitutional. When the ERA originally passed  Congress, it explicitly set a deadline for ratification. The deadline  was in 1979, almost 41 years ago. Only 35 States of the 38 needed had  ratified it. Then five States unratified it. So the count is down to  30. Thus, the equal rights amendment was dead.   The U.S. Department of Justice issued a legal opinion just last  month, reiterating that the ERA's ratification timeline is expired.   Supreme Court Justice Ruth Ginsburg said:         The deadline passed. I would like to see a new beginning. I       would like it to start over.    Secondly, the ERA is not necessary. Women's equality of rights under  the law is already recognized in our Constitution in the Fifth and 14th  Amendments. The ACLU's women's rights director wrote: ``It has been  clearly understood that the 14th Amendment prohibits discrimination  based on sex.'' Plus, many Federal, State, and local laws already  prohibit sex discrimination.   The third reason I oppose this bill: If ratified, the ERA would be  used by pro-abortion groups to undo pro-life legislation and lead to  more abortions and taxpayer funding of abortions.   But don't take my word for it. Let's look at what pro-abortion groups  have done and what they say.   In 1998, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the  State's ERA required the State to fund abortions. NARAL Pro-Choice  America, which supports abortions, asserted that the ERA would  reinforce the constitutional right to abortion and would require judges  to strike down anti-abortion laws.   In a 2019 letter to the House Judiciary Committee, the ACLU stated:  The equal rights amendment could provide an additional layer of  protection against restrictions on abortion.   In conclusion, this bill is unconstitutional. The ERA is unnecessary,  since constitutional Federal, State, and local laws already guarantee  equal protections. And the ERA, if ratified, would be used by pro- abortion groups to undo pro-life laws.
