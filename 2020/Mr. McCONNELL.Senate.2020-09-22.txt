 Madam President, I explained yesterday how moving  ahead on a vote on the forthcoming Supreme Court nomination will be  consistent with both history and precedent.   When an election-year nomination to fill an election-year vacancy  occurs in a divided government, with a Senate and a President of  different parties, the historical norm is that such nominations are not  confirmed. But the times this has happened after the American people  have elected a Senate majority to work alongside the same-party  President, every such nominee has been confirmed, save one bizarre  exception of a nominee who had corrupt financial dealings. Let me say  that again. Except for Justice Abe Fortas and his ethical scandals,  every single nomination in American history made under our present  circumstances has ended in a confirmation--seven out of eight.   That is the thing about facts and history. Angry rhetoric does not  change them. Partisan finger-pointing does not alter them. Facts simply  exist. They are there for everyone to see. History and precedent were  on this Senate majority's side in 2016, and they are overwhelmingly on  our side now.   If we go on to confirm this nomination after a careful process, then  both in 2016 and in 2020, this Senate will simply have provided the  typical, normal outcome in each scenario. Think about that fact and  then weigh it against the outcry and hysteria that has already erupted  on the far left.   Yesterday, the Democratic leader announced on the floor that if the  Senate holds a vote on the forthcoming nomination it would ``spell the  end of this supposedly great deliberative body.'' Spell the end of this  supposedly great deliberative body? That is what he said. It would be  the death of the Senate if a duly elected majority of the U.S. Senate  exercises its advice and consent power as it sees fit. That is what  Senates do. It is our job description. Presidents makes nominations as  they see fit, and Senate majorities either provide or withhold advice  and consent as we see fit. But now our Democratic colleagues tell us  that the Senate doing normal senatorial things would ``spell the end''  of this institution--whatever that may mean.   The Democratic leader is not alone in these pronouncements. Chairman  Jerry Nadler of the House Judiciary Committee has already announced  that if the Senate majority dares to act like  [[Page S5734]]  a Senate majority, future Democrats should ``immediately move to expand  the Supreme Court.''   From another colleague:         If [they hold] a vote in 2020, we pack the court in 2021.       It's that simple.    Speaker Pelosi intimated on television last weekend that she may  consider launching a new frivolous impeachment simply to tie up the  Senate's time. She said: ``We have our options.''   The junior Senator from Massachusetts said Democrats ``must abolish  the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court.''   The junior Senator for Hawaii said: ``All of those matters will be on  the agenda.''   The senior Senator from Connecticut said: ``Nothing is off the  table.''   Just yesterday, former Vice President Biden himself refused to rule  out that he might seek to pack the Supreme Court.   Bear in mind, none of them assert this majority would be breaking any  Senate rule by holding this vote; it is just that our Democratic  friends worry they might not like the outcome.   For some reason, they cannot bear to see Republicans governing within  the rules as Republicans--doing exactly what Americans elected us to  do. So they threaten to wreck the makeup of the Senate if they lose a  vote and to wreck the structure of the Court if somebody is confirmed  whom they oppose.   It has been interesting to watch our colleagues try to recast their  disturbing threats as somehow tied to this Supreme Court vacancy. No  one should fall for this trick. Democrats have already been threatening  these actions for months. This isn't anything new.   Our colleagues now say that ``nothing'' would be ``off the table'' if  a new Justice were to be confirmed. They want badly for people to  believe these are new threats that Democrats would take off the table-- would take off the table--if Republicans would just help them sink  President Trump's nominee. Let me say that again. They want badly for  people to believe these are new threats that Democrats would take off  the table if Republicans would just help them sink President Trump's  nominee.   Let me read another quotation. This is the junior Senator from  California speaking, our distinguished colleague who is now running for  Vice President:         We are on the verge of a crisis of confidence in the       Supreme Court. We have to take this challenge head on, and       everything is on the table to do that.    Sound familiar? Of course it does. Our colleague made that remark in  March of 2019--in March of 2019.   These threats are not new. They have nothing to do with this new  vacancy. Democrats have already been playing this game for more than a  year and a half.   It was more than a year ago that several Senate Democrats threatened  the Supreme Court in a written brief. They said: ``The Court is not  well [and] perhaps the Court can heal itself before the public demands  it be `restructured.' ''   It was more than a year ago that Democrats, competing for their  party's Presidential nomination, made court-packing a central element  in their platforms.   It was more than 6 months ago that the Democratic leader appeared  across the street outside the Court and threatened specific Justices if  they did not rule his way.   For goodness' sake, the junior Senator from Maryland came right out  and admitted this yesterday. Someone asked him whether he would support  these acts of institutional vandalism if a nominee is confirmed this  year, and he helpfully pointed out: ``I've always said I'm open, even  before this seat opened . . . [those] possibilities were on the table  before we got to this point,'' thereby proving my point.   These threats are not new. They have nothing to do with this vacancy.   Our friend the junior Senator from Delaware said on television this  Sunday that he wants to persuade Republicans to forgo filling this  vacancy, but all the way back in June--long before 5 days ago--he  himself notably refused to rule out breaking the Senate's rules to kill  the filibuster.   There is no degree to which rewarding these threats would buy the  Nation any relief from this. There is nothing you can give them to stop  all the threats. There is no ``deal'' that would stop these dangerous  tactics. Giving in to political blackmail would not do a thing to  secure our institutions. You do not put a stop to irresponsible  hostage-taking by making hostage-taking a winning strategy.   I will tell you what really could threaten our system of government.  It is not Senate Republicans doing legitimate things squarely within  the Senate rules and within the Constitution that Democrats happen to  dislike--no, no. What could really threaten our system is if one of our  two major parties continues to pretend the whole system is  automatically illegitimate whenever they lose; if they continue to act  like, for their side of the aisle, a legitimate defeat is an oxymoron.  That is the danger to our democracy.   Every one of these attacks on our institutions only underscores how  important they are. Every threat to turn our courts into a political  tug-of-war only reinforces why the Senate is charged with protecting  our independent judiciary and why this majority's work with President  Trump on this task is so crucial.   The President plans to use the power the voters gave him to make a  nomination. Senators will use the power the voters gave us to either  provide or withhold consent as we see fit. The only ones responsible  for those threats will be the people making them.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
