 Mr. Speaker, since before his inauguration last  year, President Trump, his administration, and its allies have tested  the independence and credibility of the FBI.   Since the appointment of Special Counsel Mueller, we have seen these  efforts grow into an apparent attempt to stymie Special Counsel  Mueller's investigation and protect the administration from potentially  being held accountable.   We have seen several pressure tactics employed from the firing of  former FBI Director Comey, the ongoing investigation into the FBI's  investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails, and most recently, reports  of the President's attempt to fire Special Counsel Mueller himself.   This is a clear sign that Congress must act to protect the  independence and integrity of the special counsel's investigation. I  urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to come together in  protecting the special counsel from baseless termination and ensuring  that his investigation can follow the facts wherever they may lead.                            ____________________
