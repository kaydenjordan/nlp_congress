 Madam Speaker, it was a very disappointing recess. I  knew at least three more people who passed away because of the COVID.   For that reason, I was very disappointed in President Biden's  comments earlier today on television, in that I think he could have  brought up things that would have prevented some of these unnecessary  deaths.   First of all, President Trump's COVID was cured by monoclonal  antibodies 16 months ago. Nevertheless, in my district, we have a  shortage of monoclonal antibodies. I have doctors or clinics calling me  wondering where they are. It is a good question.   They were available for the President of the United States 16 months  ago. But, for some reason, President Biden and his team have shortages  of monoclonal antibodies in my district that I am convinced would have  saved some of these lives.   The next thing I will point out is that my doctors tell me that  people are better off if they are taking vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc,  quercetin. All these things would save people's lives if they were  taking them up front before they got the virus.   But again, President Biden gives a big speech. No comments on this;  just let people die.                            ____________________
