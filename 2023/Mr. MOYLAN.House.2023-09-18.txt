 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my colleagues who have  called for an increase in funding for our border security and to remind  the Nation that the U.S. border in Guam ought to be defended, too.   As we continue to discuss and debate solutions to our southern border  crisis, I ask that we not forget to secure all our border cities, from  Brownsville to Hagatna.   Mr. Speaker, Chinese nationals are arriving on the shores of Guam in  droves, often coming in small boats from neighboring islands. Among the  many honest people looking to flee tyranny and find sanctuary on  American soil, it is a known fact that spies have exploited this  insecure border. Security forces at Andersen Air Force Base have told  me on numerous occasions that they have apprehended such intruders.   Citing our low terror threat, the Department of Homeland Security  currently designates less than 1 percent of Homeland Security grant  funding to Guam. The Department of Homeland Security's assessment of  the situation ignores reality and its red flags for national security.   Guam has an extremely permeable border and is facing vigorous efforts  by the CCP to exploit our vulnerabilities. With resources on a scale of  a municipality, Guam must contend with a border crisis caused by the  Chinese state.   Guam needs more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a  more robust Coast Guard presence, and a Federal law enforcement  presence proportional to the scope of the immigration issues,  transnational crime, and military intelligence vulnerabilities on my  island.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot let this moment pass without asking my  colleagues to help me fund the defense of my community. I ask my  colleagues to help me secure the border by securing all of America's  borders.                            ____________________
