 Madam Speaker, this time last year, President Biden  claimed that high prices and rising inflation were temporary; that if  we continued down this administration's path and trusted their  policies, then prices would go down again.   Well, last month's Consumer Price Index score came out and revealed  that inflation has soared to 9.1 percent, the highest rate in 41 years.  So obviously, his statement that inflation was transitory, temporary,  what have you, is false. The numbers aren't bearing up.   Now, the Commerce Department is days away from releasing its first  estimate of the economy's output in the April through June quarter. The  economy already shrank 1.6 percent in the January through March  quarter, and many economists are forecasting another negative output  rate.   Two outputs in a row means that--the ``R'' word, the one that the  Biden administration and his Cabinet don't want to say--it could mean  the recession.   Now, that will validate the feelings of Americans across the country  who are struggling to afford the basic necessities amid rising prices.   Despite record-high prices, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is trying  to spin the definition of a recession, claiming that since our Nation's  unemployment rate isn't that high, then our economy must be doing  great. That is not being felt at home. That is obviously false.   The American people are feeling unprecedented financial pain in all  aspects of their lives. Fuel, electricity, their healthcare, homes,  everything is going up. It is becoming unaffordable for lower-income  and middle-income Americans.   Wholesale prices have surged 11.3 percent. Small business confidence  has dropped to a 48-year low with businesses struggling to hire new  employees and fill open jobs.   These high-up bureaucrats in the Biden administration aren't  suffering the financial consequences that their policies are causing  average Americans. They don't feel them the same as regular people do.   This is the same administration who, when gas prices hit an all-time  high, told people to go out and buy brand new electric vehicles. Sure,  no problem; $50,000 $65,000.   Our Secretary of Transportation says it will require more pain to  benefit electric car drivers and owners at $65,000 vehicles with  Chinese-made replacement battery packs.   Our Nation is facing a recession, meaning that the sales of new  homes, consumer confidence, spending, and real wages are dropping, and  inflation is still rising.   President Biden has allowed the American people and Main Street  businesses to suffer while his reckless spending policies continue to  make things worse. I have heard this firsthand from my own  constituents, real people out there that deal with this every day.   The price of everything at the cash register, at the supermarket, is  all going up, and their wages, effectively, are going down.   In a telephone town hall I hosted recently, I asked participants,  have rising costs impacted your spending habits? Ninety percent said  yes. They can spend less; they can do less.   There are similar figures across the board. A new FOX News poll  revealed that 75 percent of Americans reported experiencing hardship  because of inflation.   We need to work to repair our economy through cutting wasteful  spending, burdensome regulations, our dependence on foreign oil. Why  are we going to Saudi Arabia and asking for their oil when we have so  much in our own backyard, our own energy, that we could make ourselves  completely self-sufficient, as we were a couple of years ago, and help  our allies around the world with that as well.    Focus on things that help the American people, lower-income and  middle-income families especially, instead of helping more illegal  immigrants come to the country; instead of helping China become richer  with more and more of our assets and more of our business.   I keep having to ask the question: President Biden, and your Cabinet,  whose side are you on?                            ____________________
