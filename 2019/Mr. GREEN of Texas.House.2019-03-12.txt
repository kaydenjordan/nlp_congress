 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. I do so today  because I love my country and I believe in what it stands for.   Because I love it and believe in what it stands for, I believe that  my country is worth liberty and justice for all. I believe it is worth  government of the people, by the people, for the people. I believe that  it is worth the belief that all persons are created equal and endowed  by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among them, life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Our country is worth it. And because our country is worth making real  these great and noble American ideals, I do not believe that an unfit  President should be allowed to stay in office.   If we acknowledge that the President is unfit, if we say that he is  causing harm to society, then we have to honor Article II, section 4 of  the Constitution of the United States of America, which calls for the  impeachment of an unfit President who is causing harm to society.   This is where I stood some many, many weeks ago, this is where I  stand now, and I stand here because I love my country.                            ____________________
