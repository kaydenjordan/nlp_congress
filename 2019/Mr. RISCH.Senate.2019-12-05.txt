TRANSMITTAL NO. 20-0A       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(c), AECA)        (i) Purchaser: Government of Italy.        (ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 08-60; Date:       August 1, 2008; Military Department: Air Force.        (iii) Description: On August 1, 2008, Congress was notified       by Congressional certification transmittal number 08-60 of       the possible sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of 4 MQ-9 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), 3       Mobile Ground Control Stations, five years of maintenance       support, engineering support, test equipment, ground support,       operational flight test support, communications equipment,       technical assistance, personnel training/equipment, spare and       repair parts, and other related elements of logistics       support. These UAVs included AN/DPY-1 Synthetic Aperture       Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) systems with       0.3 to 3 meter resolution. The estimated total cost was $330       million. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $50       million of this total.        On November 18, 2009, Congress was notified by       Congressional certification transmittal number 09-60 of the       possible sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of two unarmed MQ-9 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles       (UAVs), one (1) Mobile Ground Control Station, maintenance       support, engineering support, test equipment, ground support,       operational flight test support, communications equipment,       technical assistance, personnel training/equipment, spare and       repair parts, and other related elements of logistics       support. These UAVs included AN/DPY-1 Synthetic Aperture       Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) systems with       0.1 to 3 meter resolution. The estimated total cost was $63       million. MDE constituted $36 million of this total.        On December 17, 2009, Congress was notified by       Congressional certification transmittal number 0C-09 of the       possible sale, under Section 36(b)(5)(a) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of a performance upgrade of the AN/DPY-1 SAR/      GMTI systems aboard the four MQ-9s UAVs previously notified       on transmittal 08-60 from 0.3 to 3 meter resolution to the       same 0.1 to 3 meter resolution of the two MQ-9s notified on       transmittal 09-60. There was no increase in cost of MDE for       this upgrade.        This transmittal reports the addition of Major Defense       Equipment items beyond what was originally notified to       include:        1. Retrofit of five (5) existing MQ-9A Block 1 Unmanned       Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to Block 5;        2. Retrofit of two (2) existing MGCS Block 30;        3. Addition of three (3) MQ-9A Block 5;        4. Addition of eight (8) Multi-Spectral Targeting Systems       (MTS-B) AN/DAS-1A;        5. Addition of eight (8) General Atomics AN/APY-8 Lynx       (exportable) Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving Target       Indicator (SAR/GMTI) Systems, with Maritime Wide Area Search       (MWAS) capability;        6. Addition of two (2) Mobile Ground Control Station (MGCS)       Block 30, and;        7. Addition of twenty-seven (27) Honeywell H-764 Adaptive       Configurable Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial       Guidance Units (EGI) with Selective Availability Anti-      Spoofing Module (SAASM) (24 installed, 3 spares).        The retrofit, addition of aircraft, and inclusion of the       above listed MDE not enumerated in the previous notifications       will result in a net increase in MDE costs of $180 million       and non-MDE cost of $138 million. These notifications       represent the entirety of Italy's MQ-9 program, which will       now increase in value from $393 million to $711 million.        (iv) Significance: As Italy continues with its plans to       develop a robust MQ-9A fleet, it has requested additional       aircraft. Enhancement of Italy's MQ-9A aircraft will provide       strike capability to augment intelligence, surveillance, and       reconnaissance (ISR) capability. The proposed sale increases       Italy's capability to participate in Europe and NATO security       operations and supports the foreign and national security       policies of the US by enhancing the ISR and strike capability       of a major ally.        (v) Justification: Italy is a major political and economic       power in NATO and a key democratic partner of the United       States in ensuring peace and stability around the world.       Italy requests these capabilities to provide for the defense       of deployed troops, regional security, and interoperability       with the United States.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The MQ-9A Block 5 Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is       UNCLASSIFIED. The highest level of classified information       required for training, operation, and maintenance is SECRET.       The MQ-9A Block 5 is a Medium Altitude, long-endurance (MALE)       remotely piloted aircraft that can be used for surveillance,       military reconnaissance, and targeting missions. Real-time       missions are flown under the control of a pilot in a Ground       Control Station (GCS). A datalink is maintained that uplinks       control commands and downlinks video with telemetry data.       Line-of-Sight (LOS) communications is enabled through C-Band       datalink and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) communications is       enabled through Ku-Band Satellite Communication (SATCOM).       Control of the aircraft and payload are done through direct       manual inputs by the crew or through preprogrammed mission.       Preprogrammed missions are planned and uploaded by the pilots       via the GCS and are executed through the control of an       onboard suite of redundant computers and sensors. Payload       imagery and data are downlinked to the GCS. The pilot may       initiate pre-programmed missions once the aircraft is       airborne and lands the aircraft when the mission is       completed. Pilots can change preprogrammed mission parameters       as often as required. When operated BLOS, aircraft control is       given to other strategically placed Ground Control Stations--      permitting remote split operations (RSO). The MQ-9A Block 5       is designed to carry 850 pounds of internal payload with       maximum fuel and can carry multiple mission payloads aloft.       The MQ-9A Block 5 will be configured for the following       payloads: Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR), Synthetic       Aperture Radar (SAR), Electronic Support Measures (ESM),       Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), laser designators, and various       weapons packages. The MQ-9A Block 5 systems will include the       following components:        a. The Ground Control Station (GCS) can be either fixed or       mobile. The fixed GCS is enclosed in a customer-specified       shelter. It incorporates workstations that allow operators to       control and monitor the aircraft, as well as record and       exploit downlinked payload data. The mobile GCS allows       operators to perform the same functions and is contained on a       mobile trailer. Workstations in either GCS can be tailored to       meet customer requirements. The GCS, technical data, and       documents are UNCLASSIFIED.        b. The Raytheon Multi-Spectral Targeting System-B (MTS-B)       integrates electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), laser       designation and laser illumination capabilities to provide       detection, ranging, and tracking capabilities specifically       for high-altitude applications. This advanced EO and IR       system provides long-range surveillance, high altitude target       acquisition, tracking, range finding, and laser designation       for the Hellfire missile and for all tri-service and NATO       laser-guided munitions.        c. The AN/APY-8 Lynx Block 20 Synthetic Aperture Radar and       Ground Moving Target Radar system provides all-weather       surveillance, tracking and targeting for military and       commercial customers from manned and unmanned vehicles. The       AN/PY-8 Lynx Block 20SAR/GMTI radar system and technical       data/documents are UNCLASSIFIED.        d. The Honeywell H-764 Adaptive Configurable Embedded       Global Positioning System/Inertial Guidance Unit (EGI)       contains the Force 524D GPS Receiver card with Selective       Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM). The Force 524D is       a 24-channel SAASM based GPS receiver with precise       positioning service capability built upon Trimble's next       generation GPS technology. The Force 524D retains backward       compatibility with the proven Force 5GS while adding new       functionality to interface with the digital antenna       electronics to significantly improve anti jam performance.       The host platform can select the radio frequency of digital       antenna electronics interface. In the digital mode, the Force       524D is capable of controlling up to 16 independent beams.
