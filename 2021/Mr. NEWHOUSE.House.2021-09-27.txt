 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for  having this really important conversation.   Madam Speaker, since day one, President Biden has made his priorities  abundantly clear to the American people:   Keystone XL pipeline? Canceled.   Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline? Approved.   Domestic oil and gas protection on Federal lands? Canceled.   Increased Russian and OPEC oil production? Approved.   If this picture still isn't black and white enough, allow me to  clarify further. President Biden and his administration continue to  support and promote foreign energy development and foreign jobs, while  quite literally canceling American energy development and eliminating  good-paying American jobs.   These actions have led to higher energy prices, increased costs of  goods and services, and--most egregiously--greater reliance on foreign  countries.   As stockpiles of natural gas continue to deplete, world leaders,  including President Biden, are going to have to answer the call for  increased fuel demand, especially as winter gets closer.   As the chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus and a member of  the House Energy Action Team, I have worked with all our Members, as  well as our partners, to highlight the impacts of President Biden's  decisions and what they have done to our rural communities across the  country: from decreased public school funding to forcing small  businesses to close their doors.    Earlier this month, our colleagues from across the aisle, who serve  on the House Committee on Natural Resources all voted to ban onshore as  well as offshore oil and natural gas production. They seem to forget  that the fees that are generated by these activities go straight into  the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which those very same Members  voted to support last Congress. It makes no sense.   The U.S. is the greatest country in the world, and we have the  ability, once again, to achieve energy independence, provide affordable  and reliable energy for our citizens, as well as supporting our allies.  We just need our leaders to have these priorities as well.   Our President should support American jobs, not Russian jobs; he  should support lower gas prices, not higher gas prices; he should  support American energy dominance, not foreign energy production and  reliance.   Madam Speaker, I would encourage all of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle, and in the White House, to reassess their priorities,  support policies that help the American people, and not hinder them.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Joyce, and I truly appreciate the  opportunity to speak on a very important issue for the American people.                                time  2030
