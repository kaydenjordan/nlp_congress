 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of responsibly ending  the COVID-19 emergencies and in opposition to showmanship that would  unnecessarily disrupt American's access to healthcare.   President Biden has committed to end the COVID-19 public health and  national emergency designations by May 11, choosing an orderly,  predictable wind down over the disruptions and dislocations proposed by  House Republicans. Their actions this week could immediately kick tens  of millions off their health insurance, leaving nursing home residents  without staff to care for them, and cut off telehealth services for  people struggling with mental illness.   Governing requires planning and deliberation. Unfortunately,  Republicans have put messaging over substance. We can and will keep  schools open and make sure government officials are delivering for  constituents while sustaining flexibilities and efficiencies from the  pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose these  measures and support President Biden's responsible drawdown of  emergency authorities.                            ____________________
