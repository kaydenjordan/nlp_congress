 Madam Speaker, America is great because America is  good. But I ask the question: What is good about terminating the God- given, sacred life of unborn Americans?   Madam Speaker, on Friday, thousands of students, pastors, priests,  and patriotic Americans from all across our great land will gather here  in our Nation's Capital to take part in the 46th annual March for Life.   Madam Speaker, written into the Declaration of Independence is our  founding faith and principle that all are created by God, created  equally, endowed by a creator, created as a gift, created as an  American, to have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness.   However, since Roe v. Wade, we have fallen short of that national  ethic by not acknowledging that life at every stage is precious,  valuable, sacred, and ought to be protected.   Madam Speaker, this March for Life is a call to conscience, and it is  a challenge for all of us to work toward a future where every life,  born and unborn, is celebrated, cherished, and protected.   May God continue to bless those who are marching for their passion  and their love for the unborn, and may God continue to bless these  United States.                            ____________________
