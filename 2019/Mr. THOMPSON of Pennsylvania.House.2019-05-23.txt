 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of  the 45th annual National EMS Week. During this week, we celebrate  emergency medical services personnel and the important work that they  do in our Nation's communities.   The EMS professionals provide constant services to people in need.  From illness to injury, whenever the world  [[Page H4124]]  seems to be ending, society counts on EMS personnel to be there. They  are expected to work hard and be strong, especially in times of  trouble.   Madam Speaker, as a former EMT rescue technician and firefighter with  more than three decades of experience being on the front lines with my  fellow EMS professionals, I can personally attest to their dedication  to saving lives.   The job of an EMS professional is not easy. It requires just as much  compassion as it does courage. These men and women are committed to  making the world better.   EMS Week brings together local communities and medical personnel to  honor the dedication of those who are on the front line providing day- to-day lifesaving services.   A thank-you to the EMTs, paramedics, dispatchers, and supervisors  across the country. Every American is grateful for their service.                            ____________________
