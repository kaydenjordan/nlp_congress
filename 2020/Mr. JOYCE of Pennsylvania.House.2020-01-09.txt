 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life and the legacy of former Pennsylvania Congressman Mike  Fitzpatrick.   Mike was a dedicated public servant who proudly represented the  people of Pennsylvania's Eighth Congressional District, showcasing  incredible courage not only in Congress but throughout his life.   This week, former Congressman Fitzpatrick passed away after a valiant  battle with metastatic melanoma. As a dermatologist, I have witnessed  this disease claim many lives and devastate too many families. Here in  Congress, it is my privilege to serve as co-chair of the Skin Cancer  Caucus, and I remain dedicated to promoting innovative treatments and  cures for melanoma.   On behalf of the 13th District of Pennsylvania, I am grateful to  Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick for his longstanding service to our  Commonwealth and to our entire Nation.   As we honor him today, I extend my sincere sympathies to the entire  Fitzpatrick family, including my friend, Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick,  upon the loss of a great leader from Pennsylvania and a great leader in  our Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for the opportunity to support this amendment to this  deeply-flawed bill.  [[Page H132]]    Madam Chair, I rise this evening in support of the Balderson  amendment. H.R. 535 will have broad and significant impact on medical  innovation and negatively impact patient outcomes.   PFAS materials have a variety of uses in healthcare, ranging from  cardiac stents to the coating on contact lenses. Using innovative PFAS  materials, surgeries such as those that were previously used to repair  a child's congenital heart defect now no longer require risky, open  heart surgery procedures and can simply be done as an outpatient with  significantly less risks.                                time  2000    The EPA is already working on its own comprehensive PFAS Action Plan,  and we must listen to science rather than regulating new devices and  treatments out of existence.   Here is the bottom line: We cannot ignore the benefits that some PFAS  chemicals have given to humankind.   Madam Chair, I strongly urge the adoption of the Balderson amendment.
