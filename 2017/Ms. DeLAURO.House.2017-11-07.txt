 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill,  which would overturn the National Labor Relations Board's joint  employer decision. It will make it harder for working people to hold  employers accountable for abuses, including making it harder to bring  Equal Pay Act claims.   In 2015, the National Labor Relations Board ruled in their Browning- Ferris decision that a company can be held liable for labor violations  by other employers they contract with.   This definition of joint employers reflects the reality that  subcontractors in the workforce face today. In fact, according to the  Economic Policy Institute: ``The most rigorous recent estimates find  that the share of workers being subcontracted out was 15.8 percent in  late 2015. In today's labor market, that translates into roughly 24  million workers.''   The bill we are debating today would fly in the face of the 2015  decision, undermining employee protections.   This bill would create a more narrow and restrictive definition of a  joint employer; it would limit workers' ability to hold employers  responsible for violations under the National Labor Relations Act, such  as attempts to stop collective bargaining; or the Fair Labor Standards  Act, such as wage theft, equal pay violations.   Let me talk about what this would mean in just one area: pay  discrimination. Pay discrimination in the workplace is real; it is  happening everywhere.                                time  1715    Pay inequity does not just affect women; it affects children,  families, and our economy as a whole. That is because women in this  country are the sole or co-breadwinners in half of the families with  children.   The biggest problem facing our Nation today is that families are not  making enough to live on. They are not being paid enough in the jobs  that they have. Closing the wage gap would help to address that  problem.    Why would we further undermine a worker's ability to  bring pay discrimination cases against their employer? We must stand  with workers, defend the current definition of joint employers.   To those who claim that joint employer status is burdensome or  confusing for companies, let me just ask you: What about the burden on  millions of Americans who are experiencing pay disparity and pay  discrimination?   I urge my colleagues, reject this bill. Take a stand for equal pay,  for equal work.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from our labor leaders  rejecting H.R. 3441.                                                      July 28, 2017.        Dear Representative: We, the undersigned unions       representing millions of American workers, are writing to       urge you to not support H.R. 3441, the joint employer bill       introduced by Representatives Bradley Byrne and Chairwoman       Virginia Foxx of the House Committee on Education and the       Workforce, which would eliminate the National Labor Relation       Board's (NLRB) decision in Browning-Ferris, and greatly       restrict the definition of employer under the Fair Labor       Standards Act. Congress should be working to strengthen the       rights of working people and raise wages. The legislation       would accomplish the opposite.        Over the past few decades, the middle class has been       struggling to stay afloat. As wages have often been stagnant       or declining, more and more companies have used middlemen       from staffing agencies, labor contractors and to       subcontractors to maintain low wages, avoid accountability       and prevent a large percentage of workers from organizing. It       is important that when workers try to remedy illegal       employment practices or organize to join a union that the       party calling the shots is at the table and part of the       remedy. And indeed, the current state of the law under both       under the National Labor Relations Act and the FSLA balances       the interests of workers and employers by requiring a fact       specific inquiry to determine whether or not there is a joint       employer relationship.        This bill seeks to legislate around a century of consistent       case law and established joint employer standards in labor       and employment law. It redefines the term 'employer' so       narrowly that many workers will have no remedy when their       employers violate their union rights or wage laws.        The legislation would overturn the Browning Ferris NLRB       decision, a case which found a joint employer relationship       between Browning Ferris and Leadpoint their subcontractor. In       this case, Browning-Ferris, Inc. (BFI), the employer,       controlled the speed of the conveyor belt where employees of       contractor Leadpoint sorted materials, prohibited Leadpoint       from raising wages above a specified cap without BFI's       permission, and determined the shift times and the number of       people on shifts. Since Leadpoint was unable to negotiate       these employment terms among others without BFI approval, the       NLRB found BFI must be at the bargaining table along with its       subcontractor in order for the union to negotiate a       meaningful collective bargaining agreement. The decision was       fact specific and in keeping with the realities of today's       workplace.        Further, the bill would drastically change the definition       of employment relationships under the FLSA which recognizes       that more than one business can be an employer. Currently,       under the FLSA employers cannot hide behind labor contractors       or franchisees, when they set critical conditions of       employment. Because the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural       Worker Protection Act refers to the definition of ``employ''       in the FLSA, this bill will also impact farm workers seeking       to redress wage theft and other employment abuses. It is the       FLSA definition of employ that has allowed workers to       effectively enforce child labor and other laws and to       effectively address sweatshops for decades. Today, it is this       definition that offers workers hope that when they organize       for a union and better wages that the party that can actually       effectuate change is at the table.        We urge you to weigh the interests of workers and stand       with them in opposing legislation that would rollback the       NLRB's decision and restrict workers' rights under the law.
