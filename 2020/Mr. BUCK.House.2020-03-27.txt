 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the CARES Act.   I agree that we are facing an unprecedented emergency, one tied  directly to China's nefarious actions. However, as President Trump  said, we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.   The President has shown strong leadership, seeking to help struggling  families and small businesses. Congress must do the same. But we can't  do so at the expense of our children and grandchildren's future.   The truth is, this bill will spend $6 trillion, not $2 trillion. Even  that cost fails to include the cost of borrowing this money. There is  no attempt by Congress to reduce spending elsewhere in the budget to  pay for this bill.   The sad truth is that most of this money in this bill is unrelated to  fighting the coronavirus. We believe that the fight against the virus  will take 6 to 8 weeks, yet this spends money decades into the future.   While it is clearly necessary to do something to help our country  fight this disease, this bill is not the answer. Our country needs  help, but this cure is worse than the problem.
