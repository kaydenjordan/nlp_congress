 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a fellow marine and a  great American patriot, Mr. Donn J. Thompson of Spokane, Washington.   Donn was a student at the University of Washington when Pearl Harbor  was attacked. But he left after his freshman year to join the Marines  in 1943.   He took part in multiple assault landings, including the Battle of  Okinawa, where he helped capture Sugar Loaf Hill with the 6th Marine  Division in one of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific theater.   This month, Donn celebrates his 100th birthday. Last spring, Donn  celebrated his 75th wedding anniversary  [[Page H803]]  with his beloved wife and pen pal for life, Doodee.   Donn represents the very best of our history and the very best of  America. I thank him for his service to our country. I congratulate him  on a century of life and wisdom and a life truly well lived.   May Donn and Doodee receive every blessing and happiness under  heaven.                            ____________________
