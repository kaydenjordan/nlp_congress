 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, far too  often, Congress operates under the delusion that we know what is best  for the American consumer. Instead of allowing market participants to  determine the information they want, we seek to manipulate the free  market to impose our preferences on private actors.  [[Page S2300]]    As I am sure my colleague will readily agree, the Federal Government  is far too large in size and scope. In this case, the additional  Federal regulation and the associated potential penalties and costs are  not appropriate. This is not a case of industry committing fraud or  making willful misrepresentations about their products. This bill  simply mandates what manufacturers must tell consumers because it  assumes that consumers are not sophisticated enough to make the  judgment themselves.   If American consumers want more information about a product, they can  be sure they will make it known. If a manufacturer wants to sell more  of their products, you can be sure they will listen to the consumers.  Congress doesn't need to insert itself into every equation.   I object.    Mr. President, across our Nation, thousands of law  enforcement officers make great sacrifices to preserve our freedoms and  keep the peace. These law enforcement officers not only serve at great  risk but also start every shift with a sense of uncertainty.   On April 10, 2023, Louisville, KY, was fortunate to have two heroes  respond to the call of duty. A gunman began shooting innocent citizens  at the Old National Bank and took the lives of five individuals. Within  minutes of being dispatched, Officer Nickolas Wilt and his training  officer Officer Cory Galloway were the first to arrive on the scene.  Officer Wilt was on his 10th day of patrol following his graduation  from the academy. But the actions of Officer Wilt were that of a  seasoned veteran.   Without hesitation, the two officers left the cover of their patrol  car and approached the bank while the shooter fired at them with a  rifle. Body camera video shows the officers acted with remarkable  heroism, bravery, and dedication to save innocent lives. Knowing that  each passing second could result in further loss of innocent lives,  Officers Wilt and Galloway proceeded toward the gunman. Officer  Galloway was struck by rifle rounds in his ballistic vest, causing him  to be knocked to the ground and seek cover from further gunshots.  During this time, Officer Wilt was struck in the head by one of the  assailant's rounds.   At this point, disregarding his own safety, Officer Galloway  proceeded back toward the gunman and was able to eliminate the threat  as he continued taking fire. Officer Galloway continued into the bank  through the shot-out windows and told other responding officers to care  for Officer Wilt, who was critically injured.   Today, I stand to honor Officer Nickolas Wilt and Officer Cory  Galloway, as well as a multitude of fellow officers, fire, and  emergency medical personnel who responded to this chaotic scene. Each  of them displayed the true meaning of service before self. The actions  of these individuals as well as the dispatchers taking the frantic  calls, saved countless lives, including the life of Officer Wilt.   May the actions of each responder be forever remembered as a clear  display of heroism in action.                            ____________________
