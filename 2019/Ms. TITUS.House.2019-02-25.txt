 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding and for her  support of this bill that creates the RISE Award.   I would like to address the bill before you by telling you the story  of Ms. Virginia Mills. Ms. Mills started her career as a security guard  at William E. Orr Middle School in District One in Las Vegas over two  decades ago.    Almost immediately upon getting to the school, she saw that children  were going to school without backpacks on their shoulders to carry  their books and equipment. She saw athletes trying out for the  basketball team without having the proper shoes on their feet. She saw  children who didn't have enough clothes to make it through the whole  week without changing.   So in her very first month on the job, taking old items from her own  daughter's closet, she started a clothes closet for middle school  students in need. She first enlisted the help of friends, then  teachers, and then community members. Eventually, the closet grew to  include school supplies and even food for children to take home on the  weekends, when they might otherwise go hungry.   Ms. Mills has watched these students grow over the years to become  assemblymen and -women in the legislature, business leaders, and  community organizers. She said: ``Giving a helping hand to these  students has inspired them to become better adults . . . . They now  understand the importance of paying it forward.''   Virginia Mills has improved the lives of so many middle school  students in my district, and she has filled a gap that too many young  people are in danger of falling into. And she wanted me to tell you  that she didn't do it alone.   There are countless people in our schools, including security guards  who do more than keep students safe; they keep them motivated. There  are bus drivers who provide more than just a ride; they offer  friendship. There are counselors and nurses and cafeteria workers who  strive tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the success of our  students in our schools. Yet, too often, their contributions go  unrecognized.   That is why I introduced this bipartisan legislation to celebrate the  critical role that school staff plays in helping our students learn and  enabling our teachers to teach.                                time  1730    The contributions of these vital school employees can't really be  measured, but they can and should be recognized.   It is in our children's interest and certainly in our national  interest for the Department of Education to  [[Page H2062]]  present these RISE Awards to people like Virginia Mills who have made  such a profound impact on our Nation's youth. So for those who work so  hard to help our students become the best versions of themselves, I  urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
