 Mr. Speaker, it is now 7 months since the start of the  115th Congress, and 6 months since Republicans have controlled all the  levers of power of our government, and all we have seen are broken  promises.   Donald Trump and our Republican colleagues in Congress ran on a  platform that included healthcare for everyone, massive investments in  infrastructure, tax reform, and a dramatic increase in jobs.   On all four of these, there has been zero progress, zero legislation  sent to the President, and zero effort to work with Democrats to  achieve any of those objectives.   Donald Trump promised voters that he would be ``the greatest job  President that God ever created.''                                time  1015    Yet neither he nor the Republican congressional leadership have put  forward a comprehensive jobs bill. Instead, he and his Republican  allies in the Congress have proposed budgets that would slash  investments in education, infrastructure, and research, all areas that  directly help our economy create jobs.   In fact, jobs that the President claimed to have saved are going  overseas. Forecasters are now predicting slower economic growth, and  manufacturing average weekly earnings have  [[Page H6471]]  only grown half as fast as earnings across the private sector as a  whole over the past 6 months.   When it comes to healthcare, it hasn't just been the broken promise  of insurance for everyone. It has been a nonstop roller coaster of  legislative proposals, all of which would strip coverage away from tens  of millions of Americans, raise costs, and deny coverage for those with  preexisting conditions.   On tax reform, all we have seen is a one-page outline and a budget  proposal with reconciliation instructions setting up a process for  jamming a partisan tax reform bill through Congress. That is a  nonstarter, because to be successful any tax reform legislation must be  bipartisan, as was the 1986 tax reform under President Reagan and  Speaker O'Neill.   To top it all off, we considered and are considering this week an  appropriations minibus without even having had a budget on this floor  some 88 days after it was due. The Republicans promised regular order.  In fact, they are pursuing no order. Republicans haven't even bothered  to pass a budget, which is what we are supposed to do in the House  before moving to appropriations.   So, Mr. Speaker, at the 6-month mark, we have only seen gridlock, no  progress, chaos, and broken promises. Even some Republican Members--and  perhaps many Republican Members--are growing as frustrated as the  American people their party has failed.   Representative Steve Womack from Arkansas said late last month that:  ``We'd better get our act together. We're not governing right now. We  are stuck.''   And Representative Tom Reed of New York said: ``The fact that we are  not getting to these issues--healthcare, budget, tax reform--is  frustrating. We came here to move the needle.''   So what I am saying has been said by my Republican colleagues as  well. Perhaps Representative Tom Massie put it most succinctly when he  tweeted about his Republican colleagues: ``They confuse activity with  progress.''   Republicans, Mr. Speaker, have failed to address the challenges  facing the American people, and they have done nothing to improve the  lives of those working hard to make it in American.   We should be considering legislation to create jobs and grow the  economy. We should be working to improve and strengthen the Affordable  Care Act, not replace it. That would be consistent with some three- quarters of Americans who believe that is what we ought to be doing. We  should be working in a bipartisan way to reform our Tax Code and  promote competitiveness for our American businesses that are competing  in world markets.   Growth, job creation, as well as fiscal sustainability, that is what  we should be seeking in a tax bill. We should be investing in  infrastructure that lures jobs back home from overseas. And, Mr.  Speaker, we should be returning to regular order and an open process  that Republicans have abandoned to the detriment of legislation and to  our country. There have been more closed rules in this 7 months than  have occurred in my 36 years in the Congress of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, the American people need a better deal, a better deal  than they have gotten over the last 7 months. Seven months into this  Congress, it is clear that House Republicans are not on the side of  working people. In the words of New York Times columnist David Brooks,  one of the most conservative columnists at The New York Times, last  week he said this: ``Republicans offer nothing but negativity,  detachment, absence, and an ax.''   Democrats, on the other hand, are offering the American people, as I  said, a better deal, one focused on helping all of our people--Make It  In America--better jobs, better wages, and, yes, a better future. It is  what Democrats have always done when Democrats have been entrusted to  lead. There is a history, a track record to back it up.   Mr. Speaker, I want to show my colleagues that rhetoric is cheap--or  talk is cheap, as we say--but performance is really what we ought to  look to. I want to bring some charts here to the attention of our  colleagues--and, indeed, to the American people as well--to what  Democrats have always done.   This chart, number one, shows that Democrats perform better on  economic growth. Now, that is easy to say, but this graph shows exactly  from Truman to Obama, the blue. You can see under Eisenhower, economic  growth was about a third, or maybe 40 percent. Kennedy-Johnson and  Johnson much greater than Nixon and Nixon-Ford. Carter, greater than  either Nixon or Nixon-Ford. And Carter, to the surprise of many, had  just about the same GDP growth as Reagan, of which my Republican  friends proudly talk. And then what happened under Bush I? Down. Then  what happened under Clinton? Up, GDP growth. Under Bush II, down; under  Obama, up.   That is not campaign rhetoric. Those are the statistics that show  that the economy has performed better under Democrats.   Now, Democrats perform better on the stock market, the stock market  whom, Mr. Trump, likes to point to today. It is doing well. Why?  Because the Obama economy, as you just saw, was doing well and the  expectations were good.   If you look at this chart, things were better on the stock market  under the Democrats. Truman, greater growth in the stock market,  Eisenhower less. Kennedy-Johnson, Johnson up; Nixon down. Nixon-Ford-- Nixon-Ford had negative growth in the stock market, and then Carter,  growth. And, yes, Reagan and Bush I had growth, but guess what. Then  Clinton had better growth. And then guess what. Bush II, again, like  Nixon-Ford, negative growth in the stock market.    What did that mean? That meant 401(k)s were worth less for retired  people, and their security was less secure because the stock market  went in the tank. And then what happened under Obama? The stock market  went up.   Now, lastly, I wanted to show this statistic. And this is a stark  statistic because it shows that, under Democratic Presidents, every  segment, every wage level in America saw appreciation. Now, this only  goes back to 1967.   So if we go to the lowest quintile, it went up higher under Democrats  than Republicans in every quintile. And guess what. The highest  quintile did better under Democrats, just as the lower quintile did  better. But what you see is everybody did better. The only negative, of  course, was under Republicans, where the second quintile went down over  their years in office.   So if you compare all of these, Mr. Speaker, it is not campaign  rhetoric. It is not rhetoric on this floor, but it is economic facts,  economic statistics. Economic reports show that, when we promised a  better deal, we delivered a better deal.   So as we look back on the past 6 months of Republicans' broken  promises and failures to govern, let's remember there is, indeed, a  better deal to be had. Democrats are ready to work with our Republican  colleagues and with the administration to make progress.   Mr. Speaker, I have been here 36 years, and one of the things I am  proudest of, my Republican colleagues, many of them say: ``Hoyer will  work with us in a way to compromise and make progress for our  country.'' But if our Republican colleagues continue to be unwilling to  work in a bipartisan way, we are going to offer a clear and proven  alternative--a proven alternative.   I hope my Republican colleagues will return from the August district  work period ready to ensure that the American people get a better deal  and work with us constructively to get them that better deal.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of disorder in Washington,  D.C.:   There is chaos and conflict and confrontation in the White House.   There is conflict within the majority party in the House of  Representatives.   There was a representation that we were going to follow regular  order. We have not.   There is no budget, which was supposed to be adopted some 3 months  ago. A budget should have told all the Members of Congress and the  country how much discretionary spending we were going to have.   The majority party has been unable to bring a budget to this floor  and to pass it because of the disarray and disorder that we find in  this House. This rule represents a litany of broken promises and  exposes, frankly, the hypocrisy of this Republican majority.   This rule would add an amendment to the underlying bill that directs  $1.6 billion of American taxpayer dollars toward the construction of  President Trump's proposed border wall. This was not in the original  bill.   The irony is, in the Rules Committee, an amendment that was in the  original bill has been struck not by a vote of the Defense Committee or  by the Appropriations Committee, but by the Rules Committee. They just  struck out an amendment.   Let me remind my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, of the words of our  Speaker, Paul Ryan. He said this: ``We will advance major legislation  one issue at a time.''   Mr. Speaker, as you probably know, I have been here for some years-- 36, to be exact. I have never seen, in 36 years, an omnibus or minibus  brought to the floor before September. Why? Because the regular order  is to consider the bills one at a time, or, as the Speaker said: ``We  will advance major legislation one issue at a time.''   But what the Republicans have done, Mr. Speaker, is to bring a bill  and put so much in it, they dare people to vote against it because of  the national security.    Mr. Speaker, this rule ought to be rejected. It is not the  regular order, it is not good policy, and it is not good for the  institution of the House of Representatives or for the country.   The border wall is controversial, and many people in the Trump  administration do not believe the border wall will be effective, and  they believe it is a waste of money. And, of course, the President told  us all the Mexicans were going to pay for the wall.   Well, this is $1.6 billion of about $20 billion that would have to  come not to be paid for by the Mexicans, but to be paid for by the U.S.  taxpayer for an ineffective effort to make this country more secure.   Everybody on this floor believes we ought to know who comes into this  country and that people ought not to come into this country unless they  are authorized to do so. We all agree on that.   I ask the majority leader: Bring this border wall to the floor; let  us debate it; put it open for amendment. That is the regular order.   The Speaker went on to say: ``We will not duck the tough issues. We  will take them head on.'' That is Speaker Paul Ryan, October 29, 2015.   They had an amendment offered on the authorization bill by Mrs.  Hartzler of Missouri. It was controversial, and the majority party  lost. So what did they do? They didn't add it to the bill as Mrs.  Hartzler wanted to do, have an amendment on this floor so we could  debate it again on its demerits or merits depending upon your  perspective, but they went around not by regular order, not by taking  issues head-on, but by having the President issue some tweet that the  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says he never was talked to about  it.    Mr. Speaker, let us stand up for this institution. Let us  stand up for regular order. Let us stand up for not ducking the tough  issues. Let us reject this rule, and then let us go back to regular  order and hopefully do so in a bipartisan way and do what the American  public expects us to do:  [[Page H6486]]  make tough decisions for them, for our country, for our security, and  for our children.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the United States Senate is now considering what is  called a ``skinny bill'' on the Affordable Care Act.   The Senators are being told that they are voting for that bill to  send it over here so it can go to conference and be perfected.   The Rules Committee has just met and a provision was offered to the  martial law, which means that we can take something up right away, that  what we can take up is to go to conference. That was rejected by the  Rules Committee.   There is a suspicion that I have--and I see the majority leader on  the floor--that there may be an intent to send the bill immediately  back to the Senate and have it go to the President without 72 hours of  consideration, without hearings, without scoring. I would hope the  majority leader could give us assurances.
