 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, during Suicide Prevention  Month, in honor of the American heroes who have lost their battles with  PTSD, depression, and other mental illness.   While suicide affects Americans from all walks of life, veterans  commit suicide at a rate that is 1.5 times higher than those who have  not served in the military. According to the VA, nearly 18 veterans  take their own life each day, and at least 60,000 veterans died by  suicide between 2008 and 2017.   This is unimaginable. After surviving the horrors of war, veterans  deserve our unwavering commitment to safeguarding their physical and  mental health.   That is why I introduced H.R. 1123, the Veteran Suicide Prevention  Act, which directs the VA to complete a review of suicides by veterans  in the last 5 years and provide recommendations to improve the well- being of veterans.   Issues of mental illness can be nuanced and complex, but we owe it to  our veterans to put every resource behind understanding what factors  lead to veteran suicide so that we can put a stop to it and save  veteran lives.                            ____________________
