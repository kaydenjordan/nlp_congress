 Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the FIRST STEP  Act, which I have cosponsored. This bipartisan legislation, introduced  by Senators Grassley and Durbin, includes positive prison reforms that  the House passed by a 360 to 59 vote. The Senate has now combined the  House legislation with sentencing reform provisions that passed out of  the Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan basis.   Senators on both sides of the aisle agree that our criminal justice  system is broken and badly needs repair.   In my own State of Maryland, we passed major criminal justice reform  legislation on a bipartisan basis in 2016, which is known as the  Justice Reinvestment Act. The Justice Reinvestment Act seeks to reduce  Maryland's prison population and use the savings to provide for more  effective treatment to offenders before, during, and after  incarceration. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of  reoffending, as well as to benefit victims and families and reduce  costs to taxpayers.   This fall, I visited the headquarters of the Baltimore Ravens in  Owings Mills, MD, in Baltimore County. I am a Baltimore resident and  live in Baltimore County and, of course, am a proud Ravens fan, but on  that day, I had come to discuss criminal justice reform. I wanted to  hear directly from the Ravens players about their insights into the  criminal justice system, and they shared their stories involving their  friends and family with me.   So I am pleased that several Ravens players and team executives wrote  a letter on November 26 to Senator McConnell asking him to bring this  critical legislation to the floor. The letter reads: ``The undersigned  players and executives of the Baltimore Ravens write to voice our  support for the First Step Act, a bill which has the potential to bring  transformative and much needed change to our criminal justice system.  Criminal justice is an issue that deeply affects our community in  Baltimore, as well as the nation as a whole. Not only will this  legislation strengthen our nation's criminal justice system, but it  enjoys the backing of an incredibly diverse group of supporters.''   Indeed, this legislation is endorsed by both law enforcement and  civil rights groups. Law enforcement groups endorsing this legislation  include the Fraternal Order of Police, the National District Attorneys  Association, and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement  Executives. Civil rights groups endorsing this legislation include the  ACLU. President Trump has endorsed this legislation, which has a  growing number of bipartisan Senate cosponsors.   The legislation includes key sentencing reform provisions added by  the Senate to the House-passed measure. First, it expands the so-called  safety valve, which allows judges to sentence below the mandatory  minimum for qualified low-level nonviolent drug offenders who cooperate  with the government. Second, it makes retroactive the application of  the Fair Sentencing Act, in which Congress addressed the crack-powder  sentencing disparity and allows individuals affected by this disparity  to petition for sentence reductions. Third, it reforms the two-strikes  and three-strikes laws, by reducing the second strike mandatory minimum  of 20 years to 15 years and reducing the third strike mandatory minimum  of life in prison to 25 years. Fourth, the legislation eliminates the  so-called stacking provision in the U.S. Code, which helps ensure that  sentencing enhancements for repeat offenses apply only to true repeat  offenders. The legislation clarifies that sentencing enhancements  cannot unfairly be ``stacked,'' for example, by applying to conduct  within the same indictment.   I am pleased that the revised legislation reauthorizes the Second  Chance Act. This critical Federal program helps individuals returning  to the community from prison or jail and has a proven track record of  reducing recidivism and saving money for the taxpayers.   This legislation marks the first time that the Fraternal Order of  Police, the largest police union, has ever supported a criminal justice  reform bill. At law enforcement's request, the bill prohibits time  credits for individuals convicted of a fentanyl trafficking offense, as  well as bars time credits for individuals convicted of repeatedly  possessing or using a firearm in relation to a violent or drug- trafficking crime.   On the prison reform side, this legislation includes several positive  reforms from the House-passed FIRST STEP Act. The bill makes a good  time credit fix and revises the good-time credit law to accurately  reflect congressional intent by allowing prisoners to earn 54 days of  credit per year, rather than 47 days. The bill prohibits shackling  pregnant prisoners and requires healthcare products be provided to  incarcerated women. The bill requires prisoners be placed within 500  driving miles of their home and provides additional phone, video  conferencing, and visitation privileges. The bill expands evidence- based opioid and heroin abuse treatment for inmates. The bill expands  compassionate release under the Second Chance Act and expedites  compassionate release applications.  [[Page S7775]]    The revised Senate bill also includes several prison reforms beyond  what were included in the House-passed bill. The bill establishes an  Independent Review Committee of outside experts to assist in the  development of the risk and needs assessment system. The National  Institute of Justice would select a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization  with expertise in risk and needs assessments to host the IRC.   This added guardrail will help to ensure the risk and needs  assessment system is evidence-based and minimize racial disparities.   It allows the use of earned credits for supervised release in the  community, such as halfway houses or home confinement. The bill also  would permit individuals in home confinement to participate in family- related activities that facilitate the prisoner's successful reentry.   It effectively ends Federal juvenile solitary confinement, and limits  the discretion of the Bureau of Prisons to deny release to individuals  who meet all eligibility criteria. The bill expands evidence-based  opioid and heroin abuse treatment for inmates.   Let me be clear that this legislation is entitled the FIRST STEP Act,  and it is indeed only the first step in reforming our broken criminal  justice system.   In my own State of Maryland, we know the importance of criminal  justice reform after the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore Police  Department custody in 2015. Baltimore is a good example of the  necessary Federal and State partnership we need in order to reform the  criminal justice system. When I am talking about the criminal justice  system, I am not only talking about the so-called back end of the  system, which involves sentencing, corrections, and release from  prison; I am talking about the ``front end'' of the system, which  involves relations between the community and police and often the first  interaction between our citizens and law enforcement.   In Baltimore, the U.S. Department of Justice initiated a Federal  ``pattern or practice'' inquiry at the request of the city of Baltimore  and the Federal congressional delegation. This investigation led to a  comprehensive report finding a pattern and practice of unconstitutional  arrests and policing in Baltimore that disproportionately affected  minority residents, particularly the African-American residents of  Baltimore.   Baltimore City and the Justice Department ultimately agreed to a  consent decree and are now under supervision by the U.S. District Court  for the District of Maryland. This will entail a multiyear process of  overhauling the police department to finally give the citizens of  Baltimore the police department they deserve, using the ``guardian''  and not the ``warrior'' model, as recommended by President Obama's Task  Force on 21st Century Policing.   Congress should take up and pass my End Racial and Religious  Profiling Act, S. 411, as racial and discriminatory profiling is wrong,  counterproductive, and a wasteful use of resources. This amendment  would prohibit racial, religious, and other discriminatory profiling by  any Federal, State, or local law enforcement, setting a national  standard. It would create a cause of action for such profiling,  condition the receipt of Federal law enforcement grants on the  elimination of profiling, and create grants for best practices and  training of law enforcement officers.   Congress should also take up and pass my Law Enforcement Trust and  Integrity Act, S. 3195, to address the issue of police accountability  and build trust between police departments and the communities they  serve. This legislation provides incentives for local police  organizations to voluntarily adopt performance-based standards to  ensure that incidents of misconduct will be reduced through appropriate  management, training and oversight protocols.   Finally, this legislation authorizes funds for the implementation of  consent decrees and judgements entered into between the Department of  Justice and local police departments, such as the Baltimore Police  Department.   I have filed two additional amendments to this legislation. The first  is the text of S. 1588, the Democracy Restoration Act, DRA. This  legislation would strengthen American communities by restoring voting  rights to individuals after they have returned to their communities  after being released from incarceration. Studies indicate that former  prisoners who have voting rights restored are less likely to reoffend  and that disenfranchisement hinders their rehabilitation and  reintegration into their community.   I am pleased that last month the citizens of Florida, by a nearly  two-thirds margin of 65 to 35 percent, voted to amend their State  constitution to automatically restore the right to vote for most  individuals with prior felony convictions. Under the previous law,  people with prior felonies never regained their right to vote in  Florida unless a State board used its discretion to individually  restore your voting rights.   The United States is one of the few Western democracies that allows  the permanent denial of voting rights for individuals with felony  convictions. It is simply wrong that State disenfranchisement laws deny  citizens participation in our democracy. Casting a vote is one of the  most fundamental rights in a democracy and gives you a say in the  future of your community. Congress has a responsibility to ensure that  right is protected and should be leading an effort to remove barriers  and make it easier for more people to register to vote, cast their  vote, and make sure their votes are counted.   In the United States, an estimated 6.1 million adult citizens are  currently disenfranchised as a result of a criminal conviction. While  16 states and the District of Columbia already restore voting rights  upon release from prison, 34 States continue to restrict the voting  rights of people who are no longer incarcerated. In 10 States, a  conviction can result in lifetime disenfranchisement. Several States  deny the right to vote to individuals convicted of certain  misdemeanors. Since March 2016, Maryland automatically restores voting  rights after individuals are released from prison. The new law  immediately restored voting rights to approximately 40,000 Marylanders.   My second amendment includes the text of S. 1728, the Private Prison  Information Act, or PPIA. This amendment would apply the Freedom of  Information Act, FOIA, to private prison. This would ensure that non- Federal prisons are held to the same standard of information sharing  and recordkeeping as Federal detention facilities, and would increase  transparency and accountability. Private prisons account for 20 percent  of our Federal prison and detention population but hide behind  loopholes in the law when it comes to how they perform their job on  behalf of the American people. Security breaches, overcrowding, and  misuse of funds were among the many reasons the Justice Department  under President Obama and Attorney General Lynch rightly began to phase  out the use of private prison contracts. These companies receive  Federal funds and provide the same service as governmental agencies.  They perform the ``inherently governmental function'' of incarcerating  individuals convicted of a crime by the Federal Government. They must  be held accountable to the same standards.   I would note that the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights  and the American Civil Liberties Union sent a joint letter of support  for the FIRST STEP Act. I want to quote from a statement recently  released from the Leadership Conference on this legislation.   The Leadership Conference wrote: ``Bringing fairness and dignity to  our justice system is one of the most important civil and human rights  issues of our time. This bipartisan bill offers some modest  improvements to the current federal system--such as revising mandatory  minimum sentences for certain drug offenses and fixing the `good time'  credit calculation. For this reason, we urge the Senate to vote yes on  cloture and no on all amendments [to the FIRST STEP Act].''   ``We must acknowledge, however, that the bill falls short in  providing the meaningful change that is required to truly reform the  system. Several sentencing provisions don't apply to individuals  currently incarcerated, and the bill excludes too many people from  earning time credits, allows private prison companies to profit, fails  to include parole for juveniles, and expands the use of electronic  monitoring. We will continue working to ensure the current bill does  not further limit the number of people impacted.''  [[Page S7776]]    The Leadership Conference statement concludes: ``The FIRST STEP Act  is not the end. We must address these concerns and create a system that  is just and equitable, significantly reduces the number of people  unnecessarily entering the system, eliminates racial disparities, and  creates opportunities for second chances. Congress has much more work  to do to achieve the transformational change that will end mass  incarceration in America.''   Let us take this first step to reform our broken criminal justice  system by passing this legislation during this session, and let us  pledge to work together to make further improvements in the new  Congress.                                FIRST STEP Act
