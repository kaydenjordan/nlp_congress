 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and others who have  worked on this.   Mr. Speaker, I am so disappointed in this legislation. I have been  involved, in my time in Congress, with leaders from various LGBTQ and  other organizations representing good people, as well as religious  leaders, in an effort to find common ground to satisfy two important  priorities.   Yes, of course--of course--we should treat each other with fairness  and with dignity. I believe that all people in America should live  their lives free of any discrimination. But we also have to defend the  first freedom, the foundational liberty, the amendment and the  principle upon which all other liberties are based.   People of faith, who are also good people, deserve to have the right  to express their sincerely held religious beliefs without compulsion  from the Federal Government.   This bill, unfortunately--and more than unfortunately. I mean sadly,  disappointingly, this bill makes absolutely no effort to do that. It  makes no effort to find common ground.   What a wasted opportunity.
