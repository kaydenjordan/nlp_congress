 Madam President, today I would like to honor the  life and service of a distinguished Montanan and Vietnam war veteran,  the late Mr. Ernest Lee ``Ernie'' Flynn.   Ernie was a native son of Montana, born May 8, 1949, on the Fort Peck  Reservation in Poplar, MT. A member of the Assiniboine-Sioux Tribe, his  grandparents raised him and first taught him the importance of service.   Ernie was a fierce patriot who loved this country. Never one to shy  away from service or sacrifice, he answered the call to duty in the  Vietnam war by enlisting in the Army. A combat veteran of the First  Infantry Division, the Big Red One, he saw hard fighting at Fire Base  Gela near Lai Khe, Republic of South Vietnam. And it was there, in the  line of duty, where he received concussive injuries that would soon  leave him completely blind and deaf.   After being honorably discharged from the Army, Ernie returned home  to Montana, got married, and raised a family. He excelled in university  studies and was a certified Mensa. But blindness forever changed his  path in life. Veterans service became Ernie's life's calling, and he  became a career veterans' benefits counselor with the U.S. Department  of Veterans Affairs at Fort Harrison, MT.   Ernie's upbeat, positive example instilled in veterans and others the  courage to face disabilities. His example inspired and showed Montana's  veterans--and veterans everywhere--that a disability shouldn't prevent  you from achieving great things.   Ernie could never see the many national, State, and local civic and  veterans' awards that adorned his wall of honor, but he always felt the  support of his fellow veterans who knew and honored him. Even after  retirement from VA, the tens of thousands of volunteer hours Ernie  spent supporting Montana's veterans showed his continued dedication to  service.   On October 30, 2022, Ernie passed away at home in Billings, MT,  surrounded by his family and wife of 51 years, Yvonne Rose Brown.  Today, it is my honor to commemorate his service and legacy.   On behalf of myself and a grateful Nation, I commend Mr. Ernest Lee  Flynn and extend our deepest appreciation to him and his family. His  work will continue to be felt by Montana veterans for years to come,  and he will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
