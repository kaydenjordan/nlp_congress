 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the CARES Act, the third  relief package that will pass through the House this month, and we know  it is not the last. This bill will help protect the health, safety, and  economic security of all Americans.   I want to say that I am so grateful to our State and local officials,  our first responders and healthcare workers, our postal and grocery  workers, all of whom are fighting for our communities.   I am grateful to our friends and neighbors for listening to our  medical experts and staying home to slow the spread of the coronavirus.                                time  1100    But they can't do it alone. As the numbers of patients and deaths are  mounting, our doctors and nurses are telling us they are working  without the protective gear and medical equipment they need.   We need to end the disconnect between what the President is saying  and what is really happening in America. We need the President to use  the Defense Production Act to produce and distribute the medical  supplies we need.   I am so grateful to our colleagues for moving quickly to pass this  bill and help the American people, and I urge the President to do the  same.
