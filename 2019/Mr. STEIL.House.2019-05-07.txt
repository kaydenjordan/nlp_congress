 Mr. Speaker, we must set a vote on USMCA.   Wisconsin farmers are struggling. Low milk prices and limited access  to international markets are hurting our farmers.   NAFTA was implemented over 25 years ago. Farming, technology, and  markets have changed. It is time for a modern trade deal. It is time to  protect workers and farmers.   I recently met with Wisconsin's agricultural industry in Burlington,  Wisconsin, and there was one takeaway from our meeting: The USMCA will  help Wisconsin's farmers. Our farmers will see increased access to  markets. Our products will be able to compete on the global stage. Our  workers will have the opportunity to succeed.   Mr. Speaker, let's vote on USMCA. Wisconsin farmers need our help.                            ____________________
