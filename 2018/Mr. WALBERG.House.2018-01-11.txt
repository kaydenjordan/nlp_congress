 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a large number of  dedicated autoworkers who live and work in Michigan's Seventh  Congressional District. Today I want to recognize one of the truly  exceptional ones, Tania Pratnicki Young, the plant manager at Dundee  Engine Plant in Dundee, Michigan. Tania has been the plant manager  since 2013 and recently reached a remarkable milestone: 40 years with  the company.   The Fiat Chrysler plant employs about 700 people and produces engines  for various Dodge and Jeep products, including the Jeep Cherokee. Under  Tania's leadership, Dundee was the first U.S. facility to be awarded  silver status for implementing the principles of World Class  Manufacturing. It shows her commitment to excellence in productivity,  quality, and safety.   Tania calls Dundee ``the family plant.'' I have had the privilege of  touring the factory floor with her and was impressed by the efficiency  of the plant and the friendliness of her team. Thanks to people like  Tania Pratnicki Young, the auto industry is thriving in Michigan.   Tania, congratulations on your 40-year anniversary.                            ____________________
