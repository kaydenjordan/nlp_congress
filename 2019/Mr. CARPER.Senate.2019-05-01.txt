 Mr. President, I want to thank my friend and colleague  from Ohio for his kindness in yielding to me today.   I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to an American hero--this man  right here--an American hero and patriot who was taken away from us far  too soon.   Earlier last month, I was standing on the flight line at Dover Air  Force Base alongside Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester; our colleague  in the Senate, Chris Coons; and our Governor, John Carney. We were  there to join the members of three families who had come to receive the  remains of their loved ones, all marines who had been killed in action  on April 8--a couple weeks earlier--when a roadside bomb went off in  Afghanistan near Kabul as their convey was passing through.   Two of the servicemembers killed were Active Duty: Cpl Robert A.  Hendriks of Long Island, NY, and SSgt Benjamin S. Hines of York County,  PA, which is not too far from my State of Delaware.   There was a third marine, SSgt Christopher Slutman. Christopher was a  reservist, a 15-year member of the New York City Fire Department, and a  Delawarean. The 43-year-old U.S. marine was also a loving husband to  his wife, Shannon, and the father of three girls: McKenna, age 10;  Kenley, age 8; and Weslynn, age 4.   In life and in death, Staff Sergeant Slutman epitomized the best of  this country. He selflessly put his life on the line to protect and  serve his country and his community.   We read in the New Testament these words, and I will paraphrase them:  No greater love hath a man than his willingness to lay down his life  for a friend.   These three marines laid down their lives for our country, and they  also laid down their lives for a nation we are allied with, the  government and the people of Afghanistan.   Winston Churchill said a lot of memorable things, but one of the most  memorable to me, a retired Navy captain, is that a reservist is twice a  citizen. A reservist is twice a citizen.   By that measure, Christopher Slutman was three times a citizen. He  wore two uniforms in service to our Nation. One of them was this  uniform, the fire department--a 15-year, decorated veteran of the New  York City Fire Department--and also that of a staff sergeant of the  U.S. Marines, serving in the 25th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division  in the Marine Forces Reserve, which is based in Harrisburg, PA.   Christopher's family calls him Chris. Chris had always dreamed of  being a firefighter. He grew up in Maryland. He graduated from  Frederick Douglass High School, where he played football, basketball,  wrestled, and achieved Eagle Scout status. As a father of two Eagle  Scouts, that is quite an achievement. Eventually, he volunteered with  fire departments in Maryland and in Washington, DC. Most recently, he  spent his time between the Bronx and Wilmington, DE, where his wife and  three daughters lived full time.   As my colleagues know, I live in Delaware, and I commute to work here  by train almost every day--3, maybe 4 days a week. Christopher Slutman  had a similar kind of commute. His family was in Delaware, and instead  of coming this way, he would go north to work as a firefighter in New  York City. He took the train in the opposite direction to do his job.  He so wanted to serve that he would travel from his home in Delaware to  Ladder Company 27 in New York City almost every day. In fact, he was on  military leave from Ladder Company 27 and nearing the end of his most  recent deployment with the Marine Reserves in Afghanistan when he and  his two comrades lost their lives.   It was for Chris Slutman's work in the Bronx that in 2014 he won the  Fire Chiefs Association Memorial Medal for rescuing an unconscious  woman from the 11th floor of a high-rise apartment building. I heard a  firsthand account of that rescue, and it tells the story of a hero and  a woman who could easily have died, and she didn't, and it was because  of his actions. Staff Sergeant Slutman lived that kind of profound  love. He dedicated his life to serving others even at his own peril.   It seems that this kind of selflessness and devotion to service was a  hallmark of the Slutman household. Staff Sergeant Slutman is survived  by three brothers. One of his brothers is in the Marines, another is in  the Army, and the third is a firefighter in Washington, DC--right here.  Their father was an Army veteran and was also a volunteer firefighter,  as was Chris Slutman's mother. What a family--Marines, Army, volunteer  firefighters, firefighters up in New York City. I like to say  leadership is leading by example. Leaders lead by example. It is not do  as we say, but do as we do. They provide an incredible example for all  of us.   Last Friday, I was honored to have been able to join our Governor,  John Carney, and Staff Sergeant Slutman's family, friends, and fellow  servicemembers in New York City to pay our respects, along with the  mayor of New York City and many other dignitaries who were there to pay  their respects to a man who gave his life for this country.   The first speaker at his funeral was Marine SgtMaj Christopher  Armstrong--another Christopher--who served alongside his friend Chris  for 8 years. Marine Sergeant Major Armstrong remembered Chris Slutman  with these words. Here is what Christopher Armstrong had to say:         Upon joining the unit, I began observing the Marines; who       they watched, how they looked at their leaders, and what they       said. There were a small number of men that when they spoke,       silence fell; when they issued an order, the response was       immediate; and when they were looked upon, it was with       reverence. Christopher Slutman immediately stood out as a       leader who was both respected and admired. He didn't pound       his chest, he didn't try to impress or go on about what he       was going to do. He just did it.    He just did it.   Sergeant Major Armstrong continued:         Chris Slutman placed his Marines' welfare before his own.       Chris never sought credit, but he always gave it.    Think about that. That is a good lesson for all of us, even here.  Chris Slutman never sought credit; he always gave it to others.   Fire Department New York Commissioner Dan Nigro also spoke. He  described Chris Slutman as ``the type of American we can all be proud  of.'' He continued: ``Chris was a protector of those in danger and a  defender to those who needed him, a rescuer to those who needed saving,  and a leader who demonstrated his valor on every tour of duty, both  here and abroad.'' Those are the words of the Commissioner of the New  York City Fire Department.   I believe there was a poet named Edgar Guest--like a house guest-- Edgar Guest. I think he spent most of his life in Detroit, MI. He was  oftentimes referred as a people's poet. He  [[Page S2558]]  used to say: ``I'd rather see a sermon than hear one any day.'' Think  about that. ``I'd rather see a sermon than hear one any day.''   Chris Slutman, your life was better than any sermon.   Chris demonstrated the absolute best of our country every day with  his heroism and his service to others. The way he lived his life and  the way he give his life is a language that is clear to one and all.   It is with a heavy heart that I, along with the entire First State-- that is the State of Delaware--and the people of this country, offer  our sincere condolences to Chris's wife, Shannon, and their three  girls. Their dad is an American hero.   Our congressional delegation and our Governor promise that he will  not soon be forgotten.   I know that his legacy lives on in his daughters and in his wife  Shannon.   A friend of mine was married to a Navy SEAL a number of years ago.  That marriage produced a daughter who is 18 years old and who will  graduate from high school later this month. Her dad died of  complications of PTSD. He served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as I recall.  He later came down with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease. He succumbed to that  about a year ago. Members of my staff in Delaware--constituent service  staff--have worked for months trying to make sure that his 18-year-old  daughter would be eligible for the benefits of her Navy SEAL dad, now  deceased. We learned last month that she will be eligible.   One of the things our congressional delegation will work hard to do  is to make sure that to the extent that Chris Slutman was eligible for  the GI bill--and our guess is that he was--those benefits, under the  law, if not used by the veteran, by the soldier, by the sailor, or by  the airman, could be used by the spouse, and if not used by the spouse,  could be used by a dependent child.   There are three dependent children here--three daughters who are  beautiful girls, who anyone would be proud to claim as their own child,  grandchild, or niece. We are going to work hard to make sure that those  GI bill benefits--if there is any way to do this legally--accrue to  Chris and Shannon and Shannon's three daughters.   I, again, thank my friend Senator Portman for his kindness in  yielding tonight.   To Chris Slutman: God bless you, Chris.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
