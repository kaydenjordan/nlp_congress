 Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend from  Michigan and the other half of the unofficial Levin caucus.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the late Richard Trumka, a  fierce fighter for the hardworking men and women of America's labor  movement.   Rich Trumka dedicated his life to protecting the safety of workers,  ensuring the right to organize, and upholding the principle that each  and every person is to be treated with dignity and respect in the  workplace.   For many years, Richard worked with Presidents and Members of  Congress on both sides of the aisle to advance workers' rights. Richard  approached legislation with clear intent, passion, and purpose, to  ensure that no worker was left behind or abandoned.   Simply put, Rich Trumka's life was a testament to the amazing power  behind organizing and fighting for progress. America's workers are  better off, thanks to his many years rallying for those without a  voice. I know his legacy will live on in all of us who he inspired.   With Richard's legacy in mind, I am recommitted, as are many of my  colleagues, to creating a better America that lifts up working people  and promotes a society that treats every person with kindness, dignity,  and respect.   We now have an extraordinary opportunity, right now, to honor  Richard, not just in words, but in deeds, by creating good-paying union  jobs as part of the Build Back Better agenda. Let's get this done for  him.
