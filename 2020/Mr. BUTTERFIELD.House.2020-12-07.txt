 Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), the distinguished chair of  the Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Bass very much  for those very kind words, and I thank her for her friendship and for  her leadership over the last 2 years as she has led the 55 men and  women of the Congressional Black Caucus. I certainly know from past  experience that it is a daunting challenge to lead such a caucus. But I  thank her so much for her leadership, and I look forward to the future  leadership of our new chair, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty.   Today, the Congressional Black Caucus is convening to present a  Special Order, recognizing the 155th anniversary of the ratification of  the 13th Amendment.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members will have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  on this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I have said for years that the passage  and ratification of the 13th Amendment is one of the most significant  pieces of legislation ever considered by this body. Had Congress and  the States failed to eliminate the despicable institution of slavery,  the American experiment would have failed and failed miserably.   This afternoon, the Congressional Black Caucus lifts up this American  history for the American people to see and understand.   In the year 1860, the Republican candidate for President was Abraham  Lincoln. Three candidates opposed Lincoln: Stephen Douglas from  Illinois, representing the Northern wing of the Democratic Party; John  Breckinridge from Kentucky, representing the Southern wing of the  Democratic Party; and John Bell from Tennessee, representing the  Constitutional Union Party.   During this election, Mr. Speaker, the Southern States, the  slaveholding Southern States, were very fearful that, if elected,  Abraham Lincoln would find a way to end slavery and deprive them of  their slaves.   Over a period of 240 years, southern plantation owners had purchased  African citizens who had been transshipped to the United States from  the continent of Africa.                                time  1630    The original Constitution, which was effective March 4, 1789,  addressed the issue of slavery. It contained a provision that would  maintain the slave trade for at least 20 years after the ratification  of the Constitution, until January 1, 1809. Though the legal end of the  slave trade occurred in 1809, slave trafficking continued, to be sure.   Slave women were impregnated by males of both races and encouraged to  bear large numbers of children. By 1860, Mr. Speaker, there were nearly  4 million slaves in the United States, mostly in Southern States. The  border States of Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, and West  Virginia also had a large number of slaves.   On November 6, 1860, Mr. Speaker, it was the Presidential election.  The American voters spoke, and did they speak loudly. Abraham Lincoln  became the 16th President of the United States of America, winning a  very large number of electoral votes.   Immediately following his election, Southern States, 11 Southern  States began seceding from the Union, and that is the map I have here  to my left.   The first State to secede was South Carolina, right away, on December  20; Mississippi, January 9; followed by Florida, Alabama, Georgia,  Louisiana, and Texas.   Then after those seven States had seceded from the Union, Abraham  Lincoln takes the oath of office and becomes the 16th President of the  United States. The oath of office took place on March 3. Today, as we  all know, it is January 20, but during those times it was March 3.   After Lincoln was installed and inaugurated as President, four more  States seceded from the Union. They were Virginia, Arkansas, North  Carolina, and Tennessee.   Now, Mr. Speaker, the United States is faced with a constitutional  crisis of monumental proportions. Eleven States, these 11 Southern  States, are now considering themselves a separate nation. They refer to  themselves as the Confederate States of America.   The so-called Confederate States were formally created on March 11, a  mere 8 days following Lincoln's inauguration. The Confederate States of  America adopted a constitution. They created a currency, elected its  political leaders, stood up a military, adopted a flag, and attempted  to do everything a developing nation would do.   Great tension now existed between the 23 Union States and the 11  Confederate States. So, Mr. Speaker, we all know what happened then. On  April 12, 1861, at 4:30 in the morning, Confederate soldiers opened  fired upon Union soldiers at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, in the city  of Charleston, and the Civil War begins.   It was a brutal war. Southern States had declared war on the Union.  Thousands of soldiers lost their lives on both sides of the battle  lines.   President Lincoln, Mr. Speaker, became very weary. The war was taking  its toll on him. It was taking its toll on the democracy. So on  September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued what we now know as the preliminary  Emancipation Proclamation, announcing that, if the rebels did not end  the fighting and rejoin the Union by January 1, 1863, 100 days later,  all slaves in the rebellious States would be free.   On January 1, 1863, Lincoln did what he threatened he would do.  President Lincoln, using his power as Commander in Chief of the  military, issued an executive order. That order is referred to as the  historic Emancipation Proclamation.   Mr. Speaker, that proclamation is often recited, and I will recite it  here today.   It reads as follows. This is the Emancipation Proclamation. It says:   ``On the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand  eight hundred sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State  or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in  rebellion against the  [[Page H6890]]  United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the  Executive Government of the United States, including the military and  the naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of  such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or  any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.''   A very powerful executive order by President Lincoln.   But, Mr. Speaker, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was monumental.  It proclaimed that slaves residing in the States that were in armed  rebellion against the Union were free. Union military forces descended  upon Southern States to quiet the rebellion and to bring freedom to the  slaves.   But, Mr. Speaker, there was great dispute--great dispute--among the  legal scholars of that day as to the legal effect of the Emancipation  Proclamation.   Lincoln took the position that, as Commander in Chief, he possessed  the authority to enter orders that would deprive the enemy of any  instruments that would aid them in winning the war. The slaves were a  major asset to the slaveholders who were in rebellion. So Lincoln took  the position that he possessed the power, the absolute power as  Commander in Chief, to free the slaves.   But some scholars argued that the legal effect of the proclamation  was doubtful. It was a singular act of the President, they said,  without congressional approval or popular vote. There was some question  whether the effect of the proclamation would cease at the end of the  war, some question how the Supreme Court would rule if the President's  order was eventually judicially reviewed.   On April 8, 1864, right in the middle of the war, Mr. Speaker, just  before the Presidential election, the United States Senate passed a  13th Amendment to the Constitution, and it needed the approval of this  body, the House of Representatives, for it to become law. But House  approval was uncertain.   So, 7 months later, after it had passed the Senate, 7 months later,  on November 8, 1864, Lincoln was then reelected. Lincoln was determined  now to take ownership of this legislation to abolish slavery. Lincoln  demanded that this body, the House of Representatives, pass the  legislation that had been passed by the Senate.   Lincoln's election platform had promised that slavery would be  abolished by amendment. Lincoln demanded action. White Northern  abolitionists, Black abolitionists, demanded action. The war was now at  a fever's pitch. Abolition, Mr. Speaker, had to happen.   On January 31, 1865, finally, the House of Representatives, this  body, finally took up the question of passage of the 13th Amendment.  When the vote was taken that day, the 13th Amendment passed by a two- vote margin, a two-vote margin above the needed two-thirds majority.  The vote was 119-56.   History reports, Mr. Speaker, that the galleries in this Chamber, the  galleries which I see at this moment, the galleries were boisterous.  There was applause. Women and men cried. They waived their  handkerchiefs as the House of Representatives passed the 13th  Amendment. It was a grand, grand event.   Mr. Speaker, in the final vote, all 86 House Republicans voted in  favor of the 13th Amendment, along with 15 Democrats, 14 unconditional  Unionists, and 4 Union men. The opposition came from 50 Democrats and 6  Union men.   To amend the Constitution, not only does an amendment need to pass  both Houses of Congress, but it must be ratified by three-fourths of  the States.   After the passage by the Senate and the House, the ratification  process begins. On February 1, 1865, the very, very next day, the  following day, though not required, President Lincoln signed the 13th  Amendment, beginning ratification. It had to be ratified by 27 States.   Ratification is now underway. The first State, as you can image, Mr.  Speaker, was Lincoln's home State of Illinois, the very next day,  February 1, 1865, followed by Michigan, Maryland, New York,  Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Missouri, Maine, Kansas, Massachusetts,  Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Nevada, Louisiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin,  Vermont, Tennessee, and Arkansas.   And later that day, Arkansas, which is Mr. Davis' home State--I saw  Mr. Davis walk on the floor a moment ago. Arkansas ratified the  amendment on April 14, 1865.   And later that day, President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated here  in Washington, D.C. But ratification continued, and they had needed six  more States.   On May 4, 1865, it was Connecticut, followed by New Hampshire,  followed by South Carolina, followed by Alabama and then my home State  of North Carolina on December 4, 1865. And then, finally, Mr. Speaker,  on December 6 of 1865, the final State of Georgia ratified the 13th  Amendment.   When the State of Georgia ratified the 13th Amendment on December 6,  1865, 245 years of slavery legally ended. Four million slaves are free.  The former slaves now begin a long and difficult period of  reconstruction.   In 1868, the former slaves became citizens, with the 14th Amendment.  They obtained the right to vote in 1870 under the 15th Amendment.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, December 6 is Abolition Day in America, and  we should observe it and recognize this history. As elected Members of  Congress, Black and White, Democrat and Republican, we must rededicate  ourselves to the complete elimination of intentional and systemic  racism in America. Mr. Speaker, this is our challenge.   Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Thank you, Congressman Davis, for your passionate  leadership. You will recall, Congressman, that 5 years ago, President  Obama graced us with his presence when we celebrated the 150th  anniversary of the 13th Amendment, and your eloquence this afternoon  really adds to that history.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).  [[Page H6891]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman for  delineating the important difference between the Emancipation  Proclamation and the 13th Amendment. The Proclamation was a heroic  action of President Lincoln; the 13th amendment was a historic action  of this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Clyburn), the Democratic whip of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Clyburn very much for his  comments tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I would inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I have 12 minutes remaining and I have  four speakers. I will try to divide it up 3 minutes each.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters),  the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Financial Services.    How much time remains, Mr. Speaker?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia  (Mrs. McBath).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her very  powerful words.   At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Mfume).    Mr. Speaker, I thank all the speakers this evening.  I understand the time has been precious, and I thank all of them for  their patience and willingness to participate.   The 13th Amendment reads as follows: ``Neither slavery nor  involuntary servitude . . . shall exist within the United States, or  any place subject to their jurisdiction.''   This amendment was added to the United States Constitution by an act  of Congress on January 31, 1865, ratified by the requisite number of  States on December 6, 1865, 155 years ago.                            ____________________
