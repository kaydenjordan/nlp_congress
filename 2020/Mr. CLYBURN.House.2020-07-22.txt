 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina  for yielding me the time, and for his leadership and his management of  this significant piece of legislation.   I want to thank Mr. Davis and the other Members on the other side for  their tremendous cooperation in trying to help us move to a more  perfect Union.   Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, I stood on this floor and I referred to  this Chamber, this great Hall, as America's classroom. And it is in  that spirit that I think of this building as America's schoolhouse. And  what is taught in this building, what is experienced by the people who  visit this building ought to be about the uplifting of this great  Nation.   What people see when they come here, who people see lauded,  glorified, and honored when they visit this building ought to be people  who are uplifting to history and the human spirit.   It is in that light that I recall the writings of one great writer  who wrote that if we fail to learn the lessons of history--I think it  was George Santiano--we are bound to repeat them.   There are a lot of lessons to be learned from history. I study it  every day. Hardly a day goes by when I don't spend some time looking at  some facet of American history.   We did not come to this floor with this legislation to get rid of  that history. A lot of it we don't like; a lot of it we do like. And I  think that what we need to do is discern between what should be honored  and what should be relegated to the museums and to other places to  commemorate that history. That is not eradicating history. That is  putting history in its proper place.   And for those who did not do what I think they should have done, they  have got a place in the history books, but it is not to be honored, and  it is not to be glorified. It ought to be put in its proper  perspective.   So I don't have a problem with the fact that one of the statues in  here, John C. Calhoun--he was a historical figure. He died in 1850, if  my memory serves, 10 years before the war broke out. So we aren't  talking about John C. Calhoun as a Confederate. We are talking about  John C. Calhoun as one of the Nation's biggest proponents of slavery  and the relegation of human beings.   I want to thank my home State of South Carolina, because the people  of Charleston, Mayor Tecklenburg and the city council in Charleston,  decided several weeks ago, the John C. Calhoun statue should be taken  down, and they did it.  [[Page H3661]]    Clemson University--Calhoun, one of the great founders of that  university--is one of the original land grant schools. Clemson  University decided that they would take John C. Calhoun's name off of  their honors college.   So if the State of South Carolina, where he was from sees that, why  is it that we are going to laud him in this building?   I am asking my colleagues to do for John C. Calhoun what his home  State is doing for him, putting him in his proper place, not a place of  honor. They didn't tear down his statue; they very meticulously took it  down to retire to his proper place.   Mr. Speaker, you and I spoke last night about one other gentleman  whose statue is in this building, Wade Hampton. Wade Hampton, he was  not a Confederate, but he was a perseverer. There were three Wade  Hamptons, senior, and the third.    But Wade Hampton's history should not be glorified. I  don't know what my State's going to do about him, but what I would like  to see us do here is put him in his proper place.   So those two statues that are here representing the State of South  Carolina need to be removed from their places of honor and, at some  point, I would hope the State would bring them back home and put them  in their proper place.   So, I would like to say here today that I am not for destroying any  statue. I am not here for burning down any building. I am here to ask  my colleagues to return these people very properly and lawfully to  their proper place. Put them where they can be studied. Put them where  people will know exactly who and what they were.   But do not honor them. Do not glorify them. Take them out of this  great schoolhouse so that the people who visit here can be uplifted by  what this country is all about.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I cringe often when I hear people talk about the 1960s  as the civil rights movement. I always put an ``S'' on that.   The Stono Rebellion was in 1739. It was a civil rights movement.   Denmark Vesey's insurrection was in 1822. It was a civil rights  movement.   The Niagara Movement that led to the creation of the NAACP more than  100 years ago was a civil rights movement.   John Lewis and I met in October 1960 at a civil rights movement. For  as long as there are people held in suppression, there will always be a  movement for civil rights. However, in any movement there will be a  few--sometimes only one--that rise head and shoulders above all others,  and so it was with my good friend, John Robert Lewis.    When we met the weekend of October 13, 14, 15, 1960, on the campus of  Morehouse College, there was a little bit of an insurrection taking  place. We, who were college students, felt that we knew how best to do  things. We were not listening to Martin Luther King, Jr., and a few  others, and so we asked King to meet with us. And he did.   We went into the meeting around 10 o'clock in the evening. We did not  walk out of that room until 4 o'clock the next morning. I came out of  that room having had a Saul-to-Paul transformation. I have never been  the same since.   But listening to King's plea for nonviolence, I decided, along with  most others, to accept nonviolence as a tactic. But not John Lewis. He  internalized. It became his way of life.   After going through a few issues of the 1960s, John got elected  president of SNCC in 1963 and was summarily dethroned in 1966. But John  then joined the effort, the Voter Education Project, where he directed.  That was sponsored by the Southern Regional Council. And as he served  as the director of the Voter Education Project in Atlanta, I became the  chair of the Voter Education Project in Charleston, South Carolina, and  we continued that relationship.   He got married to a librarian, I got married to a librarian--though I  did so before he did--and they became fast friends. Lillian and Emily  became fast friends.   I will never, ever get John Robert Lewis out of my system, because he  [[Page H3672]]  succeeded where I failed. It was a tactic for me. It was a way of life  for John Lewis.                                General Leave
