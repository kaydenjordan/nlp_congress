 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding, and I thank the chairman for his leadership.   I would especially like to thank Mr. Levin for his resolution  condemning the military coup in Burma, and calling for release of all  those who have been detained, as well as restoring those elected to  serve in Parliament to a position that allows them to fulfill their  important duties.   I would also like to thank Mr. Connolly for his Protect Democracy in  Burma Act, H.R. 1112, and the important report that it will authorize.   Mr. Speaker, 24 years ago, in 1997, I chaired my first hearing on  Burmese human rights abuse, and chaired additional hearings after that,  including in 1998 and 2006. I also introduced several resolutions  addressing the ongoing egregious crisis, including H. Res. 1710, which  decried the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi, and called on the Burmese  military regime to end its campaign of religious and ethnic persecution  of the Rohingya people, amounting to crimes against humanity.                                time  1615    Thus, after decades of abuse, rape, torture, and murder, it is  incredibly tragic as to how little has changed in that country.   As H. Res. 134 points out, the Burmese Government's unlawful  detention of State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as the crackdown  on democracy advocates and the squelching of free expression and other  fundamental civil and political rights, is outrageous and begs  immediate reform and correction.   The United States must, and I believe will, in a bipartisan way, and  with the executive branch taking the lead, do its part. Every sanction  of leverage must be deployed, and we must call on all of our  international partners to join us in those efforts.   The most glaring example of basic religious persecution, Mr. Speaker,  is the oppression of Burma's Muslim Rohingya population. This  persecution has been aided and abetted in part by religious and  nationalist extremists such as the Buddhist monk Wirathu and the 969  movement.   We also see religious persecution intertwined with ethnic  persecution, as in the case of the Karen, Kachin, and Shan people, many  of whom are Christians. I have met many of them over the years.   Many of you have seen the riveting image of a Catholic nun, Sister  Ann Rose Nu Tawang, kneeling before a group of militarized police,  pleading that they do not shoot the protesters. Sadly, at least two  protesters lost their lives that day. But what gives us at least a  glimmer of hope is that opposite Sister Ann Rose, two of the officers,  who are presumably Buddhists, also got down on their knees in response  that this ought to be peaceful and not violent.   It is an image which gives one some hope that the people of Burma can  overcome their differences and unite for peace and justice and for the  benefit of all Burmese, regardless of religion, ethnicity, or political  affiliation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished chairman and the ranking member  for their leadership on this.
