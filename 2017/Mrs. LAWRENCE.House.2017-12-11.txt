 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the congresswoman from  the great State of North Carolina (Ms. Adams) for her endless passion  for education of the next generation and her strong support of our  HBCUs. I also want to acknowledge our chairman, Cedric Richmond, our  CBC chairman.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to recognize something truly  incredible. This year, nine Historically Black Colleges and  Universities are celebrating their 150th anniversaries, 150 years of  excellence, of endurance, and of new opportunity, collective strengths,  and a core belief in the value of education.   Mr. Speaker, we so often talk about the American Dream, and we talk  about that ladder of success that any American can have if they work  hard and get an education. We all know that that first rung of that  ladder is clearly education, and if we do not keep our promise in  America to educate, we are failing in our American commitment to  excellence in developing all young people to obtain their greatness.   As we look upon these accomplishments of 150 years, we are reminded  how important and how vital these schools have been to the advancement  of African Americans.   Mr. Speaker, by establishing these amazing places or institutions of  learning, against all odds, and by turning them into world-class  institutions, African-American leaders have made it clear that we hold  the belief in education just as dearly as anyone else in America.   However, to ensure that some day we can celebrate these amazing  institutions' 200th and 300th anniversaries, it is critical that we, as  a country, resist the shameful attacks on our education system.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the current tax plan being negotiated by  my Republican colleagues threatens our educational system like never  before. It pains me to stand here tonight congratulating 150 years of  academic excellence while a small group of Republicans are working  behind closed doors to strip educational opportunities for millions of  Americans.   I do not believe that this is what the constituents voted for. U.S.  citizens did not vote for higher student loan payments, teachers  digging deeper in their pockets to supply the basic needs for their  students, and a punishing tax on university endowments.   This is truly a tax scam. But perhaps the most senseless attacks on  this success are coming from the White House. Earlier this year, I was  horrified to see the President refer to the HBCUs as  ``unconstitutional'' simply because they were the answer to a  fundamentally unequal education system.   And let me be clear, HBCUs were created because there were no other  choices. However, this feeling of being horrified or disappointed, I  had frequently this year. While I am horrified, unfortunately, it is no  longer a surprise. After all, this is a President who refused to  denounce the blatant racism in Charlottesville and whose Education  Secretary foolishly called HBCUs the ``pioneers of school choice.''  Clearly she doesn't know the history because there was no choice, Mr.  Speaker.                                time  2000    While this can be unfortunate, disappointing, and even sickening,  HBCUs were born out of adversity, and I see no reason to cave to the  pressure now. We need to protect our HBCUs for future generations, for  tomorrow's leaders because, as we continue to see, equality is a fight.  Equality is a process.   I know a day will come, and I pray that I will be able to see with my  own eyes, that equality in education and equality in this country is a  reality. But until then, we must acknowledge today's successes, the  successes of these amazing places, institutions of learning, and  continue to fight for tomorrow's dreams of our next generation.
