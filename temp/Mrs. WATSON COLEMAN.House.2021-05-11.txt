 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from New  Jersey for those kind words, and I thank my colleague from the other  side of the aisle for supporting what I think is a very important piece  of legislation.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to call on all of my colleagues to  support the Pursuing Equity in Mental Health Act.   Over the last several years, data has indicated an alarming increase  in the suicide rates for Black children and teenagers, while a recent  study has shown that suicide intervention programs--while successful  among White, Asian, and Hispanic children--have done little to help  African-American and Native-American youth.   Two years ago, I launched the Emergency Task Force on Black Youth  Suicide and Mental Health, sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus.  The task force's report that inspired this bill is an urgent call to  action.   Regardless of race, gender, and socioeconomic status, every  individual should have access to mental health resources and treatment.   This bipartisan bill will provide much-needed grants for culturally  competent mental health services, increase funding for the Minority  Fellowship Program, and direct research and resources at Federal  departments and agencies. I basically am echoing what my colleagues  have already shared with you.    We must pursue this equity in mental health because the systems we  have in place simply do not address the mental health needs of all  communities.   Madam Speaker, I call upon all of my colleagues to support this  important piece of legislation.
