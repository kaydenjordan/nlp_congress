 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Gun Violence Awareness Month.   All month members of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force will be  coming to the floor to remember those we have lost and to call upon the  Senate to take up H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act.   More than 100 days ago, Democrats and Republicans came together to  pass legislation which is supported by more than 90 percent of the  American people. Since the beginning of the year, more than 6,500  people have been killed and more than 12,500 have been injured by  someone using a gun. Yet, the Senate refuses to allow a simple up or  down vote.   On Thursday, activists from around the country will be holding a day  of action to call on the Senate leadership to take up universal  background checks. No more thoughts. No more prayers. They want action,  and they want a vote.   The Senate should do the right thing. The Senate should pass H.R. 8.                            ____________________
