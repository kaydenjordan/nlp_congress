 Mr. President, today is Estonia's 102nd Independence  Day.   Lithuania celebrated 102 years of continuous statehood on the 16th,  and Latvia will in November.   This is significant not just because the Baltic States are close  American allies with shared values; it is worth noting because Russia  has been waging war on historical truth.   Vladimir Putin recently made the absurd claim that Poland was to  blame for World War II.   In 1992, Boris Yeltsin made public the secret annex to the Molotov- Ribbentrop Pact, making it clear that the Nazis and Soviets colluded to  carve up Poland and the Baltics.   That also puts to lie the myth that the Baltics ``joined'' the Soviet  Union. The United States recognized them as occupied sovereign states.   We ought to continue to defend their sovereignty as well as  historical truth.                            ____________________
