 I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about something that is near and dear to  my heart and to the hearts of my constituents.   It has been 44 years since Roe v. Wade. Since then, 58 million  precious American lives have been aborted. The Supreme Court got it  wrong when it violated its authority by creating a constitutional right  to abortion. To make matters worse, the Federal Government is now using  our taxpayer dollars to subsidize these abortions. Tomorrow we will  have the opportunity to put a stop to this. This is an area in which  the Constitution, my constituents, and my conviction will not allow me  to budge.   I believe that all life is ordained by God and begins at conception,  as the psalmists so eloquently said: ``for You created my inward parts.  You knit me together in my mother's womb.'' Our Constitution clearly  defines that all Americans--even those who cannot vote, who cannot  speak or defend themselves--have the same right to life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with me in support of H.R.  7; but, most importantly, I plead with them to stand up for generations  of Americans yet unborn.   I thank the gentleman again.                                time  1945
