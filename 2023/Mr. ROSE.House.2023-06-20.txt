 Mr. Speaker, according to the National Federation of  Independent Business, small businesses have ranked the cost of  healthcare as their number one problem for 32 straight years.   That is just one of the many reasons why House Republicans will be  working to pass the CHOICE Arrangement Act this week, which was  introduced by my good friend and chairman of the Republican Study  Committee, Mr. Kevin Hern.   The CHOICE Arrangement Act will enhance the flexibility and  affordability of healthcare options for small businesses by aiming to  reduce administrative burdens and by empowering small employers to  provide the type of healthcare coverage that works best for their  employees.   As a small business owner, I know that when Washington gets involved  in our ability to make the best decisions for our employees, things go  awry. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  CHOICE Arrangement Act by voting ``yes'' on its passage.                            ____________________
