 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to  support Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers.   Our country and my home state of New Mexico have made progress in  addressing the opioid crisis, but the United States is still falling  far short of ensuring that everyone struggling with a substance use  disorder can access the treatment they need. Recovery is not a one- size-fits-all approach--it needs to be tailored to each person's unique  needs.   In 2018, Congress passed the overwhelmingly bipartisan SUPPORT for  Patients and Communities Act. This legislation included new grants for  Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers--facilities that provide the full  continuum of treatment services, including all FDA-approved methods of  medication assisted treatment, peer support, and wrap-around services  for families. These Centers can help us identify what works and develop  best practices to improve treatment everywhere.   Last year, Congress provided $2 million for the first round of  funding for two Centers, which will be awarded this fall. My amendment  increases funding to $10 million, the full amount authorized by the  SUPPORT Act, to fund 10 Centers to serve some of the hardest-hit  communities and build the evidence needed to improve treatment across  the country.   Thank you to Mr. Guthrie and Mr. Pappas for joining me on this  amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote YES.
