 Mr. Speaker, it has been 5 weeks since Vladimir Putin  launched his assault on Ukraine and its people; a relentless churn of  cruelty, of war crimes, crimes against humanity.   More than 4 million people have fled Ukraine, but tragically, not  everyone has found refuge. More than 1,000 civilians have been  murdered, and that number grows.   On Monday, there were more than 40 shellings by Russian troops in and  around Kyiv, destroying homes, and in one case, killing a child in his  own bed.   The children. There have been 145 children known dead, a likely  horrifying undercount. Innocent children, unarmed civilians. The horror  continues.   We must continue to support Ukraine and provide all necessary aid. We  must not lose sight of the people.   Pennsylvania is home to more than 122,000 Ukrainians, the second most  of any State, and my district is home to a dynamic Ukrainian-American  community, many with family in Ukraine.   I think of them. I think of Ukraine every day. The world must stand  united to end this series of war crimes.   ``Glory to Ukraine.'' ``Slava Ukraini.''   ``Glory to the heroes.'' ``Slava heroyam.''                            ____________________
