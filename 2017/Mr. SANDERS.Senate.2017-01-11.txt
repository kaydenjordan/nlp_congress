 Mr. President, I thank my friend from Delaware for  yielding. When we talk about the health care crisis in this country, it  is not just health care, it is also the outrageously high cost of  prescription drugs. I know in my State of Vermont, and in fact  throughout this country, millions of people today are unable to afford  the medicine they need.   In fact, almost one out of five Americans who go to the doctor and  get a prescription are unable to afford to buy the medicine their  doctors prescribe. Frankly, that is insane because what happens if you  don't take the medicine your doctor prescribed, often you are going to  get sicker. Sometimes you may die. Sometimes you may end up in the  emergency room. Sometimes you may end up in the hospital. It is  literally beyond comprehension that almost one out of five Americans  today are unable to afford the medicine they need.   Meanwhile, while so many of our people cannot afford the medicine  they need, the top five drug companies last year made $50 billion in  profit--$50 billion in profit. The top 10 CEOs in the pharmaceutical  industry earned over $300 million.   So what we have is a scenario in which the American people pay the  highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Millions cannot  afford the medicine they desperately need, but at the same time the  drug companies make out like bandits, and their CEOs earn exorbitant  compensation packages.   I happen to live 50 miles away from the Canadian border. A number of  years ago, I took a busload of Vermonters across the Canadian border,  not just to do some sightseeing in Montreal, which is a beautiful city,  but to go there to purchase the same exact medicine that Vermonters,  many of whom were dealing with breast cancer, were buying but yet  buying it in Montreal, Canada, for a fraction of the price they were  paying in the United States.   In fact, on that particular trip, many of the women who were dealing  with breast cancer purchased the medicine they needed for one-tenth of  the price they were paying in Vermont--one-tenth of the price. Let me  take a moment today to review the costs of some of the exact same drugs  sold in the United States compared to their costs in Canada.   Here in the United States, EpiPen, as we all know, costs more than  $600 a set. That price has skyrocketed in recent years. In Canada, the  same exact set costs $290, less than half of what we pay in the United  States.   Crestor, a popular drug to treat high cholesterol levels, is $730  here but $160 across the border. We are not talking about generics. We  are not talking about another drug. We are talking about the same exact  same drug manufactured by the exact same company.   I may be mispronouncing it, but I think it is Abilify, a drug for  depression, is more than $2,600 for a 90-day supply here in the United  States but only $436 in Canada.   I can go on and on and on. By the way, let's be clear--   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a chart of drug prices around the world which will show that prices in  the United States are not only almost always higher than in Canada but  higher than in the UK, Spain, and the Netherlands as well.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                      USA--THE HIGHEST DRUG PRICES IN THE WORLD ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                       CANADA           U.K.            SPAIN        NETHERLANDS       U.S.A. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ENBREL..........................          $1,646          $1,117          $1,386          $1,509          $3,000 CELEBREX........................              51             112             164             112             330 COPAXONE........................           1,400             862           1,191           1,190           3,900 CYMBALTA........................             110              46              71              52             240 GLEEVEC.........................           1,141           2,697           3,348           3,321           8,500 HUMIRA..........................           1,950           1,102           1,498           1,498           3,048 NEXIUM..........................              30              42              58              23             305 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Mr. President, perhaps people then will ask a simple  question: How does it happen? How does the same exact same medicine  sold in the United States sell in countries around the world for a  fraction of  [[Page S238]]  the price that we have to pay? The answer is severalfold. No. 1, we are  the only major country on Earth, of course, that does not have a  national health care system guaranteeing health care to all people. We  are the only major country on Earth not to have that.   As part of that problem, we are the only major country not to  negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry. You can walk  into a drug store today, and the price could be double or three times  what you paid a year ago. There is no law to stop them. They can and  they will raise prices as high as the market will allow. If people die  as a result of that, not a problem for them. If people get sick, not a  problem for them.   Perhaps next to Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry is the most  powerful political force in this country. They have spent more than $3  billion on lobbying since 1998, and they have 1,400 lobbyists on  Capitol Hill. We have 100 Senators. There are 435 Members of the House.  Yet the drug companies have 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol Hill. They have  lobbyists all over the country in every State capital.   These are no small-time lobbyists. These are former leaders of the  Democratic Party, leaders of the Republican Party, people who have  enormous contacts. So the drug companies are able to raise prices to  any level they want because we as a nation, uniquely among major  nations, do not negotiate prices with them. The reason we do not  negotiate prices with them is they got lobbyists and they make very  hefty campaign contributions to make sure Congress, in fact, does not  pass legislation which will lower drug prices in this country.   The pharmaceutical industry is an industry that is not only  incredibly greedy, but they have a business model which is largely  based on fraud. Like Wall Street, their business model is largely based  on fraud. Almost every major drug company, not widely known--but almost  every major drug company in this country--multi, multibillion-dollar  corporations--have been fined for illegal activities and for cheating  consumers in our country and all over the world.   Since 1991, with lax enforcement--it is not like we have a vigorous  Attorney General's office that really goes after these guys. With  relatively lax enforcement policies, drug companies over the years  since 1991 have paid over $35 billion in fines or reached settlements  for fraud and misconduct. Imagine that. This is just when they are  caught, and I suspect that most of the times they cheat, they don't get  caught--but $35 billion in fines or settlements since 1991 from the  major drug companies in this country.    Let me give you just a few examples of some of the settlements and  fines the major drug companies have made in recent years.   In 2013, the Justice Department ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $2.2  billion in fines because they ``recklessly promote drugs for uses that  have not been proven to be safe and effective.''   According to the U.S. attorney handling the case, Johnson & Johnson's  ``promotion of Risperdal for unapproved uses threatened the most  vulnerable populations of our society--children, the elderly, and those  with developmental disabilities.''   In 2010, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals paid $520 million to resolve  allegations that it illegally marketed the antipsychotic drug Seroquel  for uses not approved as safe and effective by the Food and Drug  Administration.   In 2009, Eli Lilly was fined over $1.4 billion for its off-label  promotion of another antipsychotic product known as Zyprexa. According  to Federal investigators, Eli Lilly's ``illegal activity increases  patients' costs, threatens their safety and negatively affects the  delivery of healthcare services to the more than nine million military  members, retirees and their families who rely on'' TRICARE.   Very interestingly--and I am sure many of the Members saw it-- President-Elect Trump had a press conference this morning, and in his  press conference, he said that pharma is ``getting away with murder.''   Mr. Trump: Pharma is ``getting away with murder.''   Do you know what? Mr. Trump is exactly right. Pharma is getting away  with murder. Pharma has gotten away with murder for many decades.   The interesting issue is, with a Republican President-elect telling  the truth, that pharma is getting away with murder, will the  Republicans, will all the Democrats have the guts finally to stand up  to the pharmaceutical industry and their lobbyists and their campaign  contributions and fight for the American consumer and end the disgrace  of having our country pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for  prescription drugs?   The good news is--I say to my fellow Republicans and to Democrats-- the good news is that tonight you are going to have that opportunity  because as part of the so-called vote-arama, I will be offering a very  simple amendment which I hope wins strong bipartisan support. In fact,  there have been a number of Republicans over the years--in the House  and in the Senate--who have supported the concept of reimportation for  many years.   What this amendment will do is allow pharmaceutical distributors and  pharmacists and those involved in the pharmaceutical industries--those  people who sell drugs--to import low-cost medicine from Canada and  other countries which will be FDA-approved. In other words, all over  this country people ask a very simple question: We can eat fish and  vegetables that are grown all over the world, but somehow we cannot get  into this country brand-name prescription drugs manufactured by some of  the largest drug companies in the world from an advanced country like  Canada? The reason we can't do that is for one reason and one reason  alone, and that is the power of the pharmaceutical industry.   I would hope that tonight, both Democrats and Republicans will stand  together and demand that this country be able to import safe, low-cost  medicine from Canada and from other countries.   I should also mention that I will be introducing legislation with  Representative Elijah Cummings from Maryland in the coming days on this  very issue, on the issue of reimportation and also another issue that  Mr. Trump touched on, I believe, today; and that is, the need for  Medicare and the government, in general, to negotiate prices with the  pharmaceutical industry. The VA does it. Clearly, Medicare should be  doing it as well. I believe we are going to have an amendment on the  floor tonight. I would hope people support that amendment. I will be  introducing legislation on that issue as well as reimportation.   When we talk about the health care crisis in America, one of the  issues of concern to most Americans is the outrageously high cost of  prescription drugs. The question is whether the Congress has the guts  to take on an enormously powerful industry, the pharmaceutical  industry, with all of their lobbying and all of their campaign  contributions. I certainly hope we will do the right thing, and tonight  we can begin that process.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, tonight is an important night because it  allows what is very rare here in the Senate--for Members of the body to  bring forth amendments and ideas that are very important to them, and  that, unfortunately, don't often get debated or voted upon here on the  floor.   I know I speak for virtually all Democrats in saying that we have  deep concern about the Republican proposal that would repeal the  Affordable Care Act without having any alternative plan in place. We  think the idea of throwing some 30 million Americans off of the health  insurance they have and significantly reducing funding for Medicaid  will not only be very, very problematic for lower income people but  also impact middle-class people who depend upon Medicaid to help pay  for the nursing home care their parents get. We are deeply concerned  about the possible privatization of Medicare, making Medicare into a  voucher program. We are concerned about the increase in prescription  drug costs for seniors that would occur. If the Affordable Care Act  were repealed, seniors would have to pay far more than they are paying  right now, at a time when many seniors cannot today afford the high  cost of prescription drugs. What we find is outrageous is that, in the  midst of all these attacks on the middle class and working families of  this country, the Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act would  end up providing hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in tax  breaks for the top 2 percent. I believe there are very few people in  America who think we should devastate the health care programs that  millions of Americans depend upon and at the same time give huge tax  breaks to the very, very wealthy.   Tonight we are going to hear a number of Senators on the Democratic  side come down to the floor and offer very, very important amendments  which I hope can receive bipartisan support.   We are going to hear Senator Manchin talk about the need to protect  rural health. As a Senator from a rural State, I understand very  clearly that if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, it will be  devastating to rural hospitals all across this country.   Senator Nelson is going to talk about the high cost of prescription  drugs and what the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would mean in  raising prescription drug prices. Senator Baldwin will be talking about  the need to make sure that, as is currently the case, young people 26  years of age or younger can continue to stay on their parents' health  insurance. Senator Tester is going to be offering an amendment which  will oppose limiting veterans' ability to choose.   I will be offering an amendment making certain the people in our  country do not have to pay more for medicine than the people in Canada  and in other countries. Senator Casey is concerned about protecting  individuals with disabilities and chronic conditions. Senator King is  concerned about protecting health insurance for people, many of whom  are working in very dangerous occupations.   Senator Menendez is concerned about protecting Medicaid expansion.  Millions of Americans have received health care, in some cases for the  first time in their lives because we were able to expand Medicaid.   Senator Gillibrand is concerned about protecting women's health. The  Affordable Care Act has gone a long way in terms of equity for women,  in terms of the health care they receive, and I hope nobody wants to  see that disappear.  [[Page S249]]    Senator Manchin will address a very important issue about the opiate  epidemic that exists in West Virginia and all across this country.   Senator Stabenow will be speaking about the need to protect mental  health services. We have a major crisis in mental health care in this  country. We need to do a lot more than we are currently doing, and we  certainly do not need to do less.   Senators Cantwell and Carper will be talking about the need to  protect delivery system reform. Senator Brown will be talking about the  need to protect the Children's Health Insurance Program. Senator Coons  will be talking about the need to make sure there are no limits on the  health insurance people with serious illnesses receive.   So there are a lot of very, very important amendments that will be  offered, and I look forward to an interesting evening of discussion.   I would just conclude my remarks to say that I find it beyond  comprehension that at a time when we are the only major country on  Earth not to guarantee health care to all of our people--we are the  only one--that at a time when we pay significantly more per capita for  health care than do the people of any other nation, that at a time when  we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs-- what we need is to have a health care system that protects the needs of  the middle class and working families of our country, not just the  insurance companies and not just the drug companies. In fact, the votes  tonight are really about whether we are prepared to stand up for  ordinary Americans or whether we are going to continue to kowtow to the  insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object--and I will not object--I  have one mild correction.    Amendment No. 172 is Klobuchar-Sanders.    Yes. Klobuchar-Sanders. I know that because I am  Sanders.    Mr. President, I ask that the amendments be called up as  under the previous order.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305(b) of  that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.    Mr. President, I urge a strong ``no'' vote on the  Barrasso amendment. The language calls for strengthening Social  Security, but we all know what strengthening Social Security means. It  means cutting Social Security. It means cutting Medicare. It means  cutting Medicaid. We are into Orwellian language. ``Strengthening'' is  not cutting programs, it is not throwing 20 million Americans off  health insurance, it is not privatizing Medicare, it is not raising  prescription drug costs for senior citizens. I urge a ``no'' vote on  the Barrasso amendment.  [[Page S253]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number, and  that they be considered following disposition of the Stabenow amendment  No. 94: Cantwell amendment No. 143; Brown amendment No. 86; and Coons  amendment No. 126.    Mr. President, this amendment should be aptly called the  Orwellian amendment because it says one thing and does something very  much the opposite. It talks about strengthening Social Security,  affordable coverage for all Americans. What is really going on is a  desire to cut Social Security benefits and throw 20 million Americans  off of health insurance.   I urge the defeat of this amendment.    Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending  amendment is not germane to the underlying resolution and therefore  violates section 305(b)(2)of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending  amendment is not germane to the underlying resolution and, therefore,  violates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I  won't, I would appreciate it if we could add to the end of that tranche  the Klobuchar-Sanders amendment. Would that be all right?    OK. If we could add Klobuchar-Sanders as the fourth  amendment of that tranche--it is all right. OK. Thank you.                               Amendment No. 61     Mr. President, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act  will throw perhaps up to 30 million people off of health insurance.   I would yield to my friends if they will tell me now what the  replacement is. How many of those 30 million people are going to die?  What is your plan to cover them, plus the other 28 million people who  have no health insurance? How are you going to end the international  embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on  Earth not to guarantee health care to all people?   They don't have a plan. I understand Senator Corker wants more time.  Maybe they will develop a plan. Right now what they are talking about  is repealing legislation which has brought millions of people health  care, and they have no substitute.   I would urge the defeat of the Barrasso amendment.   Madam President, I raise a point of order on Barrasso amendment No.  181, that the pending amendment is not germane to the underlying  resolution and therefore violates section 305(b)(2) of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive all applicable  sections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask  for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, people in the United States pay by far  the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.   I live 50 miles away from Canada, and in many cases they pay 50  percent less for the same exact medicine that we buy in Vermont or in  America, and we all know the reason why. The power and wealth of the  pharmaceutical industry and their 1300 lobbyists and unlimited sums of  money have bought the U.S. Congress. Let's be clear about it.   Today Mr. Trump--a guy I don't quote very often--said that pharma  gets away with murder. That is what Trump said. He is right. Year after  year, the same old, same old takes place. We get amendments like  Senator Alexander's, and the pharmaceutical industry makes more and  more money, and the American people pay higher and higher prices.   The time has come for us to stand up to the drug companies. Let's do  it tonight. Let's defeat the Alexander amendment. Let's support the  Klobuchar-Sanders amendment.   Madam President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment  is not germane to the underlying resolution and therefore violates  section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, last year the five major drug companies  made $50 billion in profit, while one out of five Americans cannot  afford the medicine they need. Please don't tell me that we can import  fish from all over the world, but we can't bring medicine in from  Canada.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, the adoption of this budget resolution  will allow Republicans to come back to the floor of the Senate with a  budget reconciliation package which will repeal the ACA with a simple  majority. If they do that, up to 30 million Americans will lose their  health care, with many thousands dying as a result. Because if you have  no health insurance and you can't go to a doctor or a hospital, you  die.   Medicare will be converted into a voucher program. Medicaid will be  decimated. Rural hospitals will be closed, and they have no alternative  proposition. They want to kill ACA, but they have no idea about how  they are going to bring forth a substitute proposal. This is not what  the American people want. This is irresponsible. This is dangerous.  This should be defeated.    How am I recorded?   On behalf of elderly people who cannot afford higher prescription  drugs, I vote no.
