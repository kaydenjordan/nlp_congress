 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Indiana's concerns  about the process, and I share those concerns as well. But as it goes,  we are voting on this today.   By passing this short-term continuing resolution, we will provide  critical support for farmers and ranchers, extend the nutrition program  that has been a lifeline during this pandemic for low-income students  who are out of school, ensure critical military operations continue,  support vital transportation programs by extending the FAST Act, extend  the National Flood Insurance Program, ensure that there are no delays  in the Department of Veterans Affairs' electronic health records  system, and allow agencies experiencing operational challenges during  the pandemic continued funding.   So, I think it is important that we support this legislation and move  forward, and hopefully, we will get to a better agreement as we  continue negotiations.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.
