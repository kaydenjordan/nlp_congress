 Mr. Speaker, today I rise on National Medal of  Honor Day to recognize the recipients of our Nation's highest military  distinction for acts above and beyond the call of duty.   Twenty-five Medal of Honor recipients hail from Arkansas. Their  stories of self-sacrifice are not forgotten.   Today, we pay tribute to those individuals for their meticulous  service, sacrifice, and heroism.   I would like to also recognize and thank Arkansas Boy Scout Donald J.  Fitzgerald for his outstanding work to preserve the legacy of Medal of  Honor recipients and their stories.   Over the last 3 years, Donald has visited the graves of over 160  Medal of Honor recipients, documenting several Medal of Honor  recipients' stories and lives.   He chose to share with the world what he learned, and wrote a book  about his travels titled, ``Our Missions of Honor''.   I applaud Donald for his initiative, his efforts, and dedication to  all Medal of Honor recipients past and present.   We pray that their efforts may be long remembered by our citizens.                              Gulf War Memorial     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two  fellow Arkansans, Jeff Kurczek and Brenten Byrd, for their valiant  efforts to memorialize the bravery and legacy of veterans who served in  Operation Desert Storm.   Operation Desert Storm was one of the most successful operations in  American military history. Over 700,000 Americans were deployed  overseas to liberate Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's invasion. 383  Americans lost their lives in that conflict, including four Arkansans.   Last month, former Vice President Dick Cheney and others took part in  the dedication of the future site for the National Operation Desert  Storm Memorial located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.   Jeff, a Sherwood, Arkansas, accountant, served our country for the  duration of the Gulf war and acts as the organization's treasurer and  CFO.   Brent lives in Elm Springs, Arkansas, where he works with the  Veteran's Affairs Department on the mental well-being of our veterans.  He served honorably in the U.S. Marines and later in the U.S. Army  during Desert Storm. He now acts as the organization's communications  director.   I thank them for their service to our Nation and commend their good  work and efforts to honor the brave men and women who took part in  Operation Desert Storm.                     Van Buren County Wellness Committee     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the  efforts of the committed professionals at Van Buren County and their  determination to improve that community's health and well-being.   The Van Buren County Wellness Committee, founded by former County  Judge Roger Hooper in 2017, seeks to create a bridge between local  health resources, information, and initiatives to improve the health  and well-being of the residents.   At present, three grant-funded health-awareness kiosks have been  installed across the county featuring asset mapping of community health  resources and county health initiatives.   These kiosks allow residents to find the best doctors and healthcare  services within their communities, connecting individuals with the  services they need, from food insecurity to mental health support and  recovery.   I would like to extend a hand of gratitude and congratulations to  Roger and the entire Van Buren County Wellness Committee for their  worthwhile investment in the health of our citizens in that county.                            ____________________
