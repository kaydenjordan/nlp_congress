 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for votes be as follows--Lee, Cruz, and Braun--and that upon the  disposition of the Braun amendment, the Senate vote on the passage of  the bill, with all other provisions of the previous order remaining in  effect.    Mr. President, I think the Members will like this  announcement. I ask unanimous consent that the remaining votes be 10  minutes in duration each.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                          Vote on Amendment No. 4927    Under the previous order, the question occurs on agreeing to  amendment No. 4927, offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz.    Mr. President, it has been a busy and productive work  period in the Senate.   First, the good news is that we have kept the government open. It  took some work, especially when the Senate rules lend themselves to  delay and obstruction. Still, I thank Senators Leahy and Shelby, as  well as Leader McConnell, for helping us get this done. To have allowed  the government to close would have caused undue hardship for millions  of blameless Americans.   We have gotten other things done, too, in this work period.   We passed forced arbitration reform, made progress to fix our post  office, and confirmed more of the President's nominees.  [[Page S780]]         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.

Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, February 17, be  waived.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  [[Page S798]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to recess subject  to the call of the Chair.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:09 p.m., recessed subject  to the call of the Chair and reassembled at 8:04 p.m. when called to  order by the Presiding Officer (Ms. Baldwin).    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en  bloc: Executive Calendar Nos. 590, 605, 710, 711, 712, 713, 723, 724,  and PN 790; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without  intervening action or debate; the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that  any statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record;  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.

Madam President, just a word, this was a very  significant resolution that we passed. It was led by Senator Shaheen  and Portman and sends a very strong message to Mr. Putin that the U.S.  Senate, Democrats and Republicans of all different ideologies, are  united in defending Ukraine in the ways that the administration sees  fit.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S.
