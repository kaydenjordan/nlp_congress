 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3326 as  it currently stands.   This is a disappointment to me. I, like many of my colleagues,  originally voted to support this legislation in committee, with the  understanding that both sides of the aisle would continue to work to  allay the concerns that elements of this bill would give the Trump  administration new and disruptive tools that would likely be used to  the detriment of the World Bank's mission and our relationships with  other countries.   There was an understanding to negotiate changes, but this legislation  we will be voting on today does not reflect that promise. In light of  that failure, my colleague, Gwen Moore, offered an amendment that would  have set aside our concerns, but this amendment was not made in order,  so we will not be voting on that either.   This bill does have elements that are important to our country's  obligation to some of the poorest countries in the world. The World  Bank provides grants and highly concessional loans through the  International Development Association, the IDA, to the world's 77  poorest countries. This money goes a long way towards raising the  standard of living, public health, and economic growth for the 450  million people who live there.   Since World War II, the United States has stood as a strong partner  and a leader in the multilateral work to improve the quality of life  around the world. Our success has relied on the diligent support of  American lawmakers, diplomats, and groups around the world that work  closely with allies and partner organizations throughout the world to  provide assistance in times of great crisis.   But our confidence that this administration's broad discretion to  defund the IDA--provided in the bill we will be voting on--would not be  abused, frankly, was not improved by the President's recent racist  remarks last week.   We are constantly reminded of the continuing importance of this  mission and the need to pledge our support to the poorest countries in  the world, to offer aid for the neediest individuals. Time after time,  however, the Trump administration has shown itself incapable of using  the resources that Congress gives it to work in constructive ways  within multilateral organizations, instead, alienating our allies and  undermining our country's reputation and mission. While I support this  legislation's authorization of $3.29 billion for multilateral  development efforts for these countries, the poorly conceived and  defined conditions in this legislation make it impossible to support.    Any withholding of U.S. contributions to IDA is a serious action that  would have devastating consequences. It would punish millions of  children and other vulnerable groups in Africa, Latin America, and  Asia, many of whom live in absolute poverty. It would also limit our  ability to help individuals in famine-ridden parts of the world and  refugees in fragile areas. They rely on humanitarian assistance for  food and water.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chair, they rely on humanitarian assistance for food,  water, and basic medical care and could face death without this  assistance.   Many of the provisions in this bill, as written, would place  conditions on U.S. contributions to IDA that, in the hands of the Trump  administration, would not be an effective approach to reform and could  very well undermine efforts to reduce poverty and promote growth. This  would damage our country's historic and noble mission to lead the world  in assisting the poorest countries with food, clean water, and medical  help.   So, with reluctance, I have to encourage my colleagues to vote ``no''  on this bill and hope that it comes back to the floor with the  bipartisan input that we were promised.   The Acting CHAIR. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in  personalities toward the President.                                time  1530
