 Mr. Chairman, February 17, Oroville Dam, California, a  30-foot potential tsunami coming down on the cities of Oroville and  further down the river in Marysville and Yuba City. 200,000 people  evacuated. Thankfully, the rain did stop and the levee, or the  spillway, that had failed did not become a catastrophe.   FERC is now in the process of relicensing the dam, and a complete  environmental impact statement is now more than a decade over, 2007.  However, there have been very significant changes like, you know, maybe  the dam could collapse, or the spillway. We know that the river has  been further congested with the material that came from the broken  spillway.   There are serious negative environmental impacts that have resulted  from the damaged spillway. The river can't carry the same capacity. It  has been silted.   Bottom line, it is for these reasons that a failure by FERC to  require a supplemental environmental impact statement would be a  serious abdication of FERC's responsibility.   Unfortunately, a proposed amendment by Mr. LaMalfa, my good  Republican colleague, and me to require such a supplemental impact  statement was not included in the bill. Nevertheless, my message to  FERC is clear: you must do this so that there is full protection and  full understanding of the potential impact that this dam will have on  communities, our water supply, as well as flooding.
