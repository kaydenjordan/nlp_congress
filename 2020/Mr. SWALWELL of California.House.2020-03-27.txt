 Mr. Speaker, we will get through this.  That is who we are. That is what we do.   Throughout our country's history, with leadership and resources, the  American people have shown resilience to overcome every crisis we  faced. This will be no different.   As we meet here in this Chamber, across America, from Eden Hospital  in Castro Valley, California, to hospitals in New York City, our health  workers, our doctors, our nurses, our receptionists--the janitors who  support them--are toiling away to heal the sick. We see them. We hear  them. We need them. And this bill, more than for anyone else, is for  them.   This relief package also helps the next generation: student  borrowers, people who are working their first jobs and paying off their  student loan debt and, without a paycheck, find themselves in financial  quicksand. This allows them to cancel their payments through the end of  the fall and also suspends the accrual of interest.   Mr. Speaker, we will get through this. It is just who we are, and it  is what we do.
