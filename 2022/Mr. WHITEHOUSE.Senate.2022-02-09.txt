 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon  disposition of the Bush nomination, the Senate vote on confirmation of  the Coffey nomination.  [[Page S588]]     Mr. President, I am here again today to discuss the  scheme by big Republican donor interests to capture and control our  Supreme Court. Today, I am going to put a little spotlight on ongoing  scheme operations.   As we all know, Justice Stephen Breyer will retire at the end of this  Supreme Court term. As the Biden administration selects a nominee, the  scheme is shifting gears to attack her even before she has been named.   A dark money front group called the Judicial Crisis Network has  already announced a multimillion-dollar ad blitz against Justice  Breyer's unnamed replacement, and its first ad is already up. The ad's  premise is that leftwing dark money is poised to capture our Supreme  Court. I am not making that up. Think of a squid. When a squid senses  danger, it squirts a jet of ink into the water. The squid ink creates  confusion and distracts predators, and the squid sneaks off. This new  ad from the Judicial Crisis Network is squid ink.   Let's start with just a quick review of the facts. Rightwing donor  interests captured our Supreme Court under Donald Trump. They did it  with dark money. They used the front group Judicial Crisis Network to  launder off identities of big rightwing contributors. The deidentified  contributions funded political campaign ads against Merrick Garland and  for Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Those are the facts. The road onto  the Supreme Court for those three Justices was paved with dark money.   By the way, the checks were big. Four of the checks to Judicial  Crisis Network were for $15 million or more. That is a big check.  Because we don't know who those donors are or who that donor is--it  could all be one donor--we don't know what business they had before the  Court or why it was so worth it to them or him to spend $60 million to  influence the makeup of the Court.   This new Judicial Crisis Network ad--the squid ink ad--is designed to  confuse those rather conspicuous facts. They can hide who funded them,  but they can't hide what they did; so, squid ink--distraction,  misdirection. Their accusations of dark money corruption are a  projection of the very scheme they themselves hatched and executed. As  I have discussed previously in these speeches, this is a classic  propaganda technique: You accuse your adversary of what you yourself  have been doing.   Yes, it is maddening to have a phony front group use dark money to  capture and corrupt our Supreme Court and turn it into the Court that  dark money built. It is devilish, Vladimir Putin-style propaganda for  that phony front group to then accuse others of exactly what it did--a  false mirror of its own behavior.   By the way, that Judicial Crisis Network ad accusing a not-yet-chosen  Supreme Court nominee of being a dark money stooge? Paid for with dark  money. You can't make this stuff up.   Let's look at the Judicial Crisis Network. Start with the fact that  ``Judicial Crisis Network'' does not exist. It is, legally speaking, a  fiction. Who knew, right--an entity selling fiction that is itself a  fiction. ``Judicial Crisis Network'' is actually a ``fictitious  name''--that is a term under Virginia incorporation law--a fictitious  name, one of several filed by an organization, a completely different  organization, called the Concord Fund.   It gets even more tangled, as dark money schemes tend to be--they are  a lot like a covert operation--so let's keep digging.   The Judicial Crisis Network actually used to exist. It was once the  501(c)(4) twin of a 501(c)(3) called the Judicial Education Project.  That is the state of the art these days for dark money political  mischief, a twinned 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4). Tax records list the same  address for both entities--conveniently an address which happens to be  just right down the hall, on the same floor, in the same building, as  the Federalist Society.   This twinned organization trick allows donors to shift money in and  out of different shady operations with zero disclosure, and it even  gives donors a tax deduction to the 501(c)(3). You could pierce that  corporate veil pretty easily.   All this schemery hides the donors behind the operation. It fools  members of the press who don't bother to figure it out, and it helps  dark money operatives like Leonard Leo, the central organizer of the  scheme--the operative for the big dark money donors--to hide their  hands and shuffle money secretly around.   Leonard Leo, you will recall, ran the donor turnstile at the  Federalist Society that picked Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and  Barrett. Then, at the tail end of the Trump administration, with no  more Supreme Court appointments likely, Leo scuttled off to a new  venture: CRC Advisors.   CRC Advisors was designed, as Axios reported, to ``funnel big money  and expertise across the conservative movement.''   As an aside, CRC Advisors has an affiliate called CRC Strategies,  which, among other things, brought us the infamous swift boat campaign  against John Kerry--classy bunch.   Along with the inception of CRC Advisors, Judicial Crisis Network was  quietly renamed the ``Concord Fund,'' and the Judicial Education  Project was quietly renamed the ``85 Fund.''   These became twin 501(c)(4) and 501(c)(3) political mischief  operations. Concord, as a 501(c)(4), would handle attack ads and PR.  The 85 Fund, the 501(c)(3), would help mask Concord's operations and  donors and provide tax deductibility.   So that was the original setup, the renaming. Then these newly named  groups loaded up with all these fictitious names. They filed under  Virginia law for permission to operate under fictitious names, and  these are the fictitious names they registered to use.   First, Concord took its old name--its old name--and reregistered it  as this new fictitious name. And so did 85 Fund, taking its old name,  Judicial Education Project, and registering it as a fictitious name. Go  figure why that was necessary.   Then they stood up new voter suppression projects under other  fictitious names: Honest Elections Project Action and Honest Elections  Project. Those two front groups--fictitious name front groups--are part  of the dark money armada, along with Heritage Action and others,  through which big rightwing donors orchestrated the anti-voting laws  that have spread like a virus through Republican State legislatures.  That didn't just happen. That was done. And as a Heritage Action  employee admitted in a leaked video, they did it, quietly, through  sentinels.   Concord also added another fictitious name, Free to Learn Action, and  85 Fund created the twin Free to Learn. These fronts are presumably to  whip up the rightwing about so-called critical race theory when the big  donors want.   Gobs of money pours into this propaganda machine. The 85 Fund's last  tax filing shows $65 million in revenues, including one $48.5 million  donation from a single, anonymous donor. If it is the same single,  anonymous donor that contributed the over $15 million contributions to  the Judicial Crisis Network before, that would put one donor over $100  million into this Court-capture scheme--and all that money for an  organization with only one employee who draws a salary of over $100,000  per year.   So no surprise, then, that the 85 Fund channels lots of money back to  the CRC mother ship. Its last tax filing shows over $12 million paid to  Leo's CRC Advisors for so-called consulting/advertising services, and  it distributed over $34 million to other unnamed groups, presumably in  other areas of the scheme, in a big dark money shuffle.   We are still waiting for Concord Fund records for the most recent tax  year, but the previous year's filing proves the Axios reporting is spot  on. Concord's top independent contractor is CRC Advisors, paid over  $4.2 million for consulting services. It is out of this pea-and-shell  game switcheroo that the dark money Judicial Crisis Network ad emerges.   I have noticed recently--in fact, as recently as our last Judiciary  Committee markup--that Republicans are currently reverting, often, to  the same dark money line of attack as the Judicial Crisis Network. As  we watch Republican Senators attack Democrat dark money, let's remember  a few things. First, Republicans created, protected, and defended--and  defend to this day--dark money. Republicans  [[Page S589]]  block our efforts to get rid of dark money.   Republicans came first to the dark money game with billions of dark  money dollars. Then, when we began to play by their rules--the rules  they made, the rules they defend--they complained. I guess they hope  that we will unilaterally disarm so they can pound us with dark money  just as they did for years after their Republican Justices in Citizens  United let the big money flow.   Well, unilateral disarmament isn't going to happen, but that is not  the only reason for the squid ink. The falsehood of this ad serves to  damn us all in the eyes of the public. The rightwing scheme reckons  that Americans, frustrated and cynical about a slimy, dark money battle  purportedly involving both sides, will tune out and turn away from what  Justice Sotomayor has called the ``stench'' of partisanship emerging at  the Supreme Court.   All this misdirection--squid ink--can then distract from their  captured Court's record for the big scheme's donors. The ``Roberts  Five'' have a pattern now, a pattern of 80--80--partisan 5-to-4  decisions, all benefiting easily identified Republican donor  interests--an 80-to-0 record. It is a heck of a pattern.   And now they have a new rightwing, dark money supermajority to amp it  up even further. It is no wonder polling shows that Americans believe  the six-Justice Republican majority is motivated mainly by politics and  that the Court's approval rating just hit an alltime low.   So a little distraction is in order. Cue the squid ink. Meanwhile,  the Senate minority leader is reportedly urging his caucus to keep a  low profile on Biden's nominee. I get it. When you have got your  burglars inside merrily ransacking a house, the last thing you want is  a noisy ruckus out on the front lawn. One liberal Justice exchanged for  another isn't worth a fuss when the loot is being shoveled out the  window to your gang.    If there was any honest concern about dark money on the Republican  side, there is a really, really easy way to show it: support  legislation to clean it up; put an end to it.   I have a bill, the DISCLOSE Act. It will end dark money in our  politics and in our judiciary. Every single Senate Democrat has voted  in favor of this DISCLOSE Act. Even the liberal groups that Judicial  Crisis Network complains about are backing that bill.   So, my Republican friends, support it, pass the law, end the slimy,  political, dark money era we now live in. They could do that, but I  will make you a bet that they won't. Dark money power is too important  a weapon for rightwing donors to abandon.   So, instead, Republicans in this Chamber filibuster that  legislation--filibuster it--and dark money continues to corrupt our  politics.   Brace yourselves, folks. Squid ink will flow in the weeks and months  ahead. For the dark money forces squirting out the squid ink, the aim  is defense, defense of their mighty prize: the Court that dark money  built and that dances to their dark money tune.   To be continued.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I have 12 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
