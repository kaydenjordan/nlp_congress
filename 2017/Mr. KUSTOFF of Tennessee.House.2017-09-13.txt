 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of  the en bloc package, which includes my amendment to increase funds to  the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas by $10 million.   After many grave conversations with law enforcement throughout my  district, it is crystal clear that this drug scourge is one of the top  concerns right now, if not the top concern.   Mr. Chairman, I know my colleagues are having similar discussions in  their districts, so they understand just how serious the issue is  becoming for the American people. Our drug task force in the Eighth  Congressional District of Tennessee desperately needs these funds, as  we have seen a spike in trafficking of narcotics across Interstate 40  in west Tennessee.   The spread of illegal drugs in west Tennessee and across the Nation  leads to higher crime rates, which means our local, State, and Federal  law enforcement are being stretched incredibly thin. But we must also  think of the resources needed to battle the drug addiction epidemics,  such as the opioid crisis. We should be proactive now because  prevention is the best long-term solution.   Our law enforcement are working tirelessly, but they simply do not  have the proper resources to effectively combat drug trafficking. We  must do more to support our law enforcement in this fight, and I  believe that increasing funds to the HIDTA program is a really good  first step.   No doubt, officers at the local, State, and Federal level have  expressed support for this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to  support these en bloc amendments.
