 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, access to high-speed internet is  absolutely essential in today's economy. It is the key component to our  Nation's innovation infrastructure.   Yet, on Tribal lands across this country, a digital divide exists.  According to the estimate from the U.S. Census Bureau, only 53 percent  of Native Americans living on Tribal lands have access to high-speed  internet, compared to 82 percent of households nationally.   A recent report by the Government Accountability Office examined how  the Federal Communications Commission collects, validates, and uses  data on broadband availability. It found that the FCC overstates the  availability of broadband internet service on Tribal lands.   For example, if a service provider reports that it could provide  broadband service internet access to at least one location in a census  block, the FCC considers broadband to be ``available'' in that census  block. That doesn't make much sense, and the GAO agreed.   It found that the FCC's available status is applied too broadly,  sometimes including communities without infrastructure that connects  homes to a service provider's network.   It also found that the FCC does not collect information on factors  such as affordability, quality, and denials of service. FCC data that  accurately captures the availability of broadband is critical because  the Federal Government relies on the data to make important  investments.   Without accurate data, the Federal Government will have difficulties  identifying the true needs and cannot make appropriate investments.  Part of the challenge in the lack of reliable data stems from the lack  of meaningful consultation and engagement with Tribal Nations.   Tribal consultation is more than just checking a box. It is important  for the FCC to not only listen to Tribes, but to actively engage and  learn from them. Only by doing so will we be better able to get  information on where the needs are. That will lead to better decisions  and better outcomes.   My amendment would implement one of the GAO's recommendations. It  would direct the FCC to seek feedback from Tribal stakeholders and  providers on the effectiveness of its Tribal consultation, as well as  ensure accessible and affordable broadband on Tribal lands.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0930     Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments from Congressman  Walden.   I would say, in this particular case with this particular amendment,  this is not the government asking for information from entities that  don't want to provide it. Just the opposite, the Tribal communities in  my State and across the United States of America want to provide this  information and want this very detailed consultation with the FCC so  that we can provide better investments on Tribal lands.   This is a situation where government involvement is very much  welcomed by the entities that we are asking the FCC to better consult  with. This is welcome government intervention.   Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
