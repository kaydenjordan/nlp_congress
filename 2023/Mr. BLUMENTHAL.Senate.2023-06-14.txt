 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Capt.  David Osborn, for his service to our Nation in the U.S. Marine Corps.   Captain Osborn entered the Marine Corps as a young man during World  War II. After training as a pilot, he was deployed to the Pacific  Theater where he was engaged in active combat. During his tenure in the  Marine Corps, Captain Osborn flew vitally important but deeply  dangerous missions, including several for which, he indicated, he  volunteered. In all, Captain Osborn's service contributed to the  American military successes in the Pacific Theater. After the war,  Captain Osborn continued his service as a flight instructor in Corpus  Christi, TX. Captain Osborn was honorably discharged from the U.S.  Marine Corps Reserve in March of 1958.   This year, Captain Osborn will celebrate his 100th birthday. He lives  in Weston, CT, with his wife of 41 years, and cherishes time spent with  his children and grandchildren. His honorable service is a model for  all of us and will leave an enduring legacy.   We all owe our veterans a great debt of gratitude for fighting for  our freedom and safety, and I hope my colleagues will join me in  thanking Captain David Osborn for his remarkable history of service to  our Nation.                            ____________________
