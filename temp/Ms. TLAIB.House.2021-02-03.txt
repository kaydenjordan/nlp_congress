 Mr. Speaker, this pandemic has taken the lives of nearly  16,000 Michiganders with 25 percent of the deaths from Wayne County and  the city of Detroit.   Our communities are forever changed. The U.S. is on a course to reach  500,000 deaths by February 20. That is a half a million lives lost.   And in response to this record death toll, Congress has sent out one  $1,200 check almost a year ago and another $600 check, for a total of  $1,800. That is an average of $163 per month.   Mr. Speaker, there is not a single person in this Chamber or in my  district who can survive on that little per month. My residents cannot  afford to wait. The bills don't stop after 1 month; neither should the  checks. The budget resolution ensures that we can do the work of  delivering urgent relief to our families and every single district  across the country.                                time  1615
