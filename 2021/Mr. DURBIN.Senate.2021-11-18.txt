 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it was 158 years ago tomorrow that Abraham  Lincoln delivered what I believe was the greatest speech ever uttered  by an American. He had been asked to say ``a few words'' at the  dedication at the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, PA.   Four months had passed since the great armies of the North and South  had clashed on that hallowed ground. They had fought for 3 days in the  searing July heat. When the slaughter finally ended, the battlefield  lay covered with the bodies of 50,000 dead and wounded soldiers and  officers. It was the bloodiest battle in the hellish Civil War.   What good could come from butchery and sorrow? What great purpose had  been worth such staggering loss? Those were the questions which Abraham  Lincoln pondered on his train ride to answer in Gettysburg.   He spoke for less than 3 minutes--just 272 words. In those 3 minutes,  he redefined the war as not a battle for territory or property, but for  human dignity and human equality.   He gave us a profound, simple, new definition of democracy:  ``Government of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' He  said the fallen soldiers had done all they could do. They had given  their ``last full measure of devotion'' to ensure democracy did not  perish from this Earth.   Now, Lincoln said, it was left to us, the living, to ``advance their  unfinished work''--in his words, to salvage from all of that death a  new birth of freedom.   He said that our Civil War was testing ``whether a nation, conceived  in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created  equal . . . can long endure.''   Can our democracy endure? It is a question that Lincoln pondered not  just at Gettysburg but throughout his life.   Twenty-five years before Gettysburg, he had considered that question  in a speech at the Young Men's Lyceum in Springfield, IL. He was a  young lawyer and a newly elected State legislator, just 29 years old.   It was a challenging time in America, as it is today. Anxiety was  high following a stock market panic the previous year. There was  growing violence in America. Abolitionists were being killed by pro- slavery defenders. Blacks and others were being lynched with alarming  frequency in the South. Lincoln feared that what he called ``the  justice of the mob'' might replace the rule of law. Sound familiar?   In a time of such anxiety, he questioned whether people might elect a  despot who would use his power to tear down the institutions of our  democracy, rather than preserve them.   In his most famous passage, he warned that if American democracy were  ever to perish, ``it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from  abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and  finisher.''   I heard those words quoted by a thoughtful Member of the House of  Representatives on the night of January 6, 2021, after the mob that  attacked this Capitol had gone and Congress had returned to complete  our duty to certify the electoral ballots and declare Joe Biden the  President of the United States.   The weapons and military programs that we will debate in the coming  days are important. They are essential to protect America. But weapons  alone cannot save us if we don't understand what we are fighting to  defend. There is only one sure way to preserve American democracy,  Lincoln told us. We must know our history. We should study the  Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, he said, as if they  were a Bible, so that we revere the principles upon which our democracy  is built.   Our democracy can't survive if we reject the great proposition for  which so many died at Gettysburg: that all people are created equal.  Our democracy cannot survive if we abide by the rule of law only when  it suits us. And it will not endure if we see each other as enemies  rather than as friends and citizens of one Nation that we all love.   We have seen a demonstration of that particular issue this week in  the House of Representatives.   In his book, ``Lincoln at Gettysburg,'' Garry Wills wrote that ``Up  to the Civil War, the United States was referred to as a plural noun.  `The United States are a free country.' After  [[Page S8411]]  Gettysburg, it became singular, `The United States is a free  country.'''   As it says above your head, Mr. President, ``e pluribus unum.''   As we look forward to celebrating our national holiday of  Thanksgiving, perhaps we could try a little harder to hear the ``mystic  chords of memory''--what a phrase--that unite us.   I think about that Gettysburg Address, and I was asked to give a  speech about the Gettysburg Address at Gettysburg many years ago. I  tried to set out whatever I had to say in 272 words. I think I did a  fair job, but I would give myself a passing grade, at best. But it was  a complete shock to my audience when I stopped at 272 words, and  Lincoln said that a speech doesn't have to be eternal to be immortal.    In our lives as public servants, we are called on to speak very  often. And I am reminded, time and again, the impact that Lincoln had  with so few words, to capture the moment, to give people hope, and to  craft phrases which still endure to this day as some of the most  masterful uses of the English language one can imagine.   Tomorrow, I hope we can take a moment to recall our childhood  education, when we were taught the Gettysburg Address and perhaps  recite what we can of it. And I hope we will remember, even in these  dark times, that we have faced harder times than this and we were  delivered and this Nation endured.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3251         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
