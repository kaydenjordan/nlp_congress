 Madam Speaker, I am glad to see yet another member of  our Congressional Hispanic Caucus presiding over the House this  afternoon, as I had the distinct honor of doing yesterday.   Madam Speaker, I have the privilege of serving as the whip of the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus during this, the 116th congressional  session, which is the most diverse in the history of this august body.   This Congress, we celebrate the largest class of Latino Members of  Congress in the history of the United States of America.   We are proud of the diversity and the talent in our caucus. We boast  about Members representing communities across our Nation, from as far  as Guam to the Northern Mariana Islands; leaders from all walks of  life--doctors, lawyers, labor organizers, teachers, clean-energy  experts--leaders of all different Hispanic heritage, some born right  here in the United States and others who came here with their families  to pursue the American Dream from Mexico; from Puerto Rico; from  Guatemala; from Cuba; some Portuguese; some Ecuadorian, as yourself,  Madam Speaker; and, of course, from the Dominican Republic, as myself.    As the CHC's whip, I want to showcase this incredible diversity of  talent, expertise, and culture. That is why we are organizing these  monthly CHC special order hours. Each month, Members of our caucus will  join me to discuss a set of issues affecting Hispanic communities  across America.   The issue we are discussing tonight will come as no surprise to  anyone: the need for comprehensive immigration reform.   The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has been working over the past few  weeks to lay out our border immigration reform principles, and we have  been working closely with House leadership as policies are put forward  on this critical issue.   Tonight, you will hear from a number of colleagues in the CHC about  why we believe we must fix our broken immigration system, but first,  let me start with a brief history.   Let me start with the history of a young Guatemalan mom named Yeni  Gonzalez. Madam Speaker, last night in this very Chamber, we heard from  the President of the United States, and, once again, he painted  immigrants as violent criminals, claiming that the only way to keep  America safe is a useless, medieval wall along our southern border.   By all accounts, President Trump has made immigrants demons. He has  demonized immigrants, especially undocumented immigrants, as a central  theme of his presidency, and last night was, by no means, any  exception.   As a former undocumented immigrant myself, I see it as my mission to  counter the many lies coming from the White House pertaining to  immigrants. One of the ways we can do that is to introduce the American  people to immigrants and to tell them our compelling stories.   That is why I brought, as my guest, to the State of the Union this  young Guatemalan mom, Yeni Gonzalez, one of the many people impacted by  the Trump administration's hateful and heartless zero tolerance policy.   Yeni and her family, as I said earlier, are refugees from Guatemala.  Yeni is from a small agricultural town and grew fearful for her  children's safety as violence continued to surge in her community and  throughout Central America.   In the face of break-ins at her home and worried that violent gangs  would try to recruit her 11-year-old son, Yeni did what any mom would  do, what any reasonable mom would do; She chose to seek safety.   Yeni got herself and her children all the way through Mexico and up  to Yuma, Arizona, where she was apprehended by Border Patrol.   She was not charged with a single crime. No one pressed any charges  against her. Still, she was taken into custody and placed in an  immigration detention facility where our own American government  treated her in ways in which we condemn other governments across the  world for treating others.                                time  1430    The facility she was held in became known as the Icebox, and I want  to tell the American people what that is, the Icebox. Because it is so  brutal and so uncomfortably cold, many immigrants who were held there  called it the Icebox.   According to Yeni, no one was given any food to eat for 2 straight  days, not even her young children. A few days later, Yeni watched as  her children were being released from detention, but she was forced to  stay; and what is worse, no one would tell her where they were being  sent to.   Imagine just for a moment, Madam Speaker, you fled your home, the  only place you have ever known, because it is no longer safe to be  there, with your children. You travel a long journey, nearly 1,000  miles, just to get your kids to a place that is safe. You arrive in  this new place hoping to find some security, and what happens to you?  You are locked up in a freezing cell called the Icebox, given no food  to eat, and have your children sent off without you knowing where they  really are. You left a violent place to give your children a better,  safer life, and you have them taken away from you.   The horrors this woman was forced to suffer are beneath the values  upon which this great Nation was founded. But despite the cruel  policies of the current administration, the kindness and good will of  the American people has not, for one moment, wavered.   Yeni was eventually released and able to touch base with a relative  in North Carolina. She found out her children were sent to a facility  in my own congressional district in Manhattan, in Harlem. And through  the work and support of volunteers, complete strangers who never met  her before, just trying to do the right things and right the wrongs of  their government, Yeni was driven all the way across the country. It  was a cross-country trip that she took to finally reunite with her  children.   I was able to work with her attorneys and the foster care facility to  finally  [[Page H1381]]  reunite Yeni and her children. It was a touching moment for everyone  involved to see Yeni finally reunited with her family.   Those volunteers, they are the America that I have come to know and  love. Those people who put their own needs aside to help a complete  stranger whom they knew nothing about, only that she was in distress,  represent the values that America stands for. As a father and as a  former undocumented immigrant myself, I was proud to play even a small  role in this incredible story.   You see, Madam Speaker, a woman seeking refuge for the safety of her  children is not some violent criminal, as was portrayed here last night  by the President of the United States. No matter what he said here last  night, Yeni Gonzalez is not a violent criminal. And if you have ever  seen a mother in distress for the safety of her children, you know that  no wall, no matter how high, will stop her.   And now it is our duty to deal with the many immigration myths that  were perpetrated on this floor last night as America watched.   Now, let me say to you that I want to begin a bit of immigration myth  busting, and I hope that President Trump and his acolytes at FOX News  are watching because they could use this important lesson.   We will start with my favorite, myth number one: immigrants are  violent criminals--false. In fact, all immigrants, documented or  undocumented, actually commit far less crime, lower rates of crime than  any native-born Americans or any naturalized Americans like you and I,  Madam Speaker.   As you can see, this chart, published by the Cato Institute, shows  that undocumented criminals commit crimes at far less than half the  rate of native-born U.S. citizens. Undocumented immigrants commit  crimes at even lower rates.   Now, when you think about this, it makes perfect sense. So many  immigrants come to the United States, in the first place, to flee  strife in their own countries of origin. Why would anyone fleeing crime  and violence just commit a crime in the new country that has harbored  them?   I don't know of any immigrant, man or woman, who leaves their house  to go to work seeking to get arrested, to then be deported. That is a  myth, and it is irrational.   Myth number two: the number of undocumented immigrants is growing due  to a porous southern border and people are flowing in--again, false.   Not only has the number of undocumented immigrants decreased over the  past few years, but the way most undocumented immigrants arrive in the  U.S. has completely changed from what it was just 15 years ago. The  data shows that only half as many people arrive by crossing our border  as those who legally enter the United States and overstay their visa,  and the number of those crossing at the Mexican border continues to  decrease.   Finally, myth number three: there is a crisis at our southern  border--again, false.   As you can see right here in this chart, Madam Speaker, the data  shows border crossings are at a historic low. Unlike what the President  said here last night, unlike what he tweets on any given night, there  is no crisis at the border. This has been fabricated. In fact, border  crossings are at a historic low.   Only a third as many people were apprehended and turned away from the  border in 2017 as there were in 2005. The only crisis at the border is  the humanitarian crisis that the President, himself, has created.   So now that we have dispelled some of these myths, let's talk about  what we need to do to actually fix our broken immigration system.   First and foremost, we must protect Dreamers. Dreamers are young  people who came here at a very young age. They are doctors; they are  homeowners and small business owners; they are police officers; they  are members of our Armed Forces; they are teachers--and they deserve to  stay here in our Nation.   Democrats have been talking about this for years, and President Obama  did what he could in the face of Republican opposition to make sure  that these young people have some stability and certainty. But  President Trump cruelly chose to take that away, and the Federa courts  had to step in and say: No, Mr. President, those young people deserve  to stay here. Now he wants to use them as a bargaining chip, and we  will not allow that to happen.    Next, we must protect recipients of temporary protected status, TPS.  The countries TPS recipients came here from are still dealing with  extraordinary crises, and we can't just send them back en masse. They  deserve certainty, too.   Next, we have to address family separation and the need to improve  family reunification. President Trump angrily refers to this as chain  migration. We call it family unification, and we know that when a  family is together, that family is stronger; and if that family is  stronger, our Nation is stronger.   So we want to continue to work to ensure that families are kept  together, but what he doesn't understand is that our immigration system  has been made stronger by allowing individuals to have their families  here with them once they are permanent residents.   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle truly stand for  family values, and family values has been touted by those folks on the  other side of the aisle for decades, if they truly stand for family  values, they should support the efforts to strengthen families and  support family reunification policies.   Finally, any reforms we make must reduce the outrageous backlog in  processing applications for legal status. Over the past few years, we  have seen waiting times grow and grow and grow.   Since 2014, the average processing time for cases has nearly doubled.  In some cases, by the time someone comes up, they have aged out of  their situation, and now they are no longer applicable, making them no  longer eligible for permanent legal status.   This administration's backlog just adds more undocumented immigrants  to our population and is the perfect example of how broken our system  is.   Over the rest of this hour, some of my CHC colleagues will talk more  about the specific issues we must address in comprehensive immigration  reform. Many of us agree that, to do the right thing by the American  people, we must start from the same set of facts and establish a shared  set of values.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
