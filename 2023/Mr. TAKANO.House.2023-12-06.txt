 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  4468, House Republican's latest attempt to undermine climate change  action taken by the Biden administration and dismiss the high risks  presented by air pollution for communities like mine.   My district falls within the South Coast Air Basin, which has the  worst air pollution in the entire country. Inland Empire residents have  higher levels of cardiovascular disease, childhood asthma, and other  respiratory diseases compared to the national average as a result.                                time  1315    The EPA's proposed rule, which this bill would inhibit, reduces car  emissions, drives innovation of clean technologies, and improves public  health in my district and across the country.   My constituents deserve to breathe clean air and live healthy lives.  We should all support EPA's efforts to address health disparities and  combat climate change.   Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues to vote against this bill.
