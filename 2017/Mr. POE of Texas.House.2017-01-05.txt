 Mr. Speaker, I have traveled to the southern border  dozens of times over the years, and the problem is always the same. The  people who defend our border--really, defend our country--do the best  they can with what they have got, but they are outmanned, outgunned,  and outfinanced by the drug cartels and the people coming across from  the other side.   The continued failure to protect our border threatens our national  security and the sovereignty of America. The reality is that the  majority of the southern border territory is controlled by someone  other than the United States. Why? Because there is no workable plan.  Also, there is no moral will by this administration to protect our  border.   My bill, the SMART Border Act, outlines a robust border protection  strategy that includes achieving operational control of the border  within 1 year, provides smart border technology, and mandates more  boots on the ground, including 10,000 National Guard troops at the  request of the four border State Governors.   Mr. Speaker, we must have the moral will to protect our borders. All  types of people are crossing the border into the United States  illegally--the good, the bad, and the ugly--and those days need to end.  No one should come into America without America's permission.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   The recent stunt at the United Nations targeting Israel is the latest  effort by this administration to cement a legacy of foreign policy that  has failed, especially with our trusted ally Israel. It has been U.S.  policy to veto any U.N. resolution dictating parameters on the Israeli- Palestinian peace process.   The reason is simple. True peace can only be achieved at the  negotiating table between the Palestinians and the Israelis, not at the  United Nations. The one-sided, anti-Israeli resolution will only make  peace harder.   The U.N. adopted 20 anti-Israeli resolutions last year, while passing  just 4 for the rest of the world. The U.N. is not fair and unbiased.  While pointing the finger solely at Israel, the recent resolution did  nothing to point out the Palestinians' lack of progress towards peace.   The Palestinian Authority has failed to stop violence against Jews.  It continues to--get this, Mr. Speaker--make payments to jailed  Palestinian terrorists who have harmed or killed Jews.   Over the years, Israel has traded land for promised peace. They have  no peace. And soon, if the United Nations gets its way, they will have  no land.   Despite the administration's policy of abandoning our trusted ally  Israel, the United States Congress must stand with our ally Israel.   And that is just the way it is.
