 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 148th  Kentucky Derby winner Rich Strike, and Rich Strike's owner, OU grad and  Edmond native, Rick Dawson.   Rich Strike made history at the 148th Kentucky Derby overcoming 80-1  odds. This monumental victory is even more impressive as Rich Strike  was not supposed to be in the Kentucky Derby, entering only after  another horse was scratched. Rich Strike was added a mere 34 hours  before the race was set to begin.   Congratulations to Rich Strike and Rick Dawson for bringing the  Kentucky Derby to Oklahoma's Fifth Congressional District.                            ____________________
