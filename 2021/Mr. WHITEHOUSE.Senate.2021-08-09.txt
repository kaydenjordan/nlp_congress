 Madam President, I am delighted to follow my  distinguished chairman on the Finance Committee as he gives assurances  about our important work on climate change.   The majority leader has announced that the final vote on the  bipartisan infrastructure package will be tomorrow at 11 a.m., and we  will then roll into the rather ignominious spectacle of the Senate  known as vote-arama. What vote-arama does, however, it allows us to go  to budget reconciliation, which allows us to pass measures with a  simple majority.   We should do that bearing in mind what just came out--the latest IPCC  report on climate change. It is getting increasingly dire. The IPCC  report uses words like ``unequivocal,'' ``unprecedented,''  ``irreversible.''   Unequivocal is the link between fossil fuel pollution and the climate  damage we are doing to our oceans and atmosphere--unequivocal.   Unprecedented. We talk about unprecedented around here if it hasn't  happened in a decade. They talk about unprecedented across many  centuries or many thousands of years. We are undoing the basic  operating systems of our planet as humankind has come to know them.   Irreversible means, for some of this, there is no going back. We were  warned and warned and warned. We ignored it and ignored it and ignored  it, and now we are in it. We can make it less bad, but parts are  irreversible. As one United Nations spokesman said, this is red alert  for humanity.   It doesn't take the IPCC or the U.N. or the universities in our home  States or our environmental community to tell us this. All we have to  do is look around. Look at the wildfires that are tearing through the  West. Senator Padilla was here earlier today talking about what is  going on in California.   Here is a report from California, from the head of the Plumas  National Forest, its supervisor:         We are seeing truly frightening fire behavior, I don't know       how to overstate that. We have a lot of veteran firefighters       who have served for 20, 30 years and have never seen behavior       like this, especially day after day, and the conditions we're       in. So we really are in unchartered territory around some of       these extreme, large fires and the behavior we're seeing.    That is the report from the front of the wildfires. But we are not  just in unchartered territory with wildfires; we are in unchartered  territory with respect to flooding. Here is what we are predicting in  Rhode Island. Right now, this is the northern part of my State.  Everything you see here that is a bright-blue color, that is land right  now. People live there. People have businesses there. People have  recreation there. There are things that people do that are part of  their lives there, and it all disappears under current predictions of  sea level rise. It disappears   This is a place called Warwick Neck. It becomes Warwick Neck Island.  This is a place called Poppasquash Point. It becomes two little islands  off of Bristol, and Bristol becomes its own island. Barrington gains  sort of the Barrington Great Salt Lake in the middle of it, and now you  have an island along what is now Barrington's southern coast. We stop  being Rhode Island, and we become the Rhode Island Archipelago. That is  a big change, and if I can stop it, I am going to.   Drought. You have seen the pictures of the western lakes at alltime  lows, and the dependence of those Western States on water is acute. The  hurricane cycle we are already in has warnings about how serious the  coming hurricane season is going to be.   If you step down to God's creatures, you have manatees that are dying  in unprecedented numbers in Florida. Off the northwest coast, in the  Pacific Ocean, you have the humble tetrapod, a tiny, small oceanic  snail that just happens to be a big part of the bottom of the ocean  food chain. Half of the tetrapods sampled have severe shell damage  because of ocean acidification, which is happening because the ocean  absorbs carbon dioxide, and it turns acidic when it happens. I have  proven that little experiment from this desk early in the morning once.   Our Atlantic fisheries are all in flux, all moving. Our Connecticut  and Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts lobster fisheries pretty  much collapsed. Species that farmers didn't used to see are now turning  up in our waters.   There were these horrible stories about the heat that Chairman Wyden  spoke about. Small birds get so disoriented in the heat as fledglings  that they jump out of their nests to get away and then, of course,  become prey and incapable of getting back to their nests on the ground.  And birds generally and insect populations generally are crashing.   We think about this very often in terms of looking back at what we  have been through, and we are told over and over again and we know from  our own experience that this past year has been the worst in the last  10 years or the last 20 years across all of these measures. But I want  you to think about this. Yes, it has been the worst year in the last 10  or 20 years, but here is what else we know and here is what the IPCC  report warns us: It is the best year of the next 10 or 20. This is  getting worse, period--end of story. We can slow down it getting worse,  and we can slowly turn it around, but the disasters we are seeing now  are child's play compared to what is coming.   So action is now necessary, and thankfully, our timing is such that  we have a reconciliation measure starting tomorrow that gives us the  tools to take action. We have to do this now, and unfortunately, we  have to do this alone.   There are three sad facts about our predicament. One is, we can't  count on Republicans. If we lose the House next year, as people are  predicting, to gerrymandered States, we are done getting serious about  climate because we know perfectly well that since the Citizens United  decision, no Republican has gotten on a serious climate bill in the  Senate--not one. It used to be bipartisan.   John McCain ran for President on a climate plan that was very good.  There were three or four different serious climate bills kicking around  before Citizens United. But then Citizens United came. Unlimited money  came. The fossil fuel industry used unlimited money, and they shut down  the Republican Party on climate.   They said: We are tolerating no dissent any longer. You are all going  to line up and do as you are told. If you don't do what you are told,  we will do what we did to Bob Inglis--take him out in a primary. And if  you do as you are told, we will send boatloads of dark money to throw  into elections through super PACs.   You have a party that is hip deep in fossil fuel money and has a  decade--a lost decade--in which it would do nothing serious about  climate. So, unfortunately, and to the great sorrow of my friend John  Warner, who passed away recently, and John McCain and others who worked  hard before this when the Republican Party was less dependent  [[Page S6189]]  on fossil fuel money, unfortunately, we have to do it alone.   We can't count on the fossil fuel industry to mend its ways. They  have been at a decade of lying. They built this, an entire web of  phony-baloney front groups all paid for with fossil fuel money--in the  hundreds of millions, billions of dollars--to put out fake science, to  hide who they are behind the dark money, behind these front groups.  They ran an enormous corrupt scheme to fool Americans and block  progress here in this building so that they could keep polluting. And  now we are supposed to count on them? No way.   They still haven't come clean about their years of funding denial,  and they won't come clean. Guess why. Because they are still at it.  Their CEOs will say one thing at a press conference, but this machine  of disinformation and obstruction--this machine is still funded, and it  is still rolling. So you can't count on the fossil fuel industry to  change its ways.    Third, unfortunately--and I really hate to say this--you can't count  on corporate America. They are full of great statements. CEOs go to the  business roundtables, and they go to the Climate Leadership Council,  and they go to C2ES. They join series and talk about their support for  climate and how it is urgent and how they support carbon pricing. But  when it comes to the levers of power here in this building, forget  about it. They have built the most powerful lobbying and electioneering  apparatus in our country's history. Trade association after trade  association, business group after business group--not one has been  switched on to do anything about climate.   By the way, when it is a CEO giving a press conference in New York,  but that trade association is saying nothing or ``Don't do it,'' guess  who people listen to here in Washington. They listen to that trade  association. They know what greenwashing is, and they know when  corporate America is serious. At this moment, no major trade  association is taking any interest in climate action.   The chamber of commerce--nothing. They are embroiled in a long  conversation with members of theirs who are fed up with their climate  denial, but they have done nothing.   The National Association of Manufacturers--also nothing. They were  recently the two worst climate obstructers in America. Have they  changed their direction? No. Now they are just climate obstruction  light, climate obstruction 2.0.   Look at API, the American Petroleum Institute. This one is pretty  funny. They come out and they say they support carbon pricing. They are  going to support putting a cost on pollution, on greenhouse gas. And  then we come out of the Budget Committee and we announce, as Leader  Schumer did, that we are going to actually price methane, another  greenhouse gas--an even more potent greenhouse gas and actually kind of  a dangerous one--so, uh-oh, suddenly it looks real. Somebody might  actually price methane. And what did API to? Came out against it.   Now, you tell me how you can be for pricing a milder greenhouse gas  in order to help address climate change but against pricing an even  more toxic chemical to help solve climate change. It makes no sense.  The only way you can reconcile those two things is with the statement  of the Exxon lobbyists that the only reason the industry is talking  about carbon pricing is because it doesn't think it is going to happen.  It is another fake. It is another scheme. It is another denial and  obstruction--in this case, probably 5.0.   The American Bankers Association. You read from central banks around  the country warnings about the economic crash that is going to happen  if we don't get ahead of the climate problem. Those are the central  banks' warnings, but what did the American Bankers Association have to  say to us? Nothing.   Insurance companies are screaming about the risks that they are  facing now from worse hurricanes, worse flooding, worse droughts, worse  wildfires; claims going up, difficulty anticipating what risks are, and  hard-to-price insurance. Yet where is the American Insurance  Association? Silent.   Freddie Mac has warned us that there is going to be a coastal  property values crash as those sea levels rise and, as you can predict,  that that home is going to be literally under water in the 30-year  mortgage period, not just figuratively under water--so no mortgage, no  insurance, no market; hence, our property values crash.   And where is the Realtors Association? Where are the American Home  Builders? Silent.   The American Beverage Association. Oh, Coke and Pepsi talk a really  big game. What is the American Beverage Association doing on this?  Nothing.   And all those big barons out in Silicon Valley are represented by a  group called TechNet. A year ago, they didn't even mention climate  change in their lobbying materials. They didn't even mention clean or  renewable energy, and they have clean and renewable energy companies in  their membership.   So we cannot count on corporate America to take climate change  seriously here, where a solution is needed. So this is on us.   And I will tell you, we intend to--I intend to--meet the moment. And  there are those out there who will grouse and complain. And to you, I  say: Too damned bad. You have had years to help, and you did nothing or  worse. So you have lost your right to complain.   But under pressure of the facts and the realities of what is going on  around us, under pressure of the warnings about this being  irreversible, unequivocal, and unprecedented, we are going to act. We  are going to act.   And I don't want to hear your complaining because you had a decade to  come in and try to do something about this and you shirked your  responsibilities for a decade, you funded trade associations that were  doing nothing, you funded these creepy front groups that were attacking  us on climate change. So you lost your right to complain.   And in the next 6 or 7 or 8 weeks, as we go through building this  reconciliation instruction, we aren't just going to address climate  change, we are not just going to do more than has ever been done  before; we are going to get on a safe pathway for this country and for  the planet.   Because I will tell you, ``more than we have ever done before on  climate'' is a pathetically low bar because, for a decade, thanks to  the fossil fuel industry and its web of denial and its control over the  Republican Party, we have done nothing on climate.   So we have got a lot of catching up to do. Reconciliation gives us  the chance to do it. I pray to God that we meet the moment.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 107, S.  1917.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
