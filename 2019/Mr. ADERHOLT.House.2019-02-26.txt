 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the joint resolution to overturn  the President's declaration. I think it is very clear that there is a  national emergency that exists on our southern border because of the  high rate of unchecked, unregulated illegal immigration, illegal  immigration that is directly contributing to the flow of drugs, human  trafficking, and gang members into this country, not to mention the  humanitarian crisis of those who feel compelled to make this journey to  illegally enter this country.   I think there seems to be some confusion among many of my colleagues  and maybe many across the country about the action of the President.   President Trump is clearly acting within the authority that is  provided by Congress to confront a border security and humanitarian  crisis that constitutes a national emergency.   The threat to our border security is evident from the sheer number of  migrants seeking to gain illegal entry into this country, and  especially the number of criminal aliens in the form of cartels,  traffickers, and gangs. These people will continue to take advantage of  our weak borders for their own gain.   I recognize that Congress has lawfully enacted the authority for the  President to use military construction funds to support Armed Forces to  engage in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this joint  resolution, as the crisis at the border is real.
