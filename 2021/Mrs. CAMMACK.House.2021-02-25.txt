 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor  hometown heroes in my district and across the Nation, these proud  Americans embodying the persistent, giving, and fighting spirit of our  national creed.   The COVID pandemic has put our country and our communities to the  test, pushing us to seek positivity and hope in each day as we have  weathered the storms that have come our way.   Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight the great work and service of my  constituents who have shown bravery and empathy in these trying times.   Last week, I invited the constituents of Florida's Third  Congressional District, the Gator Nation, to submit their nominations  for individuals they would like to honor for their dedication to our  communities over the last year. I received several nominations with the  names of constituents who have gone above and beyond the call of duty,  who put service above self, so many nominations, in fact, that we have  pledged to continue this series throughout the year to highlight their  great work.   Included in this group are first responders, law enforcement  officers, teachers, nurses, and Good Samaritans. They are the backbone  of our communities. I am honored to be able to represent them in  Congress and share their stories with you today.   The first is my friend, and the only woman sheriff in the great State  of Florida, Sheriff Michelle Cook. Sheriff Cook, in her long tenure in  law enforcement, has walked the beat and fought against the scourge of  the opioid epidemic and human trafficking in Clay County.   She is also the proud mother to four foster children, who she  lovingly brought into her own home to prevent their separation. She  works every day to protect our community and our great county of Clay  County. I am so grateful for her service.   Thank you, Sheriff Cook.   Now, much like Sheriff Cook, Sergeant Kim Miller put service above  self as a member of the Green Cove Springs Police Department. While  Sergeant Miller celebrated her retirement earlier this year, she has  spent the last 15 years of her life dedicated to the children of Clay  County and their safety and development.   She is proud to have been the first Black female sergeant for the  Green Cove Springs Police Department and continues to make the citizens  of Clay County proud.   It was always a pleasure seeing Sergeant Miller's smiling face when I  visited the department, and I congratulate her on her retirement this  year. Although she is not on the force any longer, her service to the  Green Cove Springs community is remarkable. I am honored to celebrate  her here today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Carl).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama. Even  though, the SEC Nation, we may be rivals on game day, when it comes to  honoring our hometown heroes, we are united, and I appreciate you  taking the time to share these stories.   Mr. Speaker, before I yield to another one of my great colleagues, I  want to highlight a great man, Mr. Mike Leader, from Fleming Island,  Florida, who is an active duty physician proudly serving in the United  States Navy.   Mike was deployed in April 2020 to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and  he has been working tirelessly to save lives over the last year. His  wife, Adriane, and his three children have remained strong and positive  during his time away from home, recognizing his sacrifice for our  fellow Americans.   Mike is set to be deployed again next month to once again take up the  fight against this pandemic, and he and his family will be in my  thoughts and prayers as he continues the fight to end COVID-19.   I would also like to honor Orange Park native Peggie French. Ms.  French is what her nominators call an angel to seniors. Ms. French  spends hours every single week scheduling vaccines for seniors in Clay  County. She has become somewhat of an expert in the process and even  helps to monitor the vaccine sites for cancelations to help seniors  trying to get appointments.   To date, she has helped over 60 senior citizens to get appointments  for the COVID-19 vaccine in her spare time. I visited the COVID  vaccination sites in my district a few weeks ago, where these very  seniors that she helped were being vaccinated. I want to thank Peggie  and those just like her for helping folks in our area.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the great  State of Oklahoma. It has been an honor so far serving with her in this  Congress, and I expect that we will be hearing many more stories of  great Oklahomans who are doing incredible work in our communities.   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to honor a gentleman who is  much like my husband, a hero and a firefighter. Justin Dean serves the  Orange Park Fire Department and its city both in his capacity as a  firefighter and as a heroic private citizen. Mr. Dean was driving home  one afternoon recently when he noticed a car parked on the side of the  bridge near Doctor's Lake. He pulled his vehicle over, proceeded to  talk to the woman standing at the top of the bridge, and he offered her  a hug. When she accepted, Firefighter Dean jumped into action and  pulled her tightly over the rail to safety. He was awarded a  meritorious award for his brave, lifesaving action.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Justin.   Mr. Speaker, Rhonda Wilson is a hero from my hometown of Gainesville,  Florida. She wears many hats in our community. She is a middle school  teacher, a thespian, a theater director, and a philanthropist. She  founded the Star Center Theatre nearly two decades ago and, in the  years since, has provided an opportunity for local children and  families to perform and enjoy fine arts.   A portion of all the theatre's proceeds go to Created Gainesville, a  nonprofit committed to reaching and restoring women caught in sex  trafficking and sexual exploitation in Gainesville. Rhonda's work is  especially impactful to me, as I have worked to eliminate human  trafficking from our District and our State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Donalds).    Mr. Speaker, as a fellow Floridian, I look forward to  getting to know the gentleman's hometown heroes at some point in the  near future. I thank the gentleman for joining me here on the floor of  the people's House to honor the hometown heroes who make up the great  State of Florida.   Last, but certainly not least, I would like to recognize my friend  and the great sheriff of Marion County, Sheriff Billy Woods. I have  known Billy for nearly a decade, and in that time, I have seen his  passion for helping people. I am proud to have worked with Sheriff  Woods on combating human trafficking in the State of Florida, as well  as taking on criminal drug traffickers and supporting the rights of  lawful gun owners. I am also proud to recognize his tireless efforts  tonight to protect and serve our ever-growing community in Marion  County. I know Billy to be a man of integrity, grit, and honesty. He is  a tremendous defender of freedom and security, and I am proud to call  him and his wife, Samantha, dear friends.   I am deeply grateful for all of the people who have spoken here  today. Their work and their efforts to make my district and its many  communities a better place to live and raise a family do not go  unnoticed. They make me proud to be an American and the Representative  from Florida's Third Congressional District. I chose to celebrate these  hometown heroes today to honor their work and celebrate their passion  for helping others. I challenge my constituents and all Americans to  take stock of the everyday heroes all around us and thank them for what  they do.   Whether it is working as a frontline healthcare worker in a local  clinic, a law enforcement officer supporting children, librarians  assisting students with virtual learning, or a delivery worker ensuring  that we all get our critical packages on time, they are all--and there  are so many more out there--extraordinary Americans who continue to put  duty above all else.   I thank the nominees and the nominators of today's heroes. Again, I  look forward to continuing this yearlong series of honoring our  hometown heroes, and I look forward to hearing more of my colleagues'  stories from their hometown heroes.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity here tonight to honor  these heroes, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
