The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 4.  It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of July 20, 2017, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules, as though       under clause 1 of rule XV, relating to the bill (H.R. 2825)       to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make certain       improvements in the laws administered by the Secretary of       Homeland Security, and for other purposes.        Sec. 5.  The Committee on Appropriations may, at any time       before 5 p.m. on Friday, July 21, 2017, file privileged       reports to accompany measures making appropriations for the       fiscal year ending September 30, 2018.    The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The gentlewoman from  Wyoming is recognized for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Wyoming?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Wyoming?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 454,  which provides a structured rule for the consideration of H.R. 2910,  the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas  Pipelines Act; H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy  Infrastructure Act; and H.R. 218, the King Cove Road Land Exchange Act.   Mr. Speaker, our domestic energy industry has suffered greatly over  the last 8 years under outdated regulations and burdensome bureaucratic  red tape that have prohibited growth and innovation. Today's rule  allows for consideration of two very important bills that will provide  clear and transparent policies for our pipeline permitting processes,  making them more efficient and effective so that we can fully realize  the North American energy boom; create American jobs; grow our economy;  and strengthen our relations with our largest energy trading partners,  Canada and Mexico.   The first bill, H.R. 2910, the Promoting Interagency Coordination for  Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act, is sponsored by my colleague, Mr.  Flores of Texas.                                time  1245    This bill reinforces the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's role  as the lead agency for siting interstate natural gas pipelines by  directing it to identify and invite all agencies considering an aspect  of an application to establish a schedule for concurrent reviews, and  to impose deadlines for final decisions.   Recent advancements in energy exploration have allowed companies to  tap into previously inaccessible natural gas reserves, leading to a  dramatic increase in domestic production. The increased supply has  lowered energy costs and increased demand for natural gas.   As a result, current U.S. pipelines are now operating near capacity,  making new pipelines necessary to deliver gas to consumers across the  Nation, especially to those in the Northeast and Midwest, where demand  for energy is high, but where they lack the infrastructure to deliver  domestic natural gas. Additionally, due to its abundance and  affordability, many manufacturers are beginning to rely on natural gas  as a primary fuel.   Unfortunately, the permitting process for new pipelines is arduous  and unnecessarily burdensome. Currently, when siting a pipeline  project, multiple permits are required, including permits under the  Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Clean Air Act, for  example. According to the Government Accountability Office, the average  processing time from pre-filing to certification for interstate natural  gas pipelines has been 558 days. We cannot afford to wait that long,  Mr. Speaker.   It is critical that we expand and modernize our Nation's pipeline  infrastructure to ensure the access to affordable energy and affordable  prices for consumers across the country. In order to do this, we simply  must promote timely and efficient reviews as well as coordination among  Federal, State, and local regulators. This bill accomplishes these  goals, and I support its passage.   The rule we are discussing today also provides for consideration of  H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act,  sponsored by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin). This bill  creates a uniform and transparent process to authorize the  construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of international  transfers of oil, natural gas, and electricity imports and exports.   The bill directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to review  cross-border oil and natural gas pipelines and the Department of Energy  to review cross-border electric transmission facilities, requiring the  relevant official to issue a certificate of crossing, unless it is  found not to be in the public interest.  [[Page H5993]]    Recent advances in technology, Mr. Speaker, have dramatically  increased our ability to harness our vast natural resources, but the  current ad hoc permitting process has inhibited energy producers from  exporting American-made energy to our international trading partners  and has significantly delayed recent proposals, such as the Keystone XL  pipeline.   The value of energy traded between the United States and its North  American neighbors exceeded $140 billion in 2015, with $100 billion in  U.S. energy imports, and over $40 billion in exports. We simply cannot  afford to gamble our energy security and competitiveness on an  inefficient permitting process.   Today's rule, Mr. Speaker, also allows for consideration of H.R. 218,  the King Cove Road Land Exchange Act, sponsored by the gentleman from  Alaska (Mr. Young). This bill authorizes an equal value land exchange  to facilitate the construction of an 11-mile road linking the remote  city of King Cove and the city of Cold Bay, which has a modern airport.  The State of Alaska will transfer approximately 43,000 acres to the  Department of the Interior to add to the Izembek National Wildlife  Refuge in return for 206 acres of Federal lands to build the road.   This road is critical, Mr. Speaker, because harsh winter conditions  make transporting individuals in the remote King Cove community of  nearly 1,000 people dangerous and sometimes fatal: gale-force winds  ground planes and prevent sea travel; evacuations can take days; and  the hovercraft terminal and medical facility that Congress temporarily  provided funds for, in lieu of land for the road, ceased operation in  2010.   The King Cove community has been denied proper hospital care and  access to essential emergency services since they began fighting for  this road 40 years ago, and that, Mr. Speaker, is unacceptable.   Ensuring these folks have ground transportation options for accessing  the regional hub at Cold Bay, especially during harsh winters, is vital  to the safety of this community in emergency situations.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for the rule for these  important bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Alaska (Mr. Young), my friend and colleague, and the sponsor of H.R.  218.   (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I share my colleague's dedication to job creation, and what we know  is that the kind of job creation we need in this Nation can only come  with access to reliable, affordable sources of energy. Our fossil fuels  in this country are a national treasure, and these bills that are being  considered under this rule today are bills that would help to  streamline the regulatory process.    We have been, Mr. Speaker, really facing a war on fossil fuels during  the course of the last 8 years. We have seen these industries targeted,  completely unfairly targeted, based on some notion that, by shutting  down our fossil fuel industry, we are somehow going to be able to  continue to have economic growth. We have seen the environmental  officials of the previous administration even admit before this body  that things like the Clean Power Plan would result, if fully  implemented, in a negligible impact on the environment.   So, again, I think that it is important to recognize that it is at  the center of the agenda that we are pushing forward, frankly, with  historic progress in this Congress to begin to generate the kind of  economic growth that we really need to get back on track.   We have been stagnant now for 8 years. We have seen overreach from  the Federal Government. We have seen a situation in which companies,  industry, individuals, and small businesses are strangled by regulatory  red tape.  [[Page H5995]]    No one is suggesting that there shouldn't be oversight. No one is  suggesting that there shouldn't be environmental review, but what we  know is we have got to streamline it.   We cannot be in a position where bureaucrats--and, frankly, it is  often unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.--impose absolutely  unattainable restrictions, impose rules that our industry can't meet  and prevent us from being able to have access to our own energy  sources. Again, it is that reliable, affordable energy that will allow  our economy to grow and bring back the jobs that the gentleman says,  and to which I agree, are so important for this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Williams).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I understand that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't  want to talk about energy. They don't want to talk about fossil fuels.  They don't want to talk about how important these are to the economy.   I would propose, Mr. Speaker, maybe what we should do is turn out the  lights in this Chamber. Maybe we ought to turn off the air  conditioning, Mr. Speaker, and we could have the debate in the dark,  which is where we would be, frankly, if we followed the energy policies  in the approach of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.    These bills are hugely important, Mr. Speaker, to ensure that we are  able to continue to get access to the energy that we need; and it is  crucially important that we not skip over the burden that has been  caused by the Federal Government, by the regulatory burden we have been  feeling, and that we take action, as is our responsibility, to begin to  help to roll back that overreach, to begin to help to provide some  relief so that we can, in fact, get the jobs back that our colleagues  say they desire so much and that we know we need.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am proud to be here, and I am proud of the agenda that we have  taken up under the Republican leadership in this Congress. We are  indeed doing the important work that the people sent us here to do.   So far, just a list of some of the things that we have done in the  first few months of this Congress: We have taken the first step in our  obligation to repeal and replace ObamaCare, a system that is absolutely  failing, that is causing rising premiums. It is causing people to lose  their insurance all across the Nation, a system that will collapse if  we don't fix it. We, the House Republicans, have taken important steps  in order to begin the repeal and replace process of ObamaCare.   Also, Mr. Speaker, we have passed a bill to repeal and replace Dodd- Frank, legislation that was strangling our local community banks across  the country. We have taken a step to begin to fix that and provide  relief.   We have also dealt with important immigration issues and taken  important action in terms of passing legislation to end human  trafficking.   I am very proud, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, of the  work that we have done to pass the National Defense Authorization Act  to begin to rebuild our military and get the military the resources it  needs so that it can defend us against a growing array of threats and a  very complex array of enemies across the Nation.   We have also, Mr. Speaker, taken important steps using the  congressional review action process to repeal regulations put in place  over the last 8 years that have been damaging to our industry, to  individuals, to small businesses all across the Nation.    We have been historically productive, and it may be that our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't agree with the steps  that we have taken, but it is simply not accurate to say we aren't  focusing on what is important. We are focusing on those issues that  matter most to the men and women across this Nation that will begin to  make sure we can keep everybody safe, begin to make sure we can defend  ourselves, begin the process of reforming our outdated and burdensome  tax code, as well, Mr. Speaker, as ensuring we bring back the kind of  economic growth we know we need and fixing our healthcare system.   These bills that we are debating today, the rule for these bills, are  part of that process. I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Flores, Mr.  Mullin, and Mr. Young, for their hard work on this legislation.   In Wyoming, which is one of our Nation's largest energy-producing  States, we know how important it is that we work to develop our  domestic energy resources. We know the technology that has been  available that has helped us do that, that has helped us begin to, for  the first time ever, have energy independence that has really helped us  begin to have the kind of economic growth we need.   We cannot depend just on that technology. We also have got to improve  the permitting process, Mr. Speaker. Improving the pipeline permitting  process by promoting the kind of timely review, supporting interagency  coordination, and creating a new and streamlined system for safety that  will help us to transport our energy exports and imports are all  crucial steps in our ability to ensure affordable energy and economic  growth.   The other bill that we are considering under this rule, Mr. Speaker,  H.R. 218, will provide a desperately needed road, as you heard my  colleague Mr. Young explain, to improve the safety and well-being of  the residents of King Cove, Alaska, and save lives, Mr. Speaker.   Therefore, I urge adoption of both the rule and the underlying bills.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 454 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       685) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage       domestic insourcing and discourage foreign outsourcing. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and       Means. After general debate the bill shall be considered for       amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 685.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate  [[Page H5997]]       vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mitchell). The question is on ordering  the previous question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion.   The Clerk read as follows:         Ms. Cheney moves that the appeal be laid on the table.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
