 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4, the  John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. I am proud to be an  original cosponsor of this vital legislation. This is one of the most  important bills we will consider this Congress.   Voting rights are the foundation of our democracy, ensuring that  every American gets a fair say in who represents them and who makes the  laws governing their lives.   Voting rights have been under attack all across this country. This  year alone, 30 new discriminatory voting restriction laws have targeted  communities of color, young people, and working people across 18  States. We cannot allow this in America.   This critical legislation will restore voting rights protections and  provide the tools necessary to ensure discriminatory voting laws cannot  stand. There is nothing more American than protecting the right to  vote.   I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Sewell, for her  leadership. I thank Chairman Nadler, Speaker Pelosi, and all the  leadership for the important work they are doing to ensure that voting  rights are protected for all Americans.   I want to end by taking a moment to recognize and remember the late  Congressman John Lewis, our colleague and friend, one of history's  greatest fighters for equality and voting rights, after whom this  legislation is so appropriately named.
