 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McClintock as well as the  great leadership of the House Natural Resources Committee.   This legislation impacts residents on Navarre Beach and Pensacola  Beach in Florida's First Congressional District. Some of those  residents are now being double taxed because they have been forced to  pay ad valorem property tax payments to the government in addition to  lease payments. This legislation will grant fee simple title to these  affected residents so that they are not double taxed and simply make an  ad valorem payment like all other Floridians.
