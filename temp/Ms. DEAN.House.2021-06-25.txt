 Mr. Speaker, today is day 173 of this Congress and the  150th of the Biden administration. These days have been spent governing  to repair our global standing, to accelerate our vaccination program,  and to boost a struggling economy.   With the American Rescue Plan, we have governed to build back better  for red districts, for blue districts, for all districts.   In my district alone, here are some of the ways we have begun to  build back better: with over $87 million for our school districts, $137  million for local governments, $1.5 million for Head Start programs,  and the child tax credit will send an average of $2,400 to 37,000  families.   The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has received $7.3 billion, a  transformative amount, that must address educational and opportunity  inequities.   In these 100 days, we have proven we can live up to a responsibility  to govern. As we begin to emerge from this pandemic, we are at a  turning point where we can build on the success of the American Rescue  Plan, find infrastructure investments, and look toward a stronger, more  compassionate future.                            ____________________
