 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for hosting this  Special Order.   Madam Speaker, for the past year, we have seen policies from the  Biden administration devastate families and small businesses across the  country. Moms in my district, like Meghan, have seen the cost of  filling up their tanks and heating their homes continue to climb.   The average American family will spend an extra $1,300 in gas this  year. And Biden's Green New Deal energy policies have left us weak  abroad and crushed us economically at home. The national average for a  gallon of gasoline is now $4.17--the highest ever on record. There is  nothing to stop that number from going even higher as we head into the  summer.   But the prices at the pump today are not the result of just the  recent events in Eastern Europe. If we look at gas prices on January  21, 2021, just one day after President Biden took office, the national  average was $2.40.   One year later, on January 20, 2022--before Putin ruthlessly invaded  Ukraine--the national average was already $3.33. President Biden and  the Congressional Democrats are solely responsible for the year-over- year increase. And the anti-American energy agenda prevented the United  States from maintaining our energy independence at a critical moment in  history.   That is why it is so important that we have good, permanent policies  in place that encourage production here at home, keeping our prices low  for American families and small businesses, and ensure that we maintain  stability when bad actors disrupt the world.   We should buy American first. We should buy American oil first. When  the United States isn't reliant on foreign oil, we can better address  the global threats of tyrants and dictators.   Madam Speaker, it is time we prioritize American energy production  again that will put American families first and keep our country safe.
