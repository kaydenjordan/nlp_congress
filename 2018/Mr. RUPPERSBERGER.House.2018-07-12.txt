 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking member  for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan bill. First  and foremost, intelligence is about people. We cannot collect, analyze,  and utilize intelligence effectively unless we can recruit, hire, and  retain the best people possible. Therefore, I want to thank Chairman  Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff, and their staffs, for working with me  to include provisions in this bill that improve parental leave policies  of the intelligence community.   These provisions will ensure that these benefits are, to the fullest  extent possible, in line with the private sector. Doing so will help  the IC develop and retain the workforce required to keep America safe  against all our foes, both new and old.   This legislation also takes important steps to ensure the IC provides  critical updates to Congress in the event the United States faces a  foreign cyber attack or other active measures that threaten the heart  of our democracy: our elections. There is no doubt that Russia will  continue to exert a malign influence on the heart and soul of our  democracy.   This cannot be tolerated, and I strongly support the efforts of the  chairman and ranking member to ensure Congress will be informed of the  most critical threats to our democracy.   I thank the chairman and ranking member, and the entire intelligence  community and staff, for their dedicated oversight of the intelligence  community and their commitment to enhancing national security.
