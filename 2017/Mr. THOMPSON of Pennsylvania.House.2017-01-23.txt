 Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the  good work of the Congressional German-American Caucus and to urge new  Members of the House to consider joining.   I am cochairman of the caucus with Representative Bill Keating from  Massachusetts. The caucus seeks to highlight the friendship and the  alliance between the United States and Germany. We do so through an  Oktoberfest networking event and through our support of programs like  the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange internship program. The caucus  also discusses timely topics, such as trade, security, and foreign  affairs, and how they relate to our German counterparts.   Mr. Speaker, German heritage has become widespread in America.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Germans are the largest single  ethnic group in the United States. Frederick Muhlenberg, a German  immigrant and Lutheran pastor from Pennsylvania, whose family also  founded Muhlenberg College, was the first Speaker of this House  following the signing of the new Constitution.   Our caucus has nearly 100 members in the House, and I urge all of  those who are interested in joining to do so today.                            ____________________
