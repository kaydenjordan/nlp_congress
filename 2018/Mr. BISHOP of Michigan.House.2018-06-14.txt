 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my legislation, H.R. 5788,  the STOP Act.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is focused on stopping synthetic opioids like  fentanyl and carfentanil from entering our country through the  international mail system.   These synthetic opioids can be 50 to 500 times more potent than a  regular street dose of heroin, and it is the ever-growing presence of  these synthetic opiates in our country that is causing overdose deaths  to skyrocket. In fact, today, according to the National Institute on  Drug Abuse, there are over 115 deaths each and every day from opioid  overdose.   To address this crisis, I have been traveling across my district in  Michigan hosting townhalls and roundtables, where I have heard,  firsthand, the devastating impact this crisis is having in our  communities.   I have also met with a wide range of officials in my district who are  on the front lines of this crisis, including police and fire personnel,  emergency response personnel, educators, medical  [[Page H5168]]  professionals, and others, all of whom are pleading for commonsense  solutions at the Federal level to address this crisis, just like the  bill we are voting on today.   I want to be candid; I agree. Currently, our government is not doing  enough to stop the flow of synthetic opiates coming through the  international mail system.   I was astounded to find out that current law treats packages coming  in through private carriers like FedEx and UPS differently than it does  shipments through the international mail system. Private carriers are  required to provide what is known as advance electronic data, or AED,  on all inbound packages, while the same is not true for shipments  handled by the United States Postal Service in the international mail  system.   This advance electronic data includes three primary pieces of  information: where a package is from, where it is going to, and what is  in it. This is actionable data that enables the CBP to target high-risk  shipments for inspection and seizure.   Officials at the CBP will tell you this is all about finding a needle  in a haystack. This AED information provides law enforcement the tools  they need, the information they need to interdict and seize these  illegal packages.                                time  1230    So here, specifically, is what my bill would do: H.R. 5788 would  require the United States Postal Service to obtain AED on all  international mail shipments by 2020 so that the United States Customs  and Border Protection can target suspicious packages for synthetic  opioids and other dangerous shipments. It also requires USPS to ramp up  70 percent AED compliance by the end of this year. The legislation  would also require the United States Postal Service to refuse shipment  of any foreign package that does not have AED after 2020.   Additionally, this bill includes strong enforcement and  accountability provisions that will impose civil penalties against the  United States Postal Service if they accept packages without AED after  2020.   Lastly, and I think most importantly, this bill gives Congress strong  oversight authority, which includes biannual reporting to Congress and  reporting by the GAO to update us on the agency's progress. In the end,  it is the responsibility of Congress to ensure agencies are complying  with the law.   I would like to, if I could, quickly thank Chairman Brady, Chairman  Reichert, Ranking Member Neal, Congressman Pascrell, Congressmen Faso  and Kelly, and all my colleagues on the House Ways and Means Committee  for their support. I would also like to thank Senators Hatch, Wyden,  and Portman for all their constructive input in this process.   Mr. Speaker, this is about stopping dangerous opioids from entering  our country. Too many Americans have died from the opioid crisis, and  it is high time we take action to put a stop to the inflow of foreign  synthetic opioids.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Faso).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking Mr. Pascrell. I would  like to thank the staff as well for all of their hard work in this  process.   This is an epidemic. This is an issue that is not a Republican issue.  This is not a Democrat issue. This is our issue. It is happening every  day. Mr. Speaker, 115 Americans are dying each and every day due to  opioid overdose. We are talking about mothers, fathers, children--too  many children in our communities.   We know the current system is failing Americans. We are allowing  these foreign criminals and drug dealers to exploit a very obvious  loophole in the law. That is why this bill is so important. That is why  it is important for Members of Congress to come together and get  something done.   This bill sets hard deadlines that will require all packages coming  into our country to have this actionable data that will enable the U.S.  Customs and Border Protection to interdict and seize shipments of these  dangerous packages and keep them off the streets, the American streets.   In closing, I just would like to say to all those here today: I know  that we all have a story. I want to reiterate that we all have a story,  and we have now a moral obligation to close this obvious loophole. I  call upon my colleagues to support this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
