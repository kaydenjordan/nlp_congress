 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to deliver the 14th installment  of my farm bill impact series during a time when the effects of a poor  corn harvest in Kansas are only compounded by rising inflation.   Kansas farmers are laboring under the burden of skyrocketing input  costs while they work hard to keep our country fed, fueled, and  clothed, and they deserve workable solutions to this inflation crisis  before the situation gets any worse. Farming is already a risky,  volatile business without the added burden of inflation, and USDA  estimates that input costs will continue to  [[Page H8014]]  rise to astronomical rates throughout 2022 and beyond.   For an example of the risk of volatility in farming, the corn harvest  is underway in some parts of Kansas, and the results are a fraction of  the yield that farmers hope for and bank on during normal seasons. The  farm bill which Congress will reauthorize in 2023 exists, in part,  specifically for situations like this current corn crop to provide  energy assistance to our ag producers even when Mother Nature doesn't  cooperate.   The weather in Kansas can be extreme and unpredictable, which means  that growing corn can be a very difficult prospect. Kansas is suffering  from a major drought right now. According to the USDA, for the week  ending September 11, only 14 percent of Kansas topsoil was rated as  adequate. And USDA rated the corn condition 27 percent very poor, 27  percent poor, 24 percent fair, 20 percent good, and only 2 percent  excellent. Meanwhile, according to Drought Monitor, 34 counties in my  district alone are in extreme drought, and 16 are in exceptional  drought.    The farther west you go in Kansas, Mr. Speaker, the worse it gets.  Even irrigated fields are having issues, and far more corn crops than  normal will be complete losses. Many Kansas producers are saying that  this is the worst corn harvest in recent memory. This is a dire  situation. Farmers invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in producing  this essential crop, and its failure means that farmers are left  wondering how they are going to put food on the table and pay for gas  to drive their kids to school. To make matters worse, consumers end up  without access to many of the products that they have learned to enjoy  and on which they depend.   This is where farm bill programs like crop insurance come in. Crop  insurance serves producers and consumers alike because it helps prevent  producers from going out of business and grocery store aisles from  sitting empty. Farm bill programs like crop insurance have secured our  national food supply and helped generations of producers avoid  bankruptcy when times get tough. We are in one of those times right  now. Inflation is skyrocketing in America, President Biden is trying to  impose his farm killer tax and dismantle the stepped-up basis, and  producers are going out of business. The need to reauthorize the farm  bill for 2023 has come at a critical moment in time.   A bad harvest in Kansas isn't just about money. It is about morale  and spirit. Missing harvest time in Kansas doesn't just mean missing  out on the yield of a cash crop. It means missing out on a special  Kansas tradition of celebrating the culmination of all of your family's  hard work. It creates financial insecurity while leaving a void where a  renewal of family camaraderie should be. Washington, D.C.,  unfortunately, doesn't understand this. This city has never been  crippled by something like a lost harvest.   D.C. moves right along through drought, heat, late winter snows, and  torrential downpours unfazed. That is why I am standing here today, to  remind Congress that 1 in 10 employed Americans--nearly 20 million  people in this country--work in food and agriculture where weather  creates a make-or-break situation for their livelihoods. And, most  importantly, every American has to eat.   American agricultural producers are hurting not only from  skyrocketing input costs that come from inflation, but also from  lowered morale that comes from extreme heat, drought, thin margins, and  a broken supply chain. In 2023, Congress must reauthorize the farm bill  with American farm families at the front of their minds because they  are in a crisis.   I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my  farm bill impact series and highlight more programs and titles within  the bill that I believe Congress must understand and support to ensure  that agriculture thrives in America. The people who feed, fuel, and  clothe us all deserve our unwavering support. They also deserve a  robust safety net in the farm bill and workable solutions to the  inflation crisis before it is too late.                            ____________________
