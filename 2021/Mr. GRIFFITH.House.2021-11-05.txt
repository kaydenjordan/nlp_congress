 Madam Speaker, I offer these remarks in honor of Naval  Aircrewman 1st Class James ``Jimmy'' P. Buriak, who died on August 31,  2021, at the age of 31.   Mr. Buriak, of Salem, Virginia, was one of five sailors who died when  their helicopter from the USS Abraham Lincoln crashed into the sea off  the coast of southern California.   Mr. Buriak was born on May 9, 1990, to Jim and Carol Buriak in Salem.  Jimmy graduated from Salem High School and Roanoke College. Jimmy  joined the Navy in 2017.   During the last year of his life, Jimmy was honored for rescuing a  man who was caught in a rip current off Guam's Gun Beach.   Mr. Buriak's thoughtful character far exceeded the parameters of his  job. He always went out of his way to help those in need and to go the  extra mile that others weren't willing to do. Jimmy was a great young  man.   His wife, Megan, is starting the AWS1 James Buriak Foundation to  continue honoring his legacy. The foundation will seek to improve  financial shortcomings for Gold Star families with small children.   Mr. Buriak is survived by his wife, Megan; his very young son,  Caulder; as well as his parents, Jim and Carol Buriak; his sister,  Laura; and his brother-in-law, Erik Zickefoose.   Madam Speaker, I offer Jimmy's entire family my condolences on their  loss. He was a great young man.   Madam Speaker, as an aside, Jimmy used to play water polo with me in  the summertime.                            ____________________
