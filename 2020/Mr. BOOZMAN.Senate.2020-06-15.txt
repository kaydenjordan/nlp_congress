 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Springdale  Public School District superintendent Dr. Jim Rollins who will step  down from his position at the end of June after decades of dedication  to students, staff, and the community.   He has spent his career improving education and scholastic  opportunities for students for more than 39 years as superintendent.  His dedication and passion for education grew in his years as a science  teacher in North Little Rock. At the same time, he continued to pursue  advanced degrees in education at the University of Arkansas. He knew he  wanted to help better the lives of students.   During his tenure as superintendent in Springdale, he oversaw  tremendous growth in the district. Enrollment has increased from 5,000  students in 1980 to more than 23,000 students today. He rose to meet  the challenges of the flourishing student population by supporting the  construction of 22 schools and implementing innovative measures to  provide the diverse student population tools to succeed.   Dr. Rollins has always made students a priority and emphasized this  to teachers and staff with his motto ``We Teach Them All.''   He has distinguished himself as a key voice in education at the  local, State,  [[Page S2973]]  and national level and has received many well-deserved honors for his  work. The achievements he has accrued during his 50-year career in  public education include twice being named Arkansas Superintendent of  the Year and recognition as one of Education Week magazine's 2017  ``Leaders to Learn From.'' Just recently, Dr. Rollins was awarded the  2020 Outstanding Alumnus Award in Education from the College of  Education and Health Professionals at the University of Arkansas. His  service as Arkansas' representative on the U.S. Department of  Education's Superintendents Task Force is further evidence of his  expertise and the high regard his peers and fellow educators hold for  him.   I congratulate Dr. Rollins for his outstanding track record of  ensuring students have a solid educational foundation to help them  succeed in the future. I appreciate his friendship and his excellent  leadership which has resulted in academic improvement and growth for  countless students. I wish him all the best in the next chapter of his  career as president of Northwest Technical Institute.                            ____________________
