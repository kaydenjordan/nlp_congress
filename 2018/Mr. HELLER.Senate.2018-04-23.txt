 Mr. President, today I would like to recognize and  thank Mr. John Ruhs, the director of the U.S. Bureau of Land  Management, BLM, in Nevada, for his work on behalf of our State as he  departs his role to assume the top position at the National Interagency  Fire Center in Boise, ID.   Mr. Ruhs first moved to Nevada as a wild horse and burro specialist  and later served as Ely's BLM district manager and Winnemucca's  district fire management officer. When talking about the time he has  spent in Nevada, Mr. Ruhs said, ``I truly love the resources, the  people, and the wide variety of activities and issues that we face.''   He was appointed by Neil Kornze, the national director of the BLM  during the Obama administration, to serve as Nevada's director in 2015,  a role he was well-suited for, given his previous public service in  Nevada. For more than 3 years, he was in charge of managing 48 million  acres of Federal land in our State. It is a tough job, but he excelled  in the role, and I have appreciated the opportunity to work with him.  He is a hard-working, honest broker who has a record of successfully  and expeditiously resolving longstanding issues. John is a leader and a  problem solver and was willing to get personally involved in even the  most difficult disputes.   Prior to his work in Nevada, Mr. Ruhs worked for the BLM in Colorado,  Idaho, and Oregon, as well as in Washington, DC, as the senior special  assistant. He also worked in Wyoming as district manager of the High  Desert District. Mr. Ruhs is also a veteran. He served in the U.S.  Marine Corps, and I am truly grateful for his service to our Nation.   Mr. Ruhs grew up in Iowa and graduated from the University of Idaho  with a bachelor of science degree in animal science. He and his wife,  Amy, are the proud parents of seven daughters. Together, they embrace  the outdoors and enjoy spending time riding horses and camping.   As the senior Senator from the State of Nevada, I ask my colleagues  to join me in recognizing Mr. Ruhs for his many years of public service  to the BLM and to my home State. While his departure is Nevada's loss,  I know that the National Interagency Fire Center will benefit from his  expertise. I wish Mr. Ruhs continued success in his future endeavors  and many fulfilling years to come.                            ____________________
