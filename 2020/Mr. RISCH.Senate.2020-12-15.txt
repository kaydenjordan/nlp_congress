 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

This proposed sale will support U.S. foreign policy and       national security by helping to improve the security of a       NATO ally, which is an important partner for political       stability and economic progress in Europe.        The proposed sale supports and complements the ongoing       efforts of Italy to modernize its airborne Intelligence,       Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Electronic Warfare       capability and increases interoperability between the U.S.       Air Force and the Italian Air Force (ITAF). Italy will have       no difficulty absorbing these articles into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be L3Harris, Greenville, TX.       There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection       with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of up to six (6) additional U.S. contractor       representatives to Italy for a duration of one (1) year to       support equipment familiarization.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       resulting from this proposed sale.                            transmittal no. 21-07       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. Missile Warning Sensor (MWS) units are mounted on the       aircraft exterior to provide omni-directional protection. The       MWS warns of threat missile approach by detecting radiation       associated with the rocket motor. The Infrared Missile       Warning System (IRMWS) is a small, lightweight, passive,       electro-optic, threat-warning device used to detect surface-      to-air missiles fired at helicopters and low-flying fixed-      wing aircraft and automatically provides counter-measures, as       well as audio and visual warning messages to the aircrew.        2. Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Joint       Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS) is an advanced Link-16       command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I)       system incorporating high capacity, jam-resistant, digital       communication links for exchange of near real-time tactical       information, including both data and voice, among air,       ground, and sea elements.        3. The AN/ALE-47 Countermeasure Dispenser Set (CMDS)       provides an integrated threat-adaptive, computer controlled       capability for dispensing chaff, flares, and active radio       frequency expendables. The system is internally mounted and       may be operated as a standalone system or may be integrated       with other on-board Electronic Warfare (EW) and avionics       systems. The AN/ALE-47 uses threat data received over the       aircraft interfaces to assess the threat situation and       determine a response. Expendable routines tailored to the       immediate aircraft and threat environment may be dispensed       using one of four operational modes.        4. The Embedded GPS-INS (EGI) is a sensor that combines GPS       and inertial sensor inputs to provide accurate location       information for navigation and targeting, and can be loaded       with crypto-variable keys.        5. Wescam MX-20HD is a gyro-stabilized, multi-spectral,       multi-field of view Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) system.       The systems provide surveillance laser illumination and laser       designation through use of an externally mounted turret       sensor unit and internally mounted master control. Sensor       video imagery is displayed in the aircraft real time and may       be recorded for subsequent ground analysis.        6. The Osprey family of surveillance radars provides second       generation Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA)       surveillance capability as the primary sensor on airborne       assets. The Osprey radars are at a high technology readiness       level and are in production for fixed and rotary wing       applications. This Osprey configuration employs a side-      looking radar. Osprey radars provide a genuine multi-domain       capability, with high performance sea surveillance, notably       against difficult targets, land surveillance with wide swath,       very high resolution ground mapping, small and low speed       ground target indication, high performance air to air       surveillance, tracking and intercept.        7. The AISREW mission systems, to include the       RIOTM Communications Intelligence Systems, provide       near-real-time information to tactical forces, combatant       commanders and national-level authorities  [[Page S7497]]       across the spectrum of conflict. The mission system can       forward gather information in a variety of formats via       secured communications systems. Most hardware used in this       system is generic and commercially available. However, if any       of the specialized hardware or publications are lost, the       information could provide insight into many critical U.S.       capabilities. Information gained could be used to develop       countermeasures as well as offensive and defensive counter-      tactics.        8. The highest level of classification of information       included in this potential sale is SECRET.        9. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        10. A determination has been made that Italy can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        11. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Italy.     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Bonneville  County Sheriff Paul Wilde and his more than 40 years of service to his  community.   Sheriff Wilde began his career in law enforcement following the Teton  Dam disaster in 1976 as a reserve deputy in Jefferson County. Within a  year, he transferred to Bonneville County where he would remain for the  next four decades.   Community service is deeply engrained in Sheriff Wilde. Throughout  his time as a deputy in the Bonneville County sheriff's office, he also  served on several boards and committees, including as a founding board  member of D.A.R.E., president of the 7th Judicial Court Appointed  Special Advocates, and on the governing boards of Help, Inc., Domestic  Violence Intervention, and Rape Crisis. In addition, he holds an  Executive Certification from the Police Officers Standards a Training  Academy and currently chairs the Jail Standards Committee for the Idaho  Sheriffs Association.   Through these opportunities, he learned that effective law  enforcement requires a firm and daily commitment to community and  personal sacrifice. Over the course of his career, Sheriff Wilde  clearly demonstrated this commitment. His colleagues were not the only  people to recognize these qualities in Sheriff Wilde but also the  residents of Bonneville County, who elected him to three consecutive  terms as their sheriff.   Sheriff Wilde leaves behind a legacy demonstrating the benefits of  capable law enforcement, and we wish him and his wife Cindy the best as  he transitions back to private life. His leadership and commitment to  his community will be missed, but his legacy will benefit Eastern Idaho  for years to come.                            ____________________
