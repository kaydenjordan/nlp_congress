 Mr. Speaker, just calling this tax bill a middle class  tax bill does not make it so. You actually have to read the bill. And  if you do, you will find that the vast majority of the benefit goes to  the people at the very top: the wealthiest Americans, multinational  corporations. They are the beneficiaries of this Republican tax scam.   Saying it benefits the middle class does not make it so, and, in  fact, many in the middle class, tens of millions of people in the  middle class, will pay more taxes so that we can do what? Give huge tax  breaks to the people at the very top.   And how do they pay for that? They borrow money.   All these deficit hawks, all these people over here who have said  over and over again that it is immoral to pass debt on to our children  and grandchildren will walk to the floor of this House and they will  vote to send $1.5 trillion in debt to their kids and grandkids to give  corporations and the wealthiest Americans a tax break.   It is immoral. It is immoral.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time  and for his incredible leadership on this subject.   You can't have it both ways. I just heard it said. You can't have it  both ways. So what I suspect will happen after I get done, as has been  the case with every one of the speakers on this side, the gentleman on  the other side will say that residents in my hometown will get a tax  break of X, $1,000.   I would ask the gentleman if he would add to that the amount of the  debt that is being borne by each one of those families. Because the way  I have got it calculated, it costs a family of four about $20,000 for  your debt that you are willing to levy against our children and  grandchildren in order to give the richest 1 percent of Americans a  massive tax break.   You can't deny the math that almost all the benefit goes to the  people at the top. The top 1 percent are huge beneficiaries. You can't  deny the math that 5,400 families will get a massive tax break. You  can't deny the math that says that every single American will take on  additional debt; a family of four, $20,000 in debt.   I also was intrigued by the colloquy where Members came to ask the  leadership if they will work with them to take out egregious elements  of this tax  [[Page H9355]]  proposal. We get this sort of ``Yes, I will work with the gentleman''  answer.   I have a question: Why did you put it in in the first place? Why are  you cutting brownfield tax credits? Why are you cutting new market tax  credits? Why are you cutting historic tax credits in the first place?  Why did you put it in in the first place?   You just wrote the bill. You just wrote it. It makes no sense. It  makes no sense.   We can't pass debts to our children in order to finance tax breaks  for the people at the very top.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would like to remind all Members  that they should address their remarks to the Chair and not to others  in the Chamber.
