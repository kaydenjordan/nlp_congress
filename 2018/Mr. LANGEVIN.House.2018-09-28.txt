 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the 50th  anniversary of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, signed into law on  October 2, 1968.   This landmark conservation bill launched a movement. It helped us  recognize and protect the free-flowing rivers with ``outstandingly  remarkable'' characteristics.   In Rhode Island and Connecticut, we have just such waterways,  including the branches of the Wood and Pawcatuck Rivers.   Just this week, in cooperation with Senator Jack Reed, I introduced  legislation to designate the 110 miles of this river system as a Wild  and Scenic River. After 3 years of intense study, the National Park  Service has found it to have areas of pristine beauty, recreational  importance, and untouched wilderness.   I applaud the work of Denise Poyer, the study coordinator at the  Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed Association, and all of those who have  volunteered their time to protect this river.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the  Natural Resources Committee to complete this designation.                            ____________________
