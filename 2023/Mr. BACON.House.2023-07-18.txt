 Mr. Speaker, I stand here in support of this resolution  today. I look forward to welcoming the President of Israel tomorrow and  hearing his message.   I also stand here in support of this resolution condemning the  comments that Israel is a racist country. It is not. We all stand here  today united against anti-Semitism and the evil that it represents. It  is repugnant.   Mr. Speaker, I will make clear today from my perspective why it is so  important to stand with our ally Israel. We have practical reasons,  moral reasons, and spiritual reasons--practical in that Israel is the  only nation in the region that shares our democratic values, the values  of rule of law and human dignity. It is a win-win relationship.                                time  1600    We gain from it, they gain from it, and our countries are stronger  together.   It is moral because for thousands of years, the Jews were repressed,  discriminated against, abused, and murdered. The nation of Israel was  put together to be a safe haven from all over the world where they  could go, and that remains true today.   I would say it is spiritual, for I believe in the words of the Torah  and our Old Testament when it says that those who bless Israel will be  blessed, and, indeed, America has been blessed.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of this resolution, and I appreciate  my friend from Texas who is a fellow Air Force veteran who put this  together.
