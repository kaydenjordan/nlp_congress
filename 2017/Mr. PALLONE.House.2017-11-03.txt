 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R. 3922, a  partisan bill to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program,  or CHIP, as well as community health centers and other public health  programs.   It pains me to be here today, because this should not be a partisan  bill. I have tried for months to negotiate with Republicans to develop  a bipartisan compromise, but House Republicans chose to spend the first  9 months of this year trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They  failed, but now House Republicans are using the reauthorization of CHIP  and community health centers as a way to once again sabotage the ACA.    Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker: if Republicans can't repeal the ACA  outright, they will cripple it any time they can.   This time, Republicans are risking the healthcare of nearly 9 million  children and the care of families all around the country that use  community health centers. They are risking that care because this  partisan bill has no chance of ever becoming law.   By taking this route, Republicans are guaranteeing that CHIP and  community health centers will not be reauthorized until the end of the  year, and that is extremely unfortunate.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support CHIP, our community health centers,  and all of our public health programs that are extended in this bill.  These programs have traditionally been bipartisan, but the bill before  us extends these programs by taking billions of dollars away from the  Affordable Care Act and undermining Medicare.   In short, this Republican bill offers a false choice. On one hand, it  strips healthcare away from upwards of 680,000 Americans and guts the  Prevention Fund, which pays for immunization and vaccines, lead  poisoning prevention, opioid treatment, and many other important  programs; on other hand, it reauthorizes these important programs.  Democrats strongly support reauthorization of these programs, but we  reject the way Republicans are paying for them.   Mr. Speaker, there are so many other policies that save money,  countless alternatives that Democrats have offered to Republicans for  months. Yesterday I offered an alternative that would have provided a  robust reauthorization and extension of these important programs, and  it was paid for in a commonsense way.   My alternative would have changed the timing of payments to Medicare  Advantage Plans. This approach was recommended by both the GAO and the  Office of the Inspector General, but Republicans rejected it in the  Rules Committee. They wouldn't even allow it to come before the full  House for a vote. And why is because they would rather use  reauthorization of CHIP and community health centers as another way to  sabotage the Affordable Care Act.   I simply reject that approach and strongly urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is the ultimate absurdity for my colleague, the  chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, to suggest that somehow  I control when a bill comes to the floor of the House of  Representatives.   The only reason that the Republicans ever delayed bringing this vote  to the floor is because they know and I know that, if this bill is  partisan, it will  [[Page H8459]]  never become law. It will go to the Senate, and it will sit there, and  the only way that it is going to become law is if it is a bipartisan  effort that actually accomplishes something and gets most people to  support it.   We could keep listening to the other side all day say: Oh, the  Democrats delayed the vote. The Democrats delayed the vote.   The vote shouldn't be held today. The vote should be delayed today  because this is going nowhere. This bill is going nowhere. They know  it. You want to keep saying it? You can say it all day for the next  hour, but it is the ultimate of absurdity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene  Green), who is the ranking member of our Health Subcommittee.   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking member for  yielding time to me.   I rise to oppose H.R. 3922. I got elected to Congress to expand  access for healthcare. I am not a doctor, I am not a nurse, but as  Members of Congress, we can do as much damage as someone who isn't a  doctor or nurse by legislation that we see today.   And while I strongly support extending funding for the Children's  Healthcare Insurance Program and federally qualified health centers,  delaying cuts to disproportionate share hospital payments, advancing  our other bipartisan healthcare programs, this legislation includes  offsets that undermine access to cover these services.    Again, my goal in Congress was to expand healthcare, and this bill  restricts that access. Two-thirds of Medicaid dollars go to children.  If you cut Medicaid, you are cutting those children's benefits. This  bill cuts children from Medicaid, and it gives money to the children  who are less poor on CHIP. We need both programs. We don't need one or  the other.   Both CHIP and FQHCs are bedrocks of our healthcare system, providing  health insurance to almost 9 million lower-income children serving on  the front lines by providing high-quality primary and preventative care  to more than 25 million Americans.   Congress let funding for these programs expire last month, the first  time in our history, since the 1960s, that the FQHCs and the CHIP  program were not bipartisan. That is the step this House is making  today by doing this.   It should be bipartisan because it has always been bipartisan.  Unfortunately, instead of bipartisan negotiations looking for a  compromise, the process was derailed. The bill cuts, again, Medicaid.  Two-thirds are children, to help poor children, and limit their access.   The Prevention Fund funds the Centers for Disease Control. We have  any number of future illnesses that we need the CDC to have the ability  to fight that, and here we are, cutting vaccinations in our  communities. We are cutting infectious disease detection and  prevention.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and let's expand  access and not restrict it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), the ranking member of our Oversight  Subcommittee.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, as one of the authors of the original bill  20 years ago, I rise to express deep disappointment that the House has  not been able to reach a bipartisan agreement on how to fund the  extension of CHIP.   The September 30 deadline has long passed, and now 9 million children  and families are waiting anxiously for us to figure this out. My home  State of Colorado is likely to run out of CHIP funding in January, with  termination notices going out to worried families in the next few  weeks.   Yet here we are with a partisan bill that asks us to pay for low- income children's insurance on the backs of seniors and the most  vulnerable.   The bill also cuts the Affordable Care Act, which could result in  668,000 people enrolled in ACA plans losing their health insurance.  Nobody should have to lose coverage in order for others to keep it.  This is a false choice, and it is out of step with what the American  people have been calling on us to do. Only the 115th Congress could  find a way to make the CHIP bill partisan.   Irrespective of what happens today in this vote, I urge my colleagues  to get together across the aisle, across the Capitol, find a way to  reauthorize this important bill in a way that doesn't cut benefits for  other people. Let's  [[Page H8460]]  truly give kids these benefits that they need, and let's move on with  our business.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), the vice ranking member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Vermont (Mr. Welch).    I yield the gentleman from Vermont an additional 30  seconds.    I yield the gentleman from Vermont an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The bottom line is, when you start cutting money from the Prevention  Fund, you are cutting prevention programs for kids, adults, the  disabled, and, most importantly, the opiates.   CDC spends a significant amount of money from the Prevention Fund  dealing with the opiate crisis, so don't tell me that somehow this is  okay. You are taking money away from opiate prevention. You are taking  money away from kids programs like lead poisoning and vaccines. It is  unbelievable how much is actually going to be lost from the Prevention  Fund because of this bill.   I am not interested in what happened in the past. I want to know what  is going to happen in the future. We have an opiate crisis. Don't take  money away from the Prevention Fund that is used to deal with that  crisis.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to talk about this use of the Prevention  Fund. Democrats have never supported the type of drastic cuts to the  Prevention Fund that is in this proposal today. In fact, when faced  with such cuts, we voted ``no'' nine times. In the two cases where we  voted in favor of using some of the Prevention Fund as an offset,  neither cut placed the CDC programs and efforts at risk as this  legislation does today.   The Republican proposal would cut the Prevention Fund nearly in half  and leave a $400 million hole in funding for prevention and health  programs within the CDC's budget beginning in 2019. This cut would be  devastating to local, State and Federal efforts to protect the Nation's  health.   Unlike my Republican counterparts, what they contend, this cut to  these programs would not be made up in the annual appropriations  process, as evidenced by the proposed cut of $198 million to the CDC in  the House Republican fiscal year 2018 appropriations bill, and the  decrease of $580 million in CDC funding since 2010 when adjusted for  inflation.   Again, you talk about opiates, you talk about children's health  programs. These would be drastically cut because of what they are doing  today to the Prevention Fund.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Matsui).

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3922.   Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we authorize CHIP and community  health centers, but slashing essential public health funding is not the  right way to do it.   Treatment of chronic diseases accounts for 75 percent of our Nation's  healthcare spending, and many of these diseases can be prevented.  Unfortunately, H.R. 3922 does not do that at all. This bill cuts in  half the ACA Prevention and Public Health Fund that plays a critical  role in preventing and treating chronic diseases, including keeping  kids healthy.   The massive cuts to this funding will be devastating to my Central  Valley of California district. My district has the largest number of  tuberculosis cases in California for children under 5 years old.  Children in this age group are more likely to develop life-threatening  forms of TB since their immune systems are less mature. Public  officials in my district are relying on funding from the Prevention  Fund to address TB outbreaks.   It is troubling that Republicans are using CHIP reauthorization to  take core public health services away from kids. It is also  frustrating, but not surprising, that the Republicans are making  another attempt to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. This legislation  is robbing Paul to pay Peter, and I urge my colleagues to vote against  it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 2\1/2\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Oregon has 45 seconds remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to stress again that one of the pay-fors that the  Republicans don't talk about much is the fact that they are reducing  the grace period from 90 days to 30 days. So if someone misses a  payment on their insurance, they currently have 90 days to make up for  it. Under this bill, they will only have 30 days.   Now, the CBO estimates that over 500,000 people will lose their  health insurance and have to reapply for next year because of this  reduction in the grace period. I know my colleague from the other side  says: Well, that is too bad because they have the responsibility to pay  it.   But the fact of the matter is that a lot of people have a hard time  paying their monthly premium, and we should not be passing legislation  that ends up with half-a-million people losing their health insurance.   Again, this is a way to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. The  Affordable Care Act is trying to make more people covered, and has  succeeded in covering 95 percent of the people in this country.   Why in the world would we use a pay-for that cuts back on half-a- million people who would lose their health insurance?   I want to emphasize, Mr. Speaker, we did not have to be here today.  We could have done a bipartisan bill without sabotaging the Affordable  Care Act. That is what concerns me most, Mr. Speaker. The Republicans  tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They failed, and now they are  trying to repeal it piece by piece.   The pay-fors that are in this legislation are unfair to the American  people. The Prevention Fund is used for opiate prevention and used for  kids for various programs. Don't cut back on that to pay for these  other things.   The grace period--half-a-million Americans are going to lose their  insurance because of the cutbacks in the grace period--another effort  to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.   Lastly, and probably even most important, again, the Republicans are  going against the Medicare program. They are trying to make cuts in the  Medicare program and restructure the Medicare program in a way that I  believe will hurt the Medicare program, reduce the amount of people in  the insurance pool, and ultimately lead to higher costs for middle  class and lower-income seniors and the disabled in the Medicare  program.   I urge my colleagues: Don't let the Republicans continue to sabotage  the Affordable Care Act. We could have done this on a bipartisan basis.  Passing this bill today does nothing for the Children's Health  Initiative or for community health centers because this bill is going  nowhere. It will end up in the Senate. The Senate will not take it up,  and we will be waiting around until Christmas to actually find a way to  fund these programs and put these programs at risk. Vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5-minute vote.
