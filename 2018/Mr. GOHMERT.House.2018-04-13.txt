 Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting week here. I  always appreciate following people speaking who want to limit waste in  our Federal Government.   I only heard a little snippet, but it caught my ear. I heard  something mentioned about EPA Director Scott Pruitt gave a raise to two  people who shouldn't have gotten them.   Actually, I can elaborate a little bit on that.   One of his staff had recommended a raise to two people without the  Director's permission, and they didn't get the raise. It didn't happen.   He is one of the most effective people in that job. He is one of the  reasons the economy is doing well. And jobs for minority members are at  an all-time high record-setting. So I can understand when a Cabinet  member like Scott Pruitt is doing an incredible job and the economy is  exploding as a result doing so well, people being employed, and making  more.   Mr. Speaker, I can also report, having spent 2 weeks in my district a  week before and a week after Easter--I am hearing it from people in  jobs you wouldn't even think of that--that the economy is doing well.  It is pretty typical for people telling me, who are in retail, whatever  it is, their sales are up 30, 40, or 50 percent from where they were  after the first quarter, even last year.   I really don't believe we would ever have gotten a tax bill if we had  not had the undying commitment to get something done that we had from  President Trump. So it is a good thing. It is going to be a good year.  When the economy is going good, it is a good thing. I have been here 13  years, but I have noticed that if Republicans are in the majority and  the economy is being turned around--I know President Obama had said we  will never see 3 percent growth in the economy again, it would take a  magic wand, Trump would have to have a magic wand to get the economy  growing by 3 percent ever again--and another piece of good news is we  have found out that President Trump, as President, has already made  enough changes, through people like Scott Pruitt and others, so that  the economy has already hit 3 percent growth; and we hope by the end of  the year it will be much better. So good news.   My friend is concerned about waste. It is not what was initially  reported, but I am thrilled to see the concern about waste. I know that  is one thing that both sides of the aisle now will be concerned about.   But it is interesting. When the economy gets to going so well, that  is when I usually see my friends across the aisle get more concerned  and start using the term ``corruption.''   And why not?   I know back in 2005 and 2006, when there were Democrats being  arrested and there was trouble across the country with corruption on  both parties, and we started hearing the term ``corruption, corruption,  corruption,'' it was a huge help to the Democrats. They won the  majority. Then, as soon as people saw how bad the corruption had become  under the Democratic majority, we were able to get the majority back.   Now the key is to do something with it. Obviously, we saw yesterday  that it is not enough to just bring a balanced budget bill to the floor  that doesn't have a spending cap that would have forced taxes to go up.  That is not going to be enough to convince Americans that we are  serious about cutting waste in our spending. We are going to have to  actually avoid things like that outrageous omnibus that passed with  over 60 percent of Democrats voting for it and over 60 percent,  apparently, of Republicans voting for it.   There is another bit of good news. I do think this part of the news  is a help  [[Page H3308]]  to the economy, and one of the reasons we are seeing a help to the  economy.   I know there are some megawealthy folks out there who want to see no  border like the Clintons were pushing for. They had megawealthy  friends. They want as much illegal immigration coming in as they can.  Never mind that there are criminals coming in, there are people who  want to harm our Nation, and people here, never mind that. If people  can be rewarded who are big donors, then good, let's have open borders.   But that is not the position of the people who elected President  Donald Trump. We need to be about the things that allowed us to keep  the majority and elected Donald Trump as President. If we don't, the  majority will be lost, and then the next couple of years will be spent  dealing with impeachment of a President who has been charged with what  the prior administration did.   There is an interesting thing called projecting. One group commits  horrendous offenses, then before the other side can properly  investigate what that group did, the offending group starts projecting  their offenses as if they were done by the opposing side.   There is an article entitled: ``Attorney General Jeff Sessions  Announces New `Zero-Tolerance' Illegal Immigration Policy,'' and that  is making a difference. We are having an immense problem as the call  has been for more and more amnesty legalizing people here illegally. It  has caused a flood of people coming across our southern border, so  Attorney General Jeff Sessions' announcement is a big help. It appears  that it is helping to slow the rate of people flooding to the United  States.                                time  1230    Hopefully, the announcement by the President to call for National  Guard troops on the border is also helping, because when people know  they are going to be turned away, they realize, ``Why should I even  make the trip?''   But I would commend our National Guard. Of course, under the doctrine  of posse comitatus, normally they are not to be used against U.S.  citizens, that is the law under very tight exceptions, but they don't  have to.   If the National Guard is allowed to go to the border, not like in the  prior administration or even the prior troops that the Bush  administration sent, if they are actually allowed to go to the border  and stand there--I mean, the busiest sector for a long time now, for a  few years or so, has been the McAllen sector. It was Arizona, but as  that border was toughened up, McAllen down in south Texas, that sector  became a busier sector. I think it had to do also with the activity of  the drug cartel in Mexico that covers that sector of our border.  Probably, if that surge coming up from Central America through Mexico,  any of them were to make it, that is probably where they are going to  be coming.   I have been there at night, and all night, many nights, and it is  very clear, when Governor Perry sent game wardens, DPS troopers just to  stand on the high bank on the U.S. side of the Rio Grande River, there  are coyotes. I have been there with our folks, the Border Patrol that  are doing the best they can there, and some of our DPS, and both have  night vision gear. And the Texas DPS folks allowed me to use some night  vision gear, and we were able to see some coyotes hiding behind the  trees across the way. They were waiting for people on the U.S. side of  the border, the Rio Grande, to move out of the way, because the  coyotes, apparently, their lives can be in jeopardy. If the raft they  use to bring across illegals is destroyed, then their lives may be  destroyed by the drug cartel or the gang that was working for the drug  cartel, so they don't want their raft to be destroyed, they don't want  to get caught.   The experience is, since I have seen it so many hundreds of times,  the people coming across in the rafts, they want to be caught, because  they knew from the Obama years that when somebody gets there, they  don't tell them, ``Go back. You are not going to be allowed to set foot  on U.S. soil.'' Oh, no. Once you get across, then it is time to in- process you. We have our questions to ask as we in-process you. We may  put you in a facility and provide you food, three meals a day, take  care of your needs, or we may just let you provide us the address that  the drug cartels gave the person coming in illegally, or the family or  group, the address being where the drug cartels wanted those  individuals to go to work. Because as I have heard them say many times,  ``Oh, well, they told us I could work off the rest. $7,000 to come in.  I had $1,500, we had people in the United States that sent $2,000,''  these kind of stories over and over.   It is not on the list of required questions, but some of our folks  would ask anyway, ``How much did you pay? Well, you don't have that  kind of money. Where did you get it?''   Then there was always at least $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 that had not  been paid. ``Oh, they are going to let me pay that off when I get to  the address they are sending me.''   So what an amazing business model to have potential employees,  basically indentured servants, and you don't pay your employee. No.  They pay you a bunch of money to get to come to work for you because  you are going to get them across the border.   Then the Department of Homeland Security under the Obama  administration--you talk about waste, fraud, and abuse. The Obama  administration would then have Homeland Security ship them to the city  to which the drug cartel told them they wanted them to go work and gave  them an address, and then when they got to the city, then they were  allowed to work for the drug cartel to pay off the money that the drug  cartel said they still owed them. What a great business model. Your  employees pay you to get to work for you, and the U.S. Government will  send them to their location.   That is why Border Patrol told me, a number of different ones told  me, that the drug cartels in Mexico look at our Homeland Security--this  all occurred during the Obama years, as their logistics. They get them  across the border, and immediately, Homeland Security takes charge and  gets them to where they were needed in the drug trafficking arena. And  there were places all over the country.   It is tragic, President Trump has pointed it out, and it is true,  despite some of the naysayers, when groups start coming to the United  States, whether they come from Central America and are allowed by what  should be a friend in Mexico to come all the way through Mexico to come  into the United States, there are going to be girls that are raped,  there are going to be young women and some older women that are forced  into sex trafficking, and there are going to be some people that lose  their lives.   The very best thing we could do for the people of Mexico, and I am  saying the people of Mexico, not elected leaders in government who have  gotten there by the drug cartels, no, I am not talking about people  under the control of the drug cartels; I am talking about the people of  Mexico, the people that deserve so much better, the best thing we could  do is totally secure our border so that the only people who come in  come in lawfully.   We are trying to get the proper wording for a bill that will actually  tell our Border Patrol, anybody coming into the United States through  any place other than a legal crossing area are to be denied the  opportunity to step foot on American soil, on U.S. soil. Because, I  mean, I've been there, I have seen it.   Texas, the DPS troopers, the game wardens, they won't allow people to  step on the U.S. side, but when the Federal folks come along, they say,  ``Oh, no, come on in so we can in-process you.'' I watched that over  and over during the Obama years.   All we have to do is just say, ``No, you are not coming in through an  illegal avenue or an illegal method. You are not coming in. You are not  going to set foot here. You come by air, then we are going to turn you  around and send you right back. You come across the water, we are not  going to let you land. We are going to turn around and send you right  back. You are not going to step foot.''    That is apparently what we need to tell our folks. Don't even think  about in-processing. If you are going to come in, if you are going to  come ask for amnesty or any kind of thing, come through a legal port of  entry, come through a legal avenue, and we will have our folks talk to  you before they allow you to come in. You need to be legal coming in or  you are not coming in.  [[Page H3309]]    That is rather basic, but apparently we need something like that to  make clear we are serious about enforcing our border.   So it is welcome news. We have an article, this one by Charles Ortel.  He is quoting Jeff Sessions: `` `You play a critical part in fulfilling  these goals, and I thank you for your continued efforts in seeing to it  that our laws--and as a result, our Nation--are respected,' he said.   ``The crackdown comes after the Department of Homeland Security  reported a 203 percent increase in illegal border crossings from March  2017 to March 2018, according to the memo. The department also noted a  37 percent increase from February 2018 to March 2018--the largest  month-to-month increase since 2011.''   I will interject here, the reason is very clear for this. The more  that people in Washington talk about the term ``amnesty,'' the word  ``legalization,'' the word ``DACA,'' any of these things, it creates  yet another surge and another surge.   My position has continued to be consistent. I thoroughly supported  President Trump's platform in this area, and it is probably the biggest  reason that people went out and voted for President Trump. We are going  to enforce our border, we are going to secure it, we are going to build  a wall where we need it.   We have got to get that done, because when people talk about DACA,  amnesty, legalization, it brings more and more people surging to our  border, more people will be pulled into sex slavery, more people will  be losing their lives, more people will be pulled into drug  trafficking.   All of that hurts our country. It is destructive to Mexico, provides  tens of billions of more dollars for corruption. I mean, Mexico, they  have got the natural resources, incredible natural resources. They have  got some of the hardest working people in the world. They have got the  best location, right between two major continents, two big oceans,  perfect location. The only thing holding them back is corruption. If we  secure our border, it brings an end to the wild corruption that exists  in Mexico and further south.   This article says: ``Arrests of people trying to cross illegally into  the U.S. from Mexico were actually at a 46-year low throughout 2017,  according to data from the Department of Homeland Security.''   So that was great.   ``Border officers apprehended approximately 310,000 people in fiscal  year 2017--a 25 percent decrease from the previous year.   ``The number of apprehensions jumped by 40 percent from February to  March, which DHS said was consistent with seasonal trends.   ``Sessions said the `unacceptable' border situation is a result of  Congress' failure to pass legislation that would close `dangerous  loopholes' and fund President Donald Trump's proposed border wall.''   So one of the big problems I had with the omnibus bill, it not only  didn't provide funding for the wall, here we have a majority in the  House, majority in the Senate, and basically it was a slap at President  Trump: ``Not only are we not giving you money for the wall, but we are  going to put $1.5 billion in there and say it is only to replace  fences, and they have got to be open where you can see through them.''   What a slap at the President, what a slap at the people that are  trying to control our border, secure our border.   Another article from CBS News about the same policy, the same  announcement. That was from April 6.   Then this from The Hill, Michael Stopa: ``Jeff Sessions sends  California a strong message on immigration.''   It starts: ``There is more than a little historical irony here. In  response to the Trump administration's initiatives to restore order in  and respect for the Nation's immigration laws, the California State  Legislature passed, and liberal politicians and business and  entertainment elites of the State are vocally defending, three laws  which openly defy the Constitution and challenge the Union.''   It is basically a declaration of secession from California. That is  my interjection.   This says: ``The California regulations are dedicated to maintaining  a traditional way of life and protecting economic and political power  built on the manual labor and, eventually, the votes of an illegal  class of workers.''                                time  1245    ``By protecting the institution of illegal immigration, the  California laws not only usurp Federal prerogatives (to the detriment  of less affluent Californians) but also undermine law enforcement far  beyond the borders of the State. Therefore, the Justice Department this  week initiated court proceedings against the rebellious State,  challenging the constitutionality of the three statutes.   ``So, deriding California's ``irrational, unfair, and  unconstitutional policies,'' Attorney General Jeff Sessions began his  march to the sea. It is a script just made for Hollywood. According to  the Los Angeles Times, the three laws which the Justice Department is  challenging make it a crime for businessowners to voluntarily help  Federal agents find and detain undocumented workers, prohibit local law  enforcement from alerting immigration agents when detainees are  released from custody and create a State inspection program for Federal  immigration detention centers.''   Now, Mr. Speaker, let me interject here. This part here, ``prohibit  local law enforcement from alerting immigration agents when detainees  are released from custody,'' that needs a little further elaboration.   What California is saying, if they are in custody, then they have  been charged with a crime, or they have been accused of a crime, or  there is probable cause to suspect them of a crime.   So when California passes laws saying these people who are in  custody, because we have probable cause to believe they are criminals,  we don't want the Federal Government to know that we have illegal  aliens who we have probable cause to believe committed crimes, we want  those people in California, in San Francisco. We want those criminals,  those people there is probable cause to show committed crimes, we want  them in our State, we want them in our town; and so we are passing a  law, let's keep these criminals in California, for Californians, taking  jobs Californians would do if they were paying a little more for them,  but these people here illegally, some of them will take them, others  will get welfare. Others will apply for child tax credits and get  thousands back they didn't pay in.   That continues to happen and, hopefully, will be coming to a stop  soon, once we get the IRS under control and get the IRS to begin  following the law as they so boldly and brashly offended and violated  during the Obama administration.   We couldn't believe that there was so much money being paid out in  child tax credits. How is that happening if people are illegally here?   Well, it turns out, even though the law says you have to have,  basically, a valid Social Security number to get more money back than  you paid in, the IRS, some time back, decided, you know what--I know  they intended well. They thought, gee, there are a lot of people  working that would pay taxes if they had some number to allow them to  pay taxes. So even though the law doesn't allow it, we are going to  give these working people taxpayer ID numbers, and then that way, they  will file income tax returns, and we can get all these billions of  dollars in taxes from people that are working here that are here  illegally.   But that went a bit awry because as soon as people began figuring  out, wow, I am filing a tax return, and even though the law requires I  have a valid Social Security number, the IRS is sending me back  thousands of dollars, all I have got to do is file and claim I have a  whole bunch of children somewhere, and they will send me a check.   Well, it is time for that to come to an end. It is time for the law  to be enforced. Some of these things, we don't need new laws, we just  need the law enforced.   What these articles are saying is that the new Attorney General is  intent on enforcing the law as it is, even though a place like  California is spurning its own citizens and saying, we would rather  have people who commit crimes than allow the Federal Government to move  those who commit crimes amongst us.   It is an unbelievable story. That is not governance; that is  insanity.  [[Page H3310]]    Well, I am thrilled the Attorney General is taking a stand for law  enforcement. It has been so badly needed for so many years.   This article from Robert Moore and Matt Zapotosky, believe it or not,  from the Washington Post, they can get an article every now and then of  interest. This is from Las Cruces, New Mexico.   ``Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose Justice Department has come  under intense criticism from President Trump and some congressional  Republicans in recent days, repeatedly praised President Trump in a  speech to law enforcement officials Wednesday about immigration  enforcement.   ``'You might even say we have got a new sheriff in town,''' and that  is pretty true.   But here again, the report comes back that there is this increase,  big increase, people flooding to our border because of all the  discussion about legalization, amnesty, DACA. Until the border is  secured, this body has no business taking up any legislation or even  talking about legislation that will legalize anybody that is here.  Let's get the border secured, then we can work it out.   I have no question whatsoever. In my mind, we could get a bipartisan  legislation passed from the House, through the Senate, the President  will sign it, after the border is secured. But until the border is  secured, we are luring more people to their deaths, into sex  trafficking, just by dangling this shiny object, coming to the United  States, and luring people into their detriment.   If the government were an individual or a company, and it was saying  things that lured people in to an area where they were harmed, then  that person or that company could be sued and would have to pay out  incredible judgments for this attractive--what is called an attractive  nuisance.   They are lured in by promises of legalization, amnesty, DACA, all  this, and yet, some get here, lose their lives on the way, or once they  get inside the border trying to get somewhere, many young women lured,  or forced, rather, into sex trafficking, drugs. That is an outrageous,  attractive nuisance. But since it is the government, you can't sue  them.    Hopefully, we can do something about that, if a State or local  government were trying to get the language right, so that if you are a  State or a local government, and your policies encourage people to come  to the area illegally, and to the detriment of local citizens, you  know, the local government should be liable.   This from Laura Jarrett and Evan Perez, earlier this year: ``Federal  authorities are actively investigating allegations of corruption  related to the Clinton Foundation, the charity of Bill and Hillary  Clinton, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter.''   The reason I am bringing this up, Mr. Speaker, is so many people are  saying nothing is being done and, actually, the reason they are saying  that is we have an ethical Attorney General, unlike previous years, who  doesn't make a big announcement about investigations that are quietly,  ethically taking place.   So a lot of people, because they are used to having Justice  Department officials like Mueller and Comey leaking things, Loretta  Lynch, Eric Holder, leaking things out there that should not be  released and they should not be releasing; now we have a Justice  Department, at least at the top, they are not leaking stuff, so you  don't hear about it much. And that is why I think these articles are  important.   ``The FBI and Federal prosecutors are looking into whether donors to  the foundation were improperly promised policy favors or special access  to Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State in exchange for  donations to the charity's coffers, as well as whether tax-exempt funds  were misused, the official said.   ``The investigation''--and this is not an illegal leak. This is a  legitimate story.   ``The inquiry was first reported by The Hill, which cited law  enforcement sources and a witness who was interviewed.   ``It's unclear precisely what, if any, new evidence ignited the  current Federal investigation, after initial inquiries had stalled  prior to the 2016 election.''   Oh, it reports: ``The investigation, led by the FBI field office in  Little Rock, Arkansas, is being overseen by the U.S. Attorney's Office  in the State, according to the source.''   They are not putting out information about who and what they are  doing like, obviously, Mr. Comey had gotten into the habit of doing.   A representative for the Clinton Foundation dismissed the substantive  allegations as unfounded.   But the article goes on: ``The current probe of the foundation comes  at a sensitive time for the Justice Department.''   ``Some Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have cheered Trump on,  while others within the party, and many Democrats, have raised concerns  in recent months.''   But this article says: ``The fundamental thing is you cannot be  Secretary of State of the United States of America and use that  position to extort or seek contributions to your private foundation.''   CNN was told on New Day in 2016: ``That is a fundamental violation of  law and that does appear to have happened.''   ``The fact remains that Hillary Clinton''--this is from her  spokesperson--she ``never took action as Secretary of State because of  donations to the Clinton Foundation.''   And naturally, that would be the right thing to say because it is a  crime to do that.   But the fact is, and apparently the investigation is into the over  $100 million in donations that were made to the Clinton Foundation that  appears to have dried up and gone nonexistent after Hillary Clinton  lost the election.   So what are you to conclude? Hundreds of millions of dollars pouring  into the Clinton Foundation while she is Secretary of State and while  she has a chance to be President, and as soon as people realize they  could pay but there would be no play, there would be no pay-for-play,  that you would not be able to keep paying for the opportunity to see  the Clintons or get some favor from the State Department or get some  favor from a potential President, dried up, people weren't rushing to  give donations anymore.   This from Daniel Flynn, March 20. ``As Washington obsesses over  alleged collusion involving the Russians and the current  administration, a separate investigation in Little Rock looks into  alleged corruption involving the previous administration and the  Russians.   `` `FBI agents are interviewing people,' Joseph DiGenova, a former  U.S. attorney hired by the President on Monday, told The American  Spectator over the weekend. `That is a big deal. I can assure they are  interviewing people because our firm represents one of the people they  have interviewed.' ''                                time  1300    ``DiGenova says the investigation has been `underway for some time'  and involves the Clinton Foundation, `which includes Uranium One and  its various transactions.' DiGenova notes that he did not know whether  investigators have empaneled a grand jury or not. For many, the FBI  expending resources on interviewing witnesses and investigating the  massive foundation for months indicates that if a grand jury does not  already exist, one will soon.   ``Sources tell The American Spectator that the investigation began  focusing on Uranium One, a Canadian energy company sold to a state- owned Russian company, before broadening to a much wider range of  issues. Though the Clinton Foundation calls Manhattan home and the  State Department operates in Foggy Bottom, Eastern District of Arkansas  U.S. Attorney Cody Hiland presides over the investigation because the  foundation also boasts ventures, including the Clinton Presidential  Center, in Little Rock. The foundation reports on its website that `we  work on issues directly or with strategic partners from the business,  government, and nonprofit sectors to create economic opportunity,  improve public health, and inspire civic engagement and service.' These  partners, given Hillary Clinton's role as Secretary of State from 2009  to 2013, made observers uneasy prior to her assuming that role and led  to special transparency and ethics rules ostensibly embraced by the  foundation. Given uranium's role in nuclear weapons and nuclear energy,  and the U.S.'s position as a minor player in uranium  [[Page H3311]]  production, the specific case of Uranium One involves more than mere  corruption.   `` `What I've always wanted is a grand jury to look at it,' Peter  Schweizer, who exposed the Uranium One scandal to a wide audience in  Clinton Cash and exposes a number of alleged pay-to-play schemes in his  new book Secret Empires, explained to The American Spectator. `The  common sense of the average America will determine pretty quickly that  there was pay to play involved.' ''   In any event, the deal which then put about a fifth of the uranium of  the United States under the control of the Russian Government required  the approval of various Federal Government entities, including Hillary  Clinton's State Department. Rosatom, the energy company owned by the  Russian Government, obtained that approval and optimally gained full  control of Uranium One.   Just incredible.   So, good news. That is being investigated under the Jeff Sessions  Justice Department. There is some good news, and I look forward to real  Russian collusion being exposed after proper investigation and the  projecting, which has occurred by people who did collude improperly  with the Russian Government in the past administration, actually being  held to account for what they did but what they continue to say others  in the Trump administration did in order to try to run out the statute  of limitations on their wrongdoing.   Well, the statutes of limitation haven't all run, the investigations  are ongoing, and I still hold that hope that springs eternal in the  human breast that real justice will be done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
