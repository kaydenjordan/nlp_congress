 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota who  just talked about our recent visit to Ukraine, where we were able to  meet with President Zelenskyy and his top officials and see firsthand  what you can see on TV. But, frankly, the emotion and just the  incredible courage of the Ukrainian people, when you see it in person,  is much more powerful, including going to an airport right outside of  Kyiv where a bunch of inexperienced National Guard troops were able to  fight off a larger and very seasoned group of Russian and Chechen  special operators who landed at that airport.   This was back on February 24. You may remember seeing this on  television. I remember watching CNN and seeing these Russian troops  landing one after another. Twenty-five helicopters came in, and they  were going to use that as a staging area, as you said so well, to not  just take Kyiv but take the entire country and topple the government.  And this small band of National Guard troops, fighting for their  family, fighting for their homeland, and fighting for freedom, as they  told us, were able to instead defeat this group of highly trained  Chechen and Russian special operators and turn the tide. Within 3 days,  they had routed them. Thanks to their bravery and courage, they were  not able to use that staging area to then go into the city of Kyiv,  which is only about 30 minutes away, and be able to topple that  government.    I remember we asked the commander whom we saw there, who was the  commander that night when these helicopters arrived: How did you do it?  Like, how could this have been possible, that you could fight off these  more experienced troops and the world's third biggest army? And his  response was: Because I was fighting for my family. Remember that? So  we saw constantly.   Senator Klobuchar was always good about ensuring that the people of  Ukraine knew that we were standing with them and that we understood the  challenge they face and the fact that this is not just a fight for  freedom in Ukraine but a fight for freedom that affects all of us  around the world. They are the shield, really, of freedom--certainly  for Europe and for so much of the rest of the world.   So I appreciate your, again, going with me on the trip.   We took the last congressional delegation into Ukraine before the  invasion and now the first authorized one, I guess, after. There is so  much we were able to learn when we were there because it was a time  when the U.N. inspectors were coming into Zaporizhzhia. This is the  biggest powerplant in Europe that Senator Klobuchar just talked about.  Thank goodness they were able to get to the plant, inspect the plant,  and make some changes to try to keep the plant from leaking radioactive  material that has the potential to be another Chernobyl and also make a  very declarative statement that you must demilitarize that zone, which  the Russians still have not done. In fact, they have done just the  opposite. They have used that plant as, effectively, a military base by  having their military there, using the plant as a shield to fire on  Ukrainian positions.   They have also destroyed infrastructure going into Ukraine from that  plant, which is very dangerous, but they have used explosives to do so  to try to cut off the electricity going into Ukraine because they would  like to take that electricity and direct it, instead, to Russia and to  Crimea. These are dangerous, dangerous games.   We have seen them play politics with food, destroying bins of grain  all along the southern coast of Ukraine, stopping the ships from going  out. Finally now, because of the U.N. and Turkey and the negotiations,  some ships are going out. But they have used food as a weapon. They  have certainly used energy as a weapon. They continue to do so every  day, as they are doing in Europe, as they cut off even the Nord Stream  1 Pipeline to Europe, insisting the Europeans give up on their  sanctions, which need to be tightened, if anything. Now they are  actually using a nuclear powerplant as a weapon of war--not just  incredibly irresponsible but dangerously reckless and risking a  catastrophe.   So, again, I appreciate Senator Klobuchar coming with me. I  appreciate her leadership on this issue. We have tried to keep this  issue totally nonpartisan, not just bipartisan. The members of the  Ukraine Caucus, including Senator Klobuchar and myself, continue to  meet regularly and get updates as to what is going on in Ukraine and  ensure that we are doing our part here as a leader of freedom-loving  countries all over the world.   As she said, there are many other countries participating. In fact,  there were 50 countries at the recent conference on providing defensive  military assistance to Ukraine. At least 42 countries have provided  serious weapons, like these longer range artillery weapons that are so  essential to Ukraine's success.   So this is not just America alone, but America has a unique  leadership role to play here. That is what we have seen so far. As we  come upon another vote here in the U.S. Senate and the House over the  next couple of weeks, we have to ensure that we continue to take that  leadership role.   I have come to the floor every week for the past 21 weeks--this is  the 22nd week--while we have been in session since the invasion began,  and the focus has been often about kind of grim news about what Russia  is doing: the murders, the rapes, the fact that they are constantly  bombing civilian targets, not just apartment buildings but hospitals  and schools. It is a grim story, and it is a sobering experience to see  this, as we did in Irpin and in Bucha, to see the ditch that the  Russians dug to be able to dump the bodies that have been tortured and  murdered.   But today I am, fortunately, able to talk about some much more  positive news, which is that, at a time of all these tragic  circumstances, the Ukrainians are now making great progress and pushing  back this Russian assault.   So we were here in the Kyiv area. This is where we saw some of the  results of what the Russian troops had done, the atrocities and the war  crimes they had committed--Irpin and Bucha. This is where the airport  was we talked about. You remember, at one point, Russians were all in  this area. They were pushed out and went down to this area called the  Donbas.   The Russians had been making progress down here, frankly, in Donetsk  and Luhansk and even in southern Ukraine here, taking Kherson. This is  one of the key and one of the first cities that Russia took. Here is  Odessa. Here are the ports.   So that is where we were until a couple of weeks ago, but a few weeks  have made a big difference. Just 3 days before we arrived in Kyiv,  there was a counteroffensive that began, and that counteroffensive was  here in the south, so going here toward Kherson, as it is called, and  trying to liberate some of these areas that the Russians had invaded.  This is what they invaded initially back in 2014, and this is what they  invaded more recently. So this Russian war has been going on for 8\1/2\  years.   The good news is that this counteroffensive has been making progress,  and that progress has been not just here in the south but also up here  in the northeast. In fact, in many respects, I think what happened is  Russia moved some of its troops down here to the south, knowing that  this counteroffensive was beginning. In a surprise move that is really  astonishing, the Ukrainian troops have made progress now here in this  area, the northeastern part of Ukraine.   This map will show you a little more detail about what is happening  up north in Kharkiv. And I show you this in part to show progress but  specifically to show and demonstrate to my colleagues that what we  provided in military assistance to Ukraine is working. In particular,  they have been asking for some time for these weapons called HIMARS,  which are rocket systems that allow for a longer range and more  accurate use of artillery. Prior to that, the Russians were sitting  back and firing on Ukrainian positions, destroying towns--again, a lot  of civilian targets--and doing so with impunity because the artillery  from Ukraine could not reach them.   So we now know from public sources there are at least 16 of these  batteries  [[Page S4563]]  that are over in the area. There are also a few from Germany and the  UK. They have made a tremendous difference. That is something, again,  that is in public reporting, but we have also heard quite a bit about  this from their defense secretary and their team.   But here is where we are today. Remember, all this was red in that  larger map. Now, after only a few weeks and, really, just a couple of  weeks in terms of this offensive, you see the great progress that has  been made. A number of these cities that they have taken back are areas  where there is a tremendous advantage to the Ukrainians, because this  city, as an example, is a rail hub that was being used to supply the  Russian troops that are in this part of the Donbas called Luhansk. Now  look at that amount of blue. That is all where the Ukrainians have made  progress. In fact, they have pushed the Russians right back to the  Belarus border or to the Russian border. So this is very positive news.   Again, the reason for it--the reason that Kharkiv Oblast is now  free--is because of the work of 42 countries around the world that  supplied them the necessary equipment, the necessary ammo, to be able  to succeed and because of the courage and bravery, most importantly, of  the Ukrainian fighters. Again, think back to that commander at that  small airport in Kyiv who said: We are fighting for our families, for  our homeland, for our freedom. That gives them a distinct advantage, in  my view.   Let there be no doubt that what happened here in this northeastern  part of Ukraine was a collapse of demoralized Russian forces who fled,  often leaving behind Russian armored vehicles, personnel carriers,  tanks. You have seen some of that, perhaps, on the news coverage. On  the other side were Ukrainians showing courage, tenacity, and  determination.   The Ukrainians not just outsmarted the Russians, but they were braver  and charged into the breach to liberate, by the way, thousands, if not  millions, from Russian domination. People came out of their homes, by  the way, to embrace these Ukrainian soldiers and to thank them--people  who had been hiding in their homes, people who had been living under  these terrible conditions and suffering from some of the atrocities  from the Russian troops.    There was a great photo that I saw that I wanted to show you, which  is of a bus stop in the Kharkiv Oblast, the Kharkiv region. This is a  bus stop that had been defaced by the Russian soldiers, including  putting the Russian flag on it and other graffiti. Here are some  Ukrainians repainting this bus stop with, of course, the colors of  Ukraine, yellow and blue--yellow standing for the sunflower fields that  at one time were all over the country of Ukraine. Unfortunately,  because of the war, that production will be down about 50 percent this  year, but it is a beautiful sight to see those sunflower fields, which  I have seen throughout Ukraine. And, second, of course, there is blue  for the beautiful blue sky.   This is a photograph of people celebrating. I think there is another  one there, too. People are celebrating not just the fact that they can  reclaim their homes but celebrating the fact that their country is  being liberated, that they can, once again, call themselves proud  Ukrainians and stand tall. This is what is happening.   Sometimes the events of the day make it difficult to follow what is  going on in Ukraine. Remember, we saw it on the front pages and the top  of the news for weeks. And then, more recently, we have gotten  distracted with other issues. But it is time for us to refocus on  Ukraine and ensure that we are helping them to continue to make  progress.   Ukraine has the will, the bravery, and the military competence to  win. We have now seen that. What they need are the weapons to be able  to defend themselves and the equipment that we and other nations of the  world can provide for them. The economic aid package that passed here  in the Senate back in May included this funding they needed--again,  funding for the HIMARS, as an example.   It took longer than many of us wanted for the administration to  provide those weapons, but they did provide them and, again, we see  what is happening.   Recently, the administration, just this week, is making another  request, a supplemental request, for additional funding. This time it  is $13.7 billion in Ukraine-related funding, $7.2 billion in military  assistance of two different kinds and then $4.5 billion in budget  support.   This is a country whose economy has been reduced to a shambles thanks  to the Russian invasion, and their economy is down about 40 percent to  50 percent. So until we can have more peace in that country and people  can come back, they need budget support, as well as military support,  just to be able to pay salaries for first responders and teachers.   I was pleased that Secretary of State Blinken also made a recent  surprise visit to Kyiv right after our visit to let Ukraine know that  the Biden administration and this country stands with them. He told the  leaders the administration will continue to provide long-term support  to Ukraine and to 18 other countries that are at risk of a Russian  invasion in the Eastern European area.   That funding that he promised is from some existing appropriations.  The new money, $13.5 billion, is a new package. This is a lot of money,  but it is important that Congress continue to strongly support Ukraine,  particularly during this incredibly critical period for the country's  future.   This is a fight, again, not just about Ukraine, but it is a fight  about global freedom. If we are not there to help Ukraine and Ukraine  were to lose this fight and Russia were to take Ukraine, the cost we  would all pay would be far, far more.   We have to learn the lessons of the past. Last month, we marked 1  year since the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, when the Biden  administration was rightly criticized for abandoning our allies there.  It was a stain on American credibility. It shook the trust of many of  our allies around the world. I can say that having talked to many of  them in the aftermath, if we were to abandon Ukraine, especially right  after they demonstrated such spectacular military success, we would be  making that mistake all over again. Many would wonder if America could  be trusted to watch their backs.   Remember, Ukraine is a free and democratic country that looks to us,  the United States, as a role model. In 2014, they made a very  deliberate decision, which was to get rid of a Russian-backed corrupt  government and, instead, turn to the West--to Europe, to the United  States--to adopt our free-market approaches but also our democratic  approaches of free speech, free and fair elections, ensuring that they  had transparency and were fighting corruption. That is the country that  we want to hold up as a role model and, certainly, continue to support  them.   In 1994, we made a commitment after the Cold War ended--along with,  by the way, the UK and Russia--that in exchange for them getting rid of  their nuclear weapons in Ukraine, we would stand with them and protect  their territorial integrity. Of course, Russia is not making good on  that pledge, but for the United States of America it is another reason  for us to stand with our allies who have chosen to stand with us.   To underscore the point that the assistance is appreciated, every  time Senator Klobuchar and I were at the meeting, we heard the same  thing, whether it was with President Zelenskyy or whether it was with  people who were in these small towns like Kharkiv or Bucha. It was  ``thank you, thank you, thank you.'' There was deep appreciation for  what we are doing and thankfulness to the American people.   I will remind everyone that Ukraine has never asked for us to put  American boots on the ground. This is not Iraq. This is not  Afghanistan. What they have offered for us is an opportunity to protect  freedom by providing them with the ability to protect themselves. We  can't let Vladimir Putin even begin to think that the West is beginning  to falter in this mission, especially as this counteroffensive makes  more and more progress as the war crosses the 200-day mark.   It is important to note that we are not the only ones, again,  providing it. Nations around the world have banded together and that is  important. They know that if aggression can succeed in Ukraine, it can  spread elsewhere, including further Russian encroachments in Europe  that Russia has openly  [[Page S4564]]  talked about, reclaiming the Russian Empire, as they say, and increased  Chinese aggression throughout Asia, including in the Pacific Ocean.   The Solomon Islands is an example of that today, increased Chinese  aggression with regard to Taiwan, and aggressive moves by Iran,  exporting terrorism and instability across the Middle East.   So this is about Ukraine, but it is really about a broader issue, and  all countries are watching--our allies and our adversaries.   I know there are some out there who say we can't provide indefinite  funding to Ukraine, with no end in sight. I totally agree. That is not  what anybody wants to do or no one expects to do. Everyone agrees that  our aid to Ukraine will end at the right point, as Ukraine reclaims its  rightful territory. The question is just when. We cannot let an  arbitrary timeline determine that. We tried that in Afghanistan; it  doesn't work. We have to be guided by the reality on the ground.   It is clear that ending our support now would be premature and ill- advised. We have to step up, and this is money well-spent in defense of  freedom. A Russian victory would be disastrous for U.S. national  security and the stability and volatility of the world, the security of  our NATO allies, and, certainly, the security of Eastern Europe.   We know that Russia would not stop there. Vladimir Putin himself has  said:         The borders of Russia never end.    He talked about recreating the Soviet Union, recreating the Russian  Empire. I would say the borders of Russia end where freedom begins.   Meanwhile, China would see the West's surrender in Ukraine as proof  of the West's ``weakness.'' This would further embolden them. A  Ukrainian victory would have the opposite effect. It would not only  cripple Russia's war machine that President Putin has used to invade  Georgia, Ukraine in 2014, Transnistria, Syria, and parts of Africa  where they continue to meddle. It would also make Russian military  aggression less likely for a long period of time.   With President Putin expected to meet with Chinese President Xi this  week, both men know that the United States and their allies stand  together against rogue aggression against sovereign countries. That is  very important as a message to send.   Of course, with our assistance that we are going to be voting on,  once again, here in this body, there have to be safeguards in place.  There have to be guardrails. We have to ensure that military assistance  is subject to careful accountability.   When Senator Klobuchar and I were there, we talked to the 101st  Airborne in Poland, who are handling a lot of the equipment coming in  from around the world, from all these dozens of other countries and the  United States. They talked a lot about what is called ``end-use  monitoring,'' knowing where these weapons are going precisely to ensure  they are going to the right hands, to ensure there is not an issue with  regard to how these weapons are being used. It has been more difficult  to do that in Ukraine given the security concerns. But during our trip,  we heard about real progress being made to increase that U.S. and  global oversight of our military aid to Ukraine with real end-use  monitoring. As our Embassy in Kyiv begins to bring people back, we have  more American eyes on the ground to ensure that oversight. Ukraine,  itself, by the way, wants that transparency and strongly supports it.   The price that we pay to stop Russia now is small compared to what we  would pay if they succeed, and the deeper price, of course, is being  paid by Ukraine. As NATO Secretary Stoltenberg said recently:         The price we pay is measured in currency. The price they       pay [in Ukraine] is measured in lives lost every day.    We are on the side of freedom. Ukrainians want their freedom back.  They fought for it in 2014 in the Euromaidan. They fought for it  several times in their history. The United States and dozens of our  allies have stepped up to help them achieve this goal and win this  brutal war.   They have this big advantage. They are fighting with heart. They are  fighting for the freedom of their homeland, their families. Russia is  fighting against an enemy that never truly existed in the first place.  They are fighting against a neighbor that never wanted anything but  peace with all their neighbors, including Russia, but now has to take  up arms to protect itself.   Recent polling by the International Republican Institute, IRI, shows  that 98 percent of Ukrainians believe Ukraine will win this war. Their  morale is strong. Their spirit is amazing. That was certainly the  feeling I got from President Zelenskyy, his team, and every other  Ukrainian Senator Klobuchar and I met with on this trip. They are  united together for victory.    We met with parliamentarians from four different parties in the Rada,  the equivalent of their U.S. Congress, their parliament. They are all  together, all working together toward a common cause and a common  enemy.   This morale isn't just in Ukraine. I see this spirit every time I go  back to Ohio, where tens of thousands of Ukrainians call Ohio their  home. These Ukrainian Americans and others from the Eastern European  area--others of the community of nations that have been affected by the  Soviet Union and Russia over the years--they are sticking together and  their morale is high too.   On Sunday, President Zelenskyy brought this spirit to his people in a  powerful address to the Ukrainian people. This was a 200-day speech  that talked of 200 days of brave troops fighting. He said that he was  certain Ukrainians would get through this difficult path to victory.  This was an inspirational speech at a time when the Ukrainian people  are making progress toward victory on the battlefield and, therefore,  peace by getting Vladimir Putin to the bargaining table. This must be  the result.   With our help and the help of all freedom-loving countries, victory  can be achieved. That is what is so important right now as we look at  this new appropriations bill, this legislation that the administration  has sent us to help Ukraine continue its battle for freedom.   My hope is that this week and next, as we take up this legislation,  that Congress passes it, showing the same spirit and the commitment to  victory as we saw in Ukraine.   I yield the floor.
