 Mr. Speaker, by abandoning our Kurdish allies in Syria,  President Trump has allowed ISIS fighters to escape prison, strengthen  Russia, Iran and Syria, and damaged our reputation around the world. He  has also betrayed an ally that fought valiantly alongside American  forces against ISIS and who lost 11,000 soldiers doing so.   The Washington Post reports that American soldiers are sickened by  this betrayal. One retired four-star general described the President's  decision as, ``unsound, morally indefensible, and a disgrace.'' Our  allies around the world are also disturbed. They watched America leave  its friends vulnerable to attack. They took note as a predictable  humanitarian crisis ensued. As The New York Times reports, many now see  the United States as an unreliable, untrustworthy partner.   The President's decision cost many lives, including the lives of  children, and it will have painful consequences for generations to  come.   As our dear colleague, Representative Elijah Cummings, so often said  to us, we are better than this, America is better than this.
