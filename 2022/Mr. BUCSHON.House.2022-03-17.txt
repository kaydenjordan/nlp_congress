 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address America's energy  crisis and the administration's continued assault on American-made  energy that has killed jobs, increased our dependency on foreign oil,  and most recently jeopardized our national security.   Just 1 year ago, our country was comfortably meeting our energy  needs, and we were a net exporter of energy for the first time in 50  years. However, under this administration's leadership or lack thereof,  we have dramatically increased our dependence on foreign oil, sent gas  prices sky high, and increased heating bills during the winter.   Instead of turning to America's own energy sector to meet our energy  needs and continue to make us independent, this administration is  asking countries like Iran and Venezuela to compensate for the ban on  Russian imports and ignoring American energy producers.   In doing so, the administration is prioritizing oil produced by  dictators over American energy producers who support jobs and  businesses here at home.   I urge the administration to flip the switch and reduce our  dependence on foreign energy by increasing production of oil and gas at  home. We can do this.               Modernizing and Streamlining Diagnostic Testing     Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to  legislation that I have been working on with the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Ms. DeGette) called the VALID Act, a bipartisan, bicameral  solution to modernize and streamline diagnostic testing through  establishing a risk-based framework for review and approval of  laboratory-developed tests or in vitro diagnostic tests.   Many of you might be thinking, why does this matter? Well, let me  tell you. Right now in America, laboratory-developed tests are not  regulated for clinical or analytical accuracy. This is a problem. CMS  and FDA have both told us that this is so. They do not regulate these  tests.   Every single day there is a new story of inaccuracy of these  diagnostic tests that can be life changing and life altering with  severe consequences. As a doctor, it breaks my heart to hear of  situations where, for example, a young woman falsely tests positive for  a potential risk for cancer, takes preventive action to save her life  potentially,  [[Page H3786]]  an irreversible action that might prevent her from ever having more  children, only to find out that the test was falsely positive and  inaccurate.   A recent article in The New York Times outlined the inaccuracy of  some prenatal diagnostic blood tests, which were very inaccurate. This  may lead to potential life-changing medical decisions based on these  false results. It is absolutely devastating.   If passed, the VALID Act would protect patients and save lives by  ensuring Americans can rely on the test results they receive while also  allowing leading-edge development and innovation to thrive in our  hospitals and laboratories.                            ____________________
