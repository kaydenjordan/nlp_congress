 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me first start by thanking Mr. Crist of Florida for cosponsoring  this amendment. I also want to recognize the work of my good friend  from Maryland,   John Sarbanes, on the underlying bill and his efforts  to make our democracy work for the people.   My amendment would guarantee access to early voting during every day  of the week, including Sundays, to every American.   Early voting makes voting more convenient by providing Americans with  greater flexibility and opportunity to cast a ballot. More and more  Americans are taking advantage of early voting, with more than 40  million citizens casting ballots before election day last year.   But guaranteeing fair and flexible early voting on Sundays is not  just a matter of convenience. It is critical for minority voters who  disproportionately take advantage of Sunday early voting and often face  higher barriers and disparate burdens when deciding to cast a ballot:  lost pay, childcare expenses, transit costs.   In my State and in States across the country, churches promote ``take  your souls to the polls'' programs that take church parishioners from  Sunday services to the voting booth. So cuts to Sunday early voting, as  we have witnessed across this country, have had a negative impact,  especially on communities of color.   Six States have cut back on early voting, and even more have tried  but were blocked by the courts.   In North Carolina, lawmakers deliberately cut Sunday voting, saying 6  days of voting in one week is enough. But this action was struck down  because, as the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals noted, it targeted  African Americans with almost surgical precision.   Our democracy doesn't work if we don't give people the fullest  opportunity to make their voices heard. We should make it easier for  people to vote, not harder, and this amendment does exactly that.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, in an ideal world, perhaps, we  don't mandate from the Federal Government, but when the Fourth Circuit  determines that the North Carolina Legislature did it to target African  Americans with almost surgical precision in eliminating Sunday voting,  it is time for action at the Federal level so we can ensure every  American has the right to vote.   Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Crist), my friend and a cosponsor of this amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), the chairwoman of the Committee on House  Administration.                                time  1530     I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent that my  amendment be modified with the form I have placed at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would require States  to notify voters of polling location changes no later than 7 days prior  to the first day of early voting, providing every voter as much time as  possible to plan how and when they will vote, and avoiding last minute  polling place changes that, more often than not, discourage people from  exercising their right to vote.   Research shows that the most important factor that impacts whether  someone votes or not is the location of the polling place and the  effort it takes to get there.   A 2011 study in the American Political Science Review said changing a  location of a polling place can significantly lower voter turnout.   Unfortunately, since 2008, and further accelerated in 2013, when the  Supreme Court struck down key parts of the Voting Rights Act, nearly  15,000 polling places have been closed across the country; many of them  are located in southern Black communities.   Polling places have been used as political tools to shape the outcome  of elections for generations, and it continues to happen today.   Before the 2018 elections, States and local election boards closed  polling places at colleges and universities, consolidated polling  places in predominantly-minority neighborhoods to save money, and moved  polling locations away from public transportation.   These changes discourage participation in our democracy, and make our  system of government weaker. That is why Congress must take action to  protect the rights of the people, to have a government by the people,  for the people.   By providing sufficient notice, every voter can decide whether to  cast a vote on Election Day or, as this bill provides, take advantage  of early voting or no-excuse absentee voting.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Sadly, Madam Chair, in this country there are  far too many States and/or local election officials that are not  committed to fair and open elections. And as we have seen by decisions  in courts at every level, rolling back actions by State legislatures to  change polling sites, to take away early voting opportunities, there  are some times in the history of this Nation, and this is one of them,  when it comes to protecting voting rights, where it is a Federal  responsibility to do so.   In an optimal world, in an optimal situation, where we had truly free  and fair and open elections, perhaps this amendment and perhaps even  this legislation wouldn't be required. That is not the world we live in  today, although it is an aspirational place to be.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), the chair of the House Administration  Committee.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I will close by just encouraging  all my colleagues to support this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This amendment would require a portion of early voting hours to occur  outside of normal business hours. This simple, yet effective amendment  would ensure that every working individual has the opportunity to cast  their ballot without taking time off from work, having to find child  care, or risking being reprimanded by their employer.                                time  1545    While early voting has become increasingly commonplace, States and  localities continue to change and restrict hours every election,  sometimes closing as early as 4 p.m., making it problematic for those  whose workdays may have irregular schedules or are unable to take time  away from work.   Despite State laws guaranteeing many workers time off to go vote, too  many Americans have neither the luxury of an employer that will give  them time off to vote nor the financial freedom to risk losing a few  hours' wages in order to participate in our democracy. That is why  early voting is so important.   But holding early voting during business hours is just another way  citizens have been impeded from exercising their right to vote,  particularly middle-class working Americans in the service,  manufacturing, and other blue-collar industries. These Americans often  rely on a 9 to 5 schedule and don't have the same opportunity to vote.   To ensure everyone's voice can be heard and early voting is  convenient for every American, locations should remain open well after  the traditional close of business.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, keeping the same terminology of  ``bottom-up'' and ``top-down,'' I think the Founders contemplated both,  that when it comes to Federal elections, it would be both a bottom-up  and a top-down.   As my friend from Illinois was reminded during the last debate,  Article I, Section 4 says, and I will read it in its entirety: ``The  times, places, and manner of holding elections for Senators and  Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the legislature  thereof''--that sounds like bottom-up to me--``but the Congress may at  any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the places  of choosing Senators.''   I think that is what you would refer to as a top-down, contemplated  by the Founders, implemented and embraced here in H.R. 1. Why? So that  we can protect, expand, promote, and defend the right for every single  American to vote and to make sure it is as convenient and accessible to  every American regardless of race, color, creed, gender, sexual  orientation, or gender identity.   Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   This amendment will require States to include in their biannual  report to Congress on the voter information hotline statistics to  include a description of any actions taken in response to reports of  voter intimidation or suppression.   Discouraging voter participation through intimidation or suppression  tactics runs against the very foundation of our democracy, but these  tactics continue to play an unfortunate role in our elections today.   When I ran for Lieutenant Governor of Maryland in 2010, my opponent  hired a consultant who advised my opponent that ``. . . the first and  most desired outcome is voter suppression'' by having ``African  American voters stay home.''   To that end, my opponent made thousands of election day robocalls to  Democrat voters telling them that Democrats had won; although, in fact,  the polls were still open for 2 more hours.   The call told voters: Relax. Everything is fine. The only thing left  is to watch it on TV tonight.   It reached 112,000 voters in majority African American areas.   This is just one example of the despicable tactics that have become  commonplace in our elections.   We have the responsibility to confront these attempts to target  individuals and influence whether or not they vote.   In 2019, too many Americans are still being harassed, threatened, and  barred from exercising their right to vote. My amendment will ensure  election officials do their job by helping voters who don't know where  to vote, why their polling place is closed, or why they are being  turned away.   This is an essential element to make our elections more free, more  fair, and will help safeguard the integrity of our elections by holding  election officials accountable for protecting every citizen's right to  vote.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, turning back to the amendment,  what the amendment does is it simply holds local election officials  accountable and to be responsive to the claims, the calls, the concerns  that are raised to them regarding voter intimidation, voter  suppression, ensuring that when they are collecting that information,  that they also report on what the response is to the claims that are  made.   Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), chair of the House Administration Committee.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time I  have remaining.    Madam Chair, the issue raised by the gentleman  from Illinois is neither helped nor harmed by this amendment. He raises  an issue that we can take up perhaps another day.   But what this bill simply does is it requires that local elected  officials be responsive and report on the responses they take to claims  of intimidation and suppression.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
