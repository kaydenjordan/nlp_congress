 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about two very honorable  lives, Paul Besaw and Lahiri Garcia, who were both taken from us far  too soon by the criminal acts of one who was illegally in our country.   A death of our innocent neighbors is especially devastating when it  could have been prevented had our immigration laws been upheld and had  they been working.   Paul and Lahiri were paramedics in my community, dedicated to saving  lives, but on January 1, a man illegally in our country, driving drunk,  collided with their ambulance and killed both of them.   Paul left behind his loving wife, Dawn, and his 6-year-old daughter,  Allison, who you see here behind me. When I spoke with Paul's widow,  she rightfully said that if our country wasn't ``too afraid or inept to  enforce immigration law,'' her husband would still be with her today,  and she is absolutely right.   Lahiri's wife, Julie Garcia, told me how hard it was for her four  children to not have their father this Father's Day. She expected to  grow old with her husband, but because this man wasn't sent home the  first three times he was pulled over, she will no longer have that  opportunity.   Both wives, both mothers, expressed to me sincere disbelief. They  don't understand why this was allowed to happen, and, for the life of  me, I can't understand why it is allowed either.   The bottom line is that this should never happen to anyone. Sanctuary  cities are a violation of the rule of law, they are absolutely  unacceptable, they  [[Page H5322]]  cannot be tolerated. We must enforce this rule of law.   It is, in fact, the right of every American to be protected by this  government. It is not the right of anybody to spend one day, one  moment, in our country illegally or without invitation.   Today, Congress is addressing this epidemic. Our bills, they crack  down on dangerous sanctuary policies that put these kind of innocent  lives at risk.   So let us ensure that unlawful immigrants convicted of crimes are, in  fact, detained and are, in fact, deported.   Mr. Speaker, let's pass these bills. More importantly, let us be  convicted that what happened to Paul and what happened to Lahiri is  never allowed to happen again.                                time  1445
