 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong support of this bill, the Financial Services and  General Government Appropriations Act.   Mr. Chair, I want to start by congratulating my good friend and  colleague, Chairman   Mike Quigley, for his leadership in bringing our  tenth appropriations bill to the House floor. Speaking from experience,  I know this is no easy task, and I am sure that the relationship  between he and Mr. Graves will have a final product that we can all  vote for.   I am proud that the work that has been accomplished here takes care  of so many issues. This bill provides $24.95 billion to assist elderly  and low-income taxpayers; support our entrepreneurs and grow our small  businesses; ensure the products of our store shelves are safe for  children and families; protect our economy by policing Wall Street;  protect and strengthen the integrity of our election systems; and  provide a 3.1 percent pay raise for Federal employees; and, once again,  empower the District of Columbia to handle its own local affairs.                                time  1515    The administration has proposed to eliminate the Community  Development Financial Institutions Fund, risking the public-private  investments that are generating economic growth in places like my  district in the South Bronx. In response, Congress is investing $300  million for this invaluable program, an increase of $50 million over  fiscal year 2019.   This bill also provides $600 million in Election Assistance  Commission security grants to help State election officials improve the  security and integrity of our elections. Our election systems remain  vulnerable, and additional investments like this can give voters the  peace of mind that, when they cast their ballot, their vote will count  and be counted correctly. As we approach elections this fall in several  States across the country and the Presidential election next year, we  must be ready to combat any attempts to disrupt our democratic  institutions.   The Small Business Administration will receive nearly $1 billion to  continue providing technical assistance and other services our Nation's  businessmen need to help get their business ideas off the ground.   Out of the total amount, $150 million will go to the Small Business  Development Centers Program, $35 million will help provide Microloan  technical assistance, and $30 million will go toward supporting and  investing in women-owned businesses through the Women's Business  Centers. These investments will help create jobs.   Last but not least, this bill once again restores home rule to the  District of Columbia. I cannot think of anything more insulting than  telling any city across our country how they can spend their locally  raised funds or requiring congressional approval to implement laws  their duly elected government officials enact. The intrusive policy  riders the bill removes will ensure D.C. can govern itself without  congressional meddling and address the challenges it faces in serving  its residents.   This is now our 10th bill on the floor. Our Appropriations Committee  is doing the work of the people, and I congratulate, once again, Mr.  Quigley for his work. I stand ready to vote for this with great  enthusiasm.    Madam Speaker, we are now in the midst of a humanitarian  crisis at the border created by the policies of the Trump  administration.   Like many of my colleagues, I have been shocked by the conditions at  our border stations and the lack of basic services and necessities  available to migrant families and especially to minors.   This crisis has been aggravated by the anti-immigration policies of  this  [[Page H5154]]  President. He has once against created a disaster that undermines our  Nation's standing in the world and our basic American values.   No one should doubt why we are here today, but the question for me is  not who is at fault but, rather, how do we as a body, how do we as a  party, respond? We have a responsibility to these children now. We have  an obligation to these families now. They cannot wait.   That is what this bill does. It provides the resources to alleviate  the crisis and ensures that we have the money to provide migrants,  especially minors, with the shelter, food, medicine, and legal services  that they need.   The funding in this bill is not a blank check, however. The  legislation includes numerous conditions to ensure this money is used  for its intended purposes, to make sure that individuals are receiving  the care and services they need, and to prevent the administration from  creating further chaos and harm.   This bill takes the right steps to address the crisis and to stop  what the administration is doing. I urge my colleagues to support this  bill. If we cry out against the crisis, then we have a responsibility  to provide the funds to alleviate it. The bill does just that, and I  urge my colleagues' support.
