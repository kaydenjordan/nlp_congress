 Mr. President, once again I want to thank my colleague  from Illinois for both his passion and his intelligence in terms of his  approach to the Dream Act. We are getting closer to getting this done.  It is hardly done yet, but without the Senator from Illinois, we would  not be as close to ``as close,'' so to speak, as we are today.                                Hurricane Irma    Now, Mr. President, I want to first start off by saying that I hope  that everyone in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina is staying safe  as Hurricane Irma continues up the coast. Reports indicate that as many  as 9 million Floridians have gone without power during the storm. Large  parts of Miami and Jacksonville are under water. The Florida Keys have  taken a particular beating. I saw the pictures on TV this morning.   As with Hurricane Harvey, the road to recovery will be long. As I  said yesterday, I am ready to work with the administration and my  Republican colleagues, when the time comes, to pass an aid package for  the States dealing with Hurricane Irma.                     National Defense Authorization Bill    Mr. President, as discussions continue on NDAA, I would highlight a  few amendments that are important to the Democratic side. We will be  offering two amendments as part of our Better Deal agenda, including a  ``Buy American'' provision and an amendment that would drastically cut  down on outsourcing.   For too long, loopholes in our ``Buy American'' rules have allowed  Federal agencies to waive ``Buy American'' requirements and skirt the  spirit of the law. A single loophole--the overseas exemption, which  allows a Federal agency to waive ``Buy American'' rules if the product  is intended for use overseas--accounts for 65 percent of the exemptions  that the Department of Defense issues in a given year.   Senator Baldwin has an amendment that would eliminate these loopholes  and ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent by Federal agencies to  purchase products that are made here in the United States.   My friend Senator Stabenow has been a leading voice on this issue as  well. She has an amendment that would also roll back the overseas  exemption by requiring the DOD to identify and give consideration to  domestically sourced items before soliciting any offers for anything  that is not ``Buy American'' compliant.   Right now, there are also several American companies with records of  outsourcing American jobs that are receiving defense contracts, and  companies receive a tax credit for outsourcing expenses rather than  incentives to  [[Page S5195]]  bring jobs back to the United States. We should put a stop to both, and  Senator Donnelly's amendment will do that. His amendment will give a  tax credit of up to 20 percent for expenses that companies incur to  bring jobs back to our shores.   Another critical amendment is a bipartisan amendment offered by  Senators Graham and Klobuchar on the issue of election security. The  consensus of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies was that Russia, a foreign  adversary, interfered in our elections. Make no mistake--their success  in 2016 will encourage them to try again. We have State elections in a  couple of months, and the 2018 election is a little more than a year  away. We must improve our defenses now to ensure that we are prepared.  The Graham-Klobuchar amendment would greatly strengthen our defenses,  helping to prepare States for the inevitable cyber attacks that  threaten the integrity of our elections. We should pass it as part of  the NDAA.   As Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed continue discussions on  this bill--and I know their relationship is a good and strong one--I  hope they strongly consider the inclusion of these three critical  amendments.                        Election Integrity Commission    Mr. President, speaking of elections, a word on President Trump's  Election Integrity Commission, which is meeting with the public for the  first time today in New Hampshire. I have three points.   First, I would like to dispel the idea that this Commission has  anything to do with election integrity. It was borne out of the  President's baseless claim that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally  in the 2016 elections. That is just not true. The Commission will never  find evidence to support that claim.   Second, the public officials on this Commission must stop making  similarly outrageous claims about voter fraud in elections. Recently,  the Commission's Vice Chair, Kris Kobach, claimed that the New  Hampshire Senate election could have been swung by illegal votes  because they found a number of voters who had out-of-State licenses. Of  course, there are several reasonable, legal, legitimate reasons as to  why someone would vote in a State while having a license from a  different State. Most likely, if you live at a college in New Hampshire  but come from out of State, your car has an out-of-State license plate.  By State law, if you are registered at a New Hampshire college, it is  perfectly legal to vote there.   We all know that the States set these laws. In fact, when the  Washington Post tried to identify some of these voters, the first four  they randomly called were all college students who lived in New  Hampshire but who went to school elsewhere.   Yet this Commission and, I would say, particularly its Vice Chair,  Mr. Kobach, are so eager to prove their point--which is virtually  unprovable--that there is a huge amount of voter fraud that they come  up with these baseless claims and then have to back off. Throwing these  kinds of deeply misleading, bogus claims around about stolen elections  and massive voter fraud without there being any actual evidence is  extremely irresponsible and damaging to our democracy. They are so  eager to prove their point about voter fraud, which is demonstrably  false, that they are resorting to these crazy claims, discrediting  their Commission and discrediting themselves.   Lastly, a broader point. The Election Integrity Commission is a  punishment in search of a transgression that never happened, which  shows that it likely has an ulterior motive.   Voter fraud is extremely rare. A comprehensive study by the  Washington Post in 2014 concluded that out of over 1 billion ballots  cast between 2000 and 2014, there were only 31 credible instances of  voter fraud, and even some of those were debatable, according to the  study. The Brennan Center for Justice concluded that an American has a  better chance of being struck by lightening than impersonating another  voter at the polls.   So why the need for a Presidential advisory commission? Because the  real target of the Election Integrity Commission is not voter fraud but  voter suppression, especially the suppression of African-American  voters, poor voters, elderly voters, and Latino voters. Just like the  campaigns for outrageous voter ID laws in State after State--many have  been thrown out by the courts for being blatantly discriminatory--the  Election Integrity Commission seems focused on throwing up barriers to  voting through intimidation, misleading claims, and controversial  tactics, like the widespread collection of sensitive, personal voter  information.   I think what this Commission is trying to do flies in the face of  what the country is all about. We want everyone to vote. We do not want  to scare people, intimidate people, or make it harder for people to  vote. If there were overwhelming evidence of fraud, obviously we would  need to do something, but there is not. As I said, it is a solution--a  nasty solution--in search of a problem. The Election Integrity  Commission ought to be disbanded, and we will be looking for ways to do  that legislatively.   The real threat to election integrity comes not from voter fraud but  from foreign meddling and cyber attacks. We should pass the Graham- Klobuchar amendment rather than continue with the nonsense of this  Commission.   Moreover, with voter participation rates being so low, we should be  spending our time and energy encouraging more Americans to exercise  their fundamental right to vote rather than wasting taxpayer dollars  for a commission to solve a problem that does not exist.             50th Anniversary of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation    Mr. President, before I yield the floor, today is the 50th  anniversary of the founding of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation, which  does great work in my State in combating a very debilitating type of  disease. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the  accomplishments of the foundation and encouraging more research, better  access to care, and improved treatments for patients with Crohn's  disease and ulcerative colitis.   The New York-based Crohn's & Colitis Foundation, along with its  partnering chapters across the country, is the largest national  voluntary health group seeking the cure for Crohn's disease and  ulcerative colitis. It also works to improve the quality of life of  children and adults affected by these diseases.   One in every 200 Americans struggles with Crohn's disease or  ulcerative colitis, collectively known as inflammatory bowel diseases,  IBD. Although no cause has been identified for Crohn's disease, recent  research suggests hereditary, genetics, and/or environmental factors  contribute to the development of the disease. Further complicating  matters, ulcerative colitis is the result of an abnormal response by  the body's immune system.   The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation sponsors basic and clinical research  of the highest quality and offers a wide range of educational programs  and supportive services for patients and healthcare professionals. In  2015, IBD Plexus was launched. IBD Plexus is a groundbreaking  initiative that provides the infrastructure and capacities to  facilitate and accelerate research into the causes and treatments of  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.   Federal agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health through  the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,  the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control and Prevention, and the  Department of Defense each support meaningful research and public  health activities on Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  Furthermore, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services both play a significant role in  approving new treatments and facilitating health care financing  policies that impact patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative  colitis.   I deeply appreciate the work of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation and  its longstanding dedication to the patients it represents. They have  endeavored to improve the quality of life of so many Americans, and the  U.S. Senate recognizes the foundation's 50th anniversary.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  [[Page S5196]]
