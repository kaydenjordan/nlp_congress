 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5247) to authorize the use of eligible investigational drugs  by eligible patients who have been diagnosed with a stage of a disease  or condition in which there is reasonable likelihood that death will  occur within a matter of months, or with another eligible illness, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5247         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Trickett Wendler, Frank       Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try       Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. USE OF UNAPPROVED INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS BY PATIENTS                     DIAGNOSED WITH A TERMINAL ILLNESS.         (a) In General.--Subchapter E of chapter V of the Federal       Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb et seq.) is       amended by inserting after section 561A (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-0)       the following:       ``SEC. 561B.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the patients who face terminal  diagnoses but have exhausted all available treatment options. These are  patients like Jordan McLinn, who is with us today.   Jordan is a tireless fighter who self-advocates for others living  with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He is a namesake of this bill we are  considering, like Matt Bellina, who testified before the Health  Subcommittee last year. Because of folks like Jordan and Matt, we have  a chance to increase patient access to experimental therapies.   Thirty-eight States across our great land have right-to-try laws,  including my home State of Oregon. Wisconsin, with a bill on its way to  Governor Scott Walker's desk, will soon make it 39. While the State  policies vary, they have a common goal: helping vulnerable patients.   President Trump praised the movement during the State of the Union,  saying: ``People who are terminally ill should not have to go from  country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance here at  home.''   Now, today, there is an existing process for patients to access  unapproved drugs. The FDA oversees expanded access, commonly known as  compassionate use. This program has been critical in helping patients  access experimental drugs.   Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and the Agency, the FDA, should be  commended for their continued work to improve the expanded access  program for patients.   To improve this successful program, the bill before us today also  provides liability protections for manufacturers, sponsors, physicians,  clinical investigators, and hospitals that participate in the existing  expanded access program and the new alternative pathway created under  this legislation.   This provision removes one of the biggest hurdles that patients have  faced in getting access to these medicines, in gaining access to  experimental therapies, as identified by the Government Accountability  Office: manufacturer hesitancy to participate. That is the big hurdle.  We seek to overcome it with this legislation.   The bill also creates a new alternative pathway for patients who do  not qualify for a clinical trial. This legislation strengthens patient  protections with clearer informed consent and adverse event reporting.   The bill also ensures the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, is  notified when a patient receives an unapproved drug through the new  alternative pathway to ensure there is proper oversight.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the House sponsors of this legislation  who have worked tirelessly to bring this to a good place today: Brian  Fitzpatrick, our colleague from Pennsylvania;  Andy Biggs from Arizona;  and Morgan Griffith from Virginia. I also thank the Vice President,  with whom Jordan and I met today. I am grateful for their work on  behalf of these courageous patients, and I urge all my colleagues in  the House to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I now have the honor of yielding 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), who has been,  even before he got to the Congress, an extraordinary advocate for this  cause and for the patients with terminally ill conditions.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Barton), the former chairman of the full committee and the  current vice chairman.   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, the last two speakers from California and Texas, two of  our biggest States, a grand total of two legislators voted ``no.''  Otherwise, it was unanimous in both those States to do what we are  doing here today.  [[Page H1525]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs), an incredible advocate of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, when Illinois took this up, they approved it  169-1 in their assembly.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Griffith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), the chair of our Health Subcommittee. Texas voted  unanimously for the Right to Try Act.    I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter), a distinguished member of our committee and a pharmacist by  training and trade.    Mr. Speaker, we have two, I believe, left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains  for each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when the Energy and Commerce Committee took up this  issue in its broadest form, we heard from the FDA Commissioner, we  heard from patients, we heard from family members, and what we heard  was that there are barriers in States that preclude these State laws  from working.   That is what the Government Accountability Office told us. They  identified two issues--liability and use of outcomes--as the two  barriers as to why these laws passed in 38, soon to be 39, States. And  in many cases--most cases, I would say--these laws have passed  unanimously, with Republicans and Democrats back home supporting them,  including in my own State. I think it was unanimous in both the house  and the senate, all controlled by Democrats, in Oregon.   We have listened to our constituents; we have observed what has  happened in our States--great laboratories--and we are acting here  today to allow those who have been given this wretched, wretched  prescription that their life is about to end to have a chance and a  choice. That is what we are doing today. We are overcoming the barriers  that exist at the State level. We are doing it in a reasonable and  thoughtful way that protects patient safety and creates this new  alternative pathway for them.   This is important legislation. It is not often in this body we get  this opportunity to make this kind of a change and provide chance and  hope for those who see their loved ones dying before their eyes.   I met with Jordan McLinn and his mother, Laura, earlier today. They  have been incredible advocates for this cause. And they had just come  from a meeting with Vice President Pence, who, with the President, has  been an extraordinary supporter of this effort.   From his Bible, Jordan showed me the Parable of the Lost Sheep, which  is one of his favorites. It is a parable he had shared with the Vice  President.   That Parable of the Lost Sheep tells us that not a single sheep  should be lost, that the shepherd cares about them all. That same  sentiment is what brings us here to right to try today.   Every opportunity to save a life matters, and every patient deserves  that right to try. That is the legislation before us today, Mr.  Speaker. It is well conceived, it is well thought out, and it will make  a difference in saving lives.   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and pass this legislation  and give people a right to try.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
