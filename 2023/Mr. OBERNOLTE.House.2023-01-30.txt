 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 342, the Cost- Sharing Accountability Act.   Mr. Speaker, research and development grants in the field of energy  administered by the Department of Energy play a critical role in  innovation and energy research in the United States. The administration  and awarding of those grants is governed by the Energy Policy Act of  2005.   Among other things, that act requires the DOE to impose a cost share  on the recipients of those grants. That cost share can be as low as 20  percent in the case of research and development grants, or as high as  50 percent in the case of commercialization and demonstration grants.   The purpose of this cost share is simple. It is to ensure that the  grant recipients also have some skin in the game when it comes to  ensuring the success of the grants and the projects that they are  bidding on and demonstrating.   Several months ago, the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of  the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held an oversight  hearing in which we investigated the occasions on which the Department  of Energy had waived those cost-sharing requirements on grants that it  had awarded.   The DOE has the statutory ability to waive those cost shares under  the appropriate circumstances. We wanted to make sure that that  authority was being exercised judiciously.   Although we found that the DOE was appropriately waiving those cost  shares under those circumstances, we were very surprised by the lack of  transparency in that process and equally surprised by the difficulty  with which the subcommittee had in acquiring the information about how  often the DOE was waiving those cost shares.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 342, is a very simple solution to that  problem. It will require the DOE to make quarterly reports to the  committees of jurisdiction in both the House and the Senate on the  occasions and the circumstances under which it waives cost-share  requirements for the grants that it awards.                                time  1645    This will enhance Congress' ability to exercise oversight over the  DOE. Equally importantly, it will impose greater transparency into this  process for the parties that apply for these grants, and it will  demonstrate the circumstances under which the DOE would consider  waiving those cost-share requirements.   Mr. Speaker, this is basic good governance. It is an oversight bill.  I hope it is something that we all on both sides of the aisle can  support.   I thank my cosponsor, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), for  his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 342.
