 Less than 10 minutes.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am asking for a ruling on the unanimous  consent request I just made.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I add to that unanimous consent request  that I be given the final 5 minutes before the vote.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, we have a longstanding tradition in our  country of civilian control of government and civilian control of the  military. This was first symbolized by George Washington through his  act of resigning as Commander in Chief for all of the Continental Army  on December 23, 1783. It is a tradition, or a moment in time, that is  preserved on the walls of the Rotunda where a mural depicts  Washington's noble and selfless act.   Our early days were full of the warnings of a standing Army and of  ongoing military control at high levels, and those ideas came from  Thomas Jefferson and from Alexander Hamilton and from Samuel Adams.  When we came to the point in our history where we realized that a  continuing military force was necessary, we preserved the importance of  civilian control.   We did so for a host of important reasons, which others have pointed  out on this floor but I think are worth restating. It is important to  have a Secretary of Defense who brings a broad world view that includes  a civilian perspective to the position.   Second, it is important not to politicize our officer ranks and have  them essentially competing to position themselves to hold this position  of Secretary of Defense.   Third, we do not want the services competing against each other in  order to hold this position. This is why the Joint Chiefs of Staff  position is rotated on a specific schedule. And if we have a Secretary  of Defense come from one military service, then another branch of  service is going to say: Next time it should be our turn. The Marine  Corps today, the Air Force tomorrow, the Army after that, and then the  Navy. That is not the position we want to end up in.   We also know that across the world, countries wrestle with preserving  civilian control; that is, preserving democratic republics in the face  of the power of military machinery in their country, military  organizations, and we see military coups and we see massive military  influence.   It has been the desire of our country to model a republic that is of  the people, by the people, and for the people, not a nation that  becomes controlled by a massive concentration of power in the military.  Now my colleagues--many of whom are very learned in the history of our  country--have arisen to say that there is a set of special  circumstances, a unique set of circumstances, that merit an exception,  and they note that there was an exception once before in our history.  That exception was the appointment of George C. Marshall to become  Secretary of Defense in the time following  [[Page S306]]  World War II. But think about how many circumstances we face in the  world that can be put forward to be an exceptional time. It was  exceptional when terrorists used planes to attack the Twin Towers in  New York City and our Pentagon, and had not one plane gone down, the  additional target may have been the Capitol or the White House. That  was an exceptional moment. It is an exceptional moment when we are  fighting Al Qaeda. It is an exceptional moment when we are fighting  ISIS. It is an exceptional moment when Russia invades Ukraine and takes  over Crimea. There is an exceptional moment almost continuously in the  face of a complex and changing world.   So I stand on the side of maintaining the principle of civilian  control. Each time we violate this principle, it is easier next time to  say: It has been done before. But the conversation will not be ``We did  it once half a century ago, and so we should do it again,'' it will be  ``We did it twice, once quite recently when we weren't facing a world  crisis. Nobody had invaded the United States. We had not just lost a  couple hundred thousand folks fighting for our country in a world  war.'' So the conversation will get easier and more fragile, and that  is not the direction we should go.   It was Eisenhower who warned about the overreach of a military  enterprise--the ``military industrial complex,'' as he referred to it.  But one piece of our structure of government that has held back is to  maintain that principle of civilian control. Can anyone in this room  rise up and say that out of the thousands of experienced individuals  who have both national security experience and civilian experience,  there isn't one who currently meets either the 10- or 7-year standard  of separation? I am sure there are hundreds who could meet that  standard.   So here we are. If we could send a message to the President-elect: We  reject your effort to eviscerate civilian control. Send us someone who  is qualified. And if we feel that person is so far out of the reach of  reason--which is what I have been hearing from my colleagues in private  conversation, terrified that this President-elect will nominate  somebody who basically is unhinged, that we have to seize on this  moment to take this individual because this body won't have the courage  to turn down and reject an unhinged individual nominated by this  President-elect. That is a sad commentary on the leadership of this  body. It is a sad commentary on what has become of the U.S. Senate that  we wouldn't have the courage under our advice and consent power to turn  down someone we saw as unfit. That is, in fact, how we are charged  under this Constitution, under the advice and consent clause. It was  Hamilton who laid out that it is our responsibility to determine  whether an individual is of fit character or unfit character, and we  would retain that power for any nomination that, in the collective  judgment of this body, did not meet that standard.   So let's sustain the principle of civilian control and reject this  change.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Oregon who  asked if there were not any people who were qualified to serve as  Secretary of Defense, I am absolutely certain there are. Is there  anyone as qualified as General Mattis? My answer to the Senator from  Oregon is no. I have watched General Mattis for years. I have seen the  way that enlisted and officers react to his leadership. I have seen the  scholarly approach he has taken to war and to conflict.   I hope the Senator from Oregon will have at some point a chance to  get to know him, and he will then appreciate the unique qualities of  leadership that are much needed in these times where the outgoing  President of the United States has left the world in a state of chaos  because of an absolute failure of leadership, which is disgraceful. We  now see an outgoing President of the United States who in 2009  inherited a world that was not being torn apart in the Middle East. The  Chinese were not acting assertively in the South China Sea. The  Russians had not dismembered Ukraine and taken Crimea, in gross  violation of international law. All of those things have come about  because of his presidency.   So now he comes to the floor and objects to one of the most highly  qualified individuals and leaders in military history. I say to the  Senator from Oregon: You are wrong.   I believe the overwhelming majority of this body will repudiate and  cancel out his uninformed remarks.   Mr. President, in a few minutes we will vote on a historic piece of  legislation. For just the second time in seven decades, the legislation  before us would provide an exception to the law preventing any person  from serving as Secretary of Defense within 7 years of Active-Duty  service as a regular commissioned officer of the Armed Forces. This  legislation would allow Gen. James Mattis--the President-elect's  selection for Secretary of Defense, who retired from the Marine Corps 3  years ago--to serve in that office.   Earlier today, the Senate Armed Services Committee received testimony  from General Mattis. Once again, he demonstrated exceptional command of  the issues confronting the United States, the Department of Defense,  and our military servicemembers, but he also showed something else-- that his understanding of civil-military relations is deep and that his  commitment to civilian control of the Armed Forces is ironclad.   General Mattis's character, judgment, and commitment to defending our  Nation and its Constitution have earned him the trust of our next  Commander in Chief, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, and  so many who are serving in our Armed Forces. General Mattis is an  exceptional public servant worthy of the exceptional consideration.  That is why, directly following the conclusion of today's hearing, the  Senate Armed Services Committee reported this legislation to the Senate  with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 24 to 3--I repeat: with an  overwhelming vote of 24 to 3.   I am not saying that members of the Armed Services Committee are  smarter than the Senator from Oregon, but I am saying that members of  the Armed Services Committee have scrutinized--both sides of the aisle,  Republican and Democrat, including the ranking member--have looked at  General Mattis. Many of us have known him for years and years, as he  has shown the outstanding characteristics of leadership that he has had  the opportunity to display in his service to the country, and he was  voted out by an overwhelming vote of 24 to 3. So obviously there are 24  people on the Armed Services Committee who believe in General Mattis  and believe that this exception should be made, as opposed to 3 who  share the view of the Senator from Oregon.    I ask my colleague from Arizona if he will yield for a  question.   Mr. McCAIN. That is why, directly following the conclusion of today's  hearing, the Senate Armed Services Committee reported this legislation  to the Senate with a vote of 24 to 3. I urge this body to follow suit.   That said, it is important for future Senators to understand the  context of our action here today. Civilian control of the Armed Forces  has been a bedrock principle of American Government since our  Revolution. A painting hanging in the Capitol Rotunda not far from this  floor celebrates the legacy of George Washington, who voluntarily  resigned his commission as commander of the Continental Army to the  Congress. This principle is enshrined in our Constitution, which  divides control of the Armed Forces among the President as Commander in  Chief and the Congress as coequal branches of government.   Since then, Congress has adopted various provisions separating  military and civilian positions. In the 19th century, for example,  Congress prohibited an Army officer from accepting a civil office, more  recently, in the National Security Act of 1947, and subsequent  revisions, Congress's 7-year ``cooling off'' period for any person to  serve as Secretary of Defense. It was only 3 years later, in 1950, that  Congress granted GEN George Marshall an exemption to that law and the  Senate confirmed him to be Secretary of Defense.   Indeed, the separation between civilian and military positions has  not always been so clear. Twelve of our Nation's Presidents previously  served as generals in the Armed Forces, and over the years, numerous  high-ranking civilian officials in the Department of  [[Page S307]]  Defense have had long careers in military service.   The basic responsibilities of civilian and military leaders are  simple enough--for civilian leaders: to seek the best professional  military advice while under no obligation to follow it; for military  leaders: to provide candid counsel while recognizing civilians have the  final say or, as General Mattis once observed, to insist on being heard  and never insist on being obeyed. But the fact is that the relationship  between civilian and military leaders is inherently and endlessly  complex. It is a relationship of unequals who nonetheless share  responsibility for the defense of the Nation. The stakes could not be  higher. The gaps in mutual understanding are sometimes wide.  Personalities often clash. And the unique features of the profession of  arms and the peculiarities of service cultures often prove daunting for  civilians who have never served in uniform.   Ultimately, the key to healthy civil-military relations and civilian  control of the military is the oath that soldiers and statesmen share  in common ``to protect and defend the Constitution.'' It is about the  trust they have in one another to perform their respective duties in  accordance with our republican system of government. It is about the  candid exchange of views engendered by that trust and which is vital to  effective decisionmaking. And it is about mutual respect and  understanding. The proper balance of civil-military relations is  difficult to achieve, and, as history has taught us, achieving that  balance requires different leaders at different times.   I believe that in the dangerous times in which we live, General  Mattis is the leader our Nation needs as Secretary of Defense. That is  why, although I believe we must maintain safeguards of civilian  leadership at the Department of Defense, I will support this  legislation today and General Mattis' nomination to serve this Nation  again as Secretary of Defense.   I want to assure my friend from Rhode Island, the ranking member of  the Armed Services Committee, who has very serious concerns--I want to  assure him that this is a one-time deal. I know the Senator from Rhode  Island had deep concerns about this whole process we have been through.  Yet I think he has put the interests of the Nation and placed his  confidence in General Mattis as being so exceptional that the law that  was passed back in 1947--there can be made one single exception to it.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.   The majority leader.                      Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 72    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:15  p.m. on Tuesday, January 17, the Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs be discharged and the Senate proceed to the  consideration of H.R. 72; further, that there be 30 minutes of debate  equally divided in the usual form, and that upon the use or yielding  back of time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on  passage of H.R. 72 with no intervening action or debate; finally, that  if passed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.

Mr. President, I agreed----   Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.   Mr. McCAIN. Has time expired according to the previous UC?    Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.   Mr. McCONNELL. Just to let everybody know, all I am doing is setting  up a vote for Tuesday afternoon at 4:15. That is what I was asking  consent on.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    I reserve the right to object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    I reserve the right to object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    I reserve the right to object.   Mr. President, I was very gracious in agreeing to a unanimous consent  request that would grant me 10 minutes. That was cut short by the  filibuster of my colleague, who repeatedly brought me into the  conversation and refused to yield for my question. So I ask unanimous  to have 2 minutes to close.   Mr. McCAIN. I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   Is there objection to the majority leader's request?    I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The majority leader.                        Request for Committees to Meet    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have four requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the majority and minority leaders.    I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Duly noted.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read  the third time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the  question is, Shall it pass?   Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.
