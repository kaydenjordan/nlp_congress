 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member.   I am grateful for the opportunity to come to the floor and talk about  H.R. 2513, the Corporate Transparency Act.   I want to thank my good friend from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B.  Maloney) for her leadership in this area for well over a decade, her  hard work, and her determination on improving our anti-money laundering  and Bank Secrecy Act rules.   I appreciate the chair of the committee and her work as well.   The legislation addresses how we might combat illicit finance  activities by appropriately strengthening the collection of beneficial  ownership information.   Now, Mr. Chairman, a beneficial owner is a person who enjoys the  benefits of ownership even though the title to some form of property is  in another name. We have long debated in Congress the best way for this  information to be collected. Let's be clear here. It is being collected  by our financial services industry under our know-your-customer rules.   The ability to set up legal entities without accurate beneficial  ownership information, however, has long represented a key  vulnerability in the U.S. financial system.   As I say, all U.S. banks, brokerage firms, and financial services  companies have a know-your-customer obligation to collect ownership  information and, importantly, collect beneficial ownership information.  This was further defined in May 2008 by a FinCEN rule.   But not all shell companies are established for malicious purposes.  Owners might create one temporarily to finance a company that has not  yet started operations or to proceed with an acquisition in coming  years. But in this instance, they would have no employees and no  revenue, so the structure would look like a shell company, but it would  be otherwise legal.   It is true, though, there are too many instances of anonymous shell  companies serving as a vehicle for ill-intended activities, including  money laundering and terrorist financing. The anti-money laundering  system and the sanctions system, both independently and in tandem, are  more important than ever before, as we have seen in recent debates.   For well over a decade, Congresswoman Maloney, author of the  legislation, has been leading and working hard to pass a bill that  would enhance our AML regime, including on beneficial ownership. She  and I agree, as do all the Members of this House, Mr. Chair, that it is  vital to U.S. national security to have a vigorous and good AML/BSA  system.   However, I cannot support the legislation as currently written. In my  view, H.R. 2513 places a significant burden on small business and, in  my view, unnecessarily. The rules have been outlined here.   I believe there is a better path forward, which is why I have long  supported aligning tax filing with the collection of beneficial  ownership information. Small businesses are already familiar with  filing taxes.   A small business already files their taxes, which includes disclosing  their owners, their capital, and their business structure. On their  returns, they declare domestic and foreign aspects of their business-- all subject to common existing processes and parameters, all subject to  privacy, and all subject to existing penalties for failure to  accurately report.   I think we can all agree that closing off access to illicit finance  is laudable, necessary, and appropriate; and I expect that we can agree  that the collection of accurate beneficial ownership information is a  step in the right direction. I would just like to see us get there  without subjecting small businesses to new, unnecessarily complicated  reporting with the burden of exceedingly severe penalties for failure  to comply.   Mr. Chairman, I hope that we can reach a simple compromise that sees  stronger collection without jeopardizing small business.                                time  1430     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I want to again thank my friend from  New York for her hard work on crafting this legislation. While we have  had differences along the way, it is critical that we strengthen our  national security and AML BSA system and strengthen the transparency of  beneficial ownership.   As I have previously discussed, I am concerned with several aspects  of the bill, and I am offering this amendment which I believe will help  improve its overall purpose.   When we heard testimony, a retired FBI agent testified to our  committee acknowledging that law enforcement wants this data, this new  database at FinCEN to search, essentially, without a warrant or a  subpoena.   My amendment would require the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  to develop stringent procedures around the beneficial ownership  database pertaining to who and how it has been accessed.   Per the bill's requirements, many businesses will be providing this  information into a repository that will contain sensitive information.  Who can access and how they can access it should  [[Page H8336]]  have clearer guidelines and ensure that this information is not being  inappropriately accessed.   Additionally, the amendment requires FinCEN to report to Congress,  annually, the number of times law enforcement, banks, or other parties  access the database, how many times it was inappropriately accessed,  and the number of subpoenas obtained to gain access to the database.  This will ensure that Congress maintains oversight of the database and  that banks or law enforcement are not abusing this new system.   Our committee has heard hours of testimony about Federal Government  data breaches over these years: OPM, the SEC, IRS, CFPB. As such, we  have to make sure this information is as secure as possible.   As previously mentioned, this information is highly sensitive and  should remain extremely confidential to the extent possible. As  policymakers, we have an obligation to our constituents to ensure that  we uphold their privacy, and this amendment will better help us achieve  that goal.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. It is  good for businesses, good for our bankers and lawmakers, and,  ultimately, good for our citizens.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have  remaining.    I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry).    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend from  New York for her working with me on this amendment. I thank her for  accepting it. And I want to thank the Chair of the full committee for  its report.   I want to just close and emphasize that under the law as drafted  today there are about 10,000 law-enforcement qualified people that can  access that database. That is a lot of people, Mr. Chair, that have  access to this database that we are concerned about in making sure that  it is maintained in a very confidential manner.   I appreciate the consideration of the amendment, and I appreciate its  adoption. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, Article I, Section 2 of the  Constitution reads the House of Representatives ``shall have the sole  power of impeachment.''   This Speaker does not have that sole power. The full House of  Representatives does.   Modern precedent clearly sets out a process for fair consideration of  impeachment. It was followed by Democrats in the case of President  Nixon and followed by Republicans in the case of President Clinton.   The Speaker has turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to fairness and  precedent. Authoritarianism is now the rule of the people's House. A  Star Chamber hidden away in the Capitol basement is the domain of  authoritarianism.   Where is the due process? Where is the transparency? Abandoned.   Where is the ability to confront accusers? Where is the separation of  prosecution and grand jury? Abandoned. Abandoned by our Speaker.   I call on the majority to put aside partisanship and pointless  attacks and get back to work.                            ____________________
