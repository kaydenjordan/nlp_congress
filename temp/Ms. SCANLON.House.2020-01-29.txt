 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of families in my  district who are experiencing deep economic uncertainty.   A report issued late last year highlighted that hardworking families  in my district, especially those with children, are struggling with  rising costs and stagnant wages. The report is called ``Underwater''  because even as Wall Street rides high, American families are  struggling to stay afloat. In fact, people and small businesses in my  district are suffering as a result of this administration's economic  policies, its trade wars, and corporate giveaways.   At year end, a typical working family earning $70,000 a year is  likely to be over $2,000 in debt after paying for childcare, housing,  and healthcare, and that is before they start saving for college or  retirement.   Forty percent of the families in my district make less than that. For  these families, the American Dream of providing a better life for their  children slips further from their grasp every day.   Instead of corporate welfare, our economic policies must support  working, middle-class families in order to create healthier and more  prosperous communities for everyone.                            ____________________
