 Madam President, I have come to the floor today to  express my support for Dilawar Syed, and his nomination to be Deputy  Administrator of the Small Business Administration.   This Republican obstruction has gone on long enough. I ask my  colleagues from across the aisle to join me in supporting this  important nominee. Dilawar Syed is more than qualified to serve in this  role at the Small Business Administration. He is an entrepreneur and a  job creator, with decades of firsthand experience in business  entrepreneurship and community engagement.   He has experience working directly with small business owners and has  led efforts to drive economic growth at the local, State, and Federal  levels.   Simply put, at the SBA, he would be an asset to our Nation's small  businesses and would bring a critical voice to the Agency which  currently lacks a fully staffed leadership team.   The SBA has not had a Senate-confirmed Deputy Administrator for more  than 5 years. This is a critical mistake. This high-level absence  weakens the Agency and inhibits the SBA's ability to serve the millions  of small business owners looking to the Agency for resources,  assistance, and capital to start and grow their businesses.   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have launched  unfair and baseless attacks against Mr. Syed and have held up his  nomination for years. They have even repeatedly failed to show up to  vote on his nomination in the Small Business Committee.   These partisan attacks are simply efforts to undermine President  Biden and his administration at the SBA, as well as their ability to  successfully serve our small businesses nationwide.   These Republican attacks also unfairly disparage Mr. Syed, who is not  only a successful business leader and community organizer, but also,  importantly, a first-generation immigrant who fully exemplifies the  American dream.   With this unique and important background, Mr. Syed would bring an  influential new voice and perspective to help the SBA improve its  outreach to immigrant communities that have been traditionally  overlooked and underserved by the Federal Government.   My friends on the other side of the aisle know the importance of  filling this vacancy at the SBA. Yet they have continued to play their  partisan games.   Ahead of this vote on Mr. Syed's nomination, I ask you to join me in  supporting this eminently qualified nominee. Let's do our jobs and  finally get this nominee confirmed.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I have 10 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
