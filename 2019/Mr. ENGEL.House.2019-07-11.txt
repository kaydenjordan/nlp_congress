 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I always view military policy as a measure  of last resort in our foreign policy. When the American military is  engaged anywhere in the world, it often comes at the cost of American  lives and the lives of innocent civilians. These are the most tragic  costs of war, one reason why we can never, ever be reckless in the use  of military force.   Civilian casualties are a tragedy. They also give extremist groups  fodder to radicalize and recruit new fighters. We need to do everything  in our power to reduce the number of civilian casualties. The Pentagon  has made progress in this area thanks in part to new requirements  Congress put in place. My amendment would build on this progress in a  number of ways.   First of all, it would help fill in the blanks when it comes to our  own planning and reporting about civilian casualties. Right now, there  tends to be a big difference between what the Defense Department  estimates in terms of civilian casualties before a military strike and  what the Department reports after and, again, a big difference between  our official reporting and what NGOs report. My amendment would require  a new analysis of these disparities to help figure out why we are  getting it wrong ahead of time and why there is such a wide range of  reporting after the fact.   Secondly, while the Pentagon has done good work developing sound  policies in this area, more must be done on implementation. My measure  would improve consistent standards across all the combatant commands.   Thirdly, this amendment will help improve the way we gather  information about civilian casualties. It will establish new criteria  and methods to assess allegations of casualties, and it will make sure  we work more effectively with local populations.   Lastly, we need to understand that the Defense Department needs to  keep learning and adapting. My amendment would require standards for  incorporating lessons learned so our policies and practices will  continue to improve as time goes on.   Because this is a learning process, I will say that this amendment  won't give us a perfect policy. We need to keep working toward more  comprehensive, responsible ways of preventing and addressing civilian  casualties. We need to keep giving the Defense Department the tools it  needs to do so. This measure will provide a few more of those tools,  and I am glad the House is able to consider it today.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me say that I would respectfully remind  my colleagues that the Foreign Affairs Committee has jurisdiction over  authorizations for the use of military force, and military strikes are  conducted under authority from the Foreign Affairs Committee. It shares  jurisdiction.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this isn't an easy subject to deal with, but  it cannot be swept under the rug. It is good that the Pentagon has  taken steps in recent years to adopt stronger and more responsible  policies when it comes to civilian casualties.                                time  1315    We need to keep pressing forward on this work to make sure we have  the best information, to make sure this is a problem taken seriously  and being dealt with, and to make sure the United States is behaving  responsibly when these tragedies do occur.   Mr. Chair, I ask for Members to support this measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment is something that really should be  a no-brainer. It says we need to maintain strong and verifiable limits  on Russia's nuclear forces.   We all know that a robust nuclear deterrent has been a pillar of  American security since the beginning of the Cold War, but so has arms  control.   Democratic and Republican administrations alike have used arms  control agreements to constrain Russia's nuclear forces. These  agreements have allowed us to keep eyes on the ground so we can confirm  what the Russians are doing.   They have stopped arms races. They have strengthened peace. I fear  this administration wants to throw all of that out the window.   The President's withdrawal from the INF Treaty is sending us down a  dangerous path toward a renewed nuclear arms race. Don't get me wrong:  Russia's violation of the INF Treaty is unacceptable, but the question  is how we respond to it. Instead of using diplomacy and pressure to  push the Russians back into compliance, the administration is following  Russia's lead and walking away. This sends a terrible message and  signals a broader ideological contempt for the value of arms control.   Now the debate is shifting to New START. This treaty has won the  praise of diplomats and defense and intelligence officials as a tool  for advancing our national security interests. It allows us to keep a  lid on competition with a hostile Russia. The New START Treaty places  strong limits on Russia's strategic nuclear forces, meaning the nuclear  weapons that can reach the United States.   This treaty also gives us strong mechanisms to make sure Russia is  holding up its end of the bargain. It provides unique insights into  Russia's nuclear forces, information that would be impossible to  replace. Indeed, up to this point, the State Department has certified  that Russia is in full compliance with the New START Treaty.   The clock is ticking. The New START Treaty is set to expire in a year  and a half. It can be extended another 5 years until 2026, but only if  the  [[Page H5605]]  United States and Russia agree to do so.   My amendment sets out what should be a commonsense approach. It says  that as long as Russia remains in compliance with the treaty, the  administration should work to extend the New START Treaty unless the  administration can complete a replacement agreement with equal or  greater constraints on the Russians.   We cannot accept anything less.   The amendment also requires a series of reports from the  administration on potential consequences if the treaty lapses and  requires the President to present a plan to Congress on how to deal  with these consequences.   Like so many other aspects of its foreign policy, the Trump  administration has sent confusing messages about extending the treaty.  They recently called it ``unlikely,'' noting a desire to move beyond  the existing arms control regime with Russia to tackle other issues  like tactical nuclear weapons and China.   Those are important issues, too. I agree with that. The United States  should push ahead with a new arms control agreement, but in the  meantime, we shouldn't throw out the baby with the bathwater. We should  extend New START. After all, we cannot allow Russia free rein to expand  its nuclear forces.   What I hope this administration understands is that arms control is a  critical tool in a much broader effort as we compete with Russia. Arms  control reduces uncertainty. It creates patterns and predictability. It  helps us make sure our forces and programs are tailored to deal with  the challenges we are facing.   Mr. Chair, I ask Members to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, then let me split it. I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), a well-respected member of  the Foreign Affairs Committee and one of our subcommittee chairs.    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to support this amendment.   There has been some misinformation out there about what this  amendment would actually do, so let me just clear up a few things.   This measure is a prohibition on the United States deploying a short-  or intermediate-range ground-launched ballistic or cruise missile  system--just the United States. It has nothing to do with any other  country.   We want to prevent an arms race. We want to push back on the  President's careless and reckless approach to Russia.   The INF Treaty has been a cornerstone of arms control for 30 years.  Yes, we are clear about the threat Russia poses. Yes, Russia has  violated this treaty again and again, which threatens transatlantic  security and stability. This is no surprise, coming from Vladimir  Putin.   But we have to use every diplomatic tool at our disposal to try to  salvage the treaty. Instead, the administration followed Putin's lead  and walked away, and now Russia will feel totally unconstrained to  start another arms race.   So I know that the relationship with Putin and all kinds of things  that Putin does, we have to be very, very wary about it, and I just  think what the gentlewoman is doing is a commonsense approach to this.   The United States can go back at any time and change our policy. And  when it comes to Russia and Putin, we don't trust them. Trust and  verify.   I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
