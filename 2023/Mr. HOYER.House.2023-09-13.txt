 I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, today, we have once again seen the majority  party unable to govern. The defense bill was scheduled today, and  apparently the majority party cannot get its act together, so we are  not considering the defense bill today. Unfortunately, the Republicans  seem to be frozen by their own dysfunction.   It is interesting that we have scheduled today to show the work that  the 117th Congress did that is making such a positive effect today in  America. Today, we ought to reflect on what Democrats accomplished by  standing together last Congress, with some bipartisan support.   The 117th Congress was one of the most productive in American history  because Democrats united behind a common cause: investing in America,  making us stronger, safer, healthier, and more competitive in the 21st  century.   Now, the historic investments we made to create jobs, lower costs,  and build the economy from the bottom and middle out are coming to  fruition. Conveying the scale of these laws' positive impact on our  country is no easy task, especially in a single hour, and we do not  expect to do it in this hour alone.   We can look at the past 32 months of consecutive job growth in  America. We can point to the 13.5 million new jobs, including 800,000  new manufacturing jobs in the last 2\1/2\ years, added to our economy  under the Biden-Harris administration.                                time  1830    The previous administration, by comparison, Mr. Speaker, added  500,000 manufacturing jobs to the economy in the first 3 years before  the pandemic. Indeed, we created more jobs in 2 years than any prior  administration has added in a single 4-year term.   We pushed the unemployment rate to a generational low, with more  Americans working today than at any point in our Nation's history.   Rather than stalling out into a recession, our economy continues to  boom because Democrats put people over politics to invest in America.   Goldman Sachs just put out a report estimating that we will see  another 200,000 manufacturing jobs in the next 2 years alone. That  makes a million new manufacturing jobs incorporated into what will then  be a 15 million new jobs accomplishment.   With inflation threatening to eat into more take-home pay for working  Americans last Congress, Democrats stepped up to pass policies to  reduce costs, raise wages, and create jobs.   The results are now in: It worked, and it is still working. Wages  continue to go up; inflation continues to go down; and our economy  continues to grow at a steady pace.   There are many factors at play, Mr. Speaker, in the global economy,  but we owe these strong economic trends in no small part to the laws we  enacted in the last Congress.   Economic strength alone, however, doesn't capture all that these laws  are accomplishing for the American people.   The best way to understand how these laws are transforming our Nation  for all Americans is to meet Americans where they are to hear firsthand  how these policies are making a difference in their lives and the lives  of their families.   This year, Mr. Speaker, members of the Regional Leadership Council  appointed by minority Democratic Leader Jeffries have had those  conversations with countless Americans at schools, hospitals, union  halls, small businesses, VA clinics, farms, and factories across the  country.   We have also sought to identify further funding opportunities,  implement these policies, and inform the public about how they can  access these programs and opportunities.   Mr. Speaker, tonight we want to show Americans how their tax dollars  are building a better future for their families and communities.   We are working with Democrats to ensure that those investments reach  every community in every corner of the country, and we look forward to  working with Republicans to do the same. It doesn't seem to be their  focus right now, but maybe it will be.   All Americans deserve to feel the impact of these policies, whether  they live on the quietest country road or the loudest city street,  because investing in America, Mr. Speaker, means investing in all of  America.   Over the next hour, the members of the Regional Leadership Council  will detail our implementation progress and show how investing in  America's agenda is changing lives.   Mr. Speaker, I will now turn to my colleagues, and I yield first to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and I  now yield to the gentleman from northern California (Mr. Huffman).

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs.  Fletcher).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts  (Mrs. Trahan).     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Kelly), a member of the Regional Leadership Council.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for that, and  I am glad a good deed is returned. I will return it again.   Would the gentleman yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Kelly) so she may finish her comments?    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona (Mr.  Schweikert) for his courtesy.                                time  1930
