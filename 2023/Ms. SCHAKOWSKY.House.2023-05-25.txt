 Mr. Speaker, meet Celly, a constituent of mine living  in the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago.   He is an Army veteran and a cancer survivor, and he has received 100  percent disabled veterans benefits due to his trauma as he was serving  for us in the service. He is currently enrolled in a VA program to  become a paralegal.   Celly called my office because he was worried. He was concerned that  the veterans benefits that he relies upon could be snatched away by the  Republican default. That is a real possibility.   His VA benefits cover his rent, his medication, and his treatments.                            ____________________
