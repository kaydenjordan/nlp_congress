 Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage the continued  support for H.R. 1734, the TRANQ Research Act, which passed the House  earlier this year.   Fentanyl and other deadly substances are being seized at record  levels by our law enforcement officers. So far, in fiscal year 2023,  the Border Patrol has intercepted 20,000 pounds of fentanyl. That is  enough to kill 4.6 billion people.   Now, that is an incredible amount of deadly drugs, and it doesn't  include the dangerous opioid analogues, such as xylazine, which are  becoming far more common and are a challenge to identify in the field.   Xylazine, also called TRANQ or the ``zombie drug,'' is a veterinary  tranquilizer and fentanyl analogue that is wreaking havoc on American  communities. It is also putting our law enforcement at risk.   According to the DEA, over the past 2 years, the southern and western  United States has experienced an over 100 percent increase in xylazine  encounters. This is a very concerning trend.   TRANQ earned the name ``zombie drug'' because it kills human tissue  and is also resistant to opioid overdose treatments.   Our Federal law enforcement officers are working hard to keep our  communities safe and are doing it at great personal risk. They need the  tools to identify these drugs in order to stay safe when encountering  them in the field.   That is why 25 of my colleagues and I introduced the TRANQ Research  Act. This commonsense legislation directs the National Institute of  Standards and Technology to conduct research on the detection and  handling of the newest, most dangerous synthetic opioids.   Detection capabilities will extend to police officers, Border Patrol  agents, and other first responders so they are better equipped to stem  the flow of this deadly drug that is coming into our country and also  keep them safe while they are doing it.   Our bill passed this House unanimously in May, and the Senate  returned it in June with minor amendments that I support.   Madam Speaker, I urge you today to take up the amended TRANQ Research  Act quickly so that we can send it to the President's desk. Let's  deliver again for the American people and get this crucial legislation  signed into law.                            ____________________
