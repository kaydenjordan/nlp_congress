 Madam Speaker, I rise to offer my strong support for the  rule and for H.R. 5, the Equality Act.   Recent years have brought extraordinary progress in the fight for  full equality for our LGBTQ community. Like millions of others across  the country, I joined with friends and family to celebrate Supreme  Court rulings paving the way for same-sex couples to marry. But in the  midst of these joyful and historic victories, we knew that the work was  just beginning.   Though LGBTQ people could now get married, in a majority of States  they could still be fired for having a picture of their spouse on their  desk or kicked out of their home just for being who they are. The fact  is, LGBTQ people are still at risk of discrimination across key areas  of life in huge swaths of our country.   Recent national surveys of LGBTQ people show that 42 percent of  lesbian, gay, and bisexual people; and 78 percent of transgender people  have experienced discrimination or harassment on the job because of who  they are.   Only 21 States have explicit laws barring discrimination based on  sexual orientation and employment, housing and public accommodations,  and only 20 States have such protections for gender identity.   The time to end this patchwork of protections once and for all is  now, and to do that, we must pass this important legislation.   The promotion of fairness and justice is a hallmark of who we are as  Americans. Everyone should be afforded all of the rights provided for  in our Constitution and outlined in our Declaration of Independence.  These rights are fundamental to all human beings, and all Americans  deserve the same civil rights regardless of gender, race, and sexual  orientation. We don't need to amend that.   Let's pass the rule and let's pass the Equality Act.
