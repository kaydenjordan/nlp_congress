 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise on behalf of more than 68 million  Americans who lack access to adequate banking services. They are often  shut out of banks because of fees tied to minimum balances, overdrafts,  direct deposit penalties, and, of course, ATM charges. Or, worse, many  live in bank deserts because, incredibly, even in 2019, their community  lacks a bank or credit union altogether.   This leaves underbanked Americans to turn to unregulated, predatory  payday lenders and check cashers that level obscene annual percentage  rates. These parasitic institutions keep families in poverty and  further cement the economic inequality which tears our country apart.   It does not have to be this way. Our United States Postal Service is  in a unique position to provide affordable, consumer-driven financial  services these millions of Americans need. With branches in every ZIP  Code, from Paterson, New Jersey, to Elko, Nevada, to Barrow, Alaska,  the post office's unmatched reach offers a world of opportunity.   In 2014, the USPS inspector general determined that the Postal  Service is well positioned to expand its financial services offerings,  which currently includes money orders, check cashing, and prepaid debit  card services. The IG's report found there is a significant demand for  these services from populations underserved by private banks that the  Postal Service could fill perfectly.   It is difficult to overstate what this small change would do, Mr.  Chairman. Postal banking would benefit Americans from every walk of  life. Ninety percent of ZIP Codes lacking a bank or credit union are in  rural areas. Bank branches are also sparse in low-income urban areas.  Approximately 46 percent of Latino and 49 percent of African American  households are underbanked.   Think about that. Democrats and Republicans alike could derive  enormous benefits for their constituents. Talk about uniting America.  It is a practical thing.   In a second study the USPS inspector general conducted in 2015, the  IG concluded that expanding the Postal Service's current financial  services offerings would not even cost much, is fully permissible under  current statutory authority, and could generate $1.1 billion in  additional revenue for the Postal Service, annually, after 5 years.   You know what has happened to the Postal Service and how in debt the  Postal Service is because of a few foolish rules that are on the books.   This is not a novel concept. Postal services in 139 countries around  the world offer some form of financial services, including every other  developed country in the world.   Students of history can recall that the United States had a legendary  Postal Savings System up to 1967--started in 1911--and managed over  $3.4 billion in assets, or $35 billion in today's dollars, at the peak  of its use. I want America to back those successes.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record an essay I wrote for the  Washington Monthly on modernizing the U.S. Postal Service to make the  institution thrive once more and benefit tens of millions of Americans  in the process. The piece was titled, ``Congress Is Sabotaging Your  Post Office.''                            [Apr./May/June 2019]                  Congress Is Sabotaging Your Post Office                          (By Bill Pascrell, Jr.)         The Larry Doby Post Office is located at 194 Ward Street in       Paterson, New Jersey, across the street from my congressional       office. Dedicated on August 28, 1933, by the legendary       Postmaster General James Farley, the structure was one of the       many built by Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration in the       throes of the Great Depression. While it may not have one of       the stunning murals created by Roosevelt's Section of       Painting and Sculpture, I still marvel at the managed       grandeur of its deco buttressing, the green glow of the       elevated banker's lamps off the marble walls, and the banks       of brass P.O. boxes. My hometown has bounced like a cork in       seas of social tumult, but the Ward Street post office has       endured as I've always known it.        There is a cynical trope that Congress spends too much time       naming post offices, but I don't view the matter as       insignificant. Post offices are open gates to American       history and markers of an optimistic past. Even as       smartphones and electronic communication permeate every       crevice of daily life, the United States Postal Service       (USPS) forms a lifeblood circulatory system connecting every       community in the Union. For this reason, my work to rename       the Ward Street building for Doby, an African American       baseball legend and favorite son of Paterson, remains a       highlight of my career.        Unfortunately, when it comes to Congress and the post       office, the problem isn't too much affection. For decades,       Congress's attitude toward the post has ranged from neglect       to hostility. As a result, the USPS is struggling. In       November 2018, it announced a net decline of $3.9 billion,       continuing a twelve-year negative run.        The agency has been subjected to withering criticism by a       spate of congressional hearings and Government Accountability       Office analyses. A recent task force created by President       Trump labeled the Postal Service's financial path       ``unsustainable,'' and recommended changes that would push       the post closer to complete privatization. Under mounting       political pressure, the post office itself has endorsed       draconian layoffs and proposed ending Saturday delivery,       among other savage cuts.        What is causing all these troubles? Is the Postal Service       hopelessly outdated and dysfunctional? No. While it's       tempting to think of it as a mastodon from the pre-internet       era, the post remains one of the most impressive enterprises       on earth.        The USPS handles 47 percent of the world's mail, delivering       nearly 150 billion mail pieces annually. It delivers more in       sixteen days than UPS and FedEx, combined, ship in a year.       The agency has roughly half a million career employees spread       out across almost 31,000 locations. Post offices are tucked       into every state, across far-flung Native American       reservations, and in remote protectorates. If it were a       private business, the post would rank around fortieth on the       Fortune 500. And you can send a letter from coast to coast       for two quarters and a nickel--less than the cost of a candy       bar.        Not surprising, then, that Americans consistently rank the       post office among the most popular arms of government. A       February 2018 poll by the Pew Research Center, for example,       found that 88 percent of Americans have a positive view of       it. That's higher than the approval ratings for the Centers       for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Reserve, and       the Federal Bureau of Investigation.        It's true that technological change has affected the Postal       Service's fortunes. As people send fewer and fewer letters,       the volume of first-class mail continues to tumble; between       2016 and 2018, it dropped by more than 4.5 billion pieces.       This depresses the post's revenue, forcing it to take on more       debt, which in turn puts it under greater financial pressure.       But as online shopping slowly replaces in-person retail, the       post is sending and delivering more packages than ever       before, which compensates somewhat for lost revenue. Lower       mail volume is not the main issue.        In reality, most of the post's wounds are politically       inflicted. In the early 1970s, Congress passed legislation       that shoehorned the agency into a convoluted half-public,       half-corporate governing structure, to make it operate more       as a business. And in 2006, Congress required that the Postal       Service pre-fund its health benefit obligations at least       fifty years into the future. This rule has accounted for       nearly 90 percent of the post's red ink since.        For the most part, these harmful ``reforms'' have       originated on the political right. To argue that the Postal       Service needs to be privatized, conservatives need to show       that it is dysfunctional, and there's no better way to do       that than by weighing the agency down with impossible       financial obligations. It continues a generation-long pattern       of institutional vandalism by Republicans across government.       But ultimately,  [[Page H5137]]       both parties bear responsibility. I should know: I was in       Congress when we passed the 2006 bill. And, along with all my       colleagues, I made the mistake of voting for it.        But the good news is that just as Congress put the Postal       Service on its current dangerous trajectory, so can Congress       put it on a sustainable path, bringing our cherished       institution back to full health. In fact, I believe we can go       even further. With its massive infrastructure network, post       offices could revolutionize how the American people perform a       variety of essential tasks, from voting to paying taxes to       banking. Tapping into this network has the potential to       revitalize both the Postal Service and our democracy. Instead       of discussing how to cut the post office, we should be       talking about how to expand it.        Arguments about whether the post should operate like a       business date back to America's founding. While debating the       original Post Office Act, a group including Alexander       Hamilton argued that the post should support itself and make       money for the rest of the government. Others, including       George Washington and James Madison, didn't seem to care       whether it turned a profit. Jonathan Trumbull, the speaker of       the House of Representatives in 1792, observed that having       the post subsidize the circulation of periodicals would be       ``among the surest means of preventing the degeneracy of a       free government.'' In the end, Washington and Madison won the       day. The government allowed printers to ship their newspapers       and magazines at a very low cost: one cent to destinations       within 100 miles, and one and a half cents to destinations       more than 100 miles away. This set off what one researcher       called ``the greatest explosion of newspapers in history''--      and with it an explosion in literacy.        By the mid-nineteenth-century mark, the Washingtonian view       of the post as a public good was deeply entrenched. An early       congressional postal commission posited that the post office       existed not for generating revenue but for ``elevating our       people in the scale of civilization, and binding them       together in patriotic affection.'' Legislation enacted       between 1845 and 1851 codified inexpensive letter postage and       further redefined the post's place in public life. The       ratification of these reforms signaled the full defeat of the       idea that the post must be independent. It was entitled to       government support, deficits be damned.        Over the ensuing hundred years, the post would usher in a       second American revolution. Delivery of home mail       precipitated road building and allowed Americans to fan out       and settle across the nation. Postal contracts sustained the       construction of transcontinental railways that would have       otherwise been economically unsustainable. And it was the       post office, not the military, that got the U.S. government       to finally invest in aviation and help birth commercial       flying.        The post has also been an agent of upward social mobility.       For generations, African Americans were locked out of good       government jobs. But as the federal bureaucracy began to       desegregate, black workers joined the USPS en masse. Under       the Harding and Coolidge administrations, black people made       up between 15 and 30 percent of postal employees, making the       agency one of America's foremost incubators of the black       middle class. The post also factored significantly into       Roosevelt's efforts to fight the Great Depression. Between       1932 and 1937, the government built more than 1,300 post       offices. Many were enhanced with the beautiful murals FDR       believed would bring art to the nation. The agency's central       role in America's development was perhaps best summarized in       the Postal Policy Act of 1958, when Congress declared that       the post was ``clearly not a business enterprise conducted       for profit'' but a public service designed to promulgate       ``social, cultural, intellectual, and commercial intercourse       among the people of the United States.''        But, in the 1960s, that view began to change. After years       of underinvestment relative to the rise in demand for its       services, the post faced a huge mail backlog in Chicago. Ten       million pieces of undelivered mail piled up in the city, and       the Lyndon Johnson administration established a commission to       look into the agency. It was headed by a former AT&T chairman       and stacked with CEOs and business school deans. In 1970, the       post office was wracked by a debilitating worker strike. The       backlog and the strike spurred a political overreaction.        Following the strike and the commission's 1968       recommendations, Congress passed the Postal Reorganization       Act of 1970, which exiled the postmaster general from the       president's cabinet and downgraded the post office from a       federal department to an independent federal agency.       Ostensibly designed to modernize the post and free it from a       history of patronage, the legislation proved profoundly       shortsighted. It required that the post largely pay for its       operations out of its own revenues, and it split leadership       of the Postal Service between the postmaster general and a       board of governors, the latter of which has been largely       dominated by technocrats who see the post foremost as a       business. At the same time, however, the post was still       subject to congressional oversight. It's hard to imagine any       corporation that would agree to operate under this peculiar       hybrid structure. Even today most Americans don't realize       that despite their reliance on it, our post is not a part of       the government in the same way as the Department of       Agriculture or the Pentagon, and receives effectively no       support from the federal budget.        Unfortunately, the 1970 bill was only the first in a series       of legislative blows against the post. From 1808 until 1995,       Congress had a full congressional committee for the Postal       Service. But as part of his war on government, Speaker Newt       Gingrich relegated its duties to the present-day Oversight       and Reform Committee, where they were assigned to a postal       service subcommittee. In 2001, the Republican House majority       disbanded the subcommittee altogether.        But the most destructive change of all was the Postal       Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA). The bill has an       unfortunate history. It was hurried to the floor during a       lame-duck Congress weeks after Republicans were routed from       their twelve-year congressional majority in the 2006       midterms. Committee leaders told us that the legislation was       critical to ``saving'' the post, and we were rushed into       voting for the bill without fully considering its motivations       or long-term impacts. The legislation was passed by voice       vote--without objection. It was a blunder, one of the worst       pieces of legislation Congress has passed in a generation.        While the PAEA included some positive measures, including       giving the post increased autonomy over its rates, the law       generally tightened a noose around the USPS. It further       narrowed the post's charter and prohibited the Postal Service       from engaging in new activities outside of mail delivery. The       law's most destructive section, innocuously labeled ``Postal       Service Retirement and Health Benefits Funding,'' imposed an       unusual requirement on how the post covers its employee       health pensions. Prior to 2006, the post funded its pensions       like all agencies: pay as you go. Now, however, the agency       had to pre-fund the health care benefits of employees at       least fifty years in advance. To meet this requirement, the       post was obligated to place approximately $5.5 billion into a       pension fund each year between 2007 and 2016, followed by       additional large annual payments.        The measure has been a fiendish straitjacket, akin to       making a prospective homeowner cover an entire thirty-year       mortgage before the ink is dry on the deed. The provision is       even more onerous given that the government requires the       treasury to invest all postal workers' retiree money in       government bonds, guaranteeing miniscule returns.       Unsurprisingly, the post has defaulted on all of its pre-      funding payments since 2011, to the tune of at least $40       billion. In each of the last three years, the pre-funding       burden well exceeded the post's total losses. Overall, pre-      funding accounts for almost all of its losses since 2006.        No other agency or department is subject to this       requirement. So why is the Postal Service? The George W. Bush       administration demanded its inclusion and used the savings it       generated to try to balance the budget. Dutiful Republicans       said it was necessary to ensure that the post doesn't       generate a ``huge unfunded liability'' that would require a       bailout from the government, an absurd posture they still       maintain. But the requirement's main upshot has been to       plunge the Postal Service into a perpetual fiscal crisis that       in turn justifies further attacks from the right. Full       privatization is still neither politically nor logistically       feasible, but that won't stop Republicans and their allies       from trying.        Trump's recent Postal Service task force fits into the       gradual push toward privatization. The task force's ultimate       conclusion bore all the hallmarks of a far-right hit job.       Rather than focusing on the Postal Service's pre-funding       provision--which the final report actually recommended       keeping--the task force emphasized the supposed need to lower       Postal Service delivery standards and eliminate employees'       collective bargaining rights. The task force also recommended       diluting the post's universal service guarantee, which would       wreck the agency's functionality in rural communities. In a       country where rural citizens already feel detached from the       rest of the nation, such an outcome would only widen existing       cleavages. Convened in secret, Trump's task force was       designed with the Orwellian purpose not to save the post, but       to further weaken it.        I am heartened that Democrats routinely unite to oppose       privatization. But merely saying that the post should not be       privatized comes from a defensive posture. The solutions we       pursue must be bolder.        Any serious reformation of our post begins with eliminating       the odious pre-funding anchor. But that's only the start. To       really improve the agency, we need to fully reject the idea       that it should be run like a business. There is a reason why       the Founders made the Postal Service a federal department,       and there's a reason why it remained that way through the       better part of the twentieth century. Policymakers wanted to       make sure that Americans could affordably send and receive       mail from anywhere. In pursuing that aim, the USPS has played       a key role in developing our country. To that end, we should       evaluate reviving the U.S. Post Office Department and making       the postmaster general a cabinet official once more. It's       time that we again treat this agency like a public good       rather than a private business.        Nowhere is this perspective needed more than in Congress.       In the House and Senate, we have become hostages to a fiscal       imprisonment outlook, viewing almost every question through       the single calculation of whether it will raise or lower       revenue. Republicans have used the specter of deficits as a       cudgel to beat back funding increases for all departments and       programs. Browbeaten, too many  [[Page H5138]]       Democrats have gone along. But while deficits matter, the       Postal Service isn't running losses because it's inefficient.       It's running losses because of political sabotage.        It's time for Congress to admit that the hybrid structure       it sanctioned forty-nine years ago is not sustainable. So       long as the post exists half as a business and half as a       public enterprise, forced to make money even as it is       constrained by preposterous rules and counterproductive       meddling, it will wobble and teeter. Meanwhile, privatization       advocates will continue to chip away at one of the world's       most impressive agencies.        That doesn't mean the Postal Service should be free of       interrogation. The post, for example, must fix its deal with       Amazon. The company ships perhaps two-thirds of its packages       through the public mail, and its pricing and delivery terms       are separate from those afforded to other businesses that       ship through the post. This comes courtesy of a secret 2013       negotiated service agreement whose provisions have been       hidden from even Congress. The secrecy suggests that Amazon       is getting a deal other retailers don't enjoy.        There is some logic for a deal between the post and Amazon.       But if the world's best delivery system is awarding Amazon a       volume discount, it makes it more difficult for the company's       competitors to challenge Amazon's prices. This sets a       dangerous example for competition policy. The U.S. Postal       Service is a public facility. It should not be used to       further entrench the monopolistic power of a private company.       Nor does it need to. Amazon does not have the post's       infrastructure, and Jeff Bezos's vaunted delivery drones       aren't yet operational. The Postal Service's biggest rivals,       UPS and FedEx, simply can't match the agency's services. In       negotiations, the post should take a harder line and force       Amazon to pay more.        Congress can help spur the Postal Service into bargaining       harder by using its hearing power to make the current Amazon       deal public. Given that Congress has paid so little attention       to the agency in the past, this kind of engagement is sorely       needed. Currently, the House subcommittee that deals with the       USPS is responsible for monitoring a mind-boggling number of       other federal functions and agencies, including (but not       limited to) government management and accounting; federal       property; intergovernmental affairs. including with state and       local governments; and the entire civil service. It's no       wonder the post has become of tertiary importance in the       people's house. Between 2005 and 2018, the House Oversight       Committee held 417 hearings, of which just seven were related       to postal issues. This negligence helps explain why       legislation that kneecaps the USPS, like the 2006 Postal       Accountability and Enhancement Act, glides through Congress       before members really consider its consequences.        The two House members with the most control over postal       issues, House Oversight Committee chairman Elijah Cummings       and government operations subcommittee head Gerry Connolly,       are champions of the Postal Service, and I believe they will       dedicate attention to the issues facing the agency. But both       of their bodies are swamped with other valuable work,       including bringing needed oversight to the river of       corruption flowing from the Trump administration. Over the       next few years, Congress should therefore consider bringing       back the full Postal and Civil Service Committee or, at the       very least, creating an exclusive postal subcommittee.        To truly move beyond playing defense, however, Democrats       need to reimagine what the Postal Service can do. It is,       after all, one of the most remarkable physical systems ever       created. With arms in every single zip code, from Key West,       Florida, to Utqiagvik, Alaska, its expansiveness opens up a       world of opportunity.        In many American communities, the post office was       historically called the ``federal building,'' and it served       as a one-stop shop for numerous governmental needs.       (Tellingly, FDR wanted Social Security to be administered       through posts to assure its accessibility.) In smaller towns       and cities, for example, the post office was a focal point       for immigrant registration, military recruitment, and       distributing income tax forms. There is no reason that       America's post offices can't again provide a variety of       important governmental functions. Indeed, today's post       offices should have all tax forms readily available. The       government should even consider stationing IRS adjutants at       post offices around tax time, which would ease what is, for       many Americans, one of the most stressful times of the year.        The Postal Service could also expand on the passport       assistance it already provides. Many post offices take       passport photos and process some first-time applicants and       renewals. Often, this is by appointment only. I believe that       post offices should offer full passport services to any       American who walks through the doors. In addition to serving       as a gateway to America's bureaucracy, the post could serve       as a door to the rest of the world.        State governments should take advantage of America's postal       infrastructure as well, in particular by expanding the use of       vote by mail, which when done right is proven to increase       political participation. Turning mailboxes into voting booths       would therefore be good for the engagement of our citizenry.       The post could further weave itself into American democracy       by allowing congressional representatives to station their       district staff right in community post offices.        But perhaps the most promising service that post offices       could provide is banking. Today, sixty-eight million       Americans, more than a quarter of U.S. households, lack       access to adequate banking services. Many are shut out by       high fees tied to minimum balances, overdrafts, direct       deposit penalties, and ATM charges. As a result, they are       left to unregulated payday lenders and check cashers that       level obscene annual percentage rates. The postal inspector       general found that underbanked Americans spend $89 billion       each year on financial fees. This closed system shackles       families to poverty, further cementing the economic       inequality tearing our country apart.        Postal branches could offer a range of banking services--      including savings accounts, deposit services, and even small       lending--at a 90 percent discount compared to what predatory       lenders provide, according to a report commissioned by the       USPS inspector general. This would give many families an       average savings of $2,000 a year while putting nearly $9       billion into the post's coffers.        Postal banking could even unite liberals and Trump       supporters. Rural communities are America's most bank       starved: 90 percent of zip codes lacking a bank or credit       union lie in rural areas. Bank branches are also sparse in       poorer urban areas, and 46 percent of Latino and 49 percent       of African American households are unbanked. The Postal       Service is well positioned to help both communities. Some 59       percent of post offices lie in ``bank deserts,'' or places       where there is no more than one branch. Where financial       institutions close their doors to these communities, post       offices remain open to anyone who walks inside. And this       change wouldn't even need the approval of Congress, requiring       only the postmaster general's consent. Pilot programs could       then begin immediately--including in places like 194 Ward       Street in my own city of Paterson.        Ultimately, these reforms would expand on the post's       democratic tradition. For centuries, the agency has connected       far-flung parts of the country at little cost. Letting it       help citizens pay their taxes, obtain passports, vote, and       bank would better connect Americans with their federal       government. In doing so, these reforms could help mend our       citizenry's chronically low confidence in the federal       government. They could also make the agency's contribution to       public life--already enormous--more visible to the people it       serves. And that would make it more difficult for anti-      government zealots to tear the agency apart.     It is high time that we as a body come together to  enact sensible postal reform. This amendment is a small step in that  direction.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Representative Pressley and Representative  Amodei for joining me in offering this bipartisan amendment. I strongly  encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
