 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate  Lieutenant Commander Michael D'Angelo on his retirement from an  incredibly distinguished career with the United States Navy.   For more than 40 years, Lieutenant Commander D'Angelo has served our  country with incredible dedication and honor.   Upon graduation from Morris Catholic High School in New Jersey, he  pursued a history degree at Penn State University. Enlisting after his  graduation from Penn State, he began his career in the Navy as a  Persian-Farsi cryptologic linguist, eventually rising to rank of senior  chief petty officer in 2001.   After years of hard work as a naval cryptologic officer, he attended  the Naval Postgraduate School. Following graduation, he was deployed to  Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He then returned  to central Pennsylvania and set up roots in Ebensburg with his wife and  seven children, where he commanded the Navy Operational Support Center  for 3 years.   Lieutenant Commander D'Angelo had the unique experience of serving  alongside his son, Chief Petty Officer David D'Angelo, in Afghanistan.  These men risked everything in the service of our great Nation, and we  are forever grateful to the D'Angelo family.   Congratulations on your successful career and best wishes to you and  your family in your next chapter.                            ____________________
