 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Muddy Dog Market and Grill of Unionville, IA, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   Founded by husband and wife duo Regina and Darrell Sarmento in 2023,  Muddy Dog Market and Grill offers dine-in and takeout food options,  groceries, and entertainment in Unionville. The Sarmentos opened Muddy  Dog Market and Grill to provide quality dining and groceries to  residents of Appanoose, Monroe, Davis, and Wapello Counties. For dine- in food options, Muddy Dog Market and Grill offers artisanal pizzas,  smash burgers, soups, salads, appetizers, and weekly specials. The  drink menu at Muddy Dog Market and Grill is unique, with drinks named  after the family's ``muddy dogs.'' In addition to the market and grill,  they also provide live music events and offer party rental services.   Muddy Dog Market and Grill is actively involved in the Unionville  community. Regina grew up in Iowa but met Darrell in Sacramento, CA,  where they both were living at the time. They moved to Iowa in 2009,  with Darrell working as executive director of the Newton Area Chamber  of Commerce from 2010 until 2014 and the Des Moines West Side Chamber  of Commerce from 2017 until 2021. In addition to running Muddy Dog  Market and Grill with his wife, Darrell serves as a small business  counselor at the Indian Hills Community College Small Business  Development Center. In this position, he helps other small businesses  grow and develop. Prior to owning and running Muddy Dog Market and  Grill, Regina spent years working in restaurants and as a behavioral  health professional. The Sarmentos are actively involved in their  church, using the proceeds from their recycled bottles to benefit youth  services. Muddy Dog Market and Grill actively employs high school  students in the Moravia and Moulton-Udell School Districts. The  Sarmentos serve as mentors to the students, helping the next generation  gain practical skills in the workplace. This Veterans Day, Muddy Dog  Market and Grill offered a Vets Dine Free Day, with live music and free  meals for local veterans.   Muddy Dog Market and Grill's commitment to providing quality food and  groceries at great prices in Unionville, IA, is clear. I want to  congratulate Regina and Darrell Sarmento and the entire team at Muddy  Dog Market and Grill for their continued dedication to south central  Iowans. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
