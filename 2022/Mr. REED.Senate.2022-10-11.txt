SENSE OF THE SENATE ON REDESIGNATION OF THE AFRICA                     CENTER FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES AS THE JAMES  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The yeas and nays are ordered.            Amendment No. 6442 to Amendment No. 5499, As Modified     Mr. President, I have an amendment to the substitute, and I  ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I submit amendments on behalf of other  Senators.    Mr. President, I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2023  National Defense Authorization Act. In a few minutes, I will bring up  this bill, which the Armed Services Committee passed by a broad  bipartisan vote of 23 to 3 in June. I am glad we have the opportunity  to consider the NDAA on the Senate floor. We are at a critical period  in our Nation's security, and this bill will help ensure our military  has the tools and capabilities it needs to combat threats around the  globe and keep Americans safe.  [[Page S6466]]    First, I would like to acknowledge Ranking Member Inhofe, whose  leadership on this committee and in this body has been invaluable. His  commitment to our men and women in uniform is unwavering, and he was  instrumental in helping produce this bipartisan legislation. In honor  of his well-earned retirement, I am pleased that the committee voted to  name this year's bill the James M. Inhofe National Defense  Authorization Act.   As we discuss the NDAA, we must keep in mind that the United States  is engaged in a long-term strategic competition with China and Russia.  Beijing poses the primary potential threat to our national security, as  the only country in the world with the economic and technological  capacity to mount a sustained challenge to our interests. And, as we  have seen with disturbing clarity, Putin has demonstrated his  willingness to inflict violence and undermine global world order for  his own benefit. The importance of U.S. support for the Ukrainian  people cannot be overstated. They are fighting our fight, and we must  aid them.   Elsewhere, states like Iran and North Korea continue to push the  boundaries of military brinksmanship, and issues like terrorism,  climate change, and pandemics remain persistent threats. The  interconnected nature of these problems must drive how we resource and  transform our tools of national power. The passage of the fiscal year  2023 National Defense Authorization Act will be a critical step toward  meeting these complex challenges.   Turning to the specifics of this year's defense bill, the NDAA  authorizes $817 billion for the Department of Defense and $29 billion  for national security programs within the Department of Energy. The  bill contains a number of important provisions that I would like to  briefly highlight.   To begin, we have to ensure that the United States can outcompete,  deter, and prevail against our near-peer rivals. This NDAA confronts  China and Russia by fully investing in the Pacific Deterrence  Initiative, the European Deterrence Initiative, and the Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative.   As part of this effort, the bill increases the defense topline  authorization by $45 billion to address the effects of inflation and  accelerate implementation of the national defense strategy. This  topline boost will accelerate the production of certain munitions and  increase procurement of aircraft, naval vessels, armored vehicles,  long-range fires, and other resources needed by the services and  combatant commands.   The committee has also included an authorization of $1 billion for  the National Defense Stockpile to acquire strategic and critical  minerals currently in shortfall. This will go a long way to help meet  the defense, industrial, and essential civilian needs of the United  States.   We also include additional support for our industrial base to produce  the munitions needed to backfill our stocks, while also keeping  supplies flowing to Ukraine and other European allies. Many Senators on  both sides of the aisle have been actively engaged in this effort, but  I especially want to recognize Senator Shaheen's leadership. She has  been instrumental in pushing new authorities that can be helpful for  the Department of Defense to address the current challenge we have and  better posture us for our future. Senator Shaheen's work has been  highly impactful in the direction we ultimately took, which is  reflected in the amendment that Senator Inhofe and I have offered as  part of the managers' package.   Relatedly, America's capacity for technological innovation has long  given us the strongest economy and military on Earth, but this  advantage is not a given. It must be nurtured and maintained. To that  end, this year's NDAA authorizes significant funding increases for  cutting-edge technologies like microelectronics, hypersonic weapons,  and low-cost unmanned aircraft. Similarly, it increases funding to  support U.S. Cyber Command's Hunt Forward Operations and artificial  intelligence capabilities.   And, as we navigate threats of nuclear escalation from Russia and  increasing capabilities from China, the NDAA enhances our deterrence by  helping to marginalize the U.S. nuclear triad. It also makes progress  in ensuring the safety, security, and reliability of our nuclear  stockpile, delivery systems, and infrastructure; increasing capacity in  theater and homeland missile defense; and strengthening  nonproliferation programs.   Importantly, this year's NDAA provides a 4.6-percent pay raise for  both servicemembers and their Department of Defense civilian workforce.  It also authorizes additional funding to ease the impacts of inflation  on the force and provides resources to support recruiting and retention  needs.   When I introduce the fiscal year 2023 NDAA, it will be a substitute  to the House-passed NDAA. This substitute will be modified with a  package of amendments that have been cleared on both sides. There are  75 amendments, including 6 major authorization bills from other  committees.   Again, I am pleased that we have brought this bill to the floor so  the entire Senate has an opportunity to participate in the process.   I also want to take a moment to thank all the staff who accomplished  this herculean task in a week. The staff of the Armed Services  Committee worked tirelessly to ensure every possible amendment was  cleared and included.   I particularly want to thank Kevin Davis of the Office of Legislative  Counsel, who went above and beyond to draft this substitute.   The staff did a remarkable job, working tirelessly. They were led by  Liz King and John Wason, and I salute both of them and all the members  of the staff for their extraordinary efforts.   The topline defense number in this bill, together with the  allocations set by Chairman Leahy for defense and nondefense funding  across the appropriations bills, provides a realistic balance for  funding the military and the rest of the Federal Government. Once we  have completed work on this important authorization bill, we need to  complete the appropriations process.   Let me conclude by once again thanking Ranking Member Inhofe and my  colleagues. I particularly want to recognize and thank the Presiding  Officer, Senator King of Maine, for his great work, and all for their  thoughtful and bipartisan efforts to develop this important piece of  legislation. I would also like to thank the staff, as I said before,  for their tireless efforts on this bill throughout the year.   I look forward to a thoughtful debate on the issues that face our  Department of Defense and national security.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of the following resolutions  that were submitted earlier today en bloc: S. Res. 822, S. Res. 823,  and S. Res. 824.   PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolutions by title.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A resolution (S. Res. 822) to authorize testimony and       representation in United States v. Rhodes.        A resolution (S. Res. 823) to authorize testimony and       representation in United States v. Groseclose.        A resolution (S. Res. 824) to authorize testimony and       representation in United States v. Steele-Smith.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    Mr. President, I further ask that the resolutions be agreed  to, the preambles be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, en bloc, with no intervening  action or debate.    Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the November 10  pro forma time be changed to 3 p.m., with all other provisions of the  previous order in effect.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 11:26 a.m., adjourned until  Friday, October 14, 2022, at 11:30 a.m.                            ____________________
