 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Chris Smith  for yielding me the time.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 1107, the PRC Is Not a Developing  Country Act. This is a bipartisan bill I introduced with my colleague  Gerry Connolly to address the People's Republic of China's exploitation  of its status as a developing country in treaties and in international  organizations.   The People's Republic of China is the world's second largest economy,  accounting for 18.6 percent of the global economy. Their economy size  is second only to the United States. The United States is treated as a  developed country, and so should the PRC. The United States is also  treated as a high-income country in treaties and international  organizations, so China should also be treated as a developed country.   However, the PRC is still classified as a developing country, and  they are using this status to game the system and hurt countries that  are truly in need.   The PRC exploits their developing country status by applying for  development assistance and loans from international organizations,  despite spending trillions on infrastructure projects in developing  countries as part of the debt trap diplomacy scheme known as the Belt  and Road Initiative. In fact,  [[Page H1450]]  PRC's withdrawal of loans takes away from actual developing countries  and helps the PRC finance its Belt and Road program.   We are long overdue to level the playing field. This legislation  rights this wrong by requiring the Secretary of State to oppose the  labeling or treatment of the PRC as a developing country in any  international organization or treaty to which the United States is a  party.                                time  1730    It also directs the Secretary to seek mechanisms in international  organizations to change the status of the PRC from a developing to  developed country.   We cannot let the PRC continue exploiting countries in need and take  unfair advantage of international treaties and organizations. It is  time that we give developing countries a better chance at participating  in programs that are meant for them and not meant for the world's  second-largest economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
