 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize SSAB Steel  for taking a big step toward a more sustainable future with SSAB Zero  steel.   SSAB is the largest producer and supplier of steel plate in North  America, and their facility in Muscatine, Iowa, in my district, is the  first in the world to produce steel with zero emissions from the source  without any credits or offsets.   SSAB Zero steel is made using recycled steel--almost all steel in  America is almost 98 percent recycled--and it is produced with biogas  and renewable electricity. The rollout of zero-emission steel will  continue through 2023 with the goal of having a wide range of products  available to meet the increasing demand for environmentally friendly  alternatives.   SSAB Zero is an important step in their efforts to lead the steel  industry to a decarbonized future by creating an emission-free value  chain for their customers.   We are proud to have such an innovative company pursuing climate- neutral solutions in Iowa and wish them the very best as they continue  to lead the industry to a cleaner, healthier future.                   PBMs Abusing Patient Assistance Programs     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the HELP  Copays Act.   Too many patients are seeing large copays at the pharmacy counter  because of pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM, accumulator programs. PBMs  are the middlemen in the distribution chain between drug manufacturers  and pharmacies and were originally designed to help negotiate with  manufacturers to lower costs for patients.   Unfortunately, we are seeing patient assistance programs being abused  by PBMs. Patients often receive drug coupons from manufacturers for  high-cost medicines to reduce their out-of-pocket spending. However,  PBMs, who are also the insurer in many cases, do not allow the coupon  to apply toward the patient's deductible.   This is not the proper role of insurance. Health benefits should be  serving the patients, not their shareholders at the expense of  patients.   The HELP Copays Act would put an end to these abusive practices and  improve patient access and affordability by requiring insurance plans  to apply patient assistance toward their copay.   There simply can't be a discussion on lowering healthcare costs for  patients without addressing the role of middlemen. Banning the use of  copay accumulators is a readymade policy to do just that.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Bost for yielding me  time.   As a 24-year Army veteran, I understand the importance of improving  services for veterans as they transition to civilian life. VET-TEC is a  pilot program that started under President Trump and was led by Speaker  McCarthy. Let me repeat that. VET-TEC is a  [[Page H2478]]  highly popular and successful program that was started under President  Trump that allows eligible veterans to use GI Bill-style benefits to  attend innovative job training programs to prepare them for future  employment in the technology industry.   Through this program, veterans can get training in high-demand areas,  including computer software, computer programming, data processing,  information science, and media applications. In addition to this,  employment may help prevent and treat homelessness. We have seen 62  percent employment and $65,000 per year average salaries.   I am grateful that my colleague, Representative Ciscomani, introduced  this important piece of legislation, which will help grow our economy  and get veterans back to work. As a physician, it is no small aside  that the dignity of working and having a purpose in life may also help  improve mental health, which may also help improve homelessness.   The VET-TEC Authorization Act proves our commitment not only to  maintaining funding levels but increasing support for veterans.   Last Congress, I led legislation to extend this important program,  and I am proud to support this legislation today. This program has been  widely popular and successful, and this is exactly the type of  taxpayer-funded program that we can all support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important  legislation.
