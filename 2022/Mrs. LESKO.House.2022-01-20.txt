 Mr. Speaker, you wouldn't believe it, but as I was  walking here today to speak about the value of life, my daughter called  me, and she is headed to the hospital to give birth to my fifth  grandchildren, my second granddaughter. So isn't this an appropriate  depiction right here of my next granddaughter, who is going to be named  Grace.   I used to be what they call pro-choice years ago. But I was lied to.  You know, they said it was just a clump of cells, just some tissues,  looked like a tadpole, nothing. But, you know, as technology has gotten  better, we now have ultrasounds, and in our State of Arizona we passed  legislation so that the mothers could see what their babies really look  like. They have little hands, little fingers, little toes. They are  humans. They are real people. They are not just a clump of cells. And  that is why it is so disturbing to me that here in the U.S. Congress I  don't think we have one of my Democratic colleagues left that is pro- life. I think they got rid of them in the primaries.   And when Republicans have come forward and asked the Speaker of the  House, please, can we vote on a bill that requires medical help to be  given to babies that are born alive in a botched abortion, she said  ``no.'' What has this country come to when we don't even want to keep a  baby alive after it is born?   My fellow Republicans and I are fighting hard for the value of life  to protect the preborn, to protect every life. This is the most  important thing that we can do.
