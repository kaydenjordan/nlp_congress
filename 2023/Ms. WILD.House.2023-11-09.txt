 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the life and legacy of  Mr. Bert Winzer of Emmaus, Pennsylvania.   During World War II, Mr. Winzer served with distinction in the  legendary Army 1st Special Service Force.   When a German artillery attack sent shrapnel within an inch of his  heart, he overcame his wounds and returned to the battlefield a mere 10  days later. His grit and courageousness followed him to the Battle of  the Bulge where he held off the German advance during the Siege of  Bastogne.   For his heroism, Mr. Winzer was awarded a Purple Heart, a Bronze  Star, and a Congressional Gold Medal, the civilian honor awarded by  Congress.   After the war, Mr. Winzer spent more than 30 years working in the  automobile industry, including at our own Mack Trucks.   He was an active member in his church community and volunteered his  time at local schools to share his experiences of the war.   Mr. Winzer passed away last month at the age of 101 in the care of  his family. Let us remember Mr. Winzer for his remarkable legacy and  impact on his community and this country. Let us thank all of our  veterans this Veterans Day.                            ____________________
