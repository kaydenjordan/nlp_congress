 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Relief for Farmers Hit with PFAS Act. I thank my colleague Senator King  for joining me to introduce this important legislation for farmers  across America.   The Relief for Farmers Hit with PFAS Act would provide vital  assistance to farmers affected by PFAS contamination. PFAS are a class  of man-made chemicals--sometimes referred to as ``forever chemicals''-- that can bioaccumulate in bodies over time. They are traditionally  found in nonstick pans, clothing, furniture, and firefighting foam and  have been linked to cancer, thyroid disease, liver damage, decreased  fertility, and hormone disruption. PFAS contamination is a growing  problem, and additional resources are needed to support affected  communities.   In Maine, PFAS contamination affecting many different sectors,  including agriculture, has been discovered over the past several years.  The presence of PFAS in wastewater sludge once spread as fertilizer has  prevented some Maine farms from selling their products, thus leading to  significant financial hardship for these family farmers. One such  farmer is Fred Stone, a dairy farmer in Arundel, ME. In 2016, Fred  discovered that the milk produced on his farm contained some of the  highest levels ever reported for a PFAS contaminant at that time. More  recently, a dairy farm in Fairfield, ME, found PFAS levels in its milk  that were 153 times higher than the State's standard.   Dairy is not the only agricultural sector affected by these harmful  forever chemicals. Adam Nordell and his wife Johanna Davis, from Unity,  ME, learned last year that PFAS contaminated the soil and water in  their organic vegetable farm, the result of sludge spread on their land  in the 1990s. Tests earlier this year showed that Adam and Johanna had  levels of PFAS in their blood that were even higher than chemical plant  workers who manufactured PFAS for decades and handled them daily.   Currently, USDA provides limited support to dairy farmers who have  been directed to remove their milk from the commercial market. The  Dairy Indemnity Payment Program--DIPP--is the only USDA program that  attempts to address this problem; however, it falls far short from  meeting the growing needs of all farmers in the State of Maine. Fred  Stone, the farmer who first learned of contamination in 2016, has still  not been compensated adequately for the contaminated cows he  depopulated. What is more, this program helps only dairy farmers,  excluding the farmers of other agricultural products who have had their  livelihoods disrupted by PFAS contamination. While community  organizations and the State of Maine have stepped in to provide some  aid, USDA should do more to assist all farmers affected by these  chemicals. That is what our legislation aims to do.   Specifically, the funds authorized by the Relief for Farmers Hit with  PFAS Act could be used for a variety of purposes at the State level,  including more capacity for PFAS testing for soil or water sources;  blood monitoring for individuals to make informed decisions about their  health; equipment to ensure a farm remains profitable during or after  known PFAS contamination; relocation of a commercial farm if the land  is no longer viable; alternative cropping systems or remediation  strategies; educational programs for farmers experiencing PFAS  contamination; and research on soil and water remediation systems and  the viability of those systems for farms.   In addition to making new resources available, our bill would create  a task force at USDA charged with identifying other USDA programs to  which PFAS contamination should be added as an eligible activity. This  would help bring even more resources to farmers through existing  programs. Additionally, the task force would provide technical  assistance to states to help them coordinate their responses  effectively.   USDA needs to step up and provide support to farmers who, at no fault  of their own, are at risk of losing their livelihoods. This is not just  a problem in Maine; PFAS contamination has been discovered on farms in  New Mexico and Michigan, and this problem will only become more evident  as testing becomes more readily available.  [[Page S6472]]    Thus far, the Federal Government's response has failed to keep pace  with this growing problem. I have repeatedly urged USDA Secretary  Vilsack to come to the aid of these affected farmers, and the Relief  for Farmers Hit with PFAS Act would finally activate the Department to  help where it is needed most.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. As the members of the  Senate Agriculture Committee begin work on the 2023 farm bill, I hope  that we can work together to pass the Relief for Farmers Hit with PFAS  Act into law.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Relief for Farmers Hit with PFAS Act.
