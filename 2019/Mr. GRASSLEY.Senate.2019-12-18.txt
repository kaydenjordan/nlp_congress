 Madam President, Senator Wyden and I received a letter  from the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. Their  letter endorsed our bipartisan Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act,  which tries to respond to what we are hearing from our constituents  about the public outrage over the big increases in prescription drugs.   Now, it happens with Parkinson's disease that about 1 million  Americans have it, and it seems like up to now there is no way to stop  it or cure it, but thanks to modern medicine, the symptoms can be  treated to help patients live a much better life.   Ninety percent of all individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's disease  are on Medicare. Our bill, the bill to reduce prescription drug prices,  would help these seniors afford their medicine with a cap on out-of- pocket expenses. In other words, they would know at the beginning of  the year that they only have to spend x number of dollars on drugs, no  more.   Of course, this brings me to what Congress should be doing. Congress  needs to act, not only for those with Parkinson's disease, but for all  Americans who need our help.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I am here today to commemorate and  celebrate the 1-year anniversary of a groundbreaking achievement. On  December 18, 2018, the Senate passed the FIRST STEP Act. Three days  later, President Trump signed this far-reaching legislation into law.  The FIRST STEP Act is the most significant criminal justice reform law  in a generation.   I am proud of the work we accomplished 1 year ago on the Senate floor  by voting it out of this Chamber with a rollcall vote of 87 to 12. This  historic vote means a lot to this Senator, who then was chairman of the  Judiciary Committee. In fact, in one of the conference rooms in my  office in Washington, I have the official tally sheet from this bill's  vote framed and hung on a wall. Now Iowans, advocates, and those who  visit my office can see this piece of history.   Our criminal justice system is based on the rule of law. That means  when you commit a crime, you should be punished. But the punishment  should fit the crime. If the penalty is too harsh, it doesn't do any  more to deter criminal activity, and it is a bad value for our  taxpayers when you keep people in prison if it doesn't do any good to  have them there.   Overly harsh penalties can also make it harder for prisoners who are  trying to change their lives to turn over a new leaf. It is worth  noting that almost all criminals are eventually released from prison.   Our criminal justice system must do much more than punish and deter.  It should rehabilitate and prepare prisoners to reenter society. That  is exactly what the FIRST STEP Act does. It gives nonviolent prisoners  an incentive to participate in programs in prison, such as job  training, drug treatment programs, and counseling, which have been  shown to reduce recidivism.   The FIRST STEP Act also makes sentencing more fair. It leaves tough  penalties in place for the worst criminals, but it reduces mandatory  minimum sentences, giving judges the ability to tailor punishment to  fit the crime.   Today marks a very happy occasion and a time of reflection. However,  we must remain focused on the future and implementation of that law.  With vigilant and consistent oversight into the implementation of the  FIRST STEP Act, we can ensure these goals of reducing recidivism and  improving our criminal justice system are met.   I have had the opportunity to meet with dozens of former prisoners  who have been released because of the reforms in the FIRST STEP Act,  and I also had a chance to meet with some of the families. These former  prisoners are inspiring. They are finding jobs. They are taking care of  their families. They are paying their taxes and contributing to their  communities. They have told me that the FIRST STEP Act gave them  hope. It reminded them that the rest of the country had not forgotten  about them but wanted them to succeed.    The FIRST STEP Act gives former prisoners a better chance at changing  their lives. Every day, there are more success stories. No doubt, there  will be some prisoners who don't learn a lesson and return to a life of  crime, but the reforms we put into place have been shown at the State  level to reduce crime by reducing recidivism. It is the right thing to  do for people in the criminal justice system, but it is a good value  for the taxpayers, as well, because it costs tens of thousands of  dollars to keep people in prisons.   As we commemorate the FIRST STEP Act, it is important to acknowledge  that this was a bipartisan effort. A lot of people didn't think it was  even possible, but we did it by working together and finding a way to  work out a reasonable compromise.   First and foremost, I want to acknowledge Senator Durbin. I guess you  would call the two of us partners in crime. There is no better advocate  for criminal justice reform than Senator Durbin, and this bill would  never have passed without his hard work and willingness to forge this  bipartisan compromise.   I point especially to Senator Lee because he knows the criminal  justice code inside out, and when we needed people to tell us what we  could or could not do, what was reasonable, he had an answer. So I want  to thank Senator Lee.   I also thank Senators Cornyn, Scott, Whitehouse, Booker, and Leahy,  among others.   I also want to recognize President Trump and give a sincere thank-you  to him and his team, particularly Jared Kushner, for the support and  leadership in this space.   Today, December 18, will always be an important day for me as a  legislator. I look forward to making sure that this law is implemented  successfully and to finding additional ways to improve our criminal  justice system.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I am delighted that we last week reached  a compromise enabling Congress to send another 5-year reauthorization  of the Debbie Smith Act to the President's desk this week. Both  Chambers' adoption of that compromise, which passed the Senate by voice  vote last night, with my support, signals Congress's continued support  for the DNA Backlog and Capacity Enhancement Program.   Earlier this year, I called for reforms to the grant program that the  Debbie Smith Act established. These reforms, suggested this year by the  Government Accountability Office, would require both that the Justice  Department articulate measurable, program-wide goals and that the  National Institute of Justice take additional steps to prevent  lobbying-related conflicts of interest. They would not resolve every  issue with this grant program, but I believe the implementation of such  reforms would substantially strengthen the program. I also advocated  for reforms, which are included in the final legislation, that ensure  the analysis of untested DNA in sexual assault cases is accorded higher  priority under this program.   As mentioned earlier this week, I have called on the Attorney General  to implement several of my proposed reforms through administrative  action. I thank the Attorney General for committing to do so, in the  attached letter dated December 11, 2019. My letter to the Attorney  General on this subject, dated December 9, 2019, also is attached, and  I ask unanimous consent that both letters be printed in the  Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                         U.S. Department of Justice,                                   Office of Legislative Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, December 11, 2019.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. John Cornyn,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grassley and Senator Cornyn: This responds to       your letter to the Attorney General dated December 9, 2019,       regarding the DNA Capacity Enhancement for Backlog Reduction       (CEBR) Program. We write to assure you that the Department of       Justice places a high priority on the Government       Accountability Office's (GAO) reports and recommendations.       The recommendations from the 2019 GAO report regarding the       CEBR program are being addressed by the Office of Justice       Programs, and specifically, by the National Institute of       Justice (NIJ).        In particular, NIJ concurs with the recommendations in the       2019 GAO report regarding performance measures. To create and       implement appropriate and meaningful performance measures NIJ       has: conducted an in-depth analysis of currently available       program performance data to identify information gaps; made       corresponding modifications to program performance measures       to address these gaps; aligned its performance measures with       consistently articulated program goals and permitted program       activities; clearly delineated between measures intended to       capture the state of DNA backlog and laboratory throughout,       and those measures intended to gauge grant program impact;       made clarifications to promote consistency in grant recipient       data reporting; augmented its measures to efficiently capture       the level of DNA funding used for outsourcing DNA sample       analysis (which accounted for approximately only 10 percent       of program costs for FY 2015 award recipients).        Consistent with the recommendations in the GAO report, NIJ       will communicate enhancements to DNA CEBR program measures       starting in calendar year 2020 and continuing through 2020.       This will occur in advance of updated performance measures       that will appear in the FY 2021 DNA CEBR Program       solicitation. Grant recipients will be required to report       against the specific articulated updated measures thereafter.        The 2019 GAO report expressed concern regarding lobbying       disclosure certifications and a lack of controls to follow-up       with grantees to help ensure they are meeting statutory       requirements. As of February 2, 2019, all entities       registering for federal awards in the System for Award       Management (SAM.gov) are required to review the Financial       Assistance Representations and Certifications required by       statutes or regulations in accordance with guidance under       Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations. SAM.gov       registration question 8.L. references compliance with the       Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. Under       this question, the registrant must attest as follows:        I have read each of the certifications and representations       presented on this page. By submitting this certification, I,       , am attesting to the accuracy of the certification       and representations contained herein. I understand that I may       be subject to criminal prosecution under Section 1001, Title       18 of the United States Code or civil liability under the       False Claims Act if I misrepresent  by providing       false, fictitious, or fraudulent information to the U.S.       Government.        In addition, OJP plans to send annual reminders to all OJP       vendors with open active awards reminding them of the       disclosure requirements under the Lobbying Disclosure Act       along with instructions on how to submit the disclosures.        Finally, regarding GAO's concerns regarding controls for       conflict of interest and lobbying, OJP has historically       followed Justice Management Division procedures. However, OJP       did not have these procedures reduced to writing, as       acknowledged by GAO. OJP has memorialized the procedures in       writing, which the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney       General has approved. The procedures are in process for       implementation.        It is OJP's intent, as evidenced by the work already       completed and the plan moving forward, to comply with the       2019 GAO report. We hope this information is helpful. Please       do not hesitate to contact this office if we may provide       additional assistance regarding this or any other matter.  [[Page S7150]]         Sincerely,                                                   Stephen E. Boyd,      Assistant Attorney General.                                   ____       Hon. William P. Barr,      Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,      Washington, DC.        Dear Attorney General Barr: We are writing to urge your       immediate adoption of a government watchdog agency's       recommendations respecting a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)       grant program that makes resources available for criminal       laboratories across the country to process DNA evidence       collected from crime scenes and criminal offenders. We also       request that you commit to implement specific and measurable       goals for this program, known as the ``DNA Capacity       Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Program'' (CEBR), by the       end of the year.        The Government Accountability Office (GAO) repeatedly has       faulted DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and National       Institute of Justice (NIJ) for neglecting to articulate, in       clear, specific, and measurable terms, program-wide goals for       this formula grants program, originally authorized by       Congress under the Debbie Smith Act. The CEBR program, which       has received roughly $1.5 billion in congressional       appropriations since its inception 15 years ago, has been the       subject of two critical GAO reports, one in 2013 and another       this year.        As stated by GAO in a 2019 report on this subject:        ``[T]he Office of Justice Programs (OJP)--the primary       grant-making arm of the Department of Justice--has not       consistently documented program-wide goals for its DNA       Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction grant program       (CEBR). For instance, OJP has documented different meanings       of ``capacity enhancement.'' Additionally, CEBR performance       measures do not fully reflect selected attributes of       successful performance measures, such as having measurable       targets. These issues hinder OJP's ability to assess program       results.''        This is not a new concern: GAO reported a half dozen years       ago that DOJ was not doing enough to assess the results of       the CEBR program. As stated in a 2013 report by the       Comptroller General: ``NIJ has a process in place to       determine DNA and forensic program funding priorities, but       its decisions regarding these priorities are not clearly       documented.'' GAO noted that NIJ was unable to articulate its       rationale for how funding priorities are determined, and       ``[w]ithout a clearly documented process that demonstrates       the rationale for NIJ's funding priorities, there is limited       transparency regarding how and why the agency is allocating       its funding.'' In 2018, a GAO spokesperson testified before       the Senate Judiciary Committee that we lack the tools       necessary to assess whether the CEBR program is working:        Concerns regarding the process for identifying lobbying-      related conflicts of interest were reported by the       Comptroller General in the 2019 report on the CEBR program.       This 2019 report states that ``OJP has not properly designed       all controls related to selected requirements for conflicts       of interest and lobbying.'' Because DOJ's Office of Inspector       General also identified conflicts of interest with NIJ grant       programs as early as 2009, it is imperative that the Office       of Justice Programs immediately establish all appropriate       controls necessary to eliminate such conflicts, as       recommended by the Government Accountability Office in the       report entitled, `DNA Evidence: DOJ Should Improve       Performance Measurement and Properly Design controls for       Nationwide Grant Program' (GAO-19-216).        We also request that you give your commitment, prior to the       end of this calendar year, to implement three steps, based on       the 2019 and 2013 recommendations of the Comptroller General.       Specifically, we ask that you commit that OJP will:        Define CEBR program-wide goals in clear, specific, and       measurable terms by no later than June 30, 2019.        Consistently document these measurable goals for the CEBR       program and use performance measures that fully reflect the       recommendations made by GAO in its report entitled, `DNA       Evidence: DOJ Should Improve Performance Measurement and       Properly Design controls for Nationwide Grant Program' (GAO-      19-216).        Describe any actions taken, including steps to eliminate       conflicts of interest to improve the CEBR program based on       the 2019 recommendations of the Comptroller General.        We look forward to hearing your response no later than       December 20, 2019. If you have any questions, please contact       Evelyn Fortier of Senator Grassley's staff or Franci Rooney       of Senator Cornyn's staff. Thank you in advance for your       cooperation.            Sincerely,      Charles E. Grassley,        Chairman.      John Cornyn,        U.S. Senator.                            ____________________
