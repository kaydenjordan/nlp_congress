 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed light on  achievements made by Iowa's very own HNI Corporation located in  Muscatine, Iowa.   HNI is one of the largest office furniture manufacturers, and they  lead in production of products such as gas, electric, wood, and biomass  burning fireplaces.   Recently, HNI was recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy for  reaching reduced emission goals as a partner in the Better Climate  Challenge.   By implementing various renewable energy and energy efficiency  efforts, HNI was able to reduce emissions by 64 percent.   We congratulate HNI on this achievement.   I also take this moment to let Carol Crane of Davenport, Iowa, know  as she is battling cancer that we are all praying for her, and we all  support her.                            ____________________
