 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the objection.    Madam Speaker, this is not how I imagined my first  speech in the House of Representatives or my first week to be in  Washington.   The violence that occurred in this building yesterday is  reprehensible and inexcusable. I am appalled by anyone who assaults our  Nation's law enforcement officers.   I swore an oath on Sunday to support and defend the Constitution of  the United States. We are here today delayed, but not deterred, to  debate a constitutional question and follow a constitutional process.   The Constitution gives State legislators, not State executives or  judges, the sole authority to determine how their State selects  Presidential electors.   Nobody disputes that in Pennsylvania, as well as in other States,  rules and regulations were changed by executive fiat or judicial edict.   These changes were significant and irregular. They included changes  to vote-by-mail deadlines, identity verification requirements, and  other ballot handling practices.   In Pennsylvania specifically, the Democrat Secretary of the  Commonwealth and the Democrat-controlled Pennsylvania Supreme Court  usurped the constitutional authority of the State legislature.                                time  0110    Together, they exceeded their authority by extending the deadline for  absentee ballots and by waiving signature requirements for those  ballots.   In their haste to make these changes, the secretary and the court  created two different and unequal standards for voters. Pennsylvanians  who chose to vote in person still had to have their signatures verified  at their polling place, but those who chose to vote by mail did not.  How is this process fair?   This objection is about Pennsylvania, but it affects every State. As  a State Representative of New Mexico, Pennsylvania's unconstitutional  actions disenfranchised my constituents and the constituents of my  colleagues. It is my duty to give my constituents a voice. Signing  these objections raises their concerns to the fullest extent my office  allows.   I, again, condemn in the strongest terms the violence that took place  here yesterday. We have many issues to solve, including reforms to  restore all Americans' faith in the fairness of our elections. I look  forward to those serious civil and peaceful debates.   Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).
