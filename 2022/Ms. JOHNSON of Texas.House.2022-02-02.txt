 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 900,  I call up the bill (H.R. 4521) to provide for a coordinated Federal  research initiative to ensure continued United States leadership in  engineering biology, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to stand before this body today to speak  in support of H.R. 4521, the America COMPETES Act of 2022.   I am very proud to be the sponsor of this bill, and as chairwoman of  the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, I am especially proud  of the strong bipartisan bills from my committee that are included in  this package.   It is a privilege to be able to come together in the House this week  to consider this consequential piece of legislation. It is legislation  that is critical to the future health of our American science and  innovation enterprise and our Nation's competitiveness.   The United States has long been a beacon of excellence in science and  innovation. However, we cannot rest on our laurels. It is time for us  to revitalize Federal support for the kinds of research and development  initiatives that enabled us to achieve that excellence in the first  place.   We need to take a holistic approach that encompasses everything from  the state-of-the-art research and development taking place at our  national labs  [[Page H807]]  to advanced manufacturing facilities that employ and support  communities across the Nation.   It is not an understatement to say that we can usher in an exciting  and prosperous future for American competitiveness with the suite of  provisions contained in Divisions A and B of the America COMPETES Act.  These include transformative support for the National Science  Foundation, the Department of Energy's Office of Science, and the  National Institute of Standards and Technology.   In addition, the provisions in this act will enable us to create a  strong and diverse STEM workforce, one that is ready to address the  great societal and scientific challenges we face as a nation.   One of many STEM provisions included in the America COMPETES Act is  the STEM Opportunities Act. This is an initiative I have been working  to make law for 15 years and which is needed now more than ever.   With this legislation, we are making investments to build clean  energy solutions, address the climate crisis, reinforce our national  security, enhance our semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, and so  much more.   In short, we are acting to address the critical needs identified by  the scientific community, industry, academia, and other stakeholders as  what they need most to succeed in the 21st century.   If we are to continue to lead and be able to compete on a global  scale, we must chart our own course. The United States has endless  potential to lead the world in innovation and competitiveness, and the  America COMPETES Act can supply the driving force to get us there.   Before I close, I would like to thank Speaker Pelosi and my  colleagues on and off the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for  their work in getting us to this point.   I would also like to thank Ranking Member Lucas for being a  constructive partner with me to ensure that we passed bipartisan bills  that incorporated the good ideas put forth by Members on both sides of  the aisle in our committee.   Finally, I would like to thank the staff of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee for the hard work, dedication, and long hours that  they have put in throughout this process. I deeply appreciate what they  have done.   This is a strong package, one that was put together with the needs of  each and every American, especially those in historically underserved  communities, in mind.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the America  COMPETES Act of 2022, and I look forward to its swift passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
