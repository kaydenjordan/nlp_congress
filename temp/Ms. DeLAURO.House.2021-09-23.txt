 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5323) making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2022, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5323         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,         That the following sums are appropriated, out of any money       in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the fiscal       year ending September 30, 2022, and for other purposes,       namely:  [[Page H5108]]                                DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE                                PROCUREMENT                         Procurement, Defense-Wide         For an additional amount for ``Procurement, Defense-Wide'',       $1,000,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2024,       for the Secretary of Defense to provide to the Government of       Israel for the procurement of the Iron Dome defense system to       counter short-range rocket threats:  Provided, That such       funds shall be provided to address emergent requirements in       support of Operation Guardian of the Walls:  Provided       further, That such funds shall be transferred pursuant to an       exchange of letters and are in addition to funds provided       pursuant to the U.S.-Israel Iron Dome Procurement Agreement,       as amended:  Provided further, That nothing in the preceding       provisos shall be construed to apply to amounts made       available in prior appropriations Acts for the procurement of       the Iron Dome defense system:  Provided further, That such       amount is designated by the Congress as being for an       emergency requirement pursuant to section 4001(a)(1) and       section 4001(b) of S. Con. Res. 14 (117th Congress), the       concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2022.                        GENERAL PROVISIONS--THIS ACT         Sec. 101.  Each amount appropriated or made available by       this Act is in addition to amounts otherwise appropriated for       the fiscal year involved.        Sec. 102.  Unless otherwise provided for by this Act, the       additional amounts appropriated by this Act to appropriations       accounts shall be available under the authorities and       conditions applicable to such appropriations accounts for       fiscal year 2022.         This Act may be cited as the ``Iron Dome Supplemental       Appropriations Act, 2022''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5323 currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Iron Dome Supplemental  Appropriations Act, which provides $1 billion in funding for Iron Dome,  Israel's short-range missile defense system.   In May, during the latest period of increased violence between Israel  and Hamas, more than 4,000 rockets were launched from Gaza. Using radar  technology and missiles to track and destroy incoming rockets, the Iron  Dome intercepted over 90 percent of the rockets that would have landed  in civilian-populated areas. This system, with help from Congress'  funding, saved thousands of lives in that month alone.   Under the 2016 memorandum of understanding between the United States  and Israel, the United States is committed to replenishing the Iron  Dome so Israel can continue to defend itself from attack and protect  its citizens.   With the funding in this bill, the Iron Dome would continue to  protect millions of civilians. Let me repeat, this funding, as the bill  language clearly states, is limited to a system that is entirely  defensive. And there is no greater demonstration of the defensive  nature of this system than the videos showing the Iron Dome's  interception capacity.   Mr. Speaker, the United States has long been committed to the  objective of a two-state solution, Israelis and Palestinians living  side by side in a lasting peace. The legislation before us ensures that  Israel can fully defend all its citizens, a necessary condition for  lasting peace.   In the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs funding bill  passed by the House over the summer, we provided funding to help meet  the humanitarian and development needs of the Palestinian people,  another requirement for lasting peace.   Peace must always be our mission. It will allow Israelis and  Palestinians to reconcile their differences and heal their many wounds.  But only through peace can this reconciliation and healing even begin  to be achieved.   Mr. Speaker, this bill demonstrates that Congress' commitment to our  friend and ally Israel is bipartisan and ironclad. It fulfills our  moral imperative to protect the lives of innocent civilians and helps  build the foundations for peace.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the chair of the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee.    I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. The answer is no,  they cannot be used for offensive weapons by the Government of Israel.  On page 2, line 7, the bill clearly states the purpose, ``for the  procurement of the Iron Dome defense system to counter short-range  rocket threats.''     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chair of the Military Construction  and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 10  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my good friend and the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. My  Republican colleague's words ring hollow. What are the facts? With or  without the Iron Dome funding, every single House Republican refused to  support the continuing resolution. And, I might add, were proud of  their opposition to the continuing resolution.   But this, my friends, is not the first time. My Republican colleagues  have voted against USAID to Israel three times thus far in the 2022  appropriations bills. Over and over again they say ``no'' to Israel. I  say to them, stop politicizing the U.S. support of Israel. Stop your  empty, political gimmicks, such as your motion to recommit yesterday.  The democratic record is clear on our support for the U.S.-Israel  defense relationship.                                time  1330    We are standing up for it today, we have stood up for it in the past,  and we will continue to do that.   Mr. Speaker, this bill provides the necessary funds for Iron Dome to  continue to protect Israeli citizens which furthers the goal of a  lasting peace in the Middle East.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
