 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Congressman Elijah  Eugene Cummings after his sudden passing on October 17.   Much has been said about his legacy and dedication to the people of  Maryland's Seventh District, but I rise to honor his humility and  incredible love for our country.   Not knowing that he was near the end of his life, I was honored to  have several very personal conversations with Congressman Cummings. He  was struggling with health issues and knew I could relate. But he was  concerned with more than just his health at that  [[Page H8588]]  moment. He was concerned about our country.   America has come a long way during his lifetime, but he knew it would  not take much to undo the progress that we have made, and he was  worried about it. It was an honor to have such a conversation with an  American icon, civil rights legend, and my father on the floor of  Congress. It is a moment I will treasure forever.                            ____________________
