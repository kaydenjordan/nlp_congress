 Madam President, I rise today to recognize  Blanchard Springs Caverns on its 50th anniversary. Blanchard Springs  Caverns--BSC--opened to the public in 1973 after decades of underground  exploration and development to share this natural wonder with the  community and the entire world.   Blanchard Springs Caverns is the second-largest commercial cave in  the country and is often described as one of the most beautiful. This  is, in part, thanks to U.S. Forest Service--USFS--employees, community  advocates, and outdoor enthusiasts who ensure they are maintained in  their natural state--helping Arkansas live up to its own proud title as  a home of spectacular outdoor elements and resources.   Although the first documented visit to the cave system was in 1934 by  Civilian Conservation Corps planner Willard Hadley, its name is derived  from the nearby spring that formed it and had been used by John H.  Blanchard, a Civil War veteran who called the area home, to power a  gristmill.   The Dripstone Trail Tour was the first to launch for recreational  use, and as time went on, two other tours, the Discovery Trail and the  Wild Cave, opened as well. BSC is referred to as a ``living'' or  ``active'' cave, as it is constantly changing. The caverns include an  underground river, delicate ``soda straw'' formations, stalactites,  stalagmites, columns, and huge areas of flowstone. Along with the  unique formations, it is also home to a number of species of cave  animals. The USFS has demonstrated its commitment to ensuring  preservation and conservation of the habitants including the Ozark  blind salamander native to BSC. In addition to what is happening  underground, there is also the amazing landscape of the Ozark National  Forest. As people from all across the globe are attracted to the area  for its splendor, they are driving the local economy. This popular  destination helps support area businesses, spurring critical  development and commerce.   I am pleased to recognize all those helping to maintain Blanchard  Springs Caverns over the last five decades. This natural wonder is  accessible and engaging because of their dedication to preserving it  for all Arkansans and visitors to enjoy.                            ____________________
