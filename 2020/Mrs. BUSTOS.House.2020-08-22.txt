 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise in support of the Delivering for America Act. The post office  is a lifeline to rural communities. More than 1,000 people in the  district that I serve have written to my office desperate to save the  Postal Service: a disabled veteran who depends on the post office to  deliver lifesaving medication; a small business owner who needs the  post office to deliver her products in an efficient and cost-effective  way, so she can feed her family; seniors who must self-  [[Page H4275]]  isolate because they are at high risk, who depend on the Postal Service  for the supplies they need each and every day.   The Postal Service is more than a service; it is part of who we are.  For Joseph in Peoria, he was a child waiting for that decoder ring to  come through the mail. For Heather in Pekin, it is a care package full  of old family photos after losing a loved one. For Joseph in Kewanee,  it is a letter from his best friend serving in Afghanistan.   Birth certificates, college acceptance letters, the mortgage paid  off, the Postal Service delivers the American Dream. We cannot let it  fail.
