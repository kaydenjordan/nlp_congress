 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leader for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I think we have very different definitions of success  for the American people. As Democrats, we have been focused and have  been successful in growing our economy by growing the middle class,  lowering healthcare costs, making sure that we are addressing climate  change, and having safer communities.   Now the Republican Conference is saying they are sending us home for  6  [[Page H4051]]  weeks without funding the government?   We have 1 bill out of 12 completed because extremists are holding  your Conference hostage. That is not the full story. The extremists are  holding the American people hostage.                                time  1400    We will have 12 days when we return to fund the government and to  live up to the job the American people sent us here to do.   This is a reckless march to a MAGA shutdown, and for what? In pursuit  of a national abortion ban?   Is that what we are doing here?   The American people see through this. They know who is fighting for  them and fighting for solutions.   Your time is coming, Mr. Speaker. The American people are watching,  and they are going to demand accountability.   We should be staying here, completing these appropriation bills,  stripping out the toxic, divisive, and bigoted riders that have been  put on these bills and getting back to work for freedom, for our  economy, and the American family.    Mr. Speaker, we are going to continue to  stand in this country for some basic principles that we are sent here  for the American people, that we are sent here to defend their freedom,  and that we are sent here to work an economy that isn't just for the  wealthy and well connected but that is for the American family.   That is the work we are doing. That is the basis of the great  economic news coming out, and we are going to continue that fight.   We hope that Republicans will say no to extremism, to hatred, and to  bigotry that is put into these appropriation bills and say yes to  solutions and fairness for the American people and to build an economy  where they can see themselves.   Funding our government is our basic job. The comments from the GOP  Conference about how we could go into a MAGA shutdown and it wouldn't  matter are outrageous. The last time we had a shutdown, it was $11  billion out of this economy.   Don't talk to us about standing for our veterans when the GOP was the  one that has cut veterans housing, has cut their healthcare, and has  said to our women, our Active-Duty military women, that it is okay to  fight for freedom for our country, but we are going to take your  freedom away. That is not okay.
