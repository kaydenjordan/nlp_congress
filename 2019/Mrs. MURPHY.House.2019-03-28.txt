 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of  central Florida community leader, faculty member, and editorial writer,  John Bersia, who recently passed away.   Born and raised in central Florida, John earned a bachelor's degree  from the University of Central Florida as well as masters degrees from  Georgetown University, American University, and the London School of  Economics.   He then returned to our community to begin writing editorials for the  Orlando Sentinel. There, he won a Pulitzer Prize for an editorial  series that exposed the predatory lending practices of irresponsible  payday lenders, leading to legislation that cracked down on that  industry.   In 2001, he began teaching at the University of Central Florida,  where he helped establish the Center for the Study of Human Trafficking  and Modern Slavery. Throughout his career, he inspired his students to  pursue a love of travel, new cultures, and humanity-focused work, but  his passion spread beyond that campus.   He hosted a weekly TV show on WUCF and chaired different  institutions, including the Global Connections Foundation, the World  Affairs Council of Central Florida, and the Orlando Area Committee on  Foreign Relations.   John sought to broaden people's connections to the outside world  while helping us see that global issues can also be local.   For that and much more, he will be truly missed.                            ____________________
