 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.  Res. 1096 because I believe the time has come to recognize our  Congressional Workers' Right to Organize. Just as celebrated Mexican  American Civil Rights Activist and Labor Leader, Cesar Chavez said (``  Se Puede.''). Yes, you can.   Madam Speaker, the American Labor Movement was born out of a creed  and fundamental belief rooted firmly in protecting the common interests  of workers by promoting and advancing the social, political, and  economic equality of every man, woman, and child.   Throughout our nation's history, workers have come together to  bravely share their workplace experiences and illustrate their need for  the protected right to organize. The earliest labor unions were  inspired by a just society, deriving their ideals from the American  Revolution. They sought to create conditions that fostered social  equality, celebrated honest labor, and relied on independent and  virtuous citizenship.   It was the American Federation of Labor, a union, that successfully  negotiated wage increases for its members and enhanced workplace safety  in the early 20th Century.   And it was the dedication and efforts from unions like United Farm  Workers, United Auto Workers, and United Steelworkers, that have long  championed religious freedoms, the evolving demands of the  environmental movement; the rights of farm workers; promoting human  rights both domestically and abroad; advancing civil liberties; social  justice, and economic equality for every American.   It took President Franklin D. Roosevelt's leadership and the hard  work of unions for Congress to pass the Fair Labor Standards Act in  1938, which is responsible for establishing the eight-hour day and  five-day week for wage employees. As FDR once told union and civil- rights leader A. Philip Randolph, he agreed with the labor movement's  ideas, but it was the work of the activists that made him go out and  advocate for these reforms.   Throughout our Nation's history, workers and their unions have  agitated lobbied, organized, struck, and voted for decades to achieve  more equitable and safe working conditions.   For the past thirty years, it has been my great honor to serve the  California's 40th Congressional District and the American people. I  [[Page H4773]]  have been able to do this through a hard-working, dedicated and  committed staff.   I am happy to join my colleagues in bringing Congressional Staff  closer to having the legal right to organize and bargain collectively.   Yes, you can.   (Si, Se Puede)   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1097         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 17.
