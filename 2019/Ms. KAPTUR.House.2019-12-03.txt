 Madam Speaker, bipartisan support for the U.S.-Ukraine  longstanding strategic partnership remains resolute.   Ukraine is the nation on the scrimmage line for liberty in Europe.  And as I speak, Ukraine's armed services are protecting Europe's  eastern flank from Russian aggression. Its people have made their  commitment to democracy clear in its most recent elections, and over  14,000 Ukrainians have now died fighting Russia's illegal invasion.   Tomorrow, the Congressional Ukraine Caucus will join the Atlantic  Council in hosting a half-day bipartisan, bicameral conference,  entitled, ``U.S. Strategic Interests in Ukraine.'' It will be held  tomorrow at 11:30 in the Visitor Center Meeting Room North. I encourage  my colleagues to come and spend a few minutes with us.   I am also pleased to host a roundtable with extraordinarily brave,  award-winning Ukrainian journalist Myroslava Gongadze tomorrow at 10  o'clock in the morning in Rayburn 2362B.   Following the brutal murder of her husband, Myroslava tirelessly  pursued justice on his behalf in the European Court of Human Rights and  now serves as the Voice of America's chief for Ukrainian service.   Madam Speaker, I kindly invite all my colleagues to attend these  important sessions.                            ____________________
