 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National PTSD Awareness  Month to call attention to this topic that is so important to the lives  of our veterans and their families.   Nowhere is the connection between PTSD and suicide felt more strongly  than in the veteran community.   Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, and  on average, we lose 20 veterans per day to suicide.   Far too many of our veterans are left with the difficulties of  overcoming PTSD and addiction on their own. Our Central Arkansas  Veterans Healthcare System, led by Dr. Margie Scott, is one of nine  systems nationwide that is currently involved in the Clay Hunt SAV Act  pilot program in our Nation.   This program gives our VA employees the necessary tools to reach out  to high-risk veterans and offer guidance, while providing essential  suicide prevention services.   I have got three wounded warriors on my district staff, Mr. Speaker,  and we are together dedicated to our veterans.   I am grateful to our veteran service organizations and our work  together to spread the word on how we need to help our veterans avoid  the crisis that comes with the risk of suicide.   To our vets, you are not alone. All vets believe in the buddy system,  and the Veteran Crisis Line keeps that bond.   Please call 1-800-273-8255 if you are having a crisis or you know a  veteran in crisis.                            ____________________
