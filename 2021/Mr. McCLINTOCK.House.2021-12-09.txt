 Madam Speaker, setting aside the Democrats' neurotic  obsession with all things Donald Trump, this measure has many  provisions that would receive bipartisan support if the bill's author  were so inclined.   But when we speak of protecting democracy, we need to remember what  democracy is. It is the process by which the sovereign people, through  [[Page H7585]]  elections, decide who will control and direct the powers that we  entrust to our government.   ``The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United  States of America.'' If the executive branch begins to operate  independently of the President, the will of the people is thwarted and  democracy is diminished.   For example, the Tenure of Office Act limited the President's  authority to remove Cabinet officers, a dangerous concept ultimately  repealed by the Congress and repudiated by the Supreme Court.  Provisions in this bill, such as those that interfere with Presidential  appointments, cross that very bright constitutional line.                                time  1300
