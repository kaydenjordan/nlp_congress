 Madam Speaker, there is another unfolding humanitarian  crisis in Syria, this time in Idlib province. Syrian President Bashar  al-Assad has launched an all-out assault on the province, aided by  Vladimir Putin's Russian forces.   More than a quarter of a million people, 80 percent of them women and  children, have fled their homes to the northern part of Idlib into  freezing desert and refugee camps, without adequate food, shelter, or  medical care.   With the current death toll of the Syrian civil war estimated to  exceed 500,000, along with six million people internally displaced,  humanitarian groups are concerned that the siege of Idlib will result  in the largest humanitarian disaster yet seen in the country.   This assault is a replay of the siege of Aleppo as the government  again bombs civilian targets like hospitals, schools, markets and  people's homes.   This disaster will only be compounded as a result of Russia vetoing a  U.N. Security Council resolution allowing cross-border aid to Syrian  refugees. Although a modified resolution was adopted, cross-border aid  has been restricted and may come to an end this summer if Russia and  Syria continue to push for its elimination.   As U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft said: ``Syrians will  suffer needlessly as a result of this resolution.''                            ____________________
