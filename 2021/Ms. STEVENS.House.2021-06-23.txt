 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman  Slotkin, for organizing this tribute session to our friend and former  colleague, Paul Mitchell.   It is very symbolic of what it is like to be a member of the Michigan  delegation. There are 14 of us--7 Democrats, 7 Republicans-- representing a State of just a little over 10 million people. And yet,  we come together time and time again to champion matters and issues for  our State, whether it is the Great Lakes or veterans' issues or our  automotive industry.   Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we are doing here today. We are  standing up for our friend who is in a fight--a fight against cancer.  And we are doing it on the floor of the House of Representatives, for  this man loves the floor of the House of Representatives.  [[Page H3070]]  So there is no place more symbolic than this to tell Paul, ``You have  got this.''   Sherry, you have got this. And to your kids, who I know you love  dearly, we are standing by you every step of the way.                                time  1800    Paul was certainly a champion not only for the legislative process  and the business of doing government right by people, but he was a  champion for Michigan. And if you hear his words, if he has talked  about his experience, his recent diagnosis, you hear Paul saying: This  was a gift from God. This was a gift from God.   Even when it got scary, because he is getting a little bit more of  life. He is getting more of a chance to continue to push and to stand  up for what he knows he has worked his life for, which is the creation  of his wonderful family, and being in the State he loves so dearly.   Paul, I will just tell you, I have so many fond memories of you. I  have fond memories from learning from you on this very floor. I have  fond memories of being at Chrysler with you, which was really exciting  for a first-term Congresswoman to be alongside you, seeing the new  vehicles, and having discussions with the workforce at Chrysler in my  district, but I know you have many Chrysler employees in the Michigan  10th District as well.   So those are the memories and those are the things that we celebrate  with your service and also with your continued dedication. So it is a  real privilege and honor to be here with my colleagues, telling you,  Paul: You have got this, you are going to keep going, and we are going  to keep fighting another day.
