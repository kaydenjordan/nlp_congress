 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the National Institute  of Standards and Technology Small Business Cybersecurity Act, a bill  that I am proud to cosponsor. This legislation will help promote  stronger cybersecurity practices amongst our Nation's small businesses,  and it is fiscally responsible.   The well-being of our small businesses is important to the overall  health of our economy. According to the Small Business Administration,  small businesses account for 55 percent of total jobs in the United  States. In my home State of Nebraska, small businesses employed 390,000  people in 2016.   Some small businesses are not able to prioritize cybersecurity  efforts over other aspects of their business or they lack the resources  to secure their networks and systems. We must promote greater  preparedness to protect small businesses from cyber attacks.   H.R. 2105 directs NIST to disseminate guidance to help small  businesses identify, assess, manage, and reduce their cyber risks based  off NIST's extensive expertise. This is a big step towards promoting  better cybersecurity practices amongst our Nation's small businesses.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2105.
