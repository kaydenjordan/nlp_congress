 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy  and his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, the hardest hit sector of our economy is the 500,000  independent restaurants and their 11 million employees. That is why  there are 2.3 million of those employees unemployed. And one out of six  restaurants has closed permanently, with the prospect of up to 85  percent being lost in the year ahead. Sadly, the impact has been  disproportionately on women, minorities, and immigrants.   The PPE program didn't work for restaurants. They don't need  complicated loans. They don't know, in many cases, whether they are  going to be open in 2 or 3 months.   The restrictions across the country are such that most restaurants  simply do not have a viable economic model. That is why I introduced  the Restaurants Act. I am pleased that $50 billion has been designated  for small business in this resolution, and I hope at least 50 percent  of that will be dedicated to the bipartisan and bicameral Restaurants  Act that we have introduced. It has over half the Members of the House  of Representatives cosponsoring and over half the Senate.   We have an opportunity to move this forward in a way that will give a  lifeline to our restaurants that are the cornerstone of our community.  We give them that lifeline, and next year at this time most of it will  be back to normal. They will be vaccinated, the weather will change,  and we will be able to return to that vibrant part of our communities.  But they need the lifeline.   So I strongly urge support for the Restaurants Act which will be  reintroduced and part of the reconciliation process that will make it  possible to provide that necessary support to keep them afloat.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) for his  courtesy.
