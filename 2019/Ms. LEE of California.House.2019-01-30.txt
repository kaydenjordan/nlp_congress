 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.  Res. 79, a resolution expressing the sense of the House that shutdowns  are detrimental to the Nation and should not occur.   And as a Member of the Appropriations Committee, I know firsthand how  terrible this shutdown has been. This past weekend I met with Coast  Guard families impacted by the 35-day government shutdown.   Families told me they were skipping medications and couldn't afford  to put gas in the car because of the shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, these families did nothing wrong.   In fact, they have gone Above and Beyond the call of duty by signing  up to serve in the Coast Guard.   And how did President Trump reward their sacrifices?   By inflicting a needless, 35-day government shutdown on these  families. By using these families as political pawns.   Let me be clear: these Coast Guard families deserve far better than  this. And so do all our federal workers--who bore the brunt of this  shutdown through no fault of their own.   The CBO estimates that this shutdown cost our economy 11 billion  dollars--including 3 billion dollars that will never be recovered.   It also caused immeasurable fear and anxiety for families.   So, while we can never fully repair the damage that was caused by  this dangerous, irresponsible shutdown, I hope that President Trump and  Congressional Republicans will take these stories to heart and learn  from the damage they caused.   Simply put, families can't afford another shutdown.   So, let's pass this resolution and get back to work for the American  people. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.
