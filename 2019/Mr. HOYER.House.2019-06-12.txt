 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairwoman for yielding, and I want  to say I thank the chair and I thank Ms. Granger for her leadership and  working with the chair, Mrs. Lowey, on getting these bills to the  floor.   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, albeit on leave, I am  very proud of this committee. This committee is probably the most  critical committee in the sense that, if it doesn't get its work done,  we shut down the government. No other committee can say that, luckily.   But I am pleased, as the majority leader, to say that it has been my  intent, working with the chair and the ranking member, to complete this  appropriations process in a timely fashion.   Mr. Chair, the new Democratic majority began this Congress in the  middle of a damaging government shutdown. Even though we had a  bipartisan agreement on spending levels--which we don't yet have--and  the Republicans held both Chambers of Congress and the executive, they  failed a fundamental responsibility of funding all of government. And,  as a result, we had a partial shutdown.   This week, the Democratic majority, working with the Republican  minority in the House--and I had the privilege of serving with Ms.  Granger actively on the committee--is moving the first four  appropriations bills to the floor for consideration, with passage  expected early next week.   It is my hope that, by moving through this process, we can help  prevent a shutdown and, rationally, adopt the priorities of this  country, both from a national security standpoint  [[Page H4460]]  and from a national security standpoint on domestic investments.   The bills that are included in this package show our commitment to a  stronger military, supporting critical research to combat diseases,  more educational opportunities for our people, prioritizing diplomacy  and more robust water and energy infrastructure, and a more accountable  government.   It is a funding package for the people. I am particularly proud of  the Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies bill. In my estimate,  it is the best I have had the opportunity to vote for throughout my  career.   It supports a more competitive workforce, advances healthcare  research and access, stands up for women's health, and invests in  future generations by funding important educational initiatives; such  as, full-service community schools, a Special Olympics that provides so  many opportunities to those with intellectual disabilities, and after- school programming.   These are all critical programs for our national security that  President Trump has proposed, unfortunately, eliminating.   Moreover, the Energy and Water bill before us supports the Chesapeake  Bay Oyster Restoration Project, which is important to our State, but  also important to one of America's great estuaries.   We are doing all that while bringing the package of appropriations  bills to the floor under a rule that allows for genuine bipartisan  debate and amendment.   As I have said before, the House intends to do its job by passing all  12 appropriations bills before the end of June so that we have ample  time to go to conference with the Senate and complete them before the  end of the fiscal year.   That will be a historic step if we, together, can accomplish it. The  Democratic-led House ended the Trump shutdown earlier this year. And  the Democratic-led House is going to do its part to prevent another  Trump shutdown in October.   Let me reiterate, though, that we want to do it in a bipartisan way.  Again, I thank the chair and the ranking member for being such  constructive, positive participants in this process.    The best way to accomplish our objective, though, is for House and  Senate Democrats and Republicans to reach agreement before the fall on  lifting the sequester caps based on the principle of parity while, at  the same time, extending or eliminating the debt limit.   I talked to Senator McConnell in January. Both he and I agreed that  we ought to get a caps agreement.   I regret that we have not done that, so we are proceeding under a  deemed number. That is not the perfect way to do it, but it is the only  way we had available to us to get our work done.   I observe that Mr. Shelby, who is the chairman of the Appropriations  Committee, for my Republican friends, indicated he thought he might  well follow the House and deem numbers. As a practical matter, that is  the only way to do it absent agreement.   Agreement on top-line numbers will make it easier for the House and  Senate to agree on individual appropriations bills that can be sent to  the President's desk.   Together, we have a responsibility to make the investments the  American people have entrusted us to make. I realize that we do not all  agree, but we ought to, as a democratic body, decide that we will vote  on our disagreements and we will resolve those by vote, as we did when  the Republican side was in charge.   And, very frankly, we disagreed with many of those bills, but they  became law, five of them. And, as a result, we funded the majority of  the expenditures in the last year, even though we shut down most of the  agencies of government at the end of the year into this year.   So, Mr. Chair, I would urge my friends to pursue this debate in an  orderly fashion, realizing that we couldn't make all 600 amendments in  order, but also realizing that we will have an opportunity to debate  the equities that we think are important, come to a decision, and pass  those bills to the Senate.   Hopefully, the Senate will pass them, and we will have conferences.  Some Members don't know what conferences are.   When I started on the Appropriations Committee in 1983, and in the 23  years thereafter--in the early years, we really had conferences, and  all the members of the subcommittee were members of the conference. And  we met with the Senate; we debated back and forth; and we came out with  the compromised bills.   When I started on the Appropriations Committee, there were really no  Republicans and no Democrats. One may think that is a surprising  statement. All were advocates. Some had different points of view, but  they were advocates of making sure that we funded our government in a  rational, democratic way, which means the majority will rule, as it did  last year.   So, I urge my colleagues: Let us do our business. We will have  differences, but do not allow those differences to undermine the  ability of this House to operate in a rational, constructive manner.                                time  1530
