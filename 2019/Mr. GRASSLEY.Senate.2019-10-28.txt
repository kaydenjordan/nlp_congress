 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in  morning business for 1 minute.    Mr. President, polling consistently shows that lowering  the cost of prescription drugs is a top priority for Americans. That is  why I hope we can act on this pressing issue in the coming months. A  failure to act would be remembered by Americans.   This week, the Democratic House is poised to pass a bill. There are  many problems with that legislation, and it doesn't stand a chance of  passage in the Senate. Thankfully, we have bipartisan legislation in  the House-titled ``Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act'' that  President Trump supports and has a clear path to being signed into law.  We need the full Senate to act on this legislation. Republicans should  not want to be the party that failed to act.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    In March of 2015, I began our long investigation into  Secretary Clinton's use of nongovernment email for official business.  Since then, I have written hundreds of letters, held hearings, and  discussed my findings and concerns right here on the Senate floor.  After all, the public's business ought to be public.   Today, we can add more findings to that ongoing list of Secretary  Clinton's and her associates' wrongful conduct.   The other week I released a report from the State Department that  finalized their administrative review of how Secretary Clinton's  private server setup caused hundreds of security violations. That  review found five things I am going to mention.   First, 91 valid security violations were identified and attributable  to 38 individuals. That means 38 individuals mishandled classified  information and were punished for it. The sanctions for a violation  included suspension or revocation of their security clearance,  suspension without pay, or termination, among other forms of  punishment.   Second, an additional 497 valid violations were identified. However,  the State Department was unable to determine who was culpable. The  State Department was unable to identify culpability because some former  Department employees didn't sit for interviews or because Secretary  Clinton kept her server secret from government officials, so it was  impossible for the Department to monitor security protocol in realtime.   The review also noted that there was a 5- to 9-year gap between the  beginning of Secretary Clinton's State Department tenure when the  security incidents began and when she finally turned over the emails,  which she initially refused to do.   This many yearslong gap made it very challenging to determine who was  culpable for every violation of regulation and law covering national  security issues and the need for classification.   In total, Secretary Clinton's use of a nongovernment server for  government business caused 588 security violations for mishandling  classified information. Some of that classified information was  classified at the very highest levels, including Top Secret/Special  Access Program information.   According to the FBI, Secretary Clinton sent and received emails that  contained highly classified information. It is hard to fathom how this  wouldn't undermine our national security. If the average American did  that, they would lose their clearance, their job, and might even go to  jail.   That is what happened to Navy sailor Kristian Saucier. He took six  photographs inside his submarine that exposed information classified at  the confidential level. He mishandled classified information. He pled  guilty and was sentenced to 1 year in Federal prison.   So people ask me: How come some people go to prison for violating  classification and other people don't?   Let's go to the third point. The review found Secretary Clinton's  nongovernmental server increased the risk of unauthorized disclosures.   Fourth, the review found that the nongovernment server increased the  risk of security compromises.   Clinton's private server setup had been described as being so badly  secured that it was almost impossible to detect who had attempted to  attack it and gain access to it. Anyone could have done it.   Fifth and last, the review found that some classified information was  deliberately transmitted via unclassified emails and resulted in  adjudicated security violations.   Many in the press, as well as partisan Clinton defenders, have hung  their hats on the State Department's finding that there was ``no  persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified  information.''   Take, for example, the Washington Post. Their headline was ``State  Department probe of Clinton email finds no deliberate mishandling of  classified information.''   Well, that headline was entirely wrong. The State Department report  said: ``Instances of classified information being deliberately  transmitted via  [[Page S6183]]  unclassified emails were the rare exception and resulted in adjudicated  security violations.''   That statement clearly says some individuals deliberately transmitted  classified information on unclassified systems. Those individuals were  subject to security sanctions, but the State Department failed to  describe who the violators were and what the sanctions were.   Those answers ought to be forthcoming. Consequently--you know my  reputation--I intend to follow up. Ensuring the proper handling of  highly classified information is an issue that should garner bipartisan  support. This may sound like history, but there is a lesson to be  learned from this history that classified information should be  classified for protecting national security.   Furthermore, if government officials deliberately expose classified  information on an unclassified system, why didn't the FBI find the same  during their investigations?   We all know then-Director Comey refused to recommend any charges  related to the Clinton investigation because the FBI could not identify  the requisite criminal intent. It seems to me that deliberately sending  classified information on unclassified channels is intentional conduct.  Again, if the average American did that, they would be in big trouble,  as I pointed out about the Navy sailor spending 1 year in prison.   During the course of my oversight activities, I acquired drafts of  Comey's July 5, 2016, public statement exonerating Clinton. Comey's  initial draft stated the following. This is the initial draft.         There is evidence to support a conclusion that Secretary       Clinton, and others, used the private email server in a       manner that was grossly negligent with respect to the       handling of classified material.    Comey also said this:         Similarly, the sheer volume of information that was       properly classified as Secret at the time it was discussed on       email (that is, excluding the up-classified emails) supports       an inference that the participants were grossly negligent in       their handling of that information.    Gross negligence--the words used by Comey--is a criminal standard  under title 18, section 793.   He later dumbed-down his statement to a noncriminal standard:         Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary       Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing       the handling of classified information, there is evidence       that they were extremely careless in their handling of very       sensitive, highly classified information.    And that was before he finished the investigation and interviewed 17  witnesses, including Secretary Clinton.   Director Comey never once said that some individuals deliberately  sent classified information on an unclassified system. According to the  State Department's findings, Comey should have come to that conclusion  and made that statement.   Clearly, deliberate conduct rises beyond gross negligence. So who  deliberately sent classified information on unclassified channels, and  has the Department communicated this new finding to the FBI?   Just last week, I spoke on the floor about how the FBI pulled its  punches during the Clinton investigation. I talked about how the FBI  agreed to limit the scope of review to her time as Secretary of State.  That decision eliminated potentially highly relevant emails before and  after her tenure that could have shed light on why she operated the  nongovernment server. It also eliminated emails around the time of the  conference call between Clinton's attorneys and the administrator of  her server that led to the deletion of her emails. That limitation of  scope defies reason.   Lastly, the FBI agreed to destroy records and laptops of Clinton's  associates after reviewing them. That is an astonishing agreement in  light of the fact those records could have been relevant to ongoing  congressional inquiries that the FBI knew about.   Secretary Clinton's actions caused 588 security violations and highly  classified information to be exposed to an unclassified system. Some of  those violations were very deliberate, but that is the first we have  heard of it.   The public ought to know whether those folks involved were punished  according to the letter of the law or were given special treatment.  Equal application of the law without regard to power, party, or  privilege ought to be the norm. With what we know up to this point, the  Clinton investigation failed to hit its mark.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
