 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3364. The  authoritarian regimes in Iran, Russia, and North Korea continue to  undermine global peace and security and threaten the safety of the  United States and our allies.   Russia's coordinated efforts to undermine democracies and free and  fair elections around the world is particularly troubling and demand a  strong response.   I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their bipartisan  legislation that counters these belligerent regimes and ensures strong  oversight by Congress and the American people.   The safety and security of our communities and our country must come  before partisanship.   I also thank the chair and ranking member for introducing our  bipartisan legislation introduced with Congressman Budd to establish a  whole-of-government strategy to combat the financing of terrorism.   Current U.S. efforts to counter the financing of terrorism lack  sufficient coordination, and the U.S. has no unified national strategy  to guide our counterfinancing efforts. Money is the lifeblood of any  organization. We must establish a comprehensive and effective strategy  to deny money to terrorists. This strategy will enhance detection,  deterrence, and prosecution and ultimately strengthen our broader  national security goals.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and ranking member for advancing this  important bipartisan national security bill, and I urge my colleagues  to vote ``yes.''
