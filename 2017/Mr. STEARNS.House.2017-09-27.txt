 Mr. Speaker and Father, thank you for those very welcome  comments. I think all of us, when we come on the House floor, we feel  keenly the fact of this beloved country and how much we respect our  positions as former Members of Congress.   Thank you, Martin. It is always a distinct privilege to be back in  this revered Chamber and to see so many of my good friends and former  colleagues here. On behalf of the United States Association of Former  Members of Congress, I appreciate the Speaker's invitation to return to  this wonderful place and to present to the Congress  [[Page H7576]]  Former Members of Congress' 47th annual report.   I will be joined by some of our colleagues in reporting on the  activities, finances, and projects of our organization since our last  report a little over a year ago. But first I would like to ask the  Clerk to call the roll.   The Clerk called the roll and the following former Members answered  ``present'':   Mr. Alexander of Arkansas   Mr. Baird of Washington   Ms. Christensen of the Virgin Islands   Mr. Coyne of Pennsylvania   Mr. DioGuardi of New York   Mr. Edwards of Texas   Mr. Frost of Texas   Mr. Gerlach of Pennsylvania   Mr. Glickman of Kansas   Mr. Hertel of Michigan   Mr. Hochbrueckner of New York   Mr. Horsford of Nevada   Mr. Konnyu of California   Mr. Lancaster of North Carolina   Mr. Lungren of California   Mr. Maffei of New York   Ms. Morella of Maryland   Mr. Rahall of West Virginia   Mr. Roth of Wisconsin   Mr. Sarasin of Connecticut   Mr. Sarpalius of Texas   Mr. Skaggs of Colorado   Mr. Slattery of Kansas   Mr. Stearns of Florida   Mr. Tanner of Tennessee   Mr. Turner of Texas   Mr. Walsh of New York   Mr. Weller of Illinois   Mr. Zeliff of New Hampshire    Mr. Frost, thank you very much, and I would also  indicate the former members of the European Union are all accounted for  and present here, and we welcome all of them here especially.   I want to thank all of you for joining us today. As I prepare for  today's report, I want to give you a little quote from Aristotle that  goes back 2,500 years. He was asked: What would be the best form of  life one could live? He replied that ``the best form of life, the  Eudaimonia outcome, given all that, would be the life of the good  lawgiver.''   He didn't mention the richest person, nor the most spiritual man, but  the legislator. For all of us, service in this remarkable building was  the pinnacle of our professional lives, and I am very proud that  through the Former Members of Congress we can continue, in a very small  measure, the public service that brought us here to Congress in the  first place.   My colleagues, our Association was chartered by Congress, and one  requirement of that congressional charter is for us to report once a  year to Congress about our activities.   Incidentally, in 2016, there were approximately 1.8 million not-for- profit organizations in the United States. Of that number, right around  100 are congressionally chartered, and those include such outstanding  organizations as the USO and the Boy and Girl Scouts of America. Former  Members of Congress, therefore, is in very exclusive and prestigious  company, and we take the mandate that comes with being congressionally  chartered very seriously.   Our Association was founded in 1970 and chartered by Congress in  1983. It is a bipartisan, nonprofit, voluntary alliance of former  United States Senators and Members of Congress standing for America's  constitutional system, which vests authority in the people through  their elected offices.   We work together to strengthen Congress in the conduct of its  constitutional responsibility through promoting a collaborative  approach to policymaking. We seek to deepen the understanding of our  democratic system, domestically and internationally, and to encourage  the citizenry through civic education about Congress and the importance  of public service.   We are successful because Democrats and Republicans work together in  a partnership for all of our programs and our many projects, including  participation with current Members of Congress.   We are so proud to have been chartered by Congress, and we are  equally proud that absolutely no taxpayer dollar is earmarked or  expended to make all of our programs possible. Everything we do, and  you will hear about many of our activities in a short while, is  financed via grants and sponsors, our membership dues, and our annual  fundraising gala. Our finances are sound, our projects are fully  funded, and our most recent annual audit by an outside accountant  confirmed that we are running the Former Members of Congress in a very  fiscally sound, responsible, and transparent manner.   We are successful because former Senators and Representatives come  together, across party lines, for the good of our organization. They  all believe in our mission, and they continue to have the public  servant's spirit at heart.   Former Members of Congress, in 2016, donated over 6,500 hours of  energy, wisdom, mentoring, and expertise. All of these activities were  donated pro bono. No former Member received any kind of honorarium to  go on a Congress to Campus visit or participate in any Former Members  of Congress' programs. Your only remuneration is the knowledge that you  are giving back, that serving in Congress was a unique privilege, and  that it comes with a mandate to teach the next generation.   Before I report on specific activities, as your Association's  president, I want to thank all the Members who have contributed their  time and expertise to make our organization such a success. So on  behalf of the Former Members of Congress, thank you wholeheartedly for  your participation.   Many of you have joined us for several years on this occasion. There  will be numerous programs and projects which, by now, you have become  quite familiar with. This is a sign of the Former Members of Congress'  stability and purpose. We are extremely proud of our 50-year history of  creating lasting and impactful programs that teach about Congress and  representative government, and our ability to take longstanding  projects and expand them and improve upon them.   In addition to hearing about programs we have conducted for many  years, you will hear from us about a new vision we have for this  organization. For over a year now, our Association has engaged in a  very detailed, in-depth strategic planning process which has set us off  for a very exciting path.   This process was led by a strategic planning professional who has  worked in this field for decades, has written extensively on management  and organizational success, and has served clients, including many  Fortune 100 companies. His name is Mark Sobol, and he made the service  of his company, Longwave Partners, available to us pro bono, because he  so strongly believes in our former Members organization, that it can  play an integral and impactful role in reconnecting citizens with their  government, and also showcasing that public servants, no matter what  the party label is, are eager to work together for the good of this  country.   Our work with Mark and Longwave included our board of directors,  countless former Members of Congress, our excellent staff, and numerous  other stakeholders. It resulted in a vision for Former Members of  Congress that outlines the next 3 to 5 years and has, as its core, four  strategic principles: We will provide forums for dialogue that will  strengthen bipartisan relationships here on Capitol Hill; we will  become recognized nationwide as an unparalleled resource for the United  States Congress; we will be a champion for public service and an  advocate on behalf of Congress; and we will create internal mechanisms  for maximum impact.   Sincerely, I want to thank Mark for his invaluable leadership on this  transitional, transformative undertaking, and I also want to thank my  colleagues for being so engaged in this exciting progress.   I include the Former Members of Congress' strategic plan for the  Record.        The United States Association of Former Members of Congress    (Cliff Stearns, President; Martin Frost, Vice President; Tim Petri,   Secretary; Karen Thurman, Treasurer; Barbara Kennelly, Past President)                                 introduction         We are engaged in a strategic planning process to deepen       the impact and shape of the future of the US Association of       Former Members of Congress--FMC. We continue to believe that       the current political climate and dysfunction is preventing       Congress from functioning at its highest possible level. This       condition has compelled FMC, a Congressionally chartered       501(c)(3) non-profit, to reevaluate its mission and identify       those opportunities that will deepen the positive       contribution we are making toward a more civil  [[Page H7577]]       and productive political discourse in our nation.        With the input of a bipartisan group of more than twenty       former Members over the summer, as well as staff and       ``friends of FMC'', we convened meetings in the fall of 2016       and early January 2017 to create a mission and strategic       themes for FMC that would serve us and our country well into       the future. Since that time, we have assembled staff to build       the comprehensive strategic plan we will deploy this year and       beyond.        Ahead, are the results-to-date of our collective efforts.                              Mission Statement         FMC is a bipartisan, nonprofit, voluntary alliance of       former Unites States Senators and Representatives, standing       for America's Constitutional system, which vests authority in       the people through their elected representatives.        FMC: Working to strengthen the Congress in the conduct of       its Constitutional responsibility through promoting a       collaborative approach to policy making.        FMC: Seeking to deepen the understanding of our democratic       system, domestically and internationally, and to encourage       the citizenry through civic education about Congress and       public service.    The 9 Strategic Themes Developed by Board of Directors, Senior Staff                           and Other Stakeholders         1) Embrace the whole ``Congressional Family''        2) Collaborative Partnerships        3) Community Outreach and Programming        4) Showcase Good Governance        5) Build our Brand        6) Elevate and Enhance Media Presence        7) Working Together for Congressional Success        8) Celebrate Bipartisanship        9) Build Bipartisan Relationships     The 4 Core Strategies Developed by Staff to Translate FMC's Mission                                into Action         1) Provide forums for dialogue that build and strengthen       relationships in support of a healthy representative       democracy.        2) Elevate and streamline our brand so that our accumulated       wisdom and convening power is recognized as a reputable and       unparalleled resource on the U.S. Congress.        3) Be a champion for public service that is based on       respect and collaboration.        4) Develop FMC for maximum impact and efficiency.   Core Strategy 1: provide forums for dialogue that build and strengthen       relationships in support of a healthy representative democracy         Purpose: Strengthen and expand existing programs that build       across-the-aisle relationships for current Members of       Congress as well as Congressional staff; showcase good       governance that is based upon bipartisanship and civility;       reconnect citizens with their representative democracy by       bringing Congress back into the community.        Specific Actions:        A. Programming. Redefine programming portfolios to fall       into easily recognizable categories, for example group all       exchange programs, group all Capitol Hill programs, group all       non-DC programs rather than current labels.        1) Build partnerships with like-minded organizations that       offer programs which align with FMC's mission.        2) Identify vital themes and streamline programming into       consistent and recognizable groups and develop cohesive       schedule of events        3) Streamline staff responsibilities and portfolios to       group programs in a more coherent way.        4) Expand Congress to Campus model to other constituencies       by marketing events better, incorporating social media and       modern technology such as an updated website, and using       modern technology to keep constituencies involved.        5) Make more concerted effort to have Statesmanship Awards       Dinner celebrate true bipartisanship and build coherent year-      round programming around event theme.        6) Increase public service element of annual and regional       meetings by incorporating FMC programming and telling FMC's       story to our own membership in a more compelling and cohesive       way, which will also aid in recruiting FMCs to be more       active.        7) Expand programming impact and ability to keep       constituents involved following a program by building a       cohesive schedule of events so that participants from one       event can continue their interaction with former Members via       a follow up event, for example a Congress to Campus visit is       followed up by a webinar.        8) Find ways to incorporate technology into every aspect of       FMC events, from marketing to registration, from tweets       during event to creating platforms for follow up.        B. Regional Outreach. Develop a comprehensive plan for       regional outreach to reach new constituencies.        1) Increase regional outreach based on FMC's themes, for       example bipartisanship or civics, and involve local media.        2) Incorporate as many FMC constituencies as possible into       a regional program, for example by combining a Congress to       Campus visit with a Congressional staff delegation, all       involving local former  Already, this work has had a tremendously positive  impact on us. I am extremely pleased to announce that, since our last  meeting, as a direct result of our strategic plan, we have secured  three new grants: the Democracy Fund; the Hewlett-Packard Foundation's  Madison Initiative; and just last week, the Japan-U.S. Friendship  Commission. These outstanding sponsors join our long-term partners with  whom we have worked for many years, including the Stennis Center for  Public Service Leadership, the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA, and The  German Marshall Fund of the United States.   In addition to this fundraising success, or more accurately because  of it, we have added four additional staff members to the Former  Members of Congress team, many of whom you will meet throughout the  day.   We have also launched a new program aimed at connecting, on a  bipartisan basis, current district directors from throughout the  country with each other to work together on specific issues and benefit  from hearing each other's best practices.   As you know quite well, district directors are at the very forefront  of our representative democracy and tend to be the first interaction  between a constituent and his or her Member. The district director  functions as a mediator, bridging the gap between the national policy  and the district's interest. But the very nature of being in the  district means that the congressional professionals do not have the  same opportunity their colleagues in D.C. have: to get to know their  counterparts in other offices, to work collaboratively on issues of  common concern, and to build a network of contacts among their peers.   Thanks to expanding on existing grants and winning new foundation  support, we have conducted a number of district director specific staff  delegation trips and now have brought together, under one umbrella,  dozens of district directors from all parts of the country and, of  course, on both sides of the political aisle. District director study  tours provide an exciting opportunity to build bipartisan  relationships, share best practices, and, with the international  travel, build transatlantic relationships.   In March, a bipartisan group of 10 district directors from around the  country traveled to Stuttgart, Germany, to study security issues, dual  vocational education and apprenticeships, trade, and foreign  investments.   In April, a bipartisan group of six district directors traveled to  Houston to learn about the energy industry and workforce development.   In June, a bipartisan group of six district directors went to Boston  and focused on the tech industry and education.   This October, another bipartisan group of six district directors will  be going to Iceland to focus on alternative energy, the environment,  and natural resources.   After all these trips, we can confirm that district directors greatly  appreciated and found immense value in the opportunity to not only  learn about the organized topic but to share the experience with other  district directors, particularly from the other side of the aisle.    One statement heard again and again, ``I have that same issue, what  did you do about it?'' These district directors through FMC have a  chance to really bond, regardless of what party, where in the country  they are from or what the demographics of their constituency is.   For 2018, we already have confirmed another district director trip to  Germany and to Japan. We also plan for other activities to engage  district directors, including possibly two more domestic trips and  invitations to all Former Members of Congress regional meetings.   Regional meetings are another outgrowth of our strategic plan. One  clear refrain of the strategic planning sessions that we had that  resonated loud  [[Page H7579]]  and clear was that we need to get outside of Washington more. If we are  going to be supportive of Congress, we need to make sure we are not a  voice just heard in D.C.   Former Members live outside of Washington. Current Members are  spending much more time in their districts. It is, therefore, critical  that we participate more outside of D.C. and with the congressional  staff that is outside.   Since our last report to Congress, we already have hosted three  regional meetings, with a fourth one planned for later this year. These  meetings are a day long and not only provide an opportunity for former  Members to come together, but we also provide them an opportunity to  share their knowledge and expertise with the younger generation by  building into our program outreach to a college campus, or a high  school, for example.   We were in Los Angeles late last year and included a meeting with  UCLA students. In April, we went to Chicago, where a group of former  Members held a panel for Northwestern students. In July, we visited  Boston, where a group of former Members and a visiting delegation of  district directors met with interns in the Massachusetts State House.   We have a regional meeting in Orlando on the schedule for November  7th and have arranged for a mini Congress to Campus visit to the  University of Central Florida. In addition to bringing together former  Members from the region, we extend invitations to State  Representatives, district directors, local academics, and others in the  congressional family.   We plan to crisscross the country with regional meetings so that we  can both engage our membership and meet their needs, as well as expand  our mission to deepen the understanding of our democratic process and  to engage the citizenry through civic education about Congress and  public service.   Our last new development should be highlighted: we are issuing to our  Members a call to action on the crucially important aspect of civic  education. We have formed a partnership with the Lou Frey Institute at  the University of Central Florida. As you are surely aware, civic  education has been one of the most important issues our dear friend Lou  Frey has worked on since leaving Congress, and his institute has become  a leading voice on this topic in my home State of Florida. Included in  this partnership is the Civic Mission of Schools, which works hand in  hand with the civic education initiative of Justice Sandra Day  O'Connor.   We envision an extremely active role for former Members to play at  the State level to be an advocate for civic education. Florida, of  course, is a great example on how civics can be restored if there is a  bipartisan consensus and commitment to make it happen.   In addition to this partnership, I am proud to share with you that we  are in the process of taking our highly successful model of the  international Congressional Study Groups and translating it for the  first time to a domestic issue: the Congressional Study Group on  Civics.   Our vision is to bring together, under our umbrella, the bipartisan  congressional family--Republicans and Democrats; former Members and  current Members; chiefs of staff currently working on the Hill and some  who left the Hill and are now in communities all over the country; and  our newest constituency, district directors for current Members--all of  us working together under the umbrella of the Congressional Study Group  on Civics to promote civic education and make a better understanding of  our representative democracy and a much greater knowledge base when it  comes to Congress and the work of Members of Congress. This new  undertaking is in the very beginning stages, and I look forward to  reporting to you next year on our progress.   One goal of this civic outreach is to remove the stigma that now is  attached to the word ``politician.'' John Buchan had a quote. He was an  English scholar; he wrote 42 books; he had numerous publications; he  was elected to parliament in England at the beginning of the 20th  century; and he was appointed Governor General of the Assembly in  Canada by the King.   This is what he said: ``Public life is regarded as the crown of a  career, and to young men and women, it is the worthiest of ambitions.  Politics is still the greatest and most honorable adventure.''   If our civic education outreach can reintroduce this appreciation of  public service in this next generation, then we will have succeeded.   Civic education and this commitment to reaching out to students  across the country are just two of the reasons we will honor our  colleague David Skaggs later today. I hope you all will join us during  our luncheon in David's honor as we recognize his exemplary service to  this country with our 2017 Distinguished Service Award.   As many of you know, David was an officer in the Marine Corps in  Vietnam before seeking public office. He served in the Colorado State  Legislature and, of course, here in the House of Representatives for  six terms. He now serves with Martin Frost and Vin Weber on the board  of the National Endowment for Democracy. He and his lovely wife, Laura,  will be with us during lunch today.   Before I yield to David to report on our Congress to Campus and  Civics projects, I hope all of you will join me in a round of applause  for our 2017 Distinguished Service honoree, David Skaggs.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and we are just delighted that  you took the time to come speak with us.   David, thank you very much for that excellent report. I very much  look forward to your remarks during lunch today.   My colleagues, as all of you know, our most active programming  involves current Members of Congress from both parties and from both  Chambers and, of course, our Congressional Study Groups. We conduct  programs focussing on Europe and Asia. We bring current Members of  Congress together with their peers and legislatures overseas, and we  work with our Department of State to talk about representative  democracy with audiences overseas, also.   Via the Former Members Association, I have met with numerous groups  of legislators from other democracies who come to Washington for a  better understanding of our representative government, our form of  democracy, and what is going on politically in the United States and on  Capitol Hill.   These conversations and meetings are always a two-way street, and I  learn as much, if not more, from our visitors as they do from me. Our  Association has a longstanding partnership with a great NGO called  Legacy International, bringing young professionals from the Middle East  and North Africa to the United States.   Our most recent group completed their 6-week D.C. stay earlier in the  year and was composed of young professionals from Tunisia and Morocco.  Most of these visitors worked in the NGO sector in their countries, and  they  [[Page H7581]]  came to the United States to learn about the interaction between  government and the nongovernmental sector. It is truly a very enriching  cross-cultural dialogue, and I am very pleased that FMC offers this  opportunity to our Members and to their visitors.   As I stated earlier, the main international activity of our  Association is housed with the Congressional Study Groups on Japan,  Germany, and Europe. These are our programs that involve current  Members of Congress as well as current senior congressional staff.   I now invite my good friend and predecessor, Connie Morella of  Maryland, to report on this aspect of our international work.    Thank you, Connie, very much for that report, and thank  [[Page H7582]]  you also for the continued leadership that you have provided for the  former Members of Congress. Your counsel is always appreciated and is  invaluable.   I now will lead to another former president of our Association,  Dennis Hertel of Michigan. Dennis, along with former Member Ken Kramer,  has been the driving force behind a program that is incredibly near and  dear to our hearts: our efforts to help severely wounded veterans  returning from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.   We do so via our annual charity golf tournament called The Members-- to avoid any confusion with The Masters--and we really have had a  tremendous impact.   Dennis.    Martin, thank you for that overview.   And, Dennis, thank you very much for that very impressive report. We  appreciate your leadership. You and Ken have given so much over the  years for this golf tournament. I can only echo your remarks about the  Statesmanship Awards Dinner, which will be held next year on March 21.   All the programs we have described, of course, require both  leadership and staff to implement. Our Association is blessed to have  top people in both categories. I simply want to take this opportunity  to thank our board of directors--over 30 former Members of Congress  divided equally between the parties--for their active advice and  counsel, and I really sincerely appreciate it.   I also want to thank the many partners and supporters we have to make  our programs possible. We are truly lucky to have assembled a group of  corporations and foundations that believe in our work and make our  success possible, and we very much value our partnership with them.   Also, I would be remiss if I did not thank the other members of our  Association's executive committee: our vice president, Martin Frost;  our secretary, Tom Petri; our treasurer, Karen Thurman; and our past  president, Barbara Kennelly.   You have all made this Association a much stronger organization and  much better than it was before, and I thank you, of course, for your  time and energy.   To administer all these programs takes a staff of dedicated and  enthusiastic professionals. It is just amazing to me how much we get  done with just a relatively small staff, and it is a testament to their  dedication and their capabilities how successful we have been because  of this.   Andy Shoenig and Rachel Haas left the Former Members of Congress  after many years of tremendous service, and we wish them both all the  best as they pursue their new opportunities. Andy is earning his  master's degree at the University of North Carolina, and Rachel found a  great new position with a firm much closer to home, though I am very  glad to see that she is with us this morning.   As I mentioned earlier, we have added four new staff members, and I  hope that throughout the day you will have an opportunity to meet them.  They are: Alia Diamond, who is working on our communications; Kathy  Hunter, helping us with development and membership; Patrick Egenhofer,  focused on the Congressional Study Group on Germany and some of our  domestic programs; and Paul Kincaid, who is our brand-new director of  Congressional Outreach, and his first day is today. We welcome all of  you.   The rest of our team that you have had a chance to work with over the  years are, and let me simply mention their names.   Alexis Terai, who is part of our international team and runs our  Congressional Study Group on Japan. She is fluent in Japanese, was  educated in the United States and abroad, and has been  [[Page H7584]]  the key component to making our Study Group on Japan the largest and  most active international exchange we offer to current Members of  Congress.   Lorraine Harbison is our International Programs Manager with main  focus on the European Program. In addition, she makes the Diplomatic  Advisory Council such a great success and has grown it from just a  handful of embassies to now over four dozen actively participating  Ambassadors.   Sharon Witiw is our director of community outreach and oversees the  smooth separation of projects such as the Congress to Campus program.  She is also in charge of creating the vision we have for our  Congressional Study Group on Civics, and you will be hearing from her  as programming for their projects commences next year.   Sabine Schleidt is our managing director who spends most of her time  on the current Member international programs, but also a lot of hours  on implementing the strategic vision and fundraising goals of our  Association. With our new hire of Paul Kincaid as director of  congressional outreach, Sabine's role will be much more focused on  development, strategy, and engaging our membership. She joined our  organization over 6 years ago, and, thanks to her creativity and her  simply can-do attitude, we have grown tremendously under her  leadership.   And lastly, Pete Weichlein is our chief executive officer, who has  been with the Association for over 18 years, first as a program  director, then as international program director, and, since 2003, as  our CEO. When you think about that, when he became the CEO, the Former  Members of Congress was in a dire financial situation, and, over the  years, he has taken this organization with his leadership to new  heights, and I think all of us really appreciate his efforts.   So all of you, if you would, please give an outstanding group of  professionals a big round of applause.   Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah.   I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome to Washington a  large delegation of former members of the European Parliament. As you  know, we have two incredibly meaningful and active global partnerships,  with our colleagues in Ottawa and our colleagues in Brussels. We often  coordinate programs, particularly democracy-strengthening projects, and  we exchange best practices. We are so thrilled to have them with us  today on the House floor. They are led by their president of the  Association of Former Members of the European Parliament, the Honorable  Enrique Baron Crespo. Thank you so much for coming, and we appreciate  your attendance.   Every year at our annual meeting, we ask the membership to elect new  officers and board members. I, therefore, now will read to you the  names of our candidates for board members and officers. They are  running unopposed; and I, therefore, will ask for a simple ``yea'' or  ``nay'' as I present to you the list of candidates as our slate.   For the Association's board of directors, the candidates are:   Jim Coyne of Pennsylvania   Byron Dorgan of North Dakota   Steve Horsford of Nevada   Ken Kramer of Colorado   Jim Matheson of Utah   Jim Moran of Virginia   Karen Thurman of Florida   Ed Whitfield of Kentucky   All in favor of electing these eight former Members to our board of  directors, please say ``yea.'' Any opposed? Hearing no opposition, the  slate has been elected by the membership.   Next, we will elect our executive committee. As president, I serve a  2-year term, which will end in 2018. However, the other three elected  members of the executive board are up for re-election to a 1-year term.  The candidates for our executive committee are:   Martin Frost of Texas for vice president   Tom Petri of Wisconsin for secretary   Karen Thurman of Florida for treasurer   All in favor of electing these three former Members to our executive  committee say ``yea.'' Any opposed? Hearing no opposition, the slate  has been elected by the membership. The executive committee is  completed by Barbara Kennelly, who is an unelected officer in  her capacity as immediate past president. Thank you.     I just want to thank Mr. Hoyer, the Democratic whip, for  his kindness in coming by to give his remarks, and we appreciate his  leadership and serving.   My colleagues, it is now my sad duty to inform the Congress of those  former Members and current Members who have passed away since our last  report.   As all of you know, at the conclusion of our annual meeting later  today, we will hold a memorial service in Statutory Hall starting at 6  p.m., where we will be joined by many of the families, as well as  current Members of Congress, to pay tribute to the public servants we  have lost.   In addition, it is altogether proper to recognize these  Representatives and Senators this morning here in the Chamber of the  House of Representatives.

Thank you.   My colleagues, this concludes the 47th Report to Congress by the  Association of Former Members of Congress.   Let me leave you with one final thought as we exit this historic  Chamber. David Hume, as you know, was a great political philosopher,  and this is what he said: ``Of all men that distinguish themselves by  memorable achievements, the first place of honor seems due to  legislators and founders of states who transmit a system of laws and  institutions to secure the peace, happiness, and liberty of future  generations.''   We thank the Congress, the Speaker, and the minority leader for  giving us the opportunity to return to this revered and beloved Chamber  and to report on our Association's activities. We look forward to  another active and productive year, and I want to thank all of you for  your attendance. Please join us for coffee and danishes in Room H-122  as we leave the Capitol.   God bless America.
