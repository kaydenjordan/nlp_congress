 Mr. President, I rise to encourage my colleagues to  rescind a recently promulgated regulation by the Obama administration  and to support the corresponding resolution of disapproval that the  majority leader just brought up and that we unanimously moved forward  to debate, H.J. Res. 69.   There are few, if any, people in the world who love their lands and  wildlife more than Alaskans. In Alaska, our land is the lifeblood that  sustains us, that feeds our bodies, our families, and our souls. It is  a deep and enduring part of our culture.   Our hunting traditions are very much alive in Alaska. Alaskans hunt  for food for cultural reasons and even for survival. There are people  in my State whose families have called our beautiful and rugged lands  home for thousands of years, living side-by-side with more recent  arrivals. Alaska has also the well-earned reputation of having one of  the best managed, most sustainable fish and game populations anywhere  in America or anywhere in the world, for that matter. We have an  abundance of wildlife that most States and most countries can only  dream of. We do this year after year, generation after generation,  through rigorous scientific processes that allow and encourage public  participation through our Board of Game, Board of Fisheries, and our  Fish and Game Department to make sure we manage our fish and game for  sustainability, as required by the Alaska constitution, and that we  take into account the needs of our citizens--the needs of Alaskans. It  is not an easy process. It can be contentious, but all Alaskans take  this very seriously.   In Alaska, we respect the land and everything in it. That special  connection and our ability to manage our own lands and resources was  explicitly recognized in Federal law when Alaska became a State. The  Alaska Statehood Act passed in this body in 1958, specifically granting  Alaska the authority to manage fish and wildlife on not only State  lands but on Federal lands, unless Congress passes a law to the  contrary. By the way, that is the same authority granted to all States.  It is granted to Ohio, New Mexico--all States in America have this  authority.   Further, in 1980, this body, the Congress of the United States,  passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, designating  100 million acres of land, in my great State, as Federal conservation  units, including over 70 million acres--I believe larger than the State  of New Mexico--as wildlife refuges in one State.   Many Alaskans didn't like this bill. Several saw this as a massive  Federal usurpation of our land, but our congressional delegation fought  to include explicit provisions in this Federal law that made it  abundantly clear that the State of Alaska still had primacy in managing  fish and game throughout the entire State--State lands and Federal  lands.   When that act was passed, it explicitly stated: ``Nothing in this act  is intended to enlarge or diminish the responsibility and authority of  the State of Alaska for the management of fish and wildlife on public  lands. . . .''   That is pretty clear language, and it is very important language to  Alaskans. ANILCA is the statute we are talking about, and that is what  we call it in Alaska. That Federal law that passed in 1980 made  numerous other commitments to Alaskans about how the Federal Government  would not usurp the power of the State or our citizens to live the life  we have in Alaska. How quickly the Feds forget. How quickly the Feds  forget what this law requires.   On August 5, 2016, the Obama administration's Fish and Wildlife  Service finalized a rule that, No. 1, restricted certain State-approved  fish and game management practices; No. 2, limited public input in the  wildlife management process; and, No. 3, expanded closure procedures on  refuges in Alaska, making it easier to keep people shut out of these  Federal lands in our State.   This rule is not based on sound science. Thousands of Alaskans and  other Americans opposed it, tried to work with the Feds to get them to  moderate it or rescind it, to no avail. It is not based on established  wildlife management principles, and it is certainly not based on  Federal law. The Fish and Wildlife Service didn't take this action  because Alaska's sustainable and abundant populations of fish and game  or their habitats were being threatened; it took this action because it  wanted to control Alaska's fish and wildlife and because it  subjectively disapproved of the way Alaska's game was being managed by  our Department of Fish and Game and by the Alaska Board of Game, but  the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service does not have this authority.    To make this clear, we are proceeding today with this resolution of  disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, H.J. Res. 69, to  rescind that August 5 Obama Fish and Wildlife Service rule.   The House has already passed this measure under Congressman Don  Young's leadership. So I want to encourage all of my colleagues,  Democrats and Republicans, to vote in favor of this resolution. It is  backed by the force of law, the principles of federalism, and respect  for the Alaskan Native people who have been hunting and fishing,  subsisting off the land in Alaska for generations. It is also supported  by millions of Americans across the country and wildlife professionals  in every State in the Union who are committed to the conservation of  the abundant species of wildlife in my home State and in theirs.   Why should my colleagues support rescinding this Fish and Wildlife  Service regulation? Well, first and foremost, as I have already  mentioned, it clearly usurps power from the States  [[Page S1865]]  and it ignores Federal law. Unfortunately, faced with a Federal law it  disagreed with, the Fish and Wildlife Service took the route other  Federal agencies have been taking over the years by simply writing a  reg to bypass the will of Congress and the American people, by simply  moving forward with their preferred policy preference via regulation  and ignoring the law. That is an issue every Member of this body,  whether you are a Democrat or Republican, should be concerned about and  vigilant to reverse.   It is not a partisan issue. It is a federalism issue. It is a States'  rights issue. That is why my State of Alaska, led by a Governor who is  an Independent and a Lieutenant Governor who is a Democrat, sued to  overturn the Obama administration's litigation. This litigation that my  State brought against the Federal Government cites Federal laws like  ANILCA, which declares that the State of Alaska ``has jurisdiction over  the management of fish and wildlife on public lands throughout the  State.'' That is the Federal law.   The law is clear, and of course it makes sense from a management  perspective. Alaska is a patch of many different ownerships of our  land--State, Federal, and Native lands. The moose and bear in our great  State don't know these borders. One agency needs to be in charge, and  that is the State agency.   While it might be true that this Obama administration regulation, as  written, only applies and impacts Alaska, it is a precedent that should  trouble every Member of this body and every State in the Union because  if it can be done in Alaska, it can be done anywhere. That is why the  Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, State agencies charged with  managing wildlife in all 50 States and territories from California, New  Mexico, to New Jersey all support this resolution. They all support  overturning the Obama administration's Fish and Wildlife reg. All 50  States, the people who know these issues, support what we are doing on  the Senate floor right now.   A second and related reason for the broad bipartisan support not only  in Alaska but across the country for rescinding this Fish and Wildlife  regulation is because it significantly reduces the public participation  in managing lands and wildlife in Alaska. Before this rule came out,  the harvest of fish and wildlife on Alaska refuges was governed by  Alaska's Board of Game and Board of Fish, and the process was highly  sensible. I have been to Board of Game meetings. It is open to the  public and responsive to the public, but this new regulation gives the  Federal Government a veto over State regulations issued by the boards,  with no public process and no public input.   The rule also makes closures of Federal lands subject more to the  whims of Federal officials than to the input of the people they serve.  It shuts down the public process, which is critical to the successful  stable management of fish and game in my State.   This Federal regulation also undermines subsistence. In Alaska,  ``subsistence'' isn't just a word, a catch phrase, or a slogan. It is  not what people do for the benefit of tourism. It is critical. The  public participation element is critical to the healthy management of  fish and game, and it also enables the professionals to learn from the  people--particularly the Native people in my State--what we call  traditional knowledge in Alaska. As I mentioned, ``subsistence'' in my  State isn't just a catch phrase or a slogan. Subsistence encompasses  the customary and traditional use of fish, wildlife, plant resources,  preserving cultural traditions, supplying basic necessities such as  food, firewood, and clothing. It provides for barter, trade, and income  for subsistence in the cash-based rural economy. It is serious business  in my State. Subsistence in Alaska is life, literally, and it has been  so for thousands of years. In so many of my State's villages, there is  no grocery store, there is no Costco, there is no Whole Foods market.  If one doesn't get a moose in the fall or have enough salmon in the  summer that someone catches, they might have trouble surviving in the  winter. This is serious business.   In other places in Alaska, where we do have small grocery stores, the  costs are often more than twice to four times the national average for  basic necessities. President Obama, when he visited Alaska in 2015,  went out to the rural communities, and once he saw it, he understood  this. When he came to Alaska, he said, ``You're looking at prices that  are double, in some cases, or even higher for basic necessities like  milk, like orange juice, like other produce. . . . That's part of the  reason why the subsistence economy [in Alaska] is so important.''   This is the former President of the United States making this  comment.   One wonders why this Fish and Wildlife Service then issued a reg that  attacked subsistence. But to be honest, most Americans and certainly  most Senators do not fully understand this. Again, due to the tenacity  of Alaska's congressional delegation--former Senators, such as Ted  Stevens, and current Members, such as Don Young in the House--Federal  law recognizes the importance of subsistence in Alaska.   The protection of subsistence rights in ANILCA and other Federal  legislation is listed throughout our Federal laws. Specifically, ANILCA  states:         The opportunity for rural residents engaged in a       subsistence way of life must continue to be so.    It further goes on to state that the Federal Government's actions in  Alaska should have ``the least adverse impact possible on rural  residents who depend on subsistence uses of the resources of such  lands.''   This issue of subsistence is important to thousands of my  constituents. It is not a theoretical issue, it is critical, but it is  now more important to the Alaska Native populations in my State, which  is close to 20 percent of my State.   In 2014, the Alaska Federation of Natives ratified a resolution that  criticized a proposal from the Federal Government that was similar to  the one we are debating today, and they stated the following in their  resolution:         Alaska Natives have served as the stewards of their       traditional lands and resources, maintaining healthy and       productive ecosystems for thousands of years, and maintain       the belief that human beings are an integral part of       naturally functioning ecosystems, not separate from them.    That is what all Alaskans believe. Yet, despite Federal laws that  emphasize the importance of subsistence to all Alaskans and pleas and  letters from hundreds of Alaska Natives who ask the Federal Government  not to negatively impact their subsistence way of life and  opportunities with this new Fish and Wildlife Service regulation, the  Fish and Wildlife Service persisted. They promulgated this regulation  in the face of opposing voices in Alaska and Federal law that says they  do not have the authority to do this.   You know it is targeted for subsistence because in the Fish and  Wildlife Service's initial rule, that rule stated that the law and the  policy had to ``take into consideration the fact that humans are  dependent on wildlife refuge subsistence resources.'' That was the  original draft rule. Subsistence matters. That was in there, a nod to  Federal law. Guess what happened with the final rule? That entire  section on subsistence was removed by the Federal Government, which  showed that this law is an anti-subsistence law, which violates Federal  law. They did not want Alaskans to subsist off their lands as required  by Federal law.   Alaska's attorney general, Jahna Lindemuth, who was appointed by an  Independent Governor from my State, said:         These federal regulations are not about . . . protecting       the State's wildlife numbers. These regulations are about the       federal government trying to control Alaskans' way of life.    Hunting is a way of life in Alaska. The Presiding Officer is a hunter  and understands that it is cultural and that it provides subsistence  and even protection for our citizens.   Let's be clear. The Fish and Wildlife regulation at issue today,  which we are debating, is an anti-hunting rule, pure and simple. That  this is the case became very clear when the former Fish and Wildlife  Service Director, Dan Ashe, who promulgated this regulation, questioned  the ethics of our hunters in Alaska in a Huffington Post column. He  said that some of Alaska's practices are ``wholly at odds with  America's long tradition of ethical, sportsmanlike, fair-chase  hunting.'' That is from the former Fish and Wildlife Service Director.  One knows where he is coming from on this.   Along these lines, I anticipate some of my colleagues on the other  side of  [[Page S1866]]  the aisle--I see one of them down here already--are going to come down  and start touting this parade of horribles, spurred on by anti-hunting  groups to convince our colleagues to vote against this resolution of  disapproval--what we want to have passed. You might hear phrases from  them like Alaska's practices constitute a ``war on wolves'' or a  ``black eye for ethical hunters,'' with the implication that my  constituents are not ethical hunters. One might even see my colleagues  repeat the false and misleading claims that have been run on TV by  certain groups about alleged unethical hunting and game management  practices in Alaska. I would like to make a suggestion or two to my  colleagues who are coming down here to speak against this resolution of  disapproval.   First, please let them try to do so with a sense of humility and a  sense of history. Yes, one or two of them may have been accomplished  hunters in their own right or are still accomplished hunters in their  own right. I respect that. I love to hunt. But that does not mean one  has as much or any knowledge or understanding of my State's long  history and distinguished record of fish and game management. One might  prefer his meat wrapped in cellophane at the grocery store. That is  fine, but I ask that one doesn't criticize the thousands of Alaskans  who have to hunt for their food and who value hunting as a deep part of  their culture.   I would also caution one from making claims that Alaska's wildlife  officials allow for unethical hunting and management practices that  require the Federal Government to intervene in my State's long history  of distinguished fish and game management. Such an argument would be at  odds with the consistent and numerous awards the State of Alaska has  received for its outstanding management of fish and game year after  year after year--American Fishery Society awards, awards from the  Department of the Interior, the Wildlife Society, and the Association  of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. Those who manage wildlife in Alaska are  the best in their field. It is not just Alaskans who take issue or who  will take issue with such statements that I am sure we are going to  hear on the floor.   Let me read a list of hunting and conservation groups that support  this resolution of disapproval, groups that, in other words, support  the overturning of the Fish and Wildlife rule at issue today. It is a  very long list, and it is actually longer than this: Ducks Unlimited,  National Wild Turkey Federation, Pheasants Forever, Quail Forever,  Boone and Crockett Club, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, Delta  Waterfowl Foundation, Alaska Outdoor Council, Alaska Professional  Hunters Association, American Outfitter and Guide Association,  Territorial Sportsmen, National Rifle Association, Safari Club  International. The list goes on and on.   These groups represent millions of hunters, conservationists,  wildlife enthusiasts, and wildlife scientists who represent millions of  Americans who are focused on the model of conservation that we all are  supportive of, and they are the backbone of habitat and species  conservation in our country. These groups--every one of them--are  supportive of what we are trying to do on the Senate floor today. These  groups certainly do not consider themselves unethical hunters. To the  contrary, they care deeply about conservation and abundant wildlife  populations not only for themselves but for the generations of  Americans to come, and they have dedicated their lives to this. They  represent Americans from across the 50 States--Montana, West Virginia,  New Mexico, New Jersey. Their values, like the values held by Alaskans  with regard to conservation and hunting, should not be doubted and I  certainly hope are not going to be attacked on the Senate floor.   In closing, I believe in respectful and informed debate. Sometimes it  certainly requires reaching beyond one's own experience to listen to  others with opposing views. I took the opportunity to do that just the  other day. I had a conversation with the president and CEO of the  Humane Society about the issue and resolutions we are discussing today.  I know that he and others are leading the opposition to this, but we  had a very respectful conversation. We heard each other's views, and  although we likely will not agree on this issue, I hope he felt that I  talked to him with respect and listened to him because that is what I  did.   Perhaps my colleagues who are going to speak against this resolution  today should do the same. I would hope that those who come down to the  floor to oppose overturning this rule would have picked up the phone  and maybe called Alaska's Department of Fish and Game, or talked to a  biologist there, or maybe talked to the chairman of the Board of Game  and asked if he is an ethical hunter, or maybe called a store in remote  Alaska to ask about food prices, or made some inquiries about the lack  of stores in dozens of villages that rely on subsistence, or called an  Alaska Native leader to see how important subsistence is to his life  and his culture.   Maybe my colleagues would have called one of my constituents who  wrote in opposing this rule. He is an Alaska Native who lives in rural  Alaska and whose grandfather taught him to hunt and fish. Here is what  he wrote to us:         Please do not pass these types of regulations that will       change my future. These lands are dear to Alaska Natives, and       I feel that some of the Fish and Wildlife workers are biased       as well as listening to the wrong people. By the ``wrong       people,'' I mean Fish and Wildlife officials who do not       understand my subsistence rights, who do not work in the       villages, who want to take away my right to hunt.    This is about the rule of law, primacy, federalism, and it is about  much more than that; it is about real people--people like my  constituents.   I urge my colleagues to support our resolution of disapproval and  rescind this regulation that violates the law, undermines subsistence  in Alaska, and will do harm to my State and other States.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.    Mr. President, in spite of what my good friend from New  Mexico has been saying about this resolution, I encourage my colleagues  to vote in favor of the resolution.   I came down here predicting that he was going to come down with a  parade of horribles, none of which have happened in Alaska--that is a  fact--none of which happened in Alaska.   The resolution we have before us is backed by the force of law. The  Fish and Wildlife Service did not have the authority to do what they  did by passing this regulation, and not one of my colleagues tried to  defend this on the basis of legal authority by the Feds because it  doesn't exist. So I think that is the starting point.   The principle of federalism. We have had a lot of discussion here by  colleagues from New Jersey and New Mexico telling Alaskans, who have a  tremendous record on the management of fish and game--they are going to  tell Alaskans how to do that, Senators from States that don't know  anything about my State. That is the whole principle of federalism, and  that is another reason we need to support this resolution.   This rule is about subsistence. Thousands of Alaskans, particularly  Alaskan Natives, rely on subsistence. Again, my colleagues on the other  side come down here and say that it is not about subsistence. Come up  to Alaska. Ask the people who have to live off the land, who need the  food to survive in the winter. Tell them it is not about subsistence.   Finally, it is important to recognize just how many other Americans  care about what we are doing right now. As I mentioned, literally  millions of Americans from every State of the country, represented by  groups as diverse as Ducks Unlimited, Boone and  [[Page S1884]]  Crockett, and the National Rifle Association, are all supportive of  this resolution, as are every Fish and Wildlife Service State agency,  including from New Mexico, including from New Jersey. They are all  supportive of our resolution.   To have our colleagues come down here and say ``Those Alaskans don't  know what they are doing'' when we have the record of well-managed fish  and game, awards every year from the Department of the Interior and  others--to have them come down here with very little knowledge of my  State is not the humility that I think is needed in this body.   So I ask all my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution. It is  backed by law. It is backed by millions of Americans in every State. It  is very important to the people of Alaska, particularly those who live  a subsistence lifestyle.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   Mr. President, I yield back the time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority time is yielded back.   All time is yielded back.   The joint resolution was ordered to a third reading and was read the  third time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to mention that I am very  gratified by my colleagues--by the way, on both sides of the aisle. It  was a bipartisan vote. H.J. Res. 69, as the Presiding Officer just  mentioned, has passed the Senate and will soon be going to the White  House for a signature by President Trump. That is a resolution--now a  law--that will be heading to the White House. It is not just important  for Alaska, but, as the Presiding Officer and I were talking about, for  any American who believes in federalism, State control over our land,  and the Tenth Amendment. That is what was at stake.   For my State a lot more was at stake--subsistence rights, the ability  to continue to hunt in the ways that we have been doing for generations  in Alaska. So I just want to thank all the Alaskans--hundreds-- including the State of Alaska Board of Game, the Alaska Department of  Fish and Game, our Governor and his attorney general, who filed suit  against the Federal Government over this issue. Obviously, it is all  going to be resolved right now, right here, because of this vote.   I want to thank all the Alaskans who played such an important role,  the groups that I talked about in my remarks outside of Alaska that  represent millions of Americans--the conservationists, the people who  love the outdoors, and hunters who also weighed in and in a very  powerful way to make sure that this resolution passed. So I want to  thank them all.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1228, which was received  from the House.
