 Mr. Chair, as the designee of Mr. Nehls, I have an  amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would reduce the salary of  [[Page H5522]]  Ann Carlson, who is the acting administrator of the National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration, to $1.   While we abhor her radical climate change agenda, questionable ethics  investigation, and overall policy decisions, the reason for my  amendment is because Ms. Carlson is serving as acting administrator  after she failed to clear the Senate confirmation process for the  position.   In March of 2023, the Biden administration submitted Ms. Carlson's  nomination for the National Highway Traffic Safety administrator.  Before the Senate could vote on her nomination and after Senator Cruz  led an effective opposition, the White House pulled her nomination once  it was obvious that she was not going to be confirmed.   After the Senate effectively rejected her nomination, the White House  nominated her to that same role as an acting official anyway,  circumventing the Advice and Consent clause in the United States  Constitution on Presidential nominations.   I view this as a constitutional overreach and a violation of the  Federal Vacancy Reform Act, and so do our counterparts in the Senate.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in September of this year, 13 Republican  Commerce Committee Senators sent a letter to President Biden urging him  to immediately replace Ms. Carlson and appoint a new nominee.   The letter highlights that since Ms. Carlson's nomination is a  violation of the Federal Vacancy Reform Act, all the agency's actions  while she has held herself out as acting administrator should be  voided.   This is an unacceptable situation for the Department of  Transportation. Congress represents a coequal branch of government, and  this administration isn't a monarchy. Congress must hold this  administration accountable, and I urge all Members to vote for my  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of Mr. Nehls from Texas, I  have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would prohibit funds being  made available for the Federal Transit Administration's Electric or  Low-Emitting Ferry Pilot Program.   This $250 million program simply serves to further Joe Biden's  radical climate change agenda and fund Green New Deal pet projects to  support coastal elitists in blue States.   As an example, the San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency  Transportation Authority received $3.4 million to construct a new zero- emissions ferry. The Casco Bay Island Transit in Portland, Maine,  received $3.6 million to replace a passenger ferry with a new ferry  equipped with a diesel hybrid propulsion system. The Kitsap Transit in  Kitsap County, Washington, received $7.7 million to replace a diesel  vessel with a new, environmentally friendly battery-electric passenger- only ferry and necessary charging infrastructure.   Mr. Chairman, I could go on and on. This is not the taxpayers' burden  to bear these individual pet projects that I just named.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, those words are just another banner of pet  projects. This is what the public is sick and tired of in this country,  especially when we are $33 trillion in debt.   Overall, ferries play a minor role in the United States  transportation system, providing roughly 1 percent of the public  transportation trips in 2019--1 percent. The Infrastructure Investment  and Jobs Act more than tripled the annual dedicated ferry funding,  setting aside $2.3 billion, with a b, for ferry funding.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, stop  this boondoggle, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment reduces the salary of Julia  Gordon, who is the Assistant Secretary for Housing and the Federal  Housing Commissioner, to $1.  [[Page H5523]]    Ms. Gordon has a long history of anti-police rhetoric that makes her  unfit for public office. Among other things, she retweeted an  inflammatory post that described police officers as ``the people  killing us.''   She also suggested in a letter that she wrote--not a tweet or a  retweet--that cases of police violence are not just outliers but ``. .  . stem from flawed and biased systems that require structural change.''   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in response, it is her words that are  inflammatory in a day and time that is uncalled for. My view is shared  by the National Sheriffs' Association, a leading law enforcement group  that opposed her nomination.   Ms. Gordon also has a troubling history of denigrating her fellow  Americans residing in southern States, as I do. She retweeted an  article that asserted the South has rejected nearly everything that is  good about this country and has become just one big nuclear waste site  of extremely radicalized resentment. That is unheard of.   We should not spend another dollar on paying her salary. By the way,  she makes $158,500, and when you add all the other things with it, she  is probably closer to $200,000.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment, and I yield  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment prohibits use of funds for the  consideration of the social cost of greenhouse gases--and I don't know  how they define social costs--in the development and implementation of  budgets, Federal procurement, or environmental reviews.                                time  1900    President Biden is directing agencies to consider the flawed social  cost of greenhouse gases in the development and implementation of  budgets, the Federal procurement process, and environmental reviews.   Democrats use the social cost of greenhouse gases metrics to justify  sweeping climate policies and strict regulations. This impacts  everything from purchasing goods and services, conducting environmental  reviews of all kinds, and levying climate penalties against private  businesses.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Mr. Chair, as Sheriff Rutherford said, the social cost of  greenhouse gases is an extremely inefficient policymaking tool that can  be manipulated.   The Biden administration continues to use unproven figures to attempt  to  [[Page H5524]]  justify its radical environmental policies that drive up the cost of  every family in this country today.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment prohibits the use of funds for  the implementation of the rule entitled ``Equal Access in Accordance  with an Individual's Gender Identity in Community Planning and  Development Programs.''   My amendment defunds an Obama administration's Housing and Urban  Development rule that requires equal access for individuals in  accordance with their gender identity in shelter programs that are  funded from HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development. This  means women and young children can be housed in shelters with a male  stranger simply because these men identify as women.   Mr. Chairman, think about the impact this has on residents of female- only shelters when men who claim to be women are allowed to share  bathrooms and shower access.   These concerns are not hypothetical. In California, nine homeless  women filed a civil complaint after a homeless shelter enabled sexual  harassment because a male identifying as a female entered the shelter  and showered with a woman. In Alaska, a faith-based shelter filed a  lawsuit because female residents would rather sleep in the woods in  extremely cold temperatures than get harassed alongside a biological  male.   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, it is amazing we even have to debate this.  It just shows that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle support  the perpetrators of the crime rather than the victims of the crime.   Forcing women and children to share their private spaces with  biological men is wrong. It is dangerous in any setting, but especially  in a setting as intimate and vulnerable as a homeless shelter.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).    Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Ogles), I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, my amendment prohibits funds from being  [[Page H5525]]  used to purchase or lease a vehicle for use by the Secretary of  Transportation.   Two years ago, Secretary Buttigieg was gifted with a taxpayer-funded  Mustang Mach-E for dedicated use. The retail value of this electric SUV  was valued at more than $40,000 and proudly assembled in Detroit,  Michigan, USA, the auto capital of the world.   No. I am just kidding.   The Ford Mustang Mach-E has since been recalled for battery issues.  Apparently the battery cannot handle owners flooring it. It was made in  Mexico by foreign workers.   Putting aside the Secretary's own tone-deaf decision to use  taxpayers' funds to purchase a not-made-in-America vehicle, Mr.  Buttigieg's noted proclivity for the finer things in life apparently  extended to any mode of transportation.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Ogles), I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, if there is one thing that my colleagues,  Republican or Democrat, can agree on, it is that government corruption  undermines faith in our Republic, and none more than this present  administration.   It would, therefore, be astounding to see or hear any Democrat  attempt to justify opposition to this simple amendment that would  prohibit funds for air travel by the Secretary of Transportation, or  any other, in economy class on a commercial flight.   In February, we learned that the Office of Inspector General at the  Department of Transportation was opening an audit into Secretary  Buttigieg's extensive use of private jets. Despite the Secretary's own  rhetoric on the need to combat global warming, in the first 2 years of  the Biden administration, Mr. Buttigieg took at least 18 flights using  taxpayer-funded private jets.   Make no mistake, there is no excuse for Secretary Buttigieg to waste  taxpayers' money on private planes when commercial options were readily  available to him.   Mr. Chair, I urge passage of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of Mr. Ogles, I have an  amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, access to affordable, reliable cars and trucks  is critical to every facet of American life.   Instead of ensuring that Americans have access, the Biden  administration has included a multifront fight against the internal  combustion engine as a centerpiece of its war on American consumers.   On this front, it is the new corporate average fuel economy  standards, known as CAFE, for 2027 to 2032, which ratchet fuel economy  standards to require automakers to meet a fleet average of 58 miles per  gallon.   You might as well put a top on a riding mower. Good luck with trying  to get that kind of mileage.   Based on EPA's list of most efficient vehicles, no vehicle for model  year 2023, even including the small hybrids, reaches 58 miles per  gallon. A bicycle would probably be over 58 miles per gallon. There is  no path to reaching a fleet average, which would include larger  vehicles, that high in less than 10 years.   These standards will fail to increase actual vehicle efficiency  because automakers already know that the goal is unachievable, and they  won't waste their time trying to comply.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this is more than just words. This is going to  force American taxpayers to pay fines for falling short, which will  increase the price of any new car with an internal combustion engine by  thousands of dollars.   Biden has made it clear all along that his goal isn't to improve gas- powered cars but to eliminate them in favor of electric vehicles. If  you talk to any car dealer, no one is buying them. Unless they had  subsidies, they wouldn't be selling.   For many drivers, EVs simply aren't a viable option. They may not  have a garage and may rely on street parking. They may live in an area  where the electric infrastructure can't support the fast charging of an  EV. They may drive long distances where, when you run out of  electricity, good luck.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  [[Page H5526]]
