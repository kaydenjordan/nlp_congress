 Madam Speaker, no American will ever  forget what happened to us, to our Nation, 18 years ago. We remember  exactly where we were and what we were doing when we watched the  tragedy of September 11 unfold.   But we also recount how, in the midst of fear and uncertainty, so  many Americans acted as heroes and gave of themselves for the sake of  their country and their city to help their fellow human beings.   The darkness of that day did not prevail. An attack meant to bring us  to our knees instead brought us together and prompted a generation of  protectors--airmen, soldiers, sailors, Coast Guard, and marines--to  rise up in defense of freedom and in pursuit of peace.   As we commemorate the tragedy of September 11, we pray for the  families of the fallen in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania; we  give thanks for the bravery of first responders who ran toward the  burning buildings and away from safety; we honor the men and women  whose last moments were committed to love of country and their fellow  human beings; and we pray for the safety of those men and women still  deployed throughout the world on the mission that began that day.    While we hope never again to endure the suffering that day brought,  it continues to inspire all of us to be selfless for the greater good  of our country which unites us all.   I commend the communities in North Carolina's Fifth District and  around the country who are commemorating 9/11 and taking up service  projects in remembrance of September 11 on what has become our National  Day of Service.   May God continue to bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
