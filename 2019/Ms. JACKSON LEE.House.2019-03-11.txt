 Mr. Speaker, every year, the vision of this Nation  is crafted in the budget that is offered either by the President or the  United States Congress.   As a member of the Budget Committee, I am delighted that our theme  will be ``For the People.'' But today, sadly, I think it is important  to note that the President offered a budget that disregarded the  American people: $2.7 trillion in spending cuts coming from the very  bases that make America the greatest country in the world; 12 percent  cutting in education, your children's education; 12 percent cutting  healthcare from the Department of Health and Human Services; 11 percent  cutting from Interior, your parks and museums and monuments; 23 percent  cutting from diplomacy, from the State Department and international  health; 32 percent from the Environmental Protection Agency, the  quality of water and air; and 22 percent to decrease mobility in this  Nation, all these dollars coming from what we call domestic spending,  with increased spending in other areas where individuals are not  protected.   We will protect the people. The For the People budget will be  designed by Democrats.                            ____________________
