 Mr. Speaker, I rise today gravely concerned about the  passage of H.R. 21.   Texas' hardworking families sent me to Washington to represent them  in good faith, and dozens of them fear the passage of this bill.   My constituents are working every single day to make ends meet and  took time out of their day to share their fears of this bill becoming  law.   Why?   Because this Republican bill will raise costs on working families  across the country.   When Hurricane Gustav hit my home State of Texas, key energy supplies  went offline, and we relied on the quick response from the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve to avoid catastrophe.   The SPR has been used countless times to keep the lights on during  emergencies. H.R. 21 will make it impossible for our government to  quickly respond to emergencies, leaving Americans abandoned in the dark  when they are most in need.   After going a week without electing a Speaker, I think Congress  should get its own House in order before trying to claim the powers of  the President or interfere with the energy market.                            ____________________
