 Wow. Mr. Speaker, you have no idea how great this feels  to be back here at work in the people's House.   As you can imagine, these last 3\1/2\ months have been pretty  challenging times for me and my family. But if you look at the  outpouring of love, of warmth, of prayer, my gosh, Jennifer and I have  been overwhelmed with all of that outpouring. It has given us the  strength to get through all of this and to get to this point today, and  it starts with God.   When I was laying out on that ball field, the first thing I did once  I was down and I couldn't move anymore is, I just started to pray. And  I will tell you, it gave me an unbelievable sense of calm knowing that  at that point it was in God's hands.   But I prayed for very specific things, and I will tell you, pretty  much every one of those prayers was answered. There were some pretty  challenging prayers I was putting in God's hands, but He really did  deliver for me and my family. And it just gives you that renewed faith  and understanding that the power of prayer is something that you just  cannot underestimate. So I am definitely a living example that miracles  really do happen.   The first place I want to go to thank true angels along the way  starts with the United States Capitol Police. When I was elected  majority whip, as you know, the elected leadership has a security  detail, and if anybody ever wondered why we are assigned security  detail, I surely found out that day.   Let me tell you, I want to specifically mention Crystal Griner and  David Bailey. Crystal and David were assigned to my security detail  that morning. Day in and day out, they are part of our family. Jennifer  and I truly do treat them as part of our family because they are with  us everywhere we go. On that day, it was no different.   On June 14, they came at 6:30 in the morning. We arrived at the  baseball field just to play and practice for a game of charity  baseball. Nobody would have suspected what ensued, and yet, as soon as  those shots were fired--I will tell you, when I was laying on the  ground, one of the things I prayed for was that David and Crystal would  be successful in carrying out their duties.   Both David and Crystal are incredibly well-trained and incredibly  professional. But when I was laying there, not long after the first  couple of shots were fired, I could hear a different caliber of weapon.  That told me that they had immediately engaged the shooter. Let me tell  you, if they didn't act so quickly--even after being shot both  themselves, they continued to engage the shooter and ultimately got him  down, which not only saved my life, but saved the lives of a lot of  other people that are here in this Chamber today.   Crystal couldn't be with us today, but David Bailey is with us.  David, you are my hero. You saved my life. Thank you so much. Tiger  blood.   I also owe thanks to a lot of the people who were on the field with  me. Right after the shooter was down, a lot of my colleagues came and  ran to come check on me. One I want to mention in particular is one of  those things that Jennifer and I call the little miracles that happened  that day and throughout the next few months of our recovery.   We happened to have Brad Wenstrup on the field that day, and he was  one of the first to come to my side. As you know, Brad is not only a  doctor, but he is a decorated Army Ranger who served in combat. And one  of his roles and missions was to take care of people that were wounded  before they went off on the helicopter to go get prepared. Who would  have thought that God would have put Brad out there on that field with  me because the tourniquet he applied, many will tell you, saved my life  so that I could actually make it to the hospital in time with all of  the blood loss. So, Brad, where are you at? Right down in front.   Once I arrived at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, I was a little  bit out of it at that point. But luckily, I ended up in the trusted  hands of Dr. Jack Sava and his great team over at MedStar. They gave me  a second chance at life. Through many, many surgeries, where my life  was truly in the balance in a few of those, they did a wonderful job at  making sure that I was well taken care of and, ultimately, made it  through that point so I could get to Dr. Golden and his team who  actually put me back together again, which was quite a task, to the  point where I am actually able to relearn how to walk again. So, Dr.  Sava, Dr. Golden, thank you for being here and thanks for your team's  work.   Above all else, I want to thank my lovely wife, Jennifer. Those of  you who know her know how strong Jennifer is. She is an incredibly warm  and loving wife, and she is an incredible mother to our children.  Somehow, through the late nights and the surgeries and all of the other  things, she managed to hold our family together, to make sure that  Harrison and Madison were cared for as well. Still, to this day, she is  not only by my side, but she is also serving as a great mother. I am  lucky to have you. Thanks for being here. I love you, Sweetheart.    While it has been a challenging time for my family, the thing that  really  [[Page H7613]]  overwhelmed us from the start was the outpouring of love and warmth and  prayers. From southeast Louisiana, the district that I represent, we  saw blood drives at St. Catherine of Siena Parish. We saw prayer groups  at First United Methodist Church in Slidell.   But what we also saw were prayer groups and well-wishes being given  from people that we never met before throughout all of your districts.  You shared it with me, and it was one of those things that was hard for  us to completely comprehend that you had people from all walks of life  that had never met me before, and yet, they saw what had happened and  they just wanted to offer prayers.   Let me tell you, to each and every one of you--and please convey it  to your constituents, and I sure convey it to my constituents back  home--that warmth and love gave us just incredible strength that you  can't imagine during some really, really difficult times. So that is  one more example of the power of prayer.   Something else I saw firsthand wasn't a surprise to me, but it was  the outpouring of love from you, my colleagues, both Republican and  Democrat. I know right after the shooting--we were practicing on the  Republican side and the Democrats were practicing too--my colleague and  friend, and sometimes archrival in baseball from back home in New  Orleans--unfortunately, the star of the game too many times--Cedric  Richmond somehow figured out which hospital I was sent to, and he got  there. He was probably the first person there on the scene, in his  baseball uniform, to check on me.   So many others of you, again, both Republican and Democrat, reached  out in ways that I can't express the gratitude and how much it means to  me, Jennifer, and our whole family. It really does show the warm side  of Congress that very few people get to see.   I want to thank each and every one of you for that. You don't know  how much it meant to me. When I came back into this Chamber here today,  just seeing the faces of all of you, it just means more to me than you  can imagine. So thanks for all of that love and support.   A lot of people ask: Did the event change you? And I think those of  you who know me know I am an optimistic person. I am just a fun-loving  person. I am from south Louisiana, and we believe you work hard and you  play hard and joie de vivre.   Is an event like this really going to change that? The first thing I  can tell you is, yes, it changed me, but not in the ways you might  think. It has only strengthened my faith in God, and it has really  crystallized what shows up as the goodness in people. I got to see that  goodness in people.   While some people might focus on a tragic event and an evil act, to  me, all I remember are the thousands of acts of kindness and love and  warmth that came out of this and kept me going through all of it and,  again, just reemphasized just how wonderful most people are and how  much compassion there is out there.   Finally, I want to talk about something that I guess hit me and  probably struck me more than anything that I was not expecting, and  that was the outpouring of love and support from world leaders, people  I have met and have known. Benjamin Netanyahu and I have had some  incredible conversations from the hospital. And Theresa May, King  Abdullah of Jordan--leaders that so many of us have met--reached out.  But other world leaders also reached out, people I had never met  before.   That touched me in a different way because each and every one of us,  we come here and we fight for the things that we believe in. I have  passionate beliefs. For some reason, some of you don't agree with all  of those. But it is so important that we come up here. We are the  people's House. This is the place where these ideas are supposed to be  debated, and we fight through those issues. But, ultimately, we come  together on whatever the board shows is 218. If you can put the  majority together, that is what rules the day. It is so important that,  as we are having those political battles, we don't make them personal.   One of the things I saw--and I guess this is the thing that really  kept coming back to me--is I tried to make sense of all of this. In  comprehending the outpouring of love that I saw, it kept coming back to  those world leaders. Why would leaders from around the world that I had  never met before reach out and say: ``Steve, we hope you can get back  to work. We hope you can come through this.''?   And what it says is, sure, they cared about my wellbeing, but more  than that, they saw this as an attack on all of us. They saw this as an  attack on the institution of the United States Congress and our  government. And they really count on us to be successful.   Look, we all know the United States is the leader of the free world.  It is something that we have, frankly, had the honor as a country to  hold as a distinction for generations. And yet, when you look at that  title, what it really means is, is that there are people all around the  world that want freedom, maybe that have freedom, but they know the  United States being strong is critical to the rest of the world having  the opportunity for freedom.   That is why I am so excited to be back because, as we are fighting  through the issues of the day, let's just keep in mind that we rise  above the challenges of the day and understand that it is not just us  and our constituents and the country, the United States, that is  counting on our being successful. People all around the world who  believe in freedom are counting on us as well, and we will deliver for  them. That is why I am so honored to be back here in the House serving  with you.   God bless each and every one of you, and God bless the United States  of America.   (By unanimous consent, Ms. PELOSI was allowed to speak out of order.)
