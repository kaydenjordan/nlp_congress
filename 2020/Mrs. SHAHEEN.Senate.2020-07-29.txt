 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. John  Ruairidh ``Ru'' Morrison, chief of Clan Morrison, as he steps down from  his position as the founding executive director of the Northeast  Regional Association of  [[Page S4580]]  Coastal Ocean Observing Systems, NERACOOS. During his 10 years at  NERACOOS, Dr. Morrison has been a visionary in the world of ocean  observing for the people of New Hampshire, the Northeast, and this  country. I know I speak for so many others when I say that we are  deeply grateful and thank him for his service.   Originally from Scotland, Ru became a true advocate for New Hampshire  when he began his position as an assistant research professor at the  University of New Hampshire in 2003. During his tenure at UNH, Ru was  an inspirational teacher whose work advanced the science of remote  sensing. A primary focus of his efforts centered on building a better  understanding of Great Bay, a resource that many in New Hampshire  consider to be a cornerstone of our coastal environment.   When Ru transitioned to NERACOOS in 2009, he brought with him his  extensive knowledge of marine science and technology, the coastal and  ocean environment, and, most importantly, his collaborative nature,  which was instrumental in establishing a successful regional ocean  observing system. NERACOOS, 1 of 11 regional associations of the U.S.  Integrated Ocean Observing System--IOOS--addresses the ocean monitoring  and forecasting needs of the people of the Northeast.   As executive director of NERACOOS, Ru's charisma and outgoing nature,  coupled with his ocean science expertise, allowed him to bring together  scientists, resource managers, fishermen, NGOs, and the public into a  system notable for its espirit de corps. My staff and I all have many  fond memories of joining him for boat rides on Great Bay to get a  firsthand look at NERACOOS's work on the estuary. Anyone who's worked  with Ru can attest to his warmth, wit, and self-deprecating sense of  humor, which made working with him and NERACOOS a real pleasure.   Over the past decade, Ru has grown the organization's prominence and  expanded collaborations among its many users. Even more impactful,  though, is a decade's worth of Ru's infectious enthusiasm, which  invigorated the organization and its stakeholders alike. Under Ru's  stewardship, NERACOOS became a morning ritual for fishermen preparing  for their day at sea, and with the formation of the Northeast Coastal  Acidification Network--NECAN--NERACOOS has become a national leader in  facilitating regional responses to changing ocean chemistry.   Ru's influence extends far beyond his backyard. He is the past chair  of the IOOS Association; a member of the IOOS Federal Advisory  Committee; councilor of the bi-national Gulf of Maine Council on the  Marine Environment; board director of the Marine and Oceanography  Technology Network; and science advisory board member for the Lake  George Jefferson Project. I was pleased to invite him to Capitol Hill  in 2016 to testify before the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach  Committee to share his expertise with Congress. I and my staff are  greatly indebted to him for all of his advice and counsel over the  years. It is truly difficult to overstate the breadth and significance  of his service.   Ru would be the first to say that the foundation of his success is  his family: his wife Ann Michelle and their children, Alistair and  Marin. I know that everyone at NERACOOS and throughout the ocean  observing community joins me in thanking Dr. Morrison and his family  for his instrumental leadership and vision. We wish him all the best in  retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great American  and an exceptional member of the U.S. Air Force.   Lt. Col. Joseph ``Joe'' Wall has distinguished himself through his  professional character and dedication by serving this Nation in  uniform. A leader and expert communicator, he has provided  distinguished service to our country while assigned to the Air Force  Senate Liaison Office. He is an outstanding leader and has been the  perfect airman to represent the Air Force on Capitol Hill. Joe is a  command pilot with more than 3,000 hours in the T-37B, T-1A, and KC-10A  aircraft with over 100 combat and combat support missions, supporting  operations over Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and the Horn of Africa.   Throughout his career, Joe has demonstrated his exceptional  abilities; he was a ROTC distinguished graduate at the University of  Miami, graduate of the Air Mobility Command Phoenix Mobility program,  and he is an Olmsted Scholar fluent in German. Prior to his current  assignment, Joe had the privilege of leading airmen as a squadron  commander for the 79th Air Refueling Squadron at Travis Air Force Base.  As a legislative liaison in the Air Force Senate Liaison Office from  June 2018 to July 2020, Lieutenant Colonel Wall performed his duties  well and without reservation. His strategic thinking and foresight  helped to strengthen and improve our national security. Joe  accomplished this utilizing his in-depth Air Force knowledge with  numerous engagements between Congress and the Department of the Air  Force.   During this assignment, Joe conducted congressional engagements to  provide Members of Congress and staff insights into the development of  the ``Air Force We Need'' plan required to support the National Defense  Strategy. He also actively engaged Members of Congress regarding the  fielding and production of the KC-46A Pegasus Tanker. Last year, Joe  led the effort to make sure that the New Hampshire Congressional  Delegation was front and center to receive the first KC-46A at Pease  Air National Guard Base.   Joe organized dozens of direct engagements between senior leaders at  the Department of the Air Force and Members of Congress in order to  convey important information on behalf of the Air Force. All of these  conversations and engagements helped stakeholders understand the  defense equities and the impact on national security. Due to his direct  involvement, Members of Congress were able to make informed decisions  and ensure the Department of the Air Force was properly resourced.   After serving in this important role for the past 2 years, Lieutenant  Colonel Wall will move to his next assignment, the Dwight D. Eisenhower  School at the National Defense University. Joe, his wife Trysta, and  their son Tavin have sacrificed much as a family in service to our  Nation. I am thankful for Joe's service and his work with my office and  the Senate over the past 2 years on issues important to the State of  New Hampshire and this great Nation. I salute him, an American patriot  whose service has kept our country safe and strong. Thank you                            ____________________
