 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule  governing these pieces of legislation and, in particular, the  underlying legislation, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of  Scrutiny, or REINS Act, H.R. 26.   Mr. Speaker, during the first two terms that I have served in this  Congress, the most common question posed to me by my constituents in  central and eastern Kentucky is: What is the biggest surprise that you  have confronted as a Member of Congress?   Regrettably, Mr. Speaker, the biggest surprise that I have discovered  as a Member of Congress is that Congress is no longer in charge.  Regrettably, unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in the executive  branch run the country.                                time  1315    Most of the laws that are enacted in this country at the Federal  level come out of unelected bureaucrats in administrative agencies in  the executive branch. Members of Congress, even though we are elected  by the American people to be the lawmaking branch under Article I of  the Constitution, we can't stop it. We can't stop these rules and  regulations.   So I am proud to have consistently supported the REINS Act because it  reasserts the powers of this body and this Congress under Article I of  the Constitution, which provides: ``All legislative powers herein  granted shall be invested in a Congress of the United States, which  shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.''   What does this mean?   The most important word in Article I of the Constitution is that  first substantive word, ``all,'' implying that none of the legislative  powers should be in any other branch of the Federal Government, and it  certainly shouldn't be exercised by the executive branch. We know this  as the nondelegation doctrine, the principle that Congress may not and  should not delegate its administrative power to administrative  agencies.   The nondelegation doctrine forces a politically accountable Congress  to make policy choices rather than leave this to unelected  administrative officials. Yet what we have seen over the last several  decades, and especially over the last 8 years, has been the rise of an  unaccountable, out-of-control administrative state. Over time,  legislative powers that are vested exclusively in Congress by the  Constitution have been increasingly and unconstitutionally claimed,  assumed, and exercised by the executive branch.   Now unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats decide how you work, what  goods and services you can buy and sell, and what you can do with your  own property, all without accountability at the ballot box. So this  state of affairs is fundamentally in conflict with the foundational,  constitutional principle that Congress alone possesses the Federal  legislative power.   Look, this has enormous economic consequences. It is costly to our  economy, and I don't have to go into that. The estimates are $1.8  trillion in costs to the American economy. But the bigger issue is that  none of these rules from these agencies have been approved--let alone,  even considered--by Congress, even though they have a profound impact  on the economy. So the measure we are considering today would simply  require those regulations with the greatest economic impact to be  approved by both Houses of Congress prior to their implementation.   This has two positive outcomes. First, obviously, it has the effect  of blocking costly rules. Secondly, and more importantly, it will no  longer allow Members of Congress to delegate their constitutional  responsibility to the executive branch.   I will conclude, I heard my friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts,  make the argument that Congress is not even interested in these  regulations and we are not capable of seriously reviewing these rules.  This is about making sure that experts with specialized expertise in  the executive branch review and promulgate these rules. But what are we  doing here if  [[Page H118]]  that is true? We should turn out the lights, lock the door and leave,  and give the keys of the government to the executive branch.   We had a Democratic administration over the last 8 years. We have a  Republican administration coming. This is not about Republicans and  Democrats. This is not a partisan issue. This is about the integrity of  the institution of Congress. Let's stand up for the Congress and pass  the REINS Act.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).
