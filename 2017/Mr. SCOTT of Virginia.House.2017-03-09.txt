 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 985. In addition to the legislation's  many problems that have already been mentioned by my colleagues, I am  particularly concerned about what the bill does in the so-called FACT  Act, which will have a devastating impact on workers exposed to  asbestos.   I am acutely aware of the devastating impact that asbestos exposure  has on working men and women in this country because I represent an  area with several shipyards. In the last few decades, in my district  alone, several thousand local shipyard workers have developed  asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma from asbestos exposure that  occurred between the 1940s and 1970s. Hundreds of these workers have  already died, and asbestos deaths and disabilities are continuing due  to the long latency period associated with this illness.   I believe that we cannot consider the legislation affecting the  victims of asbestos exposure without remembering exactly who caused the  problem. Court findings show that the companies made willful and  malicious decisions to expose their employees to asbestos. Here are a  couple of examples.   One case, in 1986, after hearing both sides, the New Jersey Supreme  Court declared:         It is indeed appalling to us that the company had so much       information of the hazards of asbestos workers as early as       the mid-1930s and that it not only failed to use that       information to protect the workers, but, more egregiously, it       also attempted to withhold this information from the public.    A few years earlier, the Superior Court, Appellate Division, in New  Jersey said that: ``The jury here was justified in concluding that both  defendants, fully appreciating the nature, extent, and gravity of the  risk, nevertheless made a conscious and coldblooded business decision,  in utter and flagrant disregard of the rights of others, to take no  protective or remedial action.''   In a separate case in Florida, after hearing both sides, the court  declared that:         The clear and convincing evidence in this case revealed       that, for more than 30 years, the company concealed what it       knew about the dangers of asbestos. In fact, the company's       conduct was even worse than concealment. It also included       intentional and knowing misrepresentations concerning the       danger of its asbestos-containing product.    That is who we are talking about. These are the types of companies  who will benefit from this legislation. Any suggestion that people are  getting paid more than once is absurd. The fact of the matter is,  because of bankruptcies, most of them aren't getting anywhere close to  what they actually should be receiving, but the bill before us does not  help those victims. It actually hurts them.   The bill is nothing more than a scheme to delay the proceedings and  allow the victims to get even less than they are getting now. Because  of the delay, many of the victims will die before they get to court.  This helps the guilty corporations that have inflicted this harm on  innocent victims because, if the plaintiffs die before they get to  court, their pain and suffering damages are extinguished. If they can  delay the cases enough so that the plaintiffs die before they get to  trial, the corporations will not only get to delay their payments, but  when they finally pay, they will pay much less.    These are the people who made those conscious and coldblooded  business decisions. Those are the ones who will actually benefit from  this legislation at the expense of hardworking, innocent victims. The  victims of this corporate wrongdoing oppose this bill.   Regrettably, many of those victims are our veterans because they were  working aboard Navy ships.   Mr. Chair, we should reject this legislation.
