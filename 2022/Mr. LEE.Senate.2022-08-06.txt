 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 5316 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, across the Nation, local governments are  struggling to support their constituents. These frontline public  servants provide for the safety and well-being of their friends and  neighbors, typically using funds derived from local property taxes.   However, in many counties, these Federal neighbors of sorts don't pay  property taxes, but they draw heavily on the resources made available  by these local governments. Rescuing hikers, paving roads, addressing  forest fires--these are just a few of the vital services that these  communities honorably provide even though they receive little to no  compensation for them.   My amendment would institute a supplemental PILT Program--payment in  lieu of taxes--an additional PILT payment increasing funds by nearly 10  percent. It would not make these communities completely whole by  providing true tax equivalency, but it would make a huge difference. If  Americans want to continue to safely enjoy our national parks,  monuments, forests, and general landscape, we must ensure this program,  PILT, continues to serve as a reliable source of income as property  taxes would were Federal lands subject to property tax.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    I call for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
