 Madam Speaker, this week the new Democrat majority has  endangered more Americans with its push for more and more gun control.   By definition, criminals don't follow the law. Criminals don't honor  gun laws. They steal. They commit murder, all sorts of crimes without  permission. They don't seek permission when they take something from  you, when they enter your home.   They don't seek permission to become gun owners. Yet, what happens  here in the legislation this week, limits the rights, limits the  ability for people to defend themselves, defend their own homes, defend  their own families, by having less options or less ability to get a  weapon if they need it, especially timely.   These measures do not work. They do not work to stop the shootings  that are often cited as the reason to deny people their Second  Amendment rights in this country.   Indeed, it is a political agenda that gets pushed in every election,  every possible time in legislation, and finally, with the majority they  have, they are able to push this stuff through and harm innocent  Americans and their ability to defend themselves.   This has to come to a stop. I hope the Senate will defeat this  measure.                            ____________________
