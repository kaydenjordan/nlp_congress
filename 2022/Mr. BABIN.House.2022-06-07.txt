 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Missouri, Ranking  Member Graves, for yielding me time to speak on the 2022 Water  Resources Development Act.   As someone who has seen firsthand the impact WRDA has had on  Americans and our communities, I am greatly honored to have worked on  this year's legislation.   A major priority for southeast Texas, the Texas Coastal Spine, is  authorized in this legislation. This must-do project to protect our  home State from hurricane storm surge and flooding will make millions  of Texans, as well as our State's most important economic hubs, where a  huge percentage of our Nation's gasoline and strategic fuels are  manufactured, much safer.   Additionally, this bill expedites vital projects at the Port of  Houston and the Sabine-Neches Waterway, the busiest port in the country  and where more military equipment is shipped than any other waterway  respectively.   We need to get this bill across the finish line. And I thank Chairman  DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, as well as Subcommittee Chairwoman  Napolitano and Ranking Member Rouzer and their staffs for everyone's  hard work on this bill.   I also take a moment to thank Paul Sass, the departing Republican  staff director, for his many years of service on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee. Paul's commitment to mission and dedication  to public service have improved, not only our committee, but the  Congress as a whole. And I wish him the absolute best of luck with all  of his future endeavors.
