 Madam Chair, I rise today in strong support of  legislation introduced by myself and Representative Karen Bass to  reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.   VAWA programs have provided educational tools and helped survivors  and their families get the resources they need to protect themselves  and to begin the healing process. This should not be a partisan issue.                                time  1645    I would like to thank Congresswoman Bass for her leadership. She is a  valued partner in this fight, and I am grateful that we can make this  bill bipartisan.   Across our country, Madam Chair, millions of women and children have  been saved by the programs funded through VAWA. Shelters, counseling,  training, and law enforcement are all key parts of a national strategy  to end domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and  stalking.   In the district I represent, in Bucks and Montgomery Counties, in  Pennsylvania, and in all of our districts, VAWA programs are saving  lives.   A Woman's Place in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, relies on VAWA funding  to save lives. Unlike some larger women's organizations, their  emergency housing only has room for seven families. Nonetheless, their  shelter saved 150 women and children who were in imminent danger, often  fleeing for their lives.   Another Bucks County organization, Network of Victim Assistance, or  NOVA, has helped more than 3,600 victims of sexual assault, human  trafficking, stalking, and other serious crimes. NOVA's work to expand  prevention programs, which is essential to preventing violence, is  supported by VAWA.   This bill also includes my Combat Online Predators Act, which will  increase penalties for cyberstalking against children. My constituent,  Madison Zezzo, was cyberstalked by a then 51-year-old predator, who was  only sentenced to probation and counseling. Three years later, he made  contact with Madison again and created a web of social media accounts  to cyberstalk her. He was later sentenced to between 18 months and 7  years in prison.   From domestic violence and sexual assault to cyberstalking, we must  do more to prevent violence and, when it does happen, to support  victims and bring perpetrators to justice.   Madam Chair, the Violence Against Women Act will help us do all these  things. I urge my colleagues, both Democrat and Republican alike, to  support this legislation, which will save lives in all of our  communities.
