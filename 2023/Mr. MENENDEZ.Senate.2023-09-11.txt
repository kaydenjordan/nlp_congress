 Mr. President, I rise to speak about a horrific set of  events that are taking place in a part of the world that we could do  something about.   In this photo, this dead man's body is completely emaciated. The  skin, tight over his bones, barely covers his skeleton. Bruises and  scars stretch across his chest.   This is not a victim at the side of the road during the Ottoman  Turks' Armenian genocide. It is not a holocaust survivor lying on the  ground as allies liberated Buchenwald. It is not a human carcass left  in the wake of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia or the Hutu in Rwanda or  Serbian forces in Bosnia.   It is from the Human Rights Defender's Office in Nagorno-Karabakh,  and it is from August--only weeks ago. Because, right now, as the  Presiding Officer sits here on the dais and I stand here in the  Chamber, the Aliyev government in Azerbaijan is carrying out a campaign  of heinous atrocities that bear the hallmarks of genocide against the  Armenians in Artsakh. They have purposely and viciously trapped an  estimated 100,000 to 120,000 Christian Armenians in the Karabakh  Mountains.   There is only one road out connecting Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia for  people, food, medicine, and basic supplies. And the Azerbaijanis have  blocked it since December of last year.   Now, despite some reports yesterday, no aid has moved. They have  tried to deny their role, but make no mistake--the Azerbaijani  government is now wholeheartedly embracing this brutal blockade,  denying the Armenian community food and fuel and medicine. Aliyev and  his regime are trying to starve these people into death or political  submission.   ``There are no cemeteries and there are no machete attacks,'' wrote  the former prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, Luis Moreno  Ocampo, in a recent report. But he said:         Starvation is the invisible genocide weapon. Without       immediate dramatic change, this group of Armenians will be       destroyed in a few weeks.    This group of Armenians--we're talking about over 100,000--will be  destroyed in a few weeks. Not my observations; the observations of the  former prosecutor at the International Criminal Court.   In Artsakh, the shelves at stores are empty. Children wait in lines  for the chance of finding bread to feed their grandparents who are too  weak to leave the house. There is no gas for ambulances. According to  the head doctor at one maternity hospital, miscarriages have nearly  tripled. And the BBC reports that one in three deaths in Nagorno- Karabakh is from malnutrition.   For months, Azerbaijan was just doing the bare minimum, allowing the  International Committee of the Red Cross limited access. But in July,  Aliyev blocked even the Red Cross. And  [[Page S4348]]  in complete defiance of the Geneva Conventions, Azerbaijan detained  medical patients the Red Cross was transporting through the corridor.  This is not only outrageous at face value, but an insult to the  international community and a threat to brave Red Cross workers around  the world.   In addition to arresting sick and elderly residents a few weeks ago,  Azerbaijan also detained university students who were trying to go to  Armenia to start the school year. Azerbaijan's foreign ministry says:  Oh, there is nothing to worry about. These concerns are just a result  of ``propaganda and political manipulations spread by Armenia.''   Really? They are blaming Armenia for this? That is a flat-out lie.   It was Azerbaijan, with Turkish backing, that launched the war in  2020--a war that uprooted close to 100,000 Armenians from their homes  in Nagorno-Karabakh; a war that killed 6,500 people. Now Aliyev blocks  the Lachin corridor and says: I am ``not organizing ethnic cleansing.''  The same Azerbaijani President who has also threatened to ``chase  away'' Armenian separatists ``like dogs,'' whose government issued a  commemorative postage stamp showing a worker in hazmat gear spraying  disinfectant on the region.   We have seen and heard this kind of propaganda throughout history. It  is the work of a regime intent on destroying and erasing this ancient  Armenian community's history in Nagorno-Karabakh.   And right now, the United States is failing. The United States is not  meeting the humanitarian needs or publicly putting enough pressure on  Aliyev to stop the campaign of ethnic cleansing.   I sincerely hope the State Department is not considering renewing the  907 waiver which allows for security assistance to go to Azerbaijan. I  don't know how the United States can justify spending any kind of  support--security or otherwise--to the regime in Baku.   We have seen a video of Azerbaijani forces killing unarmed Armenian  soldiers in cold blood. We have reports of Azerbaijani soldiers  sexually assaulting and mutilating an Armenian female soldier. So to  send them assistance makes a mockery of the FREEDOM Support Act.  Section 907 of this act is meant to ban security assistance to  Azerbaijan until it is ``taking demonstrable steps to cease all  blockades and other offensive uses of force against Armenia and  Nagorno-Karabakh.''   That is the end of the quote from section 907. But still, the  Department of State has waived section 907 over and over and over  again.   Suffice it to say, I am strongly opposed to having any aid going to a  fighting force known for war crimes and the violation of human rights.  I understand the dynamics of the broader region are complicated, but  our fundamental principles underlying security assistance should not  be.   When the United States untethers our security assistance from human  rights and American values to focus on short-term tactical military  assistance, it not only damages long-term American national security  interests, it flies in the face of our duty to honor the victims and  survivors of the Armenian genocide and our duty to ensure that history  does not repeat itself.   We cannot look away from a systematic attempt to eradicate and erase  an entire people from the face of the Earth.   In 2021, as my colleagues witnessed here on the Senate floor, I was  overcome with emotion to see President Biden join us in recognizing-- for the first time of any American President--the Armenian genocide.   More than a century ago, Ottoman Turks perpetrated a systematic  campaign to exterminate the Armenian population through killings,  through forced deportation, and, yes, through starvation.   What the Turks did is an irrefutable historical fact. The recognition  of this fact was a huge step forward, and I am proud to have played a  role in that effort. I am proud that I spoke up as many  American leaders stayed silent; proud that I pressured State Department  nominees and officials to acknowledge this historical reality; proud  that I introduced or cosponsored resolutions recognizing the Armenian  genocide since before I came to the Senate in 2006.    Make no mistake, fighting the denial of Armenian genocide is not only  about the past, it is also about the present.   That is why I am calling on Aliyev to immediately release the  Armenian prisoners of war. It is why I have been working on legislation  to address the current humanitarian crisis in Artsakh. And it is why  when USAID Administrator Power came before the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee earlier this year, I pushed her to get humanitarian  assistance to the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.   I believe the United States can--and must--play an active role in  addressing this conflict because the so-called Russian peacekeepers,  who have supposedly been enforcing a ceasefire following Azerbaijan's  2020 invasion, have been--to no one's surprise--wholly ineffective. As  Azerbaijani forces began an incursion in September of 2022, these  Russian forces stood idly by. Moscow will, no doubt, exploit any  instability to its advantage, but they have also proved their lack of  worth, which is all the more reason that the United States must  continue to play a role.   Now, we have been facilitating talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan,  but we need to change our approach. We cannot continue to simply  facilitate talks. We have a responsibility to mediate, to pursue a  meaningful enforceable agreement with the guaranteed rights, security,  and dignity of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh as a central tenet. We  must also encourage--and if necessary--broker direct discussions  between political leaders in Stepanakert and Baku.   Of course, to be an honest broker means we need to tell the truth  about Azerbaijan's atrocities. We need to call out those individuals  perpetrating this campaign of ethnic cleansing. We need to target  them--including President Aliyev--with sanctions. We need to be cutting  off their access to the wealth and oil money they have stashed away in  financial institutions around the world, to their yachts and mansions  across Europe.   The evidence is there, and we must preserve it so Aliyev can be held  accountable for these atrocities.   I have called on the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations to  introduce a resolution at the UN Security Council enforcing an end to  Aliyev's blockade.   I am pleased to see that Secretary Blinken is personally engaging in  the crisis now, but the message he delivers must be crystal clear. At  the same time, the EU needs to step in too.   Now, I was pleased to see the High Representative Borell's statement  in July that the EU is ``deeply concerned about the serious  humanitarian situation'' in Nagorno-Karabakh. But I hope that actions  accompany those words. Instead of just taking Azerbaijani gas and  praising the country as a ``crucial energy partner,'' they must also  bring pressure to end this blockade.   How many leaders have solemnly promised to learn history's lessons  and prevent future genocides?   How many people have come to the floor of the Senate and said: Never,  never again?   How many people will have to die of starvation before we act?   With Aliyev potentially moving troops along the border, we cannot say  we didn't see it coming.   This time must be different. In the past, plans to carry out genocide  were clouded by distance or geography. But this time we know. We know  Aliyev is doing it right now. We must not only hold him accountable for  his actions, we must stop him from succeeding in erasing this Armenian  community.   We must stop him from starving these Armenians to death or imposing  political control by opening only the Aghdam corridor. This is not a  substitution for opening the Lachin corridor. It is not upholding the  commitments of the 2020 agreement. Using basic humanitarian food and  medical supplies as a political weapon is not acceptable. We have the  power to do it--if we act now.   Given the chance, who here among us would not go back and stop the  Turks from rounding up the first Armenian victims of the genocide who  were hung in the streets of Istanbul or the Serb forces who gave  Bosnian Muslims a 24-hour ultimatum to surrender or the Rwandan radio  broadcasts inciting violence?  [[Page S4349]]    Unlike those times in the past, we are living on the brink right now.   So to the Biden administration, I would say, now is the time to step  up and protect this vulnerable population; to the international  community, now is the time to work together to bring pressure to stop  this tragedy from unfolding in front of our very eyes.   To the Armenian people trapped in this blockade with no food as  winter approaches, know that you have friends and allies here in the  U.S. Senate and around the world who will not rest until you are safe  and secure. Hang on. Hang on.   And to the men organizing and carrying out this brutal campaign, we  will hold you accountable for your crimes even if it takes a  lifetime. You will pay a price. You will face justice, and I certainly  will not rest until you do so.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.      Hon. Robert Menendez,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements       of Section 36(b)(5)(C) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA),       as amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 23-0K.

Transmittal No. 23-0K       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(C). AECA)        (i) Purchaser: Government of Bahrain.        (ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 16-59; Date:       September 8, 2017; Implementing Agency: Air Force.        Funding Source: National Funds.        (iii) Description: On September 8, 2017, Congress was       notified by congressional certification transmittal number       16-59 of the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms       Export Control Act of the possible upgrade of Bahrain's       existing twenty (23) F-16 Block 40 aircraft to the F-16V       configuration. The requested sale was comprised of twenty-      three (23) F110 GE-129 engines (includes 3 spares); twenty-      three (23) APG-83 Active Electronically Scanned Array Radars       (includes 3 spares); twenty-three (23) Modular Mission       Computers (includes 3 spares); twenty-three (23) Embedded       Global Navigation Systems/LN260 EGI (includes 3 spares);       forty (40) LAU-129 launchers; twenty-three (23) Improved       Programmable Display Generators (iPDGs) (includes 3 spares);       twenty-five (25) AN/AAQ-33 SNIPER Pods; two (2) AIM-9X       Sidewinder Missiles; two (2) AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation       Missiles (HARM); two (2) WGU-43 Guidance Control Unit (GBU)       Guidance Control Unit (GCU) (for GBU-24 Paveway III); two (2)       BSU-84 Air Foil Group (AFG) (for GBU-24 Paveway III); five       (5) KMU-572 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Tailkits (for       GBU-38 JDAM and GBU-54 Laser JDAM); two (2) GBU-39 Small       Diameter Bombs (SDB) Guided Test Vehicles (GTV); two (2) AGM-      84 Harpoon Missiles; three (3) MAU-210 ECCG (for GBU-50       Enhanced Paveway II); three (3) BLU-109 Inert Bomb Bodies;       four (4) MK-82/BLU-111 Inert Bomb Bodies; and two (2) FMU-152       or FMU-139 Fuzes.

The estimated total cost was $1.082 billion.       Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $406 million of       this total.        On September 28, 2018, Congress was notified by       Congressional certification transmittal number 18-0C of the       possible sale, under Section 36(b)(5)(C) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of:        1. The inclusion of twenty-three (23) Multifunction       Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System       (MIDS-JTRS) Concurrent Multi-Networking-4 (CMN-4) which are       MDE;        2. The inclusion of an additional nineteen (19) AN/ALQ-211       Advanced Integrated Defensive Electronic Warfare Suite       (AIDEWS) Systems (non-MDE), which will increase the number       from twenty (20) to thirty-nine (39). These additional       nineteen (19) were not included in the total value of the       AIDEWS systems previously notified. This change was due to a       change in system requirements and a desire to prioritize       system components with long lead procurement timelines; and        3. The inclusion of additional test weapons quantities and       MDE designations outlined below:        a. BLU-109--Increase from quantity of three (3) to four       (4).        b. Bomb Practice GBU-39 Guided Test Vehicle (GTV)--MDE item       not on original notification.        c. MK-82 Inert Filled Bomb Body--Increase in quantity of       four (4) to six (6)--MDE not on original notification.        d. KMU-572 JDAM Tail Kit--Quantity of five (5) not included       on original Congressional Notification and MDE designation       not on original notification.        e. MXU-650 Air Foil Group--Quantity of two (2) not included       on original Congressional Notification and MDE designation       not on original notification.        f. MXU-651 Air Foil Group--MDE designation not on original       notification.        g. MAU-210 Enhanced Computer Control Group--Increase in       quantity of three (3) to four (4) and MDE designation not on       original notification. Also, correct that this MAU is for the       GBU-49, not the GBU-50 as outlined in the original       notification.        h. FMU-152--Quantity of six (6) not included on original       Congressional Notification and MDE designation not on       original notification.        These changes were due to unit pack minimum required       quantities, items not properly identified as MDE on the       original notification, and errors in requirements       identification by the procuring office.        The inclusion of these MDE items did not increase the value       of MDF beyond what was originally notified. The inclusion of       AIDEWS caused the total case value to rise from $1.082       billion to $1.292 billion.        On October 1, 2019, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 0T-19, under Section       36(b)(5)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act, of the inclusion       of an additional five (5) AN/AAQ-33 SNIPER Pods, which       increased the number from twenty-five (25) to thirty (30),       These additional five (5) were not included in the total       value of the SNIPER Pods previously notified. The addition of       these items resulted in a net increase in cost of MDE of       $11.6 million. The revised MDE total value was $417.6       million. The total case value remained $1.292 billion.        This transmittal notifies the following change in MDE       items: the ``twenty-three (23) Embedded Global Navigation       Systems/LN260 EGI (includes 3 spares)'' previously notified       will be changed to ``twenty-three (23) Embedded Global       Navigation Systems/LN260 EGI (includes 3 spares) and/or EGI       devices with M-code technology.'' The following non-MDE  [[Page S4350]]       items will also be included: MS-110 Reconnaissance Pod       Retrofit Kits; additional spare pans and repair and return       support; and additional integration, training, and       sustainment equipment and support. The estimated total value       of new MDE items is $7 million but will not result in a net       increase in the-total MDE cost. The total MDE value will       remain $417.6 million. The total cost of added non-MDE items       is $139 million. The total estimated case value will increase       by $139 million to $1.431 billion.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided as       the included replacement and additional items represent in an       increase in capability over what was originally notified. The       proposed sale increases Bahrain's F-16 fleet's reconnaissance       capability and contributes to greater interoperability with       the United States. Bahrain is upgrading its F-16 program as a       deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland       defense.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security of the United States by       helping to improve the security of a Major Non-NATO Ally in       developing and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense       capability. This proposed sale will enhance U.S. national       security objectives in the region.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The MMcode capable Embedded       Global Positioning System (GPS) Inertial Navigation System       (INS) (EGI), with an embedded OPS Precise Positioning Service       (PPS) Receiver Application Module-Standard Electronic Module       (GRAM-S/M), is a self-contained navigation system that       provides acceleration, velocity, position, attitude, platform       azimuth, magnetic and true heading, altitude, body angular       rates, time tags, and coordinated universal time (UTC)       synchronized time. The embedded GRAM-SIM enables access to       both the encrypted P(Y) and M-Code signals, providing       protection against active spoofing attacks, enhanced military       exclusivity, integrity, and anti-jam.        The MS-110 is a tactical reconnaissance pod with long-      range, day/night, multi-spectral sensor technology. The       multi-spectral sensor lets the end user see color and better       distinguish subtle features than a DB-110 pod's dual band       imagery. The pod can transmit imagery via a datalink: to       ground-stations for near-real time analysis and exploitation.       The MS-110 Retrofit Kit converts a DB-110 pod into an MS-110       pod.        The Sensitivity of Technology Statement contained in the       original notification applies to additional items reported       here.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        (vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: September 6, 2023.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m.  on Tuesday, September 12; that following the prayer and pledge, the  Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed  expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Bradsher nomination postcloture; further, that all  time be considered expired at 11:30 a.m. and, following the cloture  vote on the Cummings nomination, the Senate recess until 2:15 p.m. to  allow for the weekly caucus meetings; that if cloture is invoked on the  Cummings nomination, all time be considered expired at 2:15 p.m.;  finally, that if any nominations are confirmed, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
