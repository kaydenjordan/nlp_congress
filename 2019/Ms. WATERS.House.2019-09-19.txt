 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 239) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in  recognition of Christa McAuliffe.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 239         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Christa McAuliffe       Commemorative Coin Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Christa McAuliffe was a social studies teacher at       Concord High School in Concord, New Hampshire.        (2) In 1985, Christa McAuliffe was selected to be the first       participant in the Teacher in Space program of the National       Aeronautics and Space Administration.        (3) On January 28, 1986, Christa McAuliffe and 6 other       astronauts were tragically killed during the Space Shuttle       Challenger disaster.        (4) In 1989, For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and       Technology (in this Act referred to as ``FIRST'') was founded       to inspire young people's interest and participation in       science and technology.        (5) The mission of FIRST ``is to inspire young people to be       science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting       mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and       technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster       well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence,       communication, and leadership''.        (6) 2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of       FIRST.        (7) Each year, more than 1,000,000 children from the United       States and more than 86 countries participate in a FIRST       program.        (8) Studies have shown that alumni of FIRST programs are       more likely to become scientists and engineers and to       volunteer in their communities.        (9) FIRST is dedicated to carrying on the mission of       Christa McAuliffe of inspiring students and creating a new       generation of dreamers and innovators.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in 1985, Christa McAuliffe was selected out of over  10,000 applicants to be the first participant in NASA's Teacher in  Space program, becoming the first private citizen to be on a space  mission.   Before her selection, Ms. McAuliffe was a social studies teacher at  Concord High School in New Hampshire and extremely popular with her  students.   McAuliffe was to be part of the space shuttle Challenger's crew and  the mission plan, including having her conduct not only some basic  science experiments, but also teach two 15-minute classes from space  that would be broadcast to millions of students.   On January 20, 1986, Christa McAuliffe tragically lost her life,  alongside her six crewmates, in the space shuttle Challenger disaster.   Ms. McAuliffe was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal  of Honor in 2004 and has had scholarships and schools named in her  honor.   This year, a pair of teachers turned astronauts, Ricky Arnold and Joe  Acaba, honored Ms. McAuliffe by filming the lessons she would have  taught, had she lived to complete her mission, while they were aboard  the International Space Station.   This film is accessible to students around the world, courtesy of a  partnership between NASA and the Challenger Center for Space Science  Education. The first lesson was released in August 2018, and more  lessons continue to be released.   Proceeds from the sale of the commemorative coin will benefit FIRST,  the Nation's leading not-for-profit STEM engagement program. The  mission of FIRST is to inspire young people to be science and  technology leaders by engaging them in exciting, mentor-based programs  that build science, engineering, and technology skills that inspire  innovation and that foster well-rounded life capabilities, including  self-confidence, communication, and leadership.   Each year, more than 1 million children in the U.S. and 100 countries  participate in FIRST. It has a presence in every State and nearly every  congressional district.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill and vote  ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, 2021 marks the 35th anniversary of the space shuttle  Challenger tragedy. This bill will help commemorate and further Christa  McAuliffe's inspirational life and help develop a new generation of  dreamers and innovators by providing FIRST with additional funding to  launch young people into critically needed, well-paying STEM jobs.   I thank the sponsor of the House companion to S. 239, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Upton), and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this important piece of legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3625) to establish a whistleblower program at the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board, and for other purposes, as amended.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement  [[Page H7802]]       titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this       Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by       the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that       such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on       passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank Representative Garcia for this important piece of legislation  that establishes a whistleblower program at the Public Company  Accounting Oversight Board. This program is similar to the program that  was created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act for the Securities and Exchange Commission.   At the SEC, this program has proven to be extremely successful and  has been instrumental in incentivizing whistleblowers to report  suspected misconduct while protecting them from retaliation by their  employers. According to the SEC, the SEC's whistleblower program has  awarded approximately $381 million to 62 individual whistleblowers  since the program began.   Given the PCAOB's critical mission to protect investors and further  the public interest by ensuring informative, accurate, and independent  audit reports of public companies and SEC-registered brokers and  dealers, it is vital that PCAOB whistleblowers are incentivized to come  forward and are protected from employer retaliation.   Due to the success of this program and its proven track record at the  SEC, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. Madam  Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia), who is the author of this legislation, and she will  sufficiently describe why this bill is not redundant.     Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I reserve  the right to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First, Madam Speaker, I congratulate the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Garcia). I am so very proud of the work that she is doing on the  Financial Services Committee. We are here today on this particular  legislation, but this particular legislator, who serves on the  Financial Services Committee, has undertaken to produce legislation  that is so meaningful, not only for her district and for her State, but  for this country. I am very pleased about this bill today, and I join  her in saying it is certainly not redundant.   Madam Speaker, I think the gentleman on the opposite side of the  aisle from Michigan almost forgot why he came here, because he used the  word ``redundant'' at least six or seven times, and he repeated it and  repeated it because I think it was difficult for him to find other  words to try and explain why he was on the floor today opposing this  bill.   The SEC has demonstrated the value of whistleblowers. And, yes, the  whistleblowers are compensated, but they save our government money.  They save the SEC money. They save harm from being done to those  investors that we should be protecting.   Madam Speaker, again, I can't say enough about Congresswoman Garcia  and this bill and the work that she is doing, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3619) to amend the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,  and Enforcement Act of 1989 to provide the Appraisal Subcommittee with  the authority to modify annual registry fees for appraisal management  companies, to maintain a registry of trainees and charge a lower  trainee registry fee, and to allow grants to States to assist appraiser  and potential appraiser compliance with the Real Property Appraiser  [[Page H7804]]  Qualification Criteria, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3619         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Subparagraph (B) of section 1109(a)(4) of the Financial       Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989       (12 U.S.C. 3338(a)(4)(B)) is amended--        (1) in clause (ii), by striking the period at the end and       inserting a semicolon; and        (2) by inserting after and below clause (ii) the following:      ``except that if the Appraisal Subcommittee determines that       the fees established under clause (i) or (ii) result in       adverse consequences or are otherwise not appropriately       tailored to meet the goals of this paragraph, the Appraisal       Subcommittee may establish a new formula for fees, which new       formula may not take effect until the Appraisal Subcommittee       submits a report to the Congress justifying its decision to       establish such a new formula, setting forth the new formula,       and explaining how the new formula will affect such fees.''.       SEC. 3. TRAINEE APPRAISERS.         (a) Maintenance on National Registry.-- Paragraph (3) of       section 1103(a) of the Financial Institutions Reform,       Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 3332(a)(3))       is amended by striking ``and licensed'' and inserting ``,       licensed, and trainee''.        (b) Annual Registry Fees.--Subparagraph (A) of section       1109(a)(4) of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,       and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 3338(a)(4)(A)) is       amended--        (1) by inserting ``including trainee appraisers,'' after       ``transactions,'';        (2) by inserting ``except that the Appraisal Subcommittee       may, in its discretion, charge a fee for trainee appraisers       not exceeding $20'' after ``$40,''; and        (3) by inserting before the semicolon the following: ``;       except that nothing in this subparagraph may be construed to       require a State to establish or operate an program for       trainee appraisers''.        (c) Definition.--Section 1121 of the Financial Institutions       Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C.       3350) is amended by adding at the end the following new       paragraph:        ``(12) Trainee appraiser.--The term `trainee appraiser'       means an individual who meets the minimum criteria       established by the Appraiser Qualification Board for a       trainee appraiser license and is credentialed by a State       appraiser certifying and licensing agency.''.       SEC. 4. GRANTS TO NONPROFITS AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER                     EDUCATION FOR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.         Paragraph (5) of section 1109(b) of the Financial       Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989       (12 U.S.C. 3338(b)(5)) is amended by inserting ``nonprofit       organizations, and institutions of higher education'' after       ``licensing agencies,''.       SEC. 5. REQUIREMENT TO DISCLOSE APPRAISAL FEES.         Section 4(c) of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act       of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2603(c)) is amended by striking ``may''       and inserting ``shall''.       SEC. 6. INCLUSION OF DESIGNEE OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS ON APPRAISAL SUBCOMMITTEE.         The first sentence of section 1011 of the Federal Financial       Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3310)       is amended by inserting ``the Department of Veterans       Affairs,'' after ``Protection,''.       SEC. 7. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3619, the Appraisal Fee  Transparency Act, and I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Clay) for bringing this bill to the House.   This bill would provide the Appraisal Subcommittee with greater  flexibility to adjust the structure and amount of the fees they charge  to appraisal management companies to alleviate concerns that the  current statutory requirements governing these fees are too rigid and  would have put pressure on appraisal management companies to pass on  the burden of unnecessarily high fees to appraisers and reduce the  number of appraisers that they work with.   At a time when some areas of the country are experiencing an  appraiser shortage, we cannot afford to make it harder for appraisers  to obtain work.   This bill would also create a national registry of appraiser  trainees, much like there is already a national registry of licensed  appraisers. This is one small step that will help facilitate the entry  of new appraisers into the industry.   Finally, this bill would provide consumers with a separate disclosure  of fees paid to the appraiser and fees paid to the appraisal management  company in order to enhance their understanding of the costs associated  with their mortgage.   These are reforms that are broadly supported by the appraisal  industry and will make meaningful changes to this industry which makes  up a critical part of the home buying process.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) for  offering this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Clay), the chair of the Subcommittee on Housing,  Community Development and Insurance.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I, again, thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay)  for bringing this bill to the floor. This bill will remove another  impediment to obtaining homes for everyday Americans by making more  appraisers available to home buyers.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2290) to require the Federal financial regulators to issue  guidance encouraging financial institutions to work with consumers and  businesses affected by a Federal Government shutdown, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2290         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Shutdown Guidance for       Financial Institutions Act''.       SEC. 2. SHUTDOWN GUIDANCE FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.         (a) Guidance.--Not later than the end of the 180-day period       beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal       financial regulators shall, jointly, in consultation with       State banking regulators and other appropriate Federal and       State agencies, issue shutdown guidance to the financial       institutions they regulate encouraging the financial       institutions to--        (1) work with consumers and businesses affected by a       shutdown;        (2) recognize that consumers and businesses affected by a       shutdown may lose access to credit and face temporary       hardship in making payments on debts such as mortgages,       student loans, car loans, business loans, or credit cards;        (3) consider prudent efforts to modify terms on existing       loans or extend new credit to help consumers and businesses       affected by a shutdown, consistent with safe-and-sound       lending practices; and        (4) take steps to prevent adverse information being       reported in a manner that harms consumers affected by a       shutdown, including by preventing modified credit       arrangements intended to help consumers fulfill their       financial obligations from being reported to, and coded by,       consumer reporting agencies on a consumer's credit report in       a manner that hurts the creditworthiness of the consumer.        (b) Notice of Guidance During a Shutdown.--Not later than       the end of the 24-hour period beginning at the start of a       shutdown, the Federal financial regulators shall, jointly,       issue a press release to alert financial institutions,       consumers, and businesses to the existence, and content, of       the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (a).        (c) Post-shutdown Report to Congress and Updated       Guidance.--        (1) In general.--Not later than the end of the 90-day       period beginning on the date a shutdown ends, the Federal       financial regulators shall, jointly, issue a report to       Congress containing an analysis of the effectiveness of the       guidance issued pursuant to subsection (a).        (2) Updated guidance.--Not later than the end of the 180-      day period beginning on the date a report is issued under       paragraph (1), the Federal financial regulators shall update       the guidance required under subsection (a) if any       shortcomings are identified in such report.  [[Page H7806]]         (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Consumers affected by a shutdown.--The term ``consumers       affected by a shutdown'' means an individual who is an       employee of--        (A) the Federal Government, and who is furloughed or       excepted from a furlough during the shutdown;        (B) the District of Columbia, and who is not receiving pay       because of the shutdown; or        (C) a Federal contractor (as defined under section 7101 of       title 41, United States Code) or other business, and who has       experienced a substantial reduction in pay due to the       shutdown.        (2) Consumers and businesses affected by a shutdown.--The       term ``consumers and businesses affected by a shutdown''       means--        (A) a consumer affected by a shutdown; and        (B) a Federal contractor (as defined under section 7101 of       title 41, United States Code) or other business that has       experienced a substantial reduction in income due to the       shutdown.        (3) Federal financial regulators.--The term ``Federal       financial regulators'' means the Board of Governors of the       Federal Reserve System, the Bureau of Consumer Financial       Protection, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal       Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the National Credit Union       Administration.        (4) Shutdown.--The term ``shutdown'' means any period in       which there is more than a 24-hour lapse in appropriations as       a result of a failure to enact a regular appropriations bill       or continuing resolution.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2290, Shutdown  Guidance for Financial Institutions Act, a bill introduced by one of  our colleagues and a new member of the Financial Services Committee,  Representative Jennifer Wexton of Virginia.   Last December, President Trump shut the government down for an  unprecedented 35 days, resulting in missed paychecks for countless  government employees and contractors. About 800,000 Federal employees  were furloughed and another 4 million or so Federal contractors were  negatively affected.   The resulting damage was significant. Many of our constituents, who  did nothing wrong at all, found it hard to make essential payments-- such as payments on mortgages, rent, student loans, car loans, business  loans, or credit cards--when their income was temporarily limited.   Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown  cost the American economy $11 billion and it delayed approximately $18  billion in Federal discretionary spending for compensation and  purchases of goods and services.   Should there be another government shutdown in the future, this bill  will help ensure that, at a minimum, there is timely guidance provided  by financial regulators to encourage financial firms to work with and  help affected consumers. Consistent with prudent lending practices,  firms would be encouraged to modify payment terms or extend credit,  when appropriate, and prevent adverse information from being reported  that might hurt a consumer's credit score.   During the October 2013 shutdown, regulators issued guidance to  financial institutions on day nine of the shutdown, urging financial  firms to do what they could to help affected consumers.   On January 11, 2019, financial regulators issued a joint statement to  provide guidance to financial institutions, again encouraging them to  help consumers affected by the shutdown. However, the guidance did not  come until the 20th day of the shutdown and only came after I wrote  regulators the day before prodding them to issue such critical  guidance.   This delay is unacceptable, whether it is 9 days or 20 days, and  there is no reason why regulators should not prepare the appropriate  guidance now and issue a press release within the first 24 hours of any  future shutdown to remind financial institutions to help affected  consumers, as H.R. 2290 would require.   Furthermore, H.R. 2290 builds on H. Res. 77 that I sponsored and was  passed by the House on a voice vote in January 2019, expressing the  sense of Congress that financial institutions and other entities should  proactively work to help consumers affected by any future government  shutdown.   Passing the Shutdown Guidance for Financial Institutions Act will  help ensure guidance is provided to financial firms in a timely manner  and that there is no ambiguity that struggling consumers affected by a  shutdown, through no fault of their own, get the assistance that they  need.   I commend the work of Representative Wexton on this very important  legislation. I support the bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Wexton), a new member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We should all work to make sure that there is never again a  government shutdown. However, if one occurs, this bill will ease the  burden on many vulnerable workers and families.   Once again, I commend the gentlewoman from Virginia for bringing this  legislation to the House, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this important piece of legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 550) to award a Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, to  the United States Merchant Mariners of World War II, in recognition of  their dedicated and vital service during World War II, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 550         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Merchant Mariners of World       War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) 2015 marked the 70th anniversary of the Allied victory       in World War II and the restoration of peacetime across the       European and Pacific theaters.        (2) The United States Merchant Marine (in this section       referred to as the ``Merchant Marine'') was integral in       providing the link between domestic production and the       fighting forces overseas, providing combat equipment, fuel,       food, commodities, and raw materials to troops stationed       abroad.        (3) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowledged the       indispensability of the Merchant Marine to the victory in a       1945 letter stating that, without the support of the Merchant       Marine, ``the Navy could not have accomplished its mission''.        (4) President, and former Supreme Commander of the Allied       Forces, Dwight D. Eisenhower acknowledged that ``through the       prompt delivery of supplies and equipment to our armed forces       overseas, and of cargoes representing economic and military       aid to friendly nations, the American Merchant Marine has       effectively helped to strengthen the forces of freedom       throughout the world''.        (5) Military missions and war planning were contingent upon       the availability of resources and the Merchant Marine played       a  [[Page H7808]]       vital role in this regard, ensuring the efficient and       reliable transoceanic transport of military equipment and       both military and civilian personnel.        (6) The Merchant Marine provided for the successful       transport of resources and personnel despite consistent and       ongoing exposure to enemy combatants from both the air and       the sea, including from enemy bomber squadrons, submarines,       and mines.        (7) The efforts of the Merchant Marine were not without       sacrifices as the Merchant Marine bore a higher per-capita       casualty rate than any other branch of the military during       the war.        (8) The Merchant Marine proved to be an instrumental asset       on an untold number of occasions, participating in every       landing operation by the United States Marine Corps, from       Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima.        (9) The Merchant Marine provided the bulk tonnage of       material necessary for the invasion of Normandy, an invasion       which, according to a 1944 New York Times article, ``would       not have been possible without the Merchant Marine''.        (10) In assessing the performance of the Merchant Marine,       General Eisenhower stated, ``every man in this Allied command       is quick to express his admiration for the loyalty, courage,       and fortitude of the officers and men of the Merchant Marine.       We count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion to       duty as we do our own; they have never failed us''.        (11) During a September 1944 speech, President Franklin D.       Roosevelt stated that the Merchant Marine had ``delivered the       goods when and where needed in every theater of operations       and across every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult,       and dangerous transportation job ever undertaken. As time       goes on, there will be greater public understanding of our       merchant fleet's record during this war.''.        (12) The feats and accomplishments of the Merchant Marine       are deserving of broader public recognition.        (13) The United States will be forever grateful and       indebted to these merchant mariners for their effective,       reliable, and courageous transport of goods and resources in       enemy territory throughout theaters of every variety in World       War II.        (14) The goods and resources transported by the Merchant       Marine saved thousands of lives and enabled the Allied Powers       to claim victory in World War II.        (15) The Congressional Gold Medal would be an appropriate       way to shed further light on the service of the merchant       mariners in World War II and the instrumental role they       played in winning that war.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf       of Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design to       the United States Merchant Mariners of World War II, in       recognition of their dedicated and vital service during World       War II.        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award       described in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike       the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and       inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.        (c) American Merchant Marine Museum.--        (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal       under subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to the       American Merchant Marine Museum, where it will be available       for display as appropriate and available for research.        (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the American Merchant Marine Museum should make the gold       medal given to the Museum under paragraph (1) available for       display elsewhere, particularly at appropriate locations       associated with the United States Merchant Marine and that       preference should be given to locations affiliated with the       United States Merchant  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 550, the Merchant  Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019.   I thank the gentleman from California, Representative Garamendi, for  his work on this bill, which honors the courage and sacrifice of the  civilian mariners of the Merchant Marine.   In the early days of America's involvement in World War II, German U- boats sank numerous vessels during the Battle of the Atlantic. While  many think of convoys being attacked as close to Europe, the German  Navy also took the war to the U.S. eastern seaboard.   In March 1942 alone, 27 ships from six Allied Nations were sunk off  U.S. shores. All told, 733 American cargo ships were lost during World  War II.   Despite this danger, some 215,000 civilian merchant marines served  with courage to establish and maintain critical supply lines, ensuring  that vital supplies, cargo, and personnel reached Allied Forces in both  Europe and Asia.   Though they had no military standing or government benefits, these  civilian mariners often faced death from German U-boat assaults. These  brave mariners paid a heavy price in service to their country,  suffering the highest casualty rate of any branch of the U.S. Armed  Forces during World War II.   An estimated 9,300 mariners lost their lives and another 12,000 were  wounded to make sure our uniformed servicemembers could keep fighting.  Unfortunately, their sacrifices are commonly underappreciated and often  overlooked.   They were not even considered veterans until Congress remedied that  disservice in 1988. Many of our histories of World War II gave them a  passing mention or do not recognize their vital role in ensuring the  success of the Allied forces. It is time that we give these brave  mariners the recognition they so richly deserve.   I thank Mr. Garamendi for introducing this bill to Congress, and I  urge Members to vote ``yes.'' I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi), who is chair of the Subcommittee on  Readiness on the Armed Services Committee and a highly valued Member of  this House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Suozzi), who is a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green), who chairs the Financial Services Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I, too, join in thanking Representatives Garamendi, Brooks, and Young  in bringing this bill to the floor of the House of Representatives and  working for its passage.   I would just say a word about the gentleman from California (Mr.  Garamendi), whom I have known for many, many years. We served in the  California legislature together, and, of course, I am not surprised  that he took time out to recognize those who have not been given credit  for their work and what they have done in support of our country. This  is typical of Mr. Garamendi and the way that he has conducted himself  throughout his entire career.   I also thank those Members who have come to the floor today to join  in this very special recognition. This is a bipartisan bill that honors  those who answered our Nation's call to duty, regardless of the danger  and without expectation of accolades. Now it is time that we give these  courageous mariners the recognition they have more than earned.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
