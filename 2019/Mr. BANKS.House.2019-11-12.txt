 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my legislation, H.R.  3996, the VA Design-Build Construction Enhancement Act.   I first want to thank Mr. Perlmutter, my colleague on the other side  of the aisle, for his tireless support and advocacy for veterans in the  Denver area and beyond and for cosponsoring this legislation with me.   Design-build has proven itself to be an innovative and effective  method for managing construction projects in the private sector and in  some key Federal agencies. The most prominent application of design- build was to rebuild the Pentagon after 9/11, which was completed in  less than 1 year.   VA has a multibillion-dollar backlog of construction projects but has  never made much use of the design-build method, despite it being  available for over 20 years. Unfortunately, one of the few times the VA  did use a method similar to design-build was during the troubled  Aurora, Colorado, replacement medical center project that we have  already heard about today.   And as Dr. Roe noted, the VA only involved the construction  contractor in the design decisions after the design was already  complete. Design-build seems to have been given a bad name in the VA-- unfairly--as a result.   My legislation today makes it clear that design-build is available to  the VA and encourages the Department to use it when appropriate, as is  already stipulated by the law, and incorporates design-build training  into the VA construction management curriculum.   Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure that the VA is using every available  tool to deliver world-class facilities to our veterans. When used  correctly, design-build can speed up construction and minimize costly  change orders. That is exactly what we need in the VA, and I am  committed to making sure that that happens.
