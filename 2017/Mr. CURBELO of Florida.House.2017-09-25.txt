(c) Hurricane Maria Disaster Zone and Disaster Area.--For       purposes of this title--        (1) Hurricane maria disaster zone.--The term ``Hurricane       Maria disaster zone'' means that portion of the Hurricane       Maria disaster area determined by the President to warrant       individual or individual and public assistance from the       Federal Government under such Act by reason of Hurricane       Maria.        (2) Hurricane maria disaster area.--The term ``Hurricane       Maria disaster area'' means an area with respect to which a       major disaster has been declared by the President before       September 21, 2017, under section 401 of such Act by reason       of Hurricane  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, since Hurricane Irma hit south Florida earlier this  month, my staff and I have been on the ground in the Florida Keys and  South Dade helping our district with immediate recovery efforts and  listening to what our constituents need going forward.   In the lower and middle Florida Keys, it is hard to find someone who  hasn't been affected financially by this storm's devastation. From  restaurant workers who have been without a paycheck to fishermen whose  boats or traps were damaged, small businesses and the families that  depend on them are really struggling.   In South Dade, crops and agricultural structures critical to daily  operations were devastated by wind. Some small farms that were already  struggling to make ends meet have now exhausted their cash on hand to  pay for cleanup, leaving them little to pay workers or keep up with  their planting schedule.   Mr. Speaker, my district and similar communities throughout Florida,  Louisiana, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands need relief,  and this bill is a great start.   Through the business tax credit for wages, small-business owners like  Owen, a lobster and crab fisherman whose traps in the middle Keys were  destroyed by Hurricane Irma, will be able to claim a tax credit for 40  percent of employee wages. That is money Owen can use to get his  employees back to work as soon as possible.   The bill will also allow taxpayers to refer to earned income from the  immediately preceding year for purposes of determining the earned  income tax credit. That is over 415,000 hurricane survivors in Miami- Dade, and nearly 7,500 in Monroe County, who will be able to keep more  of their paycheck when the time comes to pay taxes next year.   We are also going to make it easier for individuals and businesses,  like farmers struggling in South Dade and fishermen in the Keys, to  deduct more of the costs from the extensive property damage these  storms left behind.   This legislation would also give anyone struggling with initial  recovery immediate access to their retirement savings, without  penalties, so they can make ends meet and take care of their families.   Lastly, this legislation will lift caps on charitable giving to  qualified hurricane relief organizations, encouraging more American  businesses and individuals to continue generously supporting their  fellow citizens.   Mr. Speaker, Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, the U.S. Virgin  Islands, and Puerto Rico need Congress to act. My constituents and  those in other communities like my district don't have time to wait.  They certainly don't have time to play political games. The Disaster  Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 will give them  the means to recover faster and rebuild their communities better and  stronger than before. This tax relief package we are considering  deserves bipartisan support from my colleagues.   I thank Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means Committee for allowing  me to shape this legislation for the benefit of south Florida  residents, especially those in Monroe County who were hardest hit by  Hurricane Irma. I hope we can get this done today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, briefly, I want to first convey  my gratitude to the gentleman from Massachusetts because, indeed, the  first day I returned after being back home helping my community  recover, the gentleman expressed his disposition to work together. That  really meant a lot to me, and I know it meant a lot to all of our  colleagues who represent areas that were hit hard by the storm. We  should work more closely together. We can always do better. However,  let's not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.   The bottom line is that there are a lot of provisions in this  legislation that are supported by Members of both parties, and there  are millions of Americans who are suffering, especially in south  Florida and especially in Puerto Rico that was hit hard by Maria just a  few days ago, and they are counting on us to deliver something. We can  always do more later, but this is a good package that will help people  get back up on their feet.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the House Committee on Transportation  and Infrastructure.    Mr. Speaker, no one was laughing at anything  that the gentleman said. We were listening intently.   The reason that we are all here is because the people of Florida, the  people of Texas, the people of Louisiana, the people of Puerto Rico,  and the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands need our help. They were hit  in the last few weeks, and they need our help. There are people  struggling in all of these communities.   Is this bill perfect?   No. I have never seen one.   Can we do more?   Yes. We must do more, but this is an important first step.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Hensarling), the distinguished chairman of the House Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Denham).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means  Committee staff for their work on this legislation. It has been a tough  couple weeks in the State of Florida, especially down in my  community. Again, I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts, Mr.  Neal. As I said earlier, when I came back here, the first conversation  we had was about helping south Florida, and he said he was willing and  certainly able to do it.    Here today, we are trying to take that first step to help the people  of Florida, to help the people of Texas, of Louisiana, of the Virgin  Islands, of Puerto Rico. But as often happens in the House, if  something isn't perfect, then we get nothing. That is wrong. That is  wrong, because there are people out there who need the help, people who  don't have a roof, people who don't have a home, people who have been  without power.   I visited the Marathon Emergency Operations Center, Mr. Speaker. It  was replete with people buzzing, everyone working hard, full of energy,  even though they hadn't slept in days. The emergency operations manager  there told me that a third of the employees there who were helping  their fellow residents, conchs in the Florida Keys, had lost their  homes.   This is about them, and we can help improve their lives today, and we  can work together to do more later, and we should. But why should the  perfect be the enemy of the good? Why, when we have the opportunity to  help people, because some think we should be doing even more, we are  going to give them absolutely nothing? I think that is a major mistake,  and it sends the wrong message.   Throughout this debate, we have seen everything from posturing to  name calling, and we wonder why so many Americans reject this  institution and are disappointed by it. We have to do better, and we  can do better. It would send a strong message if we all voted for this  legislation to take this first step to helping the people of the  Florida Keys, of south Florida, of Texas, of Louisiana, of the U.S.  Virgin Islands, of Puerto Rico, help them get back up on their feet.   Mr. Speaker, this is very important, and on behalf of my community  and a lot of people who have, quite frankly, lost their lives, I ask  all of my colleagues to join together and to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
