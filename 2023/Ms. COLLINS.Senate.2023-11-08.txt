 Madam President, today I rise to introduce the Peer  Support Services Center of Excellence Act, a bipartisan bill that I  have authored to help combat the vast and growing opioid epidemic. I  want to acknowledge and thank Senator Shaheen for her leadership on  this effort, and I look forward to continuing to work with her and  others on this important legislation.   Last year in Maine, 716 people died from a drug overdose--a record  number. Tragically, this was the third consecutive year that Maine set  a record for fatal overdoses. Nationwide, nearly 110,000 Americans were  lost in 2022 to overdoses. It is clear that we need to take an all-of- the-above approach to tackle this crisis. This includes support for  education and prevention, treatment, law enforcement, and border  security. No single focus will be enough on its own.   One ongoing challenge to reducing the number of overdose deaths is  that far too often individuals suffer an addiction relapse. Indeed, a  nonfatal overdose is a leading predictor for a future fatal overdose.  We must do more to address this reality. Between 40 and 60 percent of  individuals in treatment for substance use disorders relapse, and this  rate is often much higher for those struggling with opioid addiction.  Relapse rates are high, but that does not mean relapse is inevitable.   One way that individuals struggling with addiction are finding  support is through peer recovery groups. In 2018, Senator Shaheen and I  introduced the Opioid Peer Support Networks Act, much of which was  enacted as part of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act that  year. Our bill fostered the expansion of peer support networks through  the creation of a National Peer-Run Training and Technical Assistance  Center for Addiction Recovery Support. This center provides no-cost  training and assistance to recovery community organizations, or RCOs,  and peer support networks to integrate peer support workers into  nontraditional settings, build and strengthen the capacity of RCOs,  enhance the professionalism of peers through workforce development, as  well as provide evidence-based and practice-based tool kits and  resource information to stakeholders.   This national center has enhanced the field of peer recovery support  services. Through the center's work, in fiscal year 2022, nearly 2,000  individuals were trained in how to support RCOs and peer support  networks, and nearly 200 individuals were trained to provide  specialized technical assistance, evaluate and improve the  effectiveness of services provided by RCOs, and offer translation and  interpretation services, data collection support, and capacity building  expertise. This training is improving the services that are offered by  organizations across our country, and the center has provided a  platform for experts and recovery centers to learn from each other's  experiences.   In peer support networks, individuals and families battling addiction  help one another stay firm on the road to recovery by assisting with  employment, education, housing, health and overall well-being. I have  visited the Bangor Area Recovery Network, or BARN, in Brewer, ME, which  is a volunteer-led organization that provides support to individuals  recovering from addiction. BARN is a model for peer-led counseling and  brings hope, recovery support, and healing to those struggling with  substance abuse. Individuals who are themselves in recovery can make  that critical connection to others facing addiction, which, in turn,  can make the recovery process sustainable and reduce the stigma of  addiction and treatment.   In recent years, in response to growing need and community efforts to  expand recovery programming, Maine has seen the presence of RCOs like  BARN grow across our State. As of January 2023, there were 19 recovery  centers--from Sanford to Caribou--operated by people in recovery who  are serving their local communities by offering peer-based support  services, among other activities.   After touring BARN and other similar organizations, I believe the  emergence of peer-based and other recovery support services is one of  the most significant trends in the addiction field. Peer-based recovery  support services are unique in that they cover a wide range of  activities not generally offered by treatment providers. This includes  recovery coaching, support groups, sober social activities, as well as  housing, transportation, and employment services. In offering services  beyond treatment, this model provides the strong support system that is  essential to recovery. As one of BARN's core beliefs tells us, ``A  supportive community is vital to a successful recovery.''   The Opioid Peer Support Networks Act brought critical training and  assistance to these on-the-ground peer-to-peer networks and helped  build up these important recovery support systems. Our new bill  reauthorizes the National Peer-Run Training and Technical Assistance  Center for Addiction Recovery Support that is set to expire, and it  expands upon the work made possible by our bill that was enacted 5  years ago. In addition to reauthorizing the center, our bill would  create a pilot program for a regional center of excellence that could  assist the national center and tailor its work to the needs of a  particular region.   We believe that the development of regional assistance programs,  along with the continuation of a national center, will promote  coordination and effectiveness of technical assistance delivery.  According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration, utilizing a regional model to grow the national  center's reach may be an effective way to triage and distribute  technical assistance requests and ensure that all entry points are  coordinated centrally by retaining the National Center.   Tackling the opioid epidemic, both its causes and consequences,  requires a multi-pronged approach. The bipartisan bill I have  introduced continues and builds upon one proven way to respond to this  growing problem--supporting individuals in recovery through proven  support systems.   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I rise to introduce the Peer  Support Services Center of Excellence Act, a bipartisan bill that I  have authored to help combat the vast and growing opioid epidemic.
