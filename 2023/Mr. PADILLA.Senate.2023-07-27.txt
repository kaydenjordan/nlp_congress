 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Executive Calendar No. 266, Tara K. McGrath, to be U.S. Attorney for  the Southern District of California; that the Senate vote on the  nomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the  Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, let me just add that it is beyond  disappointing and beyond frustrating that our colleague from Ohio  continues to hold the Senate process hostage for political gain.   I won't get into the credentials and stellar qualifications that Ms.  McGrath has to serve in this capacity. I will reserve that for a more  constructive day relative to her confirmation. But I will note this  with a sense of urgency. In the Southern District of California, the  current acting U.S. attorney is due to step down on August 4. So there  is an urgency to this particular confirmation--a confirmation which was  approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by the way, but has not  been voted on by the entire Senate.   And it is not just this confirmation. I am not going to talk about  Federal judges. I am not going to talk about military promotions that  are on hold because of politics being played on the other side of the  aisle.   I believe the American people deserve to know that when even the  confirmation of U.S. attorneys are being held up, it is impeding the  investigation of crimes. It is impeding the enforcement of our Nation's  laws. It is impeding the cooperation and coordination between various  prosecutors' offices throughout the country. That is the job of a U.S.  attorney. And it is shameful that Republican colleagues are holding  these confirmations up, particularly of candidates for these positions  who are far and above the qualifications necessary to serve in these  capacities.                                    Energy    Mr. President, I also rise to speak today on this hot summer day in  Washington, DC, where the forecast, as I was on the way in, showed that  it was going to be 99 degrees today. Well, 35 years ago, on a scorching  98-degree summer day here in Washington, NASA scientist Dr. James  Hansen testified in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee  to share an alarming conclusion.   Thirty-five years ago, he said this: Manmade pollution was causing  our climate to change. It was one of the earliest major scientific  warnings that, without action, one day our planet would be at risk of  catastrophic climate events.   So colleagues, I am here to say that day has come. This past May, in  a report in the Environmental Research Letters journal, researchers  found a direct correlation between increased carbon emissions and  wildfires in the Western United States.   Eight of the last ten largest wildfires in California history have  occurred in just the last 6 years. In June, last month, New York City  experienced the worst air pollution recorded on the planet, while  Washington, DC, was blanketed in smoke not because of wildfires in  California but because of wildfires in Canada. And over the last  several weeks, a heat wave has brought record-breaking temperatures  from coast to coast and put over 140 million Americans under heat  alerts. And just today, we learned that this July is set to be the  hottest month in recorded history.   So the question is no longer hypothetical; the question is real: How  viable of a planet are we going to leave to our children and our  grandchildren? We must act, colleagues. Yet, even in the year 2023,  with indisputable proof in many scientific studies, too many of our  Republican colleagues remain defiant.   Now, I will acknowledge that the deliberate attempt to distract from  the problem at hand has evolved over time. What was once ``climate  change is a hoax'' has become ``defense of industry'' or ``market-based  solutions.'' What was once the Republican chair of the Senate  Environment and Public Works Committee bringing a snowball onto the  floor of the U.S. Senate to somehow disprove the dynamic of a warming  planet has been replaced with press conferences promising energy  independence if we only allow continued polluting.   It is a new kind of climate denial, a sophisticated campaign to  create delays and undermine climate progress in order to enrich major  corporations' bottom lines. But, make no mistake, the result is the  same: Republicans continuing to obstruct desperately needed solutions.   They vilify President Biden and all of us Democrats for having the  courage to fight for bold action, and all too often they hold up  California as the punching bag for enacting lifesaving policies that  they disagree with. That is right; they bash California for having the  audacity to lead.   So, today, I want to set the record straight. Yes, in California we  have long accepted the truth about climate change, and as a result, we  have been trailblazers for enacting environmental protections and  leading our clean energy transition. As far back as 1966, California  established the first tailpipe  [[Page S3717]]  emission standards for passenger vehicles in the Nation. Three years  later, after a catastrophic oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara,  Californians rose up and demanded environmental protections, spurring  the birth of the modern-day environmental movement and eventually  creating the very first Earth Day, which we now celebrate every year.   Mr. President, flash forward to 2006, when California passed AB 32,  also known as the Global Warming Solutions Act--legislation with the  bold goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. I was  elected to the State senate that year, eager to be part of  implementation of that measure, and I went on to serve for 6 years as  chair of the State senate Committee on Energy.   Now, since then, California has continued to lead the Nation with  increasingly ambitious goals for cutting emissions, conserving public  lands, becoming the first State committed to conserving 30 percent of  our lands and water by the year 2030, a goal that President Biden has  called for nationally.   Just this month, California's environmental leadership came in the  form of the Nation's heavy-duty truck manufacturers agreeing to comply  with California's first-in-the-Nation zero emission truck standards,  which will advance the adoption of 100 percent zero-emission trucks by  2036, a truly historic achievement. And I think it is important to  repeat and emphasize here, I am talking about a standard that truck  manufacturers have agreed to.   But let me make another point, Mr. President, just to demonstrate  just how partisan this conversation ought not to be. It has not just  been Democrats in California who have led the way. As President, former  California Senator Richard Nixon signed into law landmark legislation,  including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act of  1970, the Endangered Species Act, and the creation of the EPA. That is  right; a Republican President did that.   As President, former California Gov. Ronald Reagan built on  California's leadership when he signed the first national energy  efficiency standards for appliances into law. That is right; a  Republican President did that.   It was Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who established the California  EPA, and it was Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who signed the  2006 Global Warming Solutions Act that I referenced earlier.   The net result in California's efforts is that, in 2023, our State  has a diverse portfolio of clean energy resources, not hypothetical-- operational solar, wind, and geothermal energy--all while fostering a  growing economy that is on its way to becoming the fourth largest  economy in the world. It is that long-term vision and commitment to  clean energy and a transition to it that will bring the first-ever  transition to Caltrain's all-new electric fleet in 2024, a three- decade-long project that will result in the first transition from  diesel trains in the West. It is that same vision that diversified our  energy sources so that, after a winter of extreme storms like we saw  this last year, we can take advantage of torrential rains with  hydropower capabilities or reap the benefits of our expanded solar  capacity and battery storage.   I raise these examples, colleagues, not just to showcase California's  leadership but to prove that these aren't just lofty climate  aspirations. California is proving that a clean energy transition is  not only possible; it is actually good for our economy. And, today, the  Federal Government is smart to follow California's lead.   Over the last 2 years, we have made huge strides toward transitioning  our Nation's energy sector to clean, renewable sources and adopting  California's clean vehicle emission standards. When we passed the  bipartisan infrastructure law, we also chose to invest in clean  schoolbuses, to invest in electrifying public transit across the  country. We chose to expand electric vehicle charging stations to make  the switch to electric vehicles that much more convenient for  Americans.   Last summer, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which is jump- starting clean energy and clean transportation projects, providing tax  credits for Americans to upgrade their appliances and their homes and  making electric vehicle ownership more affordable.   And, more recently, we were able to defend our hard-fought gains  during the debt ceiling negotiations from Republicans who wanted to  undercut our progress.   Now, part of making sure we fully realize the investments in the IRA  is speeding up the permitting process for transmission lines that are  needed to deliver the renewable energy from where it occurs as a  natural resource to the communities where it is needed. It also means  pushing Agencies like the EPA to embark on ambitious regulatory efforts  on light- and heavy-duty vehicles, trains, and ships, thanks to  investments in the IRA.   So when we hear the defeatist attitude of Republicans who say this is  going to hurt jobs, we can show them the millions of good-paying jobs  being created by the Inflation Reduction Act.   When we hear about alleged overreliance on foreign imports, we will  show them badly needed investments in domestic manufacturing and a new  generation of American solar, wind, geothermal, and green hydrogen.   And when we hear cynics who prefer inaction to intervention, a planet  burning to Congress acting, we will show them that the audacity to lead  has paid off before, and it can pay off again.   Now, I am willing to forgive all that has been said--all the  misinformation about climate change, all the ranting about California-- if my Republican colleagues were just willing to do what is right. Now,  in the end, I wouldn't even ask my Republican colleagues to reverse  their positions and have the courage to lead. I will settle for their  courage to follow or at least get out of the way because California has  already shown us the path forward.   Have the courage, colleagues. Have the courage for the sake of our  children and future generations.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today as a proud, lifelong Los  Angeles Dodgers fan to recognize the achievements and legacy of  Fernando ``El Toro'' Valenzuela, whose jersey will soon be retired by  the Los Angeles Dodgers.   Fernando Valenzuela stunned the baseball world, captured the hearts  of millions of Californians, and inspired Little League baseball  players, future Major League Baseball Hall of Famers, and Mexican  Americans across the country to dream big.   The youngest of 12 children, Valenzuela was born and raised in the  small town of Etchohuaquila, in Sonora, Mexico. His parents Avelino and  Maria were poor farmers who worked the land with their children.  Valenzuela learned to play baseball from his older brothers and started  pitching professionally in Mexico at the age of 17. Discovered by  legendary Dodgers scout Mike Brito, Valenzuela soon made his Major  League debut at the age of 19. In 1980, his first season, he pitched in  relief in 10 games and did not surrender a single earned run.   The 1981 season saw the cultural phenomenon of ``Fernandomania,''  which brought one of the best stretches of pitching in Major League  Baseball history. He was on the mound for the Dodgers as their opening  day starting pitcher and proceeded to win his first eight starts--at  that time, the longest such streak since World War II. He finished the  season with 11 complete games, 8 shutouts, and a 2.48 ERA. His  sensational pitching brought packed crowds to Dodger Stadium as he  captured the hearts of Los Angeles' Mexican-American community, and  brought record crowds to every stadium he pitched in across the  country.   During the deciding game 5 of the 1981 National League Championship  Series against the Expos, Valenzuela locked into a grueling pitching  duel for over eight innings and helped the Dodgers win the National  League pennant. In game 3 of the 1981 World Series, Valenzuela pitched  a complete game against the Yankees and jumpstarted a four-game Dodgers  winning streak on their way to winning the World Series title.   On a personal note, as a kid growing up playing Little League  baseball in the San Fernando Valley, I remember watching Fernando  pitch, his iconic wind-up with his leg sweeping up chest high, his  quick glance toward the heavens, and suddenly, El Toro would deliver a  devastating screwball.   Valenzuela would go on to pitch for the Dodgers for 11 seasons, play  for several other MLB teams, and even pitch in the Mexican Pacific  League when he was nearly 44 years old. He ended his career as a World  Series Champion, a six-time All-Star, a two-time Silver Slugger winner,  and a Gold Glove winner. He also became the first player--and remains  the only player--ever to win the Rookie of the Year and Cy Young awards  in the same season for his remarkable 1981 season. And today, he  remains part of the Dodgers organization as the color commentator for  the team's Spanish language television broadcast.   More than 40 years later, Fernandomania lives on. Valenzuela  continues to bring immense joy and pride to the Mexican-American  community in Los Angeles and around the country. I am proud that the  Dodgers will be retiring Valenzuela's No. 34 jersey, and I am proud to  recognize his many years of dedication to the Los Angeles community and  for inspiring generations of Latinos to pursue their dreams and be  champions in their own right.   So now, enshrined in Dodger Stadium alongside names like  ``Robinson,'' ``Koufax,'' ``Drysdale,'' ``Hodges,'' and ``Snider,''  finally, a new number will hang forever--34, for Valenzuela.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to introduce the bipartisan  Economic Empowerment Through Predevelopment Act. This legislation would  improve support for capacity building and early-stage project  development activities to ensure inclusive economic growth across  communities.   Predevelopment activities are projects that must be completed prior  to construction to advance infrastructure and development projects from  concept to reality. This includes planning and design, community asset  mapping, training, technical assistance, feasibility and environmental  studies, demonstration projects, permitting, and organizational  capacity building.   This bill would enhance the Economic Development Administration's  role in the initial stages of a project by authorizing the Agency to  make grants and cooperative agreements for predevelopment activities  and capacity building purposes.   Many underserved, low-income, and rural communities simply do not  have the institutions, expertise, or capacity to plan, design,  coordinate, or implement new economic development initiatives. Building  an inclusive economy requires policies for comprehensive economic  development plans that better equip our communities to sustain and grow  investments, leverage community-based assets, and diversify local  economies to withstand potential disruptions.   Additional support for predevelopment projects would also allow for  more intentional investments and longer term sustainability in local  economies by preventing costly mistakes or unwise investments.   Since the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and  the American Rescue Plan Act, Congress, State and local governments, as  well as community organizations, have increasingly turned to EDA and  economic development districts for assistance in predevelopment  activities. This legislation will strengthen the Agency's work in this  space.   I thank Senator Cassidy for introducing this important legislation  with me in the Senate. I hope all of our colleagues will join us in  supporting this bill for the economic empowerment of our communities.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Ms. Warren, Mr. Lujan, Mr. Durbin,          Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Booker):   S. 2606. A bill to amend section 249 of the Immigration and  Nationality Act to render available to certain long-term residents of  the United States the  [[Page S3762]]  benefit under that section; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Renewing  Immigration Provisions of the Immigration Act of 1929 Act.   This legislation would permit individuals who have lived in the  United States continuously for at least 7 years to file for lawful  permanent residence here.   The Renewing Immigration Provisions of the Immigration Act of 1929  Act will provide long-term residents of the U.S. a path to lawful  permanent residence.   Specifically, this bill would amend the existing Registry mechanism  in the Immigration and Nationality Act by opening the application to  register permanent or adjust status to long-term residents who have  lived in the United States for at least 7 years at the time of filing.   This bill would also allow long-term residents who have been in the  United States for at least 7 years, waiting patiently for a visa number  to become available, to immediately file an application to register  permanent or adjust status.   This legislation has the added benefit of creating a much needed  pathway to permanent residency for Dreamers and forcibly displaced  individuals, such as TPS holders, who have been stuck in legal limbo  for years.   By making the eligibility cutoff rolling, this bill would also  preempt the need for Congress to repeatedly update the Registry's  cutoff date to a specific year of entry into the United States.   There is strong precedent for Congress to advance the Registry date,  which it has done on a bipartisan basis four times since it first  codified the Registry in 1929. In 1958, Congress opened the Registry  mechanism to long-term residents of the United States who had entered  the country improperly, overstayed a visa, or otherwise violated the  terms of a temporary period of entry. Congress clearly intended the  Registry to allow undocumented immigrants to adjust to lawful permanent  resident status.   Currently, the eligibility cutoff date for the Registry is January 1,  1972, more than 50 years ago. Just a handful of immigrants can  currently satisfy this cutoff entry date requirement, rendering the  1972 entry cutoff all but meaningless. From 2015 to 2019, only 305  individuals adjusted their status based on the Registry, compared to  the 58,914 individuals who did so between 1985 and 1989. If this  legislation passed today, over 8 million individuals--who are already  living in the United States and have longstanding ties to their  communities--would become eligible to apply for permanent residency  through the Registry.   Today, about 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United  States. It is not feasible or productive to remove all of them, and it  would significantly hurt the U.S. economy to do so. The overwhelming  majority of these undocumented immigrants have established roots in the  United States and are law-abiding citizens. They are integral parts of  our communities who work essential jobs, pay taxes, and even serve in  our military. Leaving them without a path to permanent residency  relegates them to second-class status and denies them the opportunity  to fulfill the American Dream.   It is imperative that we create a path to permanent residence status  for immigrants who lack certainty about their futures.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Lujan, Mr.          Van Hollen, Mr. Casey, Ms. Cortez Masto, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr.          Markey, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Murphy, Mr.          Heinrich, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Smith, Ms. Duckworth, Mrs. Shaheen,          Mr. Booker, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. Padilla):   S. 2608. A bill to provide for the long-term improvement of public  school facilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Water  Efficiency, Conservation, and Sustainability Act of 2023. This  legislation would authorize $550 million for the Environmental  Protection Agency to address water inefficiencies and losses in public  water systems.   Every year, household leaks waste nearly 1 trillion gallons of water  nationwide, increasing water bills and wasting water meant for critical  drinking water and clean water uses.   The Water Efficiency, Conservation, and Sustainability Act of 2023  creates a suite of options for States, municipalities, water systems,  and Tribal nations to address water inefficiencies and losses in public  water systems and to support leak reduction as one of the most cost- effective urban water management tools we have.   Leaking pipes waste an estimated 17 percent of water before a drop  reaches a consumer's faucet. In my home State of California, 8 percent  is wasted in a State that cannot afford any waste as we face  increasingly unpredictable weather whiplash between drought and  flooding.   Water efficiency is the most cost-effective way to ensure clean,  affordable drinking water for communities across the country. Much like  energy efficiency measures, improving water efficiency saves consumers  money, reduces demand, decreases strain on water supply systems, and  saves energy.   Yet Federal spending on energy efficiency and renewable energy in  outpaced spending on water efficiency and water reuse by approximately  80 to 1 since 2000, resulting in millions of gallons wasted each year  that could otherwise be saved or utilized.   Achieving widespread water efficiency will require both inside-the- home and system upgrades. Fixes at the individual building level can  add up to make a big difference. The EPA estimates that installation of  water-efficient fixtures and appliances can reduce water use 20 percent  and save money for consumers.   The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided a  historic level of water infrastructure investment--including for Bureau  of Reclamation States and for wastewater efficiency--but more  investment is needed in the water systems that deliver drinking water  to our homes and businesses across all States.   As drought continues to impact the Western United States and regions  across the country, investing in resilient water supplies is an  increasingly urgent priority for States, water systems, and families  facing rising water rates.   In a survey completed as part of a 2014 GAO report, 40 out of 50  State water managers expected water shortages in some portion of their  State in the next decade. Improving water efficiency saves money, saves  energy, and helps ensure a more resilient water supply.   I would like to thank my House colead, Congressman Levin, for  championing this effort with me, and I look forward to working with my  colleagues to enact the Water Efficiency, Conservation, and  Sustainability Act of 2023.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Marshall, Mr. Bennet, Mr.          Lujan, Mr. Padilla, Mr.  [[Page S3764]]          Kelly, Ms. Sinema, and Mr. Heinrich):   S. 2696. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to modify the  water conservation or irrigation efficiency practice waiver authority;  to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    Madam President, I rise in support of the Housing for  All Act of 2023, which I introduced today.   Our Nation's homelessness and affordable housing crises have reached  a breaking point. As of January 2022, over 580,000 individuals in the  United States--disproportionately people of color--experienced  homelessness. The rate of homelessness has increased by 6 percent since  2017. In Los Angeles County alone, the mortality rate for people  experiencing homelessness increased by 55 percent between 2019 to 2021.   The lack of adequate Federal investment in affordable housing and  housing assistance programs contributes to these crises. There is  currently a shortage of 7.3 million affordable and available rental  homes in the United States. According to a recent National Low Income  Housing Coalition report, no State or county exists where a person  working 40 hours a week and earning the State or local minimum wage can  afford to rent a modest two-bedroom apartment, and 86 percent of all  low-income renters in the Nation are considered cost-burdened, spending  more than 30 percent of their income on just housing costs alone.   The affordable housing and homelessness crises are not just a  Democrat problem or an urban problem but impact every Senator's State.  From our metropolitan areas to our rural heartlands, our constituents  everywhere feel the real impact of housing unaffordability. And it is  time for the Federal Government to step up, partner with our State and  local governments alongside service providers on the ground and other  stakeholders, and invest in solving these problems at a rate  commensurate with the need.   I am proud to reintroduce this bill, which represents a comprehensive  approach to tackling housing and homelessness. If enacted, it would  invest in and align Federal resources to support people experiencing  housing instability. To address the affordable housing and homelessness  crises, we must invest in proven policies that support strong,  sustainable, inclusive communities and ensure quality, affordable homes  for all.   Specifically, this bill will address the affordable housing shortage  by investing in the housing trust fund, the Section 202 Supportive  Housing for the Elderly Program, Section 811 Supportive Housing for  Persons with Disabilities Program, and the HOME Program. It establishes  a commission to focus on racial equity in housing and homelessness.   The bill will address homelessness by investing in housing choice  vouchers, project-based rental assistance, emergency solutions grants,  and continuums of care. It also builds on locally-developed and -driven  approaches by creating new grant programs to strengthen mobile crisis  intervention teams; to support hotel and motel conversions to permanent  supportive housing with services; to aid libraries in supporting  persons experiencing homelessness; to provide people living in vehicles  with a safe place to park overnight and facilitate a transition to  stable housing; and to coordinate behavioral health care with  homelessness services. And it commissions a report on the connection  between evictions and emergency rental assistance during the pandemic,  so we can make smarter policies moving forward.   When I have traveled around California--from Los Angeles County and  the Inland Empire to the Central Valley, San Diego, and San Francisco-- to better understand the needs for housing in different communities,  some key elements stood out. On the production side, there is a need  for more dedicated funding for affordable housing from the Federal  Government. There is also missing middle-income housing for families,  especially people of color. And there is not enough housing near  transit. That is why my bill focuses on supporting inclusive, transit- oriented development. When I talked to researchers about keeping  families housed, one main point they made is that we don't have enough  data on renters and evictions, and that is why I wanted to include a  section of the bill on data--so we can make evidence-based policies.   Right now, the cost to build low-income housing in California is very  high in part because of land and material costs and the fragmented way  funding is distributed in California. This is a common problem across  the Nation, not just in California. That is why I included a section to  provide technical assistance for localities navigating Federal and  State housing funding sources.   Affordable housing is essential infrastructure. Every person deserves  dignity, security, and a space of their own.   I want to thank Representatives Ted Lieu and Salud Carbajal for  introducing this bill with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us  in supporting this comprehensive solution to our nationwide affordable  housing and homelessness crises.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Booker, Mr. Brown, Mrs.          Feinstein, Mrs. Gillibrand, Ms. Warren, Mr. Welch, and Mr.          Wyden):   S. 2702. A bill to amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization  Act of 1994 to reauthorize the position of Farmworker Coordinator; to  the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the Voice  for Farm Workers Act of 2023, which I introduced today.   Farmworkers feed our Nation. This is especially true in California,  agricultural heart of the Nation. California is the most successful  State in agricultural production and has the largest population of  farmworkers. During COVID-19, a time of incredible hardship,  farmworkers put food on the tables of millions of Americans despite  working in extreme conditions and facing deep-rooted inequities.   Right now, just one person is statutorily dedicated to serving as a  liaison between farmworkers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture--the  Farmworker Coordinator. While the 2008 farm bill created this position,  Congress has never provided the proper resources to support or staff  this position. The 2023 U.S. Department of Agriculture Equity  Commission Interim Report even included a strong recommendation for the  USDA to fund and elevate roles for professional staff solely dedicated  to farmworkers' concerns and perspectives.   It is time that we support the USDA staff who are dedicated to  integrating the valuable perspectives of farmworkers into the decisions  that directly affect the lives and livelihoods of these workers.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill, which would expand the  current role of USDA Farmworker Coordinator to allow for the  Coordinator to create recommendations for new initiatives and programs,  collaborate within the Department on programmatic and policy decisions  that related to farm and food system workers, and allow for the  employment of additional staff to support the Coordinator in their  duties.   This bill would include additional entities for the Farmworker  Coordinator to consult with, including institutions of higher  education, local education agencies, and community-based nonprofit  organizations, to increase outreach efforts and ensure that more  farmworkers in more communities can be heard.   As we work towards passing this year's farm bill, I urge my  colleagues to consider the farmworkers who keep our families and  communities fed and healthy.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Feinstein,  [[Page S3766]]          Mrs. Gillibrand, Ms. Warren, Mr. Welch, and Mr. Wyden):   S. 2703. A bill to amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization  Act of 1994 to establish the Office of the Farm and Food System  Workforce; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Supporting Our Farm and Food System Workforce Act of 2023, which I  introduced today.   Farm and food system workers feed our Nation. We know this well in  California--the agricultural heart of the Nation--where we have one of  the largest populations of farmworkers and food system workers in the  United States. Throughout pandemic, these workers put food on our  tables and kept our grocery store shelves stocked--despite facing deep- rooted inequities in the workforce and often experiencing food  insecurity themselves.   Right now, just one person in the entire Federal Government is  statutorily dedicated to serving as a liaison between farmworkers and  the U.S. Department of Agriculture--the Farmworker Coordinator. While  the 2008 farm bill created this position, Congress has never provided  the proper resources to support or staff this position. The 2023 U.S.  Department of Agriculture Equity Commission Interim Report even  included a strong recommendation for USDA to fund and elevate roles for  professional staff solely dedicated to farmworkers' concerns and  perspectives.   It is time that we give those who provide the food for our Nation a  voice in the national conversation. We must give farm and food system  workers a dedicated office within the USDA to integrate their  invaluable perspectives into the decisions that directly affect their  lives and livelihoods.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill, which will create the  USDA Office of the Farm and Food System Workforce to not only serve as  a liaison for farm and food system workers but also to provide a  platform for their concerns and interests to assist in the creation of  recommendations and new initiatives for the Department.   The bill would also create a Farm and Food System Worker Advisory  Committee, composed of a diverse cross-section of members representing  these workers' varied interests and perspectives, such as workers  themselves, labor unions, higher education professionals, civil rights  advocates, women worker focused groups, and trusted community-based  nonprofits.   The legislation would also establish a Farm and Food System Workforce  Interagency Council comprised of representatives from various Federal  Agencies to improve coordination, planning, program development, and  policymaking across Cabinet-level leadership. The Office will also  appoint staff to various USDA entities to serve as liaisons on matters  related to farm and food system workers within the Department.   Finally, the bill would require annual, publicly available reports in  multiple languages about the Office's work in the past year, including  recommendations to improve the work and livelihood of farm and food  system workers, climate change impacts on the food system, and the  barriers workers face in accessing Federal programs.   During this year's Farm Bill, I urge my colleagues to remember the  workers behind the American food system, the workers who keep our  families and communities fed and healthy. These workers deserve a seat  at the table.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and Mr. Tillis):   S. 2704. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to establish  an exception to certain payment limitations in the case of person or  legal entity that derives income from agriculture, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Fair Access to  Agriculture Disaster Programs Act of 2023. This legislation would allow  specialty crop producers to access critical disaster relief programs at  the U.S. Department of Agriculture.   Increasingly frequent and catastrophic floods, fires, freezes, and  other disasters are threatening the long-term sustainability of  agriculture across the country.   The impact has been particularly acute for California's agricultural  communities, who face year-round threats from drought, heat, floods,  and fires.   To ensure producers can get back on their feet following natural  disasters, the farm bill authorizes a number of safety net programs.  But these programs simply don't work for specialty crop producers, who,  despite facing the same challenges posed by extreme weather as other  growers, are excluded from meaningful participation in USDA disaster  programs based on the application of outdated adjusted gross income,  AGI, limitations.   As a result, producers from California to Florida are excluded from  accessing critical disaster programs.   The Fair Access to Agriculture Disaster Programs Act would codify  flexibility used in the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program to waive  the AGI limitation for producers that derive 75 percent of their income  from farming, ranching, or related farming practices.   What are referred to as specialty crops are just that--special.  Specialty crops, which include fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried  fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops, are cultivated for food,  medicine, and aesthetic purposes, requiring overall higher inputs and  specialized processes for planting, growing, and harvesting.   Did you know that it costs more than $30,000 to produce an acre of  strawberries? The cost of production for specialty crops is typically  thousands of dollars per acre.   As a result, both large and small producers of specialty crops end up  exceeding the AGI limitations put in place to means-test critical  disaster assistance.   That is why we need to pass the Fair Access to Agriculture Disaster  Programs Act to ensure farmers and ranchers can access agricultural  safety net programs in the wake of increasingly more frequent and  catastrophic disasters.   I would like to thank Senator Tillis for joining me to introduce this  bill, as well as Congressman Panetta for championing this bill in the  House.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Fair Access  to Agriculture Disaster Programs Act as quickly as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Ricketts, and Mr.          Hickenlooper):   S. 2705. A bill to grant States the authority to request additional  nonimmigrant visas for foreign workers in their respective States, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the bipartisan  Economic Empowerment Through Predevelopment Act. This legislation would  improve support for capacity building and early-stage project  development activities to ensure inclusive economic growth across  communities.   Predevelopment activities are projects that must be completed prior  to construction to advance infrastructure and development projects from  concept to reality. This includes planning and design, community asset  mapping, training, technical assistance, feasibility and environmental  studies, demonstration projects, permitting, and organizational  capacity building.   This bill would enhance the Economic Development Administration's  role in the initial stages of a project by authorizing the Agency to  make grants and cooperative agreements for predevelopment activities  and capacity building purposes.   Many underserved, low-income, and rural communities simply do not  have the institutions, expertise, or capacity to plan, design,  coordinate, or implement new economic development initiatives. Building  an inclusive economy requires policies for comprehensive economic  development plans that better equip our communities to sustain and grow  investments, leverage community-based assets, and diversify local  economies to withstand potential disruptions.   Additional support for predevelopment projects would also allow for  more intentional investments and longer term sustainability in local  economies by preventing costly mistakes or unwise investments.   Since the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and  the American Rescue Plan Act, Congress, State and local governments, as  well as community organizations, have increasingly turned to EDA and  economic development districts for assistance in predevelopment  activities. This legislation will strengthen the Agency's work in this  space.   I thank Senator Cassidy for introducing this important legislation  with me in the Senate. I hope all of our colleagues will join us in  supporting this bill for the economic empowerment of our communities.                                  ______    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Renewing  Immigration Provisions of the Immigration Act of 1929 Act.   This legislation would permit individuals who have lived in the  United States continuously for at least 7 years to file for lawful  permanent residence here.   The Renewing Immigration Provisions of the Immigration Act of 1929  Act will provide long-term residents of the U.S. a path to lawful  permanent residence.   Specifically, this bill would amend the existing Registry mechanism  in the Immigration and Nationality Act by opening the application to  register permanent or adjust status to long-term residents who have  lived in the United States for at least 7 years at the time of filing.   This bill would also allow long-term residents who have been in the  United States for at least 7 years, waiting patiently for a visa number  to become available, to immediately file an application to register  permanent or adjust status.   This legislation has the added benefit of creating a much needed  pathway to permanent residency for Dreamers and forcibly displaced  individuals, such as TPS holders, who have been stuck in legal limbo  for years.   By making the eligibility cutoff rolling, this bill would also  preempt the need for Congress to repeatedly update the Registry's  cutoff date to a specific year of entry into the United States.   There is strong precedent for Congress to advance the Registry date,  which it has done on a bipartisan basis four times since it first  codified the Registry in 1929. In 1958, Congress opened the Registry  mechanism to long-term residents of the United States who had entered  the country improperly, overstayed a visa, or otherwise violated the  terms of a temporary period of entry. Congress clearly intended the  Registry to allow undocumented immigrants to adjust to lawful permanent  resident status.   Currently, the eligibility cutoff date for the Registry is January 1,  1972, more than 50 years ago. Just a handful of immigrants can  currently satisfy this cutoff entry date requirement, rendering the  1972 entry cutoff all but meaningless. From 2015 to 2019, only 305  individuals adjusted their status based on the Registry, compared to  the 58,914 individuals who did so between 1985 and 1989. If this  legislation passed today, over 8 million individuals--who are already  living in the United States and have longstanding ties to their  communities--would become eligible to apply for permanent residency  through the Registry.   Today, about 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United  States. It is not feasible or productive to remove all of them, and it  would significantly hurt the U.S. economy to do so. The overwhelming  majority of these undocumented immigrants have established roots in the  United States and are law-abiding citizens. They are integral parts of  our communities who work essential jobs, pay taxes, and even serve in  our military. Leaving them without a path to permanent residency  relegates them to second-class status and denies them the opportunity  to fulfill the American Dream.   It is imperative that we create a path to permanent residence status  for immigrants who lack certainty about their futures.                                  ______    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Water  Efficiency, Conservation, and Sustainability Act of 2023. This  legislation would authorize $550 million for the Environmental  Protection Agency to address water inefficiencies and losses in public  water systems.   Every year, household leaks waste nearly 1 trillion gallons of water  nationwide, increasing water bills and wasting water meant for critical  drinking water and clean water uses.   The Water Efficiency, Conservation, and Sustainability Act of 2023  creates a suite of options for States, municipalities, water systems,  and Tribal nations to address water inefficiencies and losses in public  water systems and to support leak reduction as one of the most cost- effective urban water management tools we have.   Leaking pipes waste an estimated 17 percent of water before a drop  reaches a consumer's faucet. In my home State of California, 8 percent  is wasted in a State that cannot afford any waste as we face  increasingly unpredictable weather whiplash between drought and  flooding.   Water efficiency is the most cost-effective way to ensure clean,  affordable drinking water for communities across the country. Much like  energy efficiency measures, improving water efficiency saves consumers  money, reduces demand, decreases strain on water supply systems, and  saves energy.   Yet Federal spending on energy efficiency and renewable energy in  outpaced spending on water efficiency and water reuse by approximately  80 to 1 since 2000, resulting in millions of gallons wasted each year  that could otherwise be saved or utilized.   Achieving widespread water efficiency will require both inside-the- home and system upgrades. Fixes at the individual building level can  add up to make a big difference. The EPA estimates that installation of  water-efficient fixtures and appliances can reduce water use 20 percent  and save money for consumers.   The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided a  historic level of water infrastructure investment--including for Bureau  of Reclamation States and for wastewater efficiency--but more  investment is needed in the water systems that deliver drinking water  to our homes and businesses across all States.   As drought continues to impact the Western United States and regions  across the country, investing in resilient water supplies is an  increasingly urgent priority for States, water systems, and families  facing rising water rates.   In a survey completed as part of a 2014 GAO report, 40 out of 50  State water managers expected water shortages in some portion of their  State in the next decade. Improving water efficiency saves money, saves  energy, and helps ensure a more resilient water supply.   I would like to thank my House colead, Congressman Levin, for  championing this effort with me, and I look forward to working with my  colleagues to enact the Water Efficiency, Conservation, and  Sustainability Act of 2023.                                  ______    Madam President, I rise in support of the Housing for  All Act of 2023, which I introduced today.   Our Nation's homelessness and affordable housing crises have reached  a breaking point. As of January 2022, over 580,000 individuals in the  United States--disproportionately people of color--experienced  homelessness. The rate of homelessness has increased by 6 percent since  2017. In Los Angeles County alone, the mortality rate for people  experiencing homelessness increased by 55 percent between 2019 to 2021.   The lack of adequate Federal investment in affordable housing and  housing assistance programs contributes to these crises. There is  currently a shortage of 7.3 million affordable and available rental  homes in the United States. According to a recent National Low Income  Housing Coalition report, no State or county exists where a person  working 40 hours a week and earning the State or local minimum wage can  afford to rent a modest two-bedroom apartment, and 86 percent of all  low-income renters in the Nation are considered cost-burdened, spending  more than 30 percent of their income on just housing costs alone.   The affordable housing and homelessness crises are not just a  Democrat problem or an urban problem but impact every Senator's State.  From our metropolitan areas to our rural heartlands, our constituents  everywhere feel the real impact of housing unaffordability. And it is  time for the Federal Government to step up, partner with our State and  local governments alongside service providers on the ground and other  stakeholders, and invest in solving these problems at a rate  commensurate with the need.   I am proud to reintroduce this bill, which represents a comprehensive  approach to tackling housing and homelessness. If enacted, it would  invest in and align Federal resources to support people experiencing  housing instability. To address the affordable housing and homelessness  crises, we must invest in proven policies that support strong,  sustainable, inclusive communities and ensure quality, affordable homes  for all.   Specifically, this bill will address the affordable housing shortage  by investing in the housing trust fund, the Section 202 Supportive  Housing for the Elderly Program, Section 811 Supportive Housing for  Persons with Disabilities Program, and the HOME Program. It establishes  a commission to focus on racial equity in housing and homelessness.   The bill will address homelessness by investing in housing choice  vouchers, project-based rental assistance, emergency solutions grants,  and continuums of care. It also builds on locally-developed and -driven  approaches by creating new grant programs to strengthen mobile crisis  intervention teams; to support hotel and motel conversions to permanent  supportive housing with services; to aid libraries in supporting  persons experiencing homelessness; to provide people living in vehicles  with a safe place to park overnight and facilitate a transition to  stable housing; and to coordinate behavioral health care with  homelessness services. And it commissions a report on the connection  between evictions and emergency rental assistance during the pandemic,  so we can make smarter policies moving forward.   When I have traveled around California--from Los Angeles County and  the Inland Empire to the Central Valley, San Diego, and San Francisco-- to better understand the needs for housing in different communities,  some key elements stood out. On the production side, there is a need  for more dedicated funding for affordable housing from the Federal  Government. There is also missing middle-income housing for families,  especially people of color. And there is not enough housing near  transit. That is why my bill focuses on supporting inclusive, transit- oriented development. When I talked to researchers about keeping  families housed, one main point they made is that we don't have enough  data on renters and evictions, and that is why I wanted to include a  section of the bill on data--so we can make evidence-based policies.   Right now, the cost to build low-income housing in California is very  high in part because of land and material costs and the fragmented way  funding is distributed in California. This is a common problem across  the Nation, not just in California. That is why I included a section to  provide technical assistance for localities navigating Federal and  State housing funding sources.   Affordable housing is essential infrastructure. Every person deserves  dignity, security, and a space of their own.   I want to thank Representatives Ted Lieu and Salud Carbajal for  introducing this bill with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us  in supporting this comprehensive solution to our nationwide affordable  housing and homelessness crises.                                  ______    Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the Voice  for Farm Workers Act of 2023, which I introduced today.   Farmworkers feed our Nation. This is especially true in California,  agricultural heart of the Nation. California is the most successful  State in agricultural production and has the largest population of  farmworkers. During COVID-19, a time of incredible hardship,  farmworkers put food on the tables of millions of Americans despite  working in extreme conditions and facing deep-rooted inequities.   Right now, just one person is statutorily dedicated to serving as a  liaison between farmworkers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture--the  Farmworker Coordinator. While the 2008 farm bill created this position,  Congress has never provided the proper resources to support or staff  this position. The 2023 U.S. Department of Agriculture Equity  Commission Interim Report even included a strong recommendation for the  USDA to fund and elevate roles for professional staff solely dedicated  to farmworkers' concerns and perspectives.   It is time that we support the USDA staff who are dedicated to  integrating the valuable perspectives of farmworkers into the decisions  that directly affect the lives and livelihoods of these workers.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill, which would expand the  current role of USDA Farmworker Coordinator to allow for the  Coordinator to create recommendations for new initiatives and programs,  collaborate within the Department on programmatic and policy decisions  that related to farm and food system workers, and allow for the  employment of additional staff to support the Coordinator in their  duties.   This bill would include additional entities for the Farmworker  Coordinator to consult with, including institutions of higher  education, local education agencies, and community-based nonprofit  organizations, to increase outreach efforts and ensure that more  farmworkers in more communities can be heard.   As we work towards passing this year's farm bill, I urge my  colleagues to consider the farmworkers who keep our families and  communities fed and healthy.                                  ______    Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Supporting Our Farm and Food System Workforce Act of 2023, which I  introduced today.   Farm and food system workers feed our Nation. We know this well in  California--the agricultural heart of the Nation--where we have one of  the largest populations of farmworkers and food system workers in the  United States. Throughout pandemic, these workers put food on our  tables and kept our grocery store shelves stocked--despite facing deep- rooted inequities in the workforce and often experiencing food  insecurity themselves.   Right now, just one person in the entire Federal Government is  statutorily dedicated to serving as a liaison between farmworkers and  the U.S. Department of Agriculture--the Farmworker Coordinator. While  the 2008 farm bill created this position, Congress has never provided  the proper resources to support or staff this position. The 2023 U.S.  Department of Agriculture Equity Commission Interim Report even  included a strong recommendation for USDA to fund and elevate roles for  professional staff solely dedicated to farmworkers' concerns and  perspectives.   It is time that we give those who provide the food for our Nation a  voice in the national conversation. We must give farm and food system  workers a dedicated office within the USDA to integrate their  invaluable perspectives into the decisions that directly affect their  lives and livelihoods.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill, which will create the  USDA Office of the Farm and Food System Workforce to not only serve as  a liaison for farm and food system workers but also to provide a  platform for their concerns and interests to assist in the creation of  recommendations and new initiatives for the Department.   The bill would also create a Farm and Food System Worker Advisory  Committee, composed of a diverse cross-section of members representing  these workers' varied interests and perspectives, such as workers  themselves, labor unions, higher education professionals, civil rights  advocates, women worker focused groups, and trusted community-based  nonprofits.

The Office will also  appoint staff to various USDA entities to serve as liaisons on matters  related to farm and food system workers within the Department.   Finally, the bill would require annual, publicly available reports in  multiple languages about the Office's work in the past year, including  recommendations to improve the work and livelihood of farm and food  system workers, climate change impacts on the food system, and the  barriers workers face in accessing Federal programs.   During this year's Farm Bill, I urge my colleagues to remember the  workers behind the American food system, the workers who keep our  families and communities fed and healthy. These workers deserve a seat  at the table.                                  ______    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Fair Access to  Agriculture Disaster Programs Act of 2023.
