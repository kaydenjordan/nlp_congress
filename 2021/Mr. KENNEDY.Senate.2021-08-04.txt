 Madam President, with respect to my amendment, I offer  it on behalf of myself and Senator Cassidy.   The last 18 months have been challenging for Louisiana. First, there  was Hurricane Laura. Then there was Hurricane Delta. Then there was  Hurricane Zeta. The hurricanes alone did about $25 billion of damage.  Then we had the historic freezes. Then we had historic flooding. The  total amount of damage was $47.1 billion.   My people are tough, but they are tired. This amendment would  appropriate $1.1 billion in community development block grants to help  my people recover.   I bring you a problem but also a solution. Thanks to the efforts of  Senator Cantwell and Senator Schatz and myself, 3 years ago, we  convinced the FCC not to give away the spectrum auction, which belongs  to the American people, and instead to auction it off. There is now $80  billion sitting in Treasury. The money for these block grants would  come from that $80 billion in cash.   Thank you.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
