 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 79th  anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. I recently had the  opportunity to visit with a constituent of mine from Pasco County,  Florida, Mr. Wigmore, on his 100th birthday. Mr. Wigmore is a Pearl  Harbor survivor, and I appreciate his heroism.   While there are very few Pearl Harbor survivors remaining throughout  our Nation, unfortunately, we must never forget their bravery, service,  and sacrifice.   On the morning of December 7, 1941, Japan launched a sneak attack on  the U.S. Pacific Fleet's base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Tragically,  the attack killed 2,403 American servicemembers--heroes, Mr. Speaker-- and wounded almost 1,200 more. Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the  attackers failed to achieve their objective of disabling the U.S.  fleet.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that we all remember the lives lost on that day  and celebrate the remarkable contributions that the Greatest Generation  made for all of us.                            ____________________
