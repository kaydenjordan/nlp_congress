 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this evening, I want to talk a little  about the nexus of high prescription drug costs and the opioid epidemic  that has gripped my State and our country--the No. 1 public health  crisis in America today. It is a story of greed, frankly, and it is a  story of the need for some fixes here in Congress to keep it from  happening again.   With regard to the opioid crisis, I think the degree that this is  affecting our communities is well documented. Some 72,000 Americans  died last year of overdoses from drugs. This is the high water mark for  our country. It is a grim statistic. More than two-thirds of those  overdose deaths involve what is called opioids. This would be heroin,  prescription drugs, and pain killers, and also the new synthetic  opioids--the fentanyl, which is responsible for most of those opioid  deaths.   I think we have made good progress over the past couple of years here  in Congress in passing new legislation to help to address this  problem--new innovative ways to get people into treatment and longer  term recovery, which  [[Page S7574]]  we know works well in some instances--and also to do a better job on  prevention and education.   So I do think those numbers will begin to turn around, but they  haven't yet. They haven't yet. We have much more work to do. The  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which we passed, is starting  to work. The Cures Act is starting to work. Most recently, the  President signed legislation to try to reduce the cost of this  synthetic opioid coming into our country, mostly from China, mostly  through the U.S. mail system, based on research that we had done. That  is called the STOP Act.   So, again, we are making some progress, but these overdose death  rates are just unbelievably high, and it is a tragic situation, not  just in my State, which is probably top three or four in the country,  but throughout our Nation.   There is a miracle drug that can be used to reverse the effects of an  overdose, and one reason we are beginning to see some progress in some  regions of my State and around the country is that we are getting this  drug out to more first responders and others who can, in effect, save  people from an overdose. Then, of course, the trick is to get that  person into treatment, and not to just have these overdoses continue to  occur. That is where the more innovative programming is starting to  make a difference. But I guess I could say that we have never in our  history as a country had more of a need for this miracle drug to reduce  the effects, to reverse the effect, of an overdose. It is called  naloxone, and naloxone, again, is something that we are using more and  more, and we are saving more and more lives.   I am going to talk this evening about a company that exploited the  opioid epidemic by dramatically increasing the price of this naloxone  drug by more than 600 percent just in the space of a few years.   The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair  alongside Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware, conducted a year-long  investigation--a bipartisan investigation, a really nonpartisan  investigation--into this naloxone issue. We were concerned about the  rising cost in order to find out why it was happening.   We focused on a pharmaceutical company called Kaleo and their  naloxone auto-injector, called Evzio. While naloxone is available in  generic form, two branded products exist for take-home use by untrained  individuals in the case of an overdose. One is Adapt's nasal spray,  called Narcan. You may have heard of that. Narcan is something that  many first responders use and know about.   But the other one is this Evzio drug which is, again, the other  branded naloxone product.   Narcan is available at a cost of about 125 bucks for two doses--$125  for two doses.   Evzio, I thought, was an innovative product when it came out, and  indeed, it has some innovative aspects to it. A unit includes two auto- injectors and a training device that provides verbal instructions to  talk the user through using the product.   Before Kaleo took Evzio to the market, industry experts, who were  impressed with the product, said they should probably charge between  $250 and $300 for this product. Again, it is miracle drug to reverse  the effects of an overdose. They told the company they could ``own the  market'' at that price of $250 to $300 a unit.   Instead, the company decided on charging a higher price, taking it to  the market in October of 2014. So about 4 years ago they took it to the  market for a price of $575 per unit.   With sluggish sales--I think because the price was a little higher  than, again, was advised--Kaleo could have lowered the price. Instead,  the company went the other direction. It implemented a new distribution  model proposed by an outside drug pricing consultant--who has installed  similar distribution models at other pharmaceutical companies, by the  way--and this involves dramatically raising the drug price.   Now, let me explain this. As part of the distribution model, Kaleo  increased Evzio's price from $575 per unit in 2014--again, October  2014--to $3,750 in February of 2016, and then to its current price of  $4,100 in January of 2017.   So they started off a little high, had sluggish sales, and instead of  going lower, they went from 575 bucks to $4,100. That is a 600-percent  increase over the space of about 2\1/2\ years--a 600-percent increase  in this drug that is so needed right now in our communities.   Why did they do this? Well, according to company documents, the new  distribution model for Evzio was designed to ``capitalize on the  opportunity of opioid overdose at epidemic levels.''   So, in effect, from the company's own documents, they chose to  capitalize or exploit the opportunity of the opioid epidemic--this  tragic epidemic that is killing more Americans than any other thing  right now in my home State of Ohio and the No. 1 cause of death of  Americans under the age of 50 in the entire country--72,000 is the  number from last year of overdose deaths.   So as part of this new model the company worked to ensure that  doctors' offices signed the paperwork indicating that Evzio was  medically necessary.   Why is that important?   Well, this ensured government programs like Medicare and Medicaid-- these are programs that, as you know, we already look at every year and  think: Gosh, how do these costs keep going up? What do we do to  maintain these important programs?   But they said they would increase the cost of this drug because they  could get doctors to say that this was medically necessary, and that  meant that these government programs--Medicare and Medicaid--would  cover the cost regardless of what the cost was, even though it had  increased 600 percent in 2\1/2\ years.   So that was the concept behind this new distribution model. It relied  on a portion of the prescriptions being filled by patients with  commercial health plans that covered Evzio at the much higher cost--and  it worked.   For people whose plans didn't cover Evzio or who didn't have  insurance, Kaleo gave the drug to the patient for free. In these  instances, the company incurred the roughly $52 in cost of the goods.  It was worth it because they could get these incredibly high prices  from Medicare and Medicaid.   This distribution model worked, as I mentioned, when physicians  deemed that Evzio was medically necessary. Then it would cover the  cost--Medicare and Medicaid--all the way up to $4,100 a unit.   Under this new model, Evzio fill rates jumped from 39 percent to 81  percent. So it worked. They sold more product. They made a killing, but  at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer and at the expense of all of us,  really.   The majority of Kaleo's initial revenue was from Medicare and  Medicaid, and the resulting cost to the taxpayer to date has been about  $142 million, despite the fact that a much less costly alternative was  readily available.   You will remember that for most of this time Narcan, this other  product--not Evzio but Narcan--was available for $125 for two doses.   So instead of following recommendations by drug pricing experts to  take the product to market at that lower price, the company decided to  exploit this loophole in our health insurance market and charge this  much higher price to the American taxpayer through Medicare and  Medicaid.   Our report from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was  released on the same day that 60 Minutes aired a new story on Kaleo,  its products, and why the price was so high. The findings of our report  were used in that segment to highlight Kaleo's distribution model that  transferred the cost of this drug, effectively, to American taxpayers.  Now, you can see our report online at the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations' website. That PSI report and the 60 Minutes segment  were both released on November 18.   Today, less than a month later, I am very pleased to tell you that  Kaleo has publicly stated its plan to take steps toward now reducing  the cost--the price--of its naloxone auto-injector from the current  price of $4,100 per unit down to $178.   This is a very positive step forward, and I am hopeful that it will  increase access to Naloxone--this critically important overdose  reversal drug that has saved so many thousands of lives already. But I  am also pleased that they made this change because it is going to save  taxpayers a lot of money.   Make no mistake. I don't believe that this change would have occurred  but  [[Page S7575]]  for our year-long investigation, the PSI report, and the 60 Minutes  story shining a light on these incredibly high drug prices. Does  anybody really believe that these prices would have been lowered if not  for exposing it and the transparency that was then able to show what  was happening?   So the bipartisan investigation has produced a good result, but we  need to do a lot more.   The report includes recommendations to prevent similar situations  moving forward. Among other things, the report recommends that the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid, or CMS, should review its policies  governing physicians' use of medical necessity exceptions for Part D in  Medicare to prevent companies from inappropriately influencing  prescribing. That is the least they should do.   While there are legitimate uses of the exception sometimes, we need  to be sure it is not exploited, as it was in this case.   Congress should also require CMS to improve transparency regarding  the total amount spent for drugs purchased by government healthcare  programs so we can identify these problems early on and stop them.   To combat the underlying factors affecting addiction, of course,  Congress has to do more here. We should put in place a 3-day limit, in  my view, on prescription pain medication for acute pain--not for  chronic pain, not for cancer, but for acute pain. That would make a  huge difference.   By the way, it is consistent with the Centers for Disease Control  recommendations requiring all States to utilize prescription monitoring  programs--another thing we should do--and we should allocate more  funding for immediate overdose remedies and first responder training.   There is reason to be optimistic, as I said earlier, about the  direction our country is now headed in overcoming the opioid epidemic.  We have committed ourselves here at the Federal Government to do more  and to be better partners with State government and local government  and non-profits. That is good, and I am proud of the work this Congress  has done.   But the tragedy of overwhelming opioid overdoses has also created  this opportunity for companies like Kaleo to exploit or, as they said,  capitalize on this public health crisis. That is wrong. It is shameful.    I am proud of the investigative work we have done. I will continue to  work in a bipartisan manner to do what we can to reduce prescription  drug prices and also protect taxpayer-funded programs like Medicare and  Medicaid.   Thank you.                            Tribute to Bob Corker    Mr. President, today on the floor the Senate voted on legislation  dealing with Saudi Arabia; two issues, the death of journalist  Khashoggi and also the ongoing and tragic war in Yemen.   You may have seen on the floor somebody who helped to orchestrate  this debate. I thought it was a healthy debate. I thought it was good.  People offered amendments and had an opportunity to discuss their  amendments and debate them in full.   I appreciate the fact that the Senate voted by an overwhelming margin  and, in fact, by unanimous consent for a resolution that I think sends  a very clear signal to Saudi Arabia and to other partners in the region  and, frankly, to the Trump administration.   The person who was orchestrating this, you may have seen him down on  the floor of the Senate, is the chairman of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee. His name is Bob Corker.   Senator Corker is leaving after this week, assuming Congress is going  to be out of session this week or next week. I think we will. He has  chosen to retire, not to run for reelection. So come January, we will  have another Senator from Tennessee who will be joining us, but Bob  Corker is going back into the private sector.   So today I want to talk a little bit about Chairman Corker, the  person you saw on the floor if you were watching earlier. He is a  friend, but he is also a very valuable Member of the U.S. Senate.   The reason other people aren't on the floor talking about him right  now is that he chose not to give a departure speech, which is unusual.  Most Senators take to the floor and give a speech about their departure  and their reflections on being here and what they might do in the  future, and other Members come and talk about them. Bob Corker, in his  typical style, being a guy who is here for all the right reasons and  that is not him--it is about others for him--said: I don't think I am  going to give a departure speech.   So I don't think I will have a chance to talk about him as I have  with other colleagues in their presence because he is not going to give  that speech, but I will say, he deserves to have others like me talk  about his record because he has had so many accomplishments.   He has been a leading voice in this body on so many important  initiatives and issues. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee on a global stage, of course, he has been active focusing on  issues to improve the U.S. image around the world. Our diplomacy is  something he believes in and has supported. He is concerned about the  U.S. role in the world. He wants to be sure America continues to play a  leading role on things like human rights, spreading democracy, and  opening up channels of commerce.   He has also been very involved in budget issues, focusing on the  debt, the deficit, and the problems we face in this country.   Finally, he has been active on other legislative matters. One that  comes to mind is banking issues. He is on the Banking Committee and  very involved in how to deal with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and, after  the financial crisis, some of the issues that arose after the great  recession. So he has been very active as a legislator.   He also brings an interesting perspective to this place because to  this day, he will tell you he is a businessperson, not a politician. He  came up as a developer, a builder. He didn't come up through politics.  He did become the mayor of Chattanooga, and that is how he got involved  in the political world, but he has this business approach to things  around here which I think is refreshing.   He also has the work ethic that comes with somebody from the private  sector, and that is relentless. I see it on display every day, but I  think it has been part of Bob's personality since he was a kid.   He started his first job at age 13. That was picking up trash and  bagging ice. He started his own construction company at age 25. By the  way, that construction company later expanded to 18 States--17 States  in addition to his home State of Tennessee.   He first entered public service, not in a glamorous job, but having  been successful in the private sector, he wanted to give back, and he  was offered an opportunity to help his State. He said he wanted to be  the Finance and Administration department director of Tennessee. Sort  of like the budget person, and he was very helpful to the Governor and  to the State of Tennessee in that role and then became mayor of  Chattanooga, his hometown.   In 2006, he ran for Federal office for the first time, and that was  for the U.S. Senate. He quickly rose to prominence as someone who again  had expertise on some of the issues. That was after the housing crisis,  so he was focused on that issue--the housing market crash and someone  who advocated for conservative principles like reining in Federal  spending and reducing the U.S. deficit.   In 2012, he was reelected to the Senate handily and has been chairman  of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the past 4 years. I am a  member of that committee, so I have had the opportunity to see his work  up close and watched how he works patiently with Republicans and  Democrats alike and focuses not just on sound bites and throwing out  the rhetoric but on actually how do you get something done that helps  our great country.   I can tell you with certainty that during Chairman Corker's tenure  before the Foreign Relations Committee, our allies around the world  have benefited and our adversaries have been held accountable. That is  his approach--pretty simple.   He has played a key role in helping restore America's leadership role  in the world, and I am pleased the work was accomplished, combating  Russia's continued aggression in Eastern Europe and standing up for our  friend and ally, Israel, and for what we did today, sending a clear  message on values.   Just recently, legislation he championed was called the BUILD Act,  and  [[Page S7576]]  it was signed into law with the President without a lot of fanfare, but  it is going to make a big difference in terms of helping our country  and helping not just our image around the world but ensuring we are  helping to bring other countries out of poverty by using U.S. market  forces that work. It helps bring U.S. private sector investment to low- income countries around the world to reduce poverty, to grow  investment. This is important in any context but certainly today with  one of our competitors, China, trying to do the same thing. They are  using another tactic--not the private sector but the public sector. It  is a perfect example of the kind of impact Bob Corker has had on this  body.   He has built up international relationships and has bolstered our  national security all at once. It was a pleasure working with him, and  I wish him all the best.   He is a restless guy, so he is going to end up doing something else  very creative with his life, I am sure, and I know he will enjoy  spending more time with his wife, Elizabeth, of 30 years and their two  daughters and grandchildren, but I am eager to see what Bob is going to  do next. I know we will be hearing from him because his thirst for  public service and helping others is just too great.   So to Bob Corker, congratulations on a career of public service, and  I hope you enjoy the next exciting chapter of your life.   I yield the floor.
