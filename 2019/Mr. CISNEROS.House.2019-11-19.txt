 Madam Speaker, I rise today in anticipation of  Transgender Remembrance Day, to honor the memory of those who have been  lost to anti-transgender violence.   It is important that we recognize the bravery of those individuals  who have chosen to live truthfully and openly and embrace their gender  identity with the world.  [[Page H9043]]    We must raise up their names and remember those who have been lost to  senseless violence and hate. We must shine a light on the injustice  that has affected this community.   I am proud to have a transgender woman as part of my staff.   I would also like to recognize the Shah family from my district.  Priya and Jaspret Shah are the parents of a brave little transgender  girl. Together, they have advocated not only for their daughter, but  for the entire transgender community. Priya has come to the forefront  of the Human Rights Campaign's national program to make schools safe  spaces for transgender children.   We must continue to stand in solidarity with the Shah family, their  daughter, and the entire transgender community and continue to work  toward equality and justice for all.                            ____________________
