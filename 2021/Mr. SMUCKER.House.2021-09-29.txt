 Madam Speaker, there are several problems with what I am  hearing on the floor today. One, this is a blank check for Democrats to  continue to spend at unprecedented levels. They talk about this  spending for previous expenditures. Not true. This doesn't even set a  limit. This would suspend completely the debt limit until December 16,  2022. They can spend as much as they want. It is a big problem.   Number two. Democrats aren't talking about finding ways to reduce the  debt. We must tackle that problem. Rather, they believe that they can  spend their way into a prosperous economy. In fact, they are attempting  to completely erode the foundation of our society that has been built  on individual freedom and personal responsibility, and they want to  pave the way for the radical socialist agenda.   Unfortunately, we are already seeing the economic damage from their  disastrous policies. Inflation is showing a 4 percent increase year to  date. Consumer price inflation is higher than that. That is more than  double the Federal Reserve's 2 percent goal. Those increases are being  felt in my district; they are being felt across the country; and they  are essentially a hidden tax on the American people.   Another problem we have, while they are attempting to spend even more  money, cause even more economic harm, they will further degrade  confidence in the dollar.   And, finally, another problem. This is an exercise in futility, and  they know it. They know that this bill is very unlikely to pass in the  Senate. So this is simply to score cheap political points today.   Democrats are in full control of the House, Senate, and the  Presidency. They can raise the debt at any time. In fact, they passed  up another opportunity to amend their budget resolution to include a  debt ceiling increase, and they refused to do so.   Madam Speaker, I am strongly opposed to the Democrats' radical  socialist agenda, and I oppose this bill which will help them advance  that agenda.
