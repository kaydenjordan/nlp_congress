 Madam Speaker, China continues to grow as a threat to  freedom and human rights worldwide, and the People's Liberation Army is  one of their strongest tools.   Unfortunately, large U.S. investment funds are shelling out millions  of dollars to Chinese companies that support the PLA. Individuals,  banks, and companies should not be putting our financial security at  risk in order to inflate their financial portfolios.   President Trump has been consistently tough on China and recently  issued an executive order banning American investment in these  dangerous companies. Similarly, Congressman Banks, Congressman  Gallagher, and I introduced the Stop Funding the PLA Act to prohibit  American funds from going to entities that support China's growing  military presence.   Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to join us in making this  bill a permanent part of our strategy to hold China accountable. We  should stand strong and never support the Chinese Communist Party or  any of its entities.                            ____________________
