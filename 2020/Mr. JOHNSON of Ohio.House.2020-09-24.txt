 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about a  missed opportunity, a missed opportunity to deliver for the American  people an energy strategy that advances America's exceptionalism.  Instead, while this energy package isn't quite the radical left's Green  New Deal, it is certainly inspired by it.   Madam Speaker, you have heard about the dozens of other amendments  Republicans offered to show our vision for America's energy future,  including two of mine that would break down regulatory barriers to  export more American LNG and advance America's nuclear power  technology. But those amendments were ruled out of order by the  majority.   What we are left with is unserious legislation that picks winners and  losers, throws billions of taxpayer dollars at green pet projects, and  lacks the needed regulatory reforms to bring America's energy economy  into the 21st century.   Energy dominance is key for America to remain at the head of the  global leadership table. Unfortunately, today was a missed opportunity  to strengthen America's position, an exercise in futility since the  Senate will not consider this bill, nor should it.   Madam Speaker, while I support this Republican en bloc of amendments,  I urge my colleagues to oppose the underlying bill.
