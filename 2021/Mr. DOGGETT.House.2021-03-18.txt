 Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of those who teach, who  heal, who protect, who study; for those whose entrepreneurial talent  advances our economy--for all of our Dreamers. They have so much to  contribute and they are American in every way except on paper.   For so many long years, they have been burdened with uncertainty  because of the anti-immigrant hysteria whipped up by these Republican  fanatics. In San Antonio, San Marcos, and Austin I have met with them  personally; Dreamers in Texas, where releasing their full potential,  through approval of this bill, would have such benefit to all of us.   Today let's move forward to reject the Republican nightmare and  achieve the dream so that these deserving young people may truly share  in the entire American Dream. This bill must only be the beginning.
