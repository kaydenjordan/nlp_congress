 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.  [[Page H3053]]     Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of amendment No. 24 to the  Violence Against Women Act.   The true cost of domestic violence is difficult to compute because of  just how many aspects of someone's life it can affect and the economic  sabotage it can induce.   A woman could face job insecurity because she must spend excessive  resources on legal assistance or childcare. She could lack the  financial security to leave an abusive partner, because the partner may  be tightening his grip on a shared bank account. She may be vulnerable  to homelessness. She may even face unavoidable and skyrocketing  healthcare costs due to the physical abuse she has experienced.   There are numerous ways that domestic and sexual violence can create  economic obstacles for women in America, and it is imperative that we  study these issues, to strengthen the health and safety of our  communities.   My bipartisan amendment, which I introduced with Congresswoman Susan  Brooks of Indiana, requires the Department of Health and Human Services  and the Department of Labor to analyze and report all barriers that  survivors face in achieving economic security outside of an abusive  relationship.   This amendment would ensure we are taking a comprehensive approach to  strengthen the economic stability of survivors of domestic and sexual  violence, including their ability to achieve financial empowerment,  affordable housing, transportation, healthcare access, and quality  education and training opportunities.   Ultimately, this information will help put more women and survivors  of domestic and sexual violence on a path of upward mobility.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1830     Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment No. 25 to the  Violence Against Women Act.   For decades, Congress has taken action to ensure that victims of  domestic violence are supported and protected from their abusers by  providing resources and tools to promote health and safety.   We know that one in three women experience domestic violence or  sexual assault in their lifetime. We also know that the devastating  effects of such violence are experienced at home, in relationships, and  even when they go to work.   In fact, the Department of Labor reports that, in total, survivors of  domestic violence lose nearly 8 million days of paid work a year due to  a violent situation at home, whether that be finding legal assistance,  securing childcare, or receiving health services. Statistics show that  abusers are more likely to follow or harass survivors at their  workplace, which can add an overwhelming sense of fear. Survivors may  also experience an extreme loss in productivity due to distraction,  worry, or poor performance. Due to the abundance of difficult issues  facing these individuals, their ability to remain employed often is at  risk.   These missed days result in $1.8 billion in lost productivity for  American businesses per year. According to the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, over 44 percent of workplaces do not have formal policies  that address domestic violence in the workplace.   Moving forward, we must find ways to help employers offer lifesaving  resources to victims of such violence, an endeavor that will improve  the health and safety of American employees both at home and at the  workplace.   Many companies nationwide have adopted effective ``employee  assistance programs'' that include comprehensive domestic violence  services for survivors. Employee assistance programs have been proven  to help survivors when they come into work by offering free counseling,  referrals, and assessments. In many cases, these programs offer  lifesaving services to survivors dealing with dangerous and difficult  situations at home.   This bipartisan amendment, which I am offering with my colleague  Congressman   Don Bacon, directs the Department of Health and Human  Services and the Department of Labor to launch a public information  campaign that includes guidelines and best practices for employers to  create these effective employee assistance programs. By conducting  extensive research and sharing these findings with employers across the  country, we can strengthen support services at the workplace for the  betterment of women's health and safety.   Mr. Chairman, with the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women  Act, we have a momentous opportunity to improve employee assistance  programs throughout the country. I urge my colleagues to seize this  moment by supporting this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
