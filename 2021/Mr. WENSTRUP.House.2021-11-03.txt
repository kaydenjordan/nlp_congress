 Madam Speaker, we are here tonight to recognize and  bring awareness to our servicemembers who are dealing with health  issues caused by exposure to burn pits and other toxins during their  tour of duty.    These brave men and women answered the call. They were willing to lay  down their lives for our freedom, and they served us honorably.   Unknowingly, by following orders, they put themselves in harm's way.   As our military continues to adapt, we are learning that certain  amounts of exposure to burn pits can potentially present troublesome  and life-threatening health challenges, some that don't show up until  later in life.   When I served in Iraq, I smelled the smoke, and I don't wish it upon  anyone. Those suffering from the repercussions of burn pit exposure  need help, not hurdles. We must meet them with compassion, not red  tape. That is why I am proud to work with fellow members of the  Congressional Burn Pit Caucus, as well as friends on the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, to put forth bipartisan solutions to help our  servicemembers. We must prevent this in the future and care for those  that have borne the battle.   I want to thank my friend, Dr. Ruiz, for hosting this Special Order.  I am proud to work with him on this issue, as I have been proud to work  with him on so many other issues on behalf of patients.                                time  1845
