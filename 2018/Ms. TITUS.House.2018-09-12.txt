 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and also to my friend  from Florida who sponsored this legislation.   I too rise in support of H. Res. 401. It is a resolution urging  countries around the world to outlaw the dog and cat meat trade, and to  recommit to enforcing existing laws against this horrible practice.   As you have heard, approximately 30 million dogs and tens of millions  of cats are killed annually for human consumption; and many suffer from  abuse and cruelty during their lifetime, facing painful deaths at the  hands of these horrible meat dealers. We cannot afford to turn a blind  eye to the extreme torment that they have to endure.   In the United States, we cherish dogs and cats, recognizing their  many contributions as service and therapy animals, search and rescue  assistants, and police dogs that aid with drug and bomb searches.                                time  1815    They provide airport security, are companions to our veterans, and  are cherished family pets.   As a member of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, I am a  proud cosponsor of this legislation, which enjoyed the support of 150  bipartisan cosponsors and passed the committee by a voice vote. I have  worked hard in Congress to end the dog and cat meat trade, eliminate  the use of dog leather, and protect our furry and feathered friends  from undue harm and abuse.   Hundreds of constituents have written us about this issue, and they  want the United States to speak up and set an example. Mr. Speaker, I  believe this resolution does just that. I thank those who are  responsible for bringing it, those who have lent their voice in support  of it, and I look forward to seeing it pass today.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I  thank Ranking Member Engel for his leadership in this.   I, too, rise in support of H.R. 6197. It is a bill that will combat  the illegal wildlife trade by authorizing rewards for information on  wildlife traffickers through the State Department's Rewards for Justice  program.   First, I want to thank the cosponsors, Representatives Donovan and  Castro, for their work on this bipartisan legislation, along with  Chairman Royce, who has dedicated his career to helping animals in  faraway places.   Wildlife trafficking generates over $10 billion, annually, for  transnational criminal networks. As such, it not only decimates  endangered wildlife species, but it also threatens security and fuels  corruption.   H.R. 6197 gives the State Department another tool to go after  wildlife traffickers, and it positively complements the END Wildlife  Trafficking Act, which recognizes wildlife trafficking as a serious  crime.   Together, these two efforts will fuel a multipronged, coordinated  approach to combating the illegal wildlife trade and will help to bring  the perpetrators to justice.   As an advocate for wildlife protections, I am proud to cosponsor this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it today and  end this wildlife trafficking practice.
