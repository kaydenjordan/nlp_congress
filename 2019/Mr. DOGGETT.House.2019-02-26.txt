 Mr. Speaker, the serious border emergency that America  is confronted with today is an emergency that Donald Trump has created  by ignoring borders--ignoring the borders set forth in our  Constitution, borders that were set forth to prevent an all-powerful  executive, a would-be king, or the type of tyrant that Trump so admires  abroad.   After Congress repeatedly rejected his phony border crisis and  wasteful wall, Trump decided: build it anyway.   Well, today's emergency wouldn't have happened without two years of  Republicans who have continued to yield the right-of-way to his  creeping wrongdoing--more and more of it--Republicans who can just  never summon the ability to say ``no'' to Trump.   Today, we must reject this unconstitutional power grab that diverts  resources from real threats to an imaginary, politically contrived one.   Today, we defend our Constitution and our democracy by pushing back  on the lies, the deceit, the anti-immigrant hysteria, and the fear- mongering mismanagement of this administration.
