 Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), the distinguished chairman of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to begin by recognizing Chairman Yarmuth, whose leadership of  the Budget Committee is so routinely remarkable that we take it for  granted.   The budget resolution we are voting on today will set us on a path to  defeating the virus and providing urgent relief for millions of  Americans.   It is a big moment for this country, and this Chamber and Chairman  Yarmuth have handled it with characteristic skill and grace.   I also want to thank Speaker Pelosi for her extraordinary leadership,  guiding the House through all the challenges since this pandemic began  and now bringing up legislation that is urgently needed and will  ultimately sustain millions of Americans during this crisis.   President Biden has called for a package that meets the moment, and  Speaker Pelosi has laid out a path that gets us there. The Speaker has  guided this Chamber brilliantly as we passed the Cares Act; provided  additional support to families and businesses in the spring and fall;  and now, as we begin the expeditious process to beat the virus, get the  American people the relief they need and deserve.   I am honored that she has asked me to lead the Joint Economic  Committee this Congress as our country recovers and rebuilds. I look  forward to partnering with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on  the full range of economic challenges and opportunities before us.  There is so much work to do.   This legislation will save American lives and give tens of millions  of Americans the help they need.   Mr. Speaker, I am a businessman. One of my favorite ideas is: Don't  show me your values; don't tell me your values; just show me your  calendar.   Well, budgets are a statement of values. If you want to know what a  person or a party really believes, look at how they allocate their  resources. Show me your budget.   Four years ago, the Republicans held the White House, the Senate, and  the House of Representatives. Their signature legislation was a $1.9  trillion tax cut bill, which overwhelmingly favored the wealthy, the  top 10 percent. That was a statement of their values.   Today, Democrats have the responsibility of governing, with Joe Biden  in the White House and majorities in the House and Senate. We declare  different values. The most important value is to save American lives.  The second most important value is to restore American prosperity.   The budget resolution we consider today is a critical first step to  achieving both overarching goals. We have to act quickly because those  aren't the only overwhelming goals that we are facing.   Climate change. Secretary Yellen, in her confirmation hearing, called  climate change an existential threat facing the globe. She is right,  and we can't waste any more time. Temperatures are rising. Glaciers are  melting. The frequency of forest fires is increasing, as is the  frequency of once-in-a-hundred-year storms. Carbon emissions are out of  control.   Soon, scientists say, we will reach a point of no return. Many  believe we may already be there, and it doesn't help that the previous  administration spent 4 years pretending that climate change didn't  exist.                                time  1545    And infrastructure: Despite years of ``infrastructure weeks,'' we  haven't moved the ball on infrastructure at all.   This harms our country in countless ways, not the least of which it  makes the United States less competitive around the world. Bad for  business, bad for consumers, harmful to the next generation.   Our roads are filled with potholes. Our bridges are falling down.  Broadband doesn't reach millions of Americans and is priced out of  reach for millions more. And on and on.   We have the opportunity to build back better a more equitable,  inclusive, sustainable, and green economy. But we need policies that  are aligned with the priorities and the needs of middle-class families,  not geared toward the wealthy and the well connected.   This budget resolution reflects deeply held American values,  preserving lives and health, and creating prosperity for every  American. It reflects who we are, all Americans, and it deserves our  complete support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a quick response to my dear friend  from Arizona. While we acknowledge that many of the States actually had  increased revenues last year, virtually no locality did. I represent  Northern Virginia, a fairly wealthy part, yet every one of our local  governments is getting creamed. We had 1.3 million job losses in State  and local government in 2020. That is not nothing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Pocan), the immediate past chair of the Congressional Progressive  Caucus and the most distinguished magician in the U.S. House.    Mr. Speaker, let me just point out that we are not  throwing away our chance to work with Republicans. We would love to  have a bipartisan bill, but if it's not possible, we have to have this  reconciliation process in place because it takes weeks to unfold.   Mr. Speaker, we are in a deep hole. To build back better, we have to  crush the virus, as Speaker Pelosi so beautifully captured. But make no  mistake, the COVID-19 pandemic has plunged us into a very, very big  hole.   Last week, we got the advance--or first--report on 2020 GDP, and it  was ugly. The economy shrank by 3.5 percent last year, the worst  economic performance since 1946. Very few of us were even born the last  time our economy declined by this much. Let me say it again, the U.S.  economy is the weakest it has been since the end of World War II.   It could have been worse. It could have been much worse but for the  actions we took in a bipartisan way in this Congress. We passed the  CARES Act in May, and instead of the 5.6 percent decline the CBO had  forecast, we only got 3\1/2\ percent. Just imagine if the Senate had  taken up the Heroes Act that we passed. Unemployment insurance alone,  which was strengthened with the $600 supplemental payment and the  creation of pandemic unemployment assistance, accounted for more than  $550 billion in personal income in 2020. These payments were a lifeline  to individuals, and they bolstered the economy.   We lost huge amounts of ground in the spring when second quarter GDP  declined at a record 31.4 percent rate. That 4 percent in the fourth  quarter helped, but not nearly enough to get us out of the hole.   As Fed chair Powell and others have made clear, the risk isn't doing  too much. The risk is doing too little. This budget resolution before  us recognizes that reality and uses it as a starting point.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty), the distinguished chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, a  member of the Joint Economic Committee, and my dear friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would agree with all of those economists who say go target, go big,  and go targeted. In fact, that is what Joe Biden has said again and  again.   I think his speech on the American Recovery Act was extraordinarily  targeted, and while this budget reconciliation bill is the big picture,  we all know that by the time we pass those individual budgets, they  will be targeted at the most granular level.   And to my friend, Mr. Estes, with whom I serve on Ways and Means, I  am glad that Kansas is doing well. I don't know the answer to this, but  I would go back and see how it is going in Wichita and some of those  local governments.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline),  one of the leaders in so many different ways of the U.S. House of  Representatives, the former mayor of Providence.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to welcome our new colleague from  Texas to the floor. An excellent speech.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters),  a member of the Joint Economic Committee and a distinguished  businessperson in his own right.    Mr. Speaker, can I ask how much time is remaining on our  side.    Mr. Speaker, to my new friend from Texas, I would point  out that Texas and California and New York--two of the bluest States  around--are all net exporters of Federal dollars mostly to red States.   Now, it tends to be the blue States who are helping out the red  States in terms of our Federal allocations. I would also like to  compliment the ranking member on the Joint Economic Committee for his  optimism in having a 5-year-old daughter.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib), the distinguished Member who spent her life  lifting people out of poverty.    Mr. Speaker, last summer, when Donald Trump was pressuring  governors to ignore the advice of health experts and reopen their  economies, he was predicting we would  [[Page H309]]  lead to a ``V-shaped'' recovery, in which the recovery would be as  steep as the catastrophic decline.   Others predicted a ``U-shaped'' recovery, a more drawn-out version of  the ``V.'' And even others predicted a ``W-shaped'' recovery, an  uptick, followed by another drop due to a probable second wave of the  coronavirus, and then hopeful improvement. Even Ian Bremmer talked  about a scalloped recovery.   Mr. Speaker, there has been recovery, but with two big caveats. It  has been a ``K-shaped'' recovery. It has come at the cost of over  440,000 American lives.   As the Trump administration pressured States to relax measures needed  to control the coronavirus, the virus exploded. And this does have  incredibly long-term cost on families, on generations in the economy.   But this ``K-shaped'' recovery, which has really come into vogue  right now, is some are doing quite well and some are doing pretty  poorly. High-income workers have been able to work from home and save  record amounts of cash--I think a 33 percent savings rate in the second  quarter.   The savings rate has gone through the roof because the paychecks, the  stock gains, have kept coming in for those folks; but they can't spend  it on restaurants or movies or travel, flights, entertainment.   American billionaires picked up $1.9 trillion in net worth in 2020.  Just the increase in billionaires' net worth alone would pay for this  package. The personal savings rate more than doubled in 2020. Housing  prices climbed 10 percent in the last year. Stock market went up about  15 percent in the midst of the crisis. But, remember, the wealthiest 10  percent own 84 percent of the stocks. So they walked away with a vast  majority of the stock gains last year, as they do every year.   These factors probably explained why households of more than $75,000  in income saved their $600 payments from December rather than spent  them, as revealed in recent Opportunity Insights' data.   On the other side of the coin, low-wage workers have seen  unemployment drop by 20 to 25 percent, and the unemployment rates for  Black and Hispanic workers exceeds 9 percent. The rich have gotten  richer. The poor have gotten poorer. And the American Dream has become  ever-less attainable for too many Americans. A ``K-shaped'' recovery is  unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Connolly), my friend of almost 40 years, my godfather.    Mr. Speaker, to add to my friend's charts, let me point  out that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated, without  additional resources, investment into the economy, it will take until  2024--3 more years--just to get back to where we were at the  prepandemic level 1 year ago.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green), and not the singer.    Mr. Speaker, I had the great honor of attending the  Arlington funeral service for Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. It  was moving and very sad, eloquent. I only bring this up because I was  transported with my friend, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, to the  cemetery and back with two Capitol Police Officers who were talking  about how much they love their job but how exhausted they were at ages  40 and late 20s.   I asked them, ``What is your job?''   They said, ``We are security for the Speaker.''   And she is indefatigable, tireless, works around the clock, and, to  my mind, is the best Speaker America has ever had.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the Speaker of the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time we have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), the distinguished chairman of the Trade  Subcommittee on Ways and Means and, in my opinion, the most thoughtful  Member of the House.                               time  (1645)     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the ranking member, for this  hourlong discussion. I will point out that all those billions and maybe  trillions of dollars that apparently are still in coffers, one of the  best things we can do is get new management at the executive level who  will actually spend the money allocated by Congress, and I think the  Senate is working on those confirmations right now.   There is nothing that has the sense of theater about the children in  Virginia who are three times as food insecure as they were a year ago.  We have millions of Americans out of work. We have this remarkable  chart that shows that our unemployment rate hit an official 14.8  percent back in the spring, and we knew that was undercounted by all  the people who left the workforce who weren't counted at all. They said  it was probably closer to 20 percent, the highest since the Great  Depression.   Now, we are formally down to 6.7 percent, but, once again, that is  double the pre-pandemic level and doesn't capture the nearly 5 million  workers who have given up looking for a job and left the labor force  since February. That would push the unemployment rate almost at 10  percent. We cannot afford to be passive.   My friend, Mr. Schweikert, talks about the multiplier factor, and I  am a huge fan of the multiplier effect. But the multiplier effect means  putting money in the hands of people who will spend it. So we are in  defense of our $15 minimum wage. That is money that will go into the  hands of people who will spend it that day, that Friday, that weekend.   Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, two prominent economists, found that  fiscal monetary responses in 2008 and 2009 substantially reduced the  severity and length of the Great Recession. Our wonderful chairman of  the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, a Republican, has said that monetary  policy has gone as far as it can. Interest rates are near zero. It is  up to us now, those who control fiscal policy, to make this comeback.   The Hamilton Project found that the Biden proposal would return us to  the CBO's pre-pandemic projections after the third quarter of this  year, not 2024 which would be where we were without it.    We face a once-in-a-generation challenge: a public health crisis  caused a massive economic hit worse than the Great Recession, and  responding to either one of these crises, the COVID or  [[Page H313]]  the economy, requires a smart, multifaceted, comprehensive approach. It  is not a blank-check approach. We have outlined piece by piece by piece  how this money would be spent, and we still have much granularity to  go. We have don't have the luxury of choosing which crisis we respond  to. We have got to overcome both of them to save the lives of hundreds  of thousands of Americans and ensure the livelihoods of millions more.   Another luxury we don't have is time. We can't waste months and  months and months trying to figure out whether we are actually going to  spend that money in those coffers or whether bipartisanship will work.  We have to set the structure up so that if reconciliation is  necessary--the same reconciliation my Republican friends used on the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act--it is ready to go.   The American people--Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and those  who don't fit in any of those groups--want us to take action. Giving  shots in people's arms, ramping up testing and tracing, ensuring  unemployment benefits don't expire on March 14 and that they are there  when they are needed most--I thank the gentleman, by the way, Mr.  Schweikert, for piling on automatic stabilizers, almost every economist  I know thinks that is a good idea--and helping families put food on the  table. This is what Americans want. We need to move now to get our  country and our economy back on track, and this budget resolution  starts the process.   Today, we are taking a very important step for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the resolution, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
