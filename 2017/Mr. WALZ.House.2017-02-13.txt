 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would, first of all, like to thank the chairman for bringing H.R.  609 to the floor, and a very special thank you to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly) for the honor and privilege to learn about  this great American. You heard a little bit of the story, and you will  hear more of it from Mr. Kelly. It is sometimes unimaginable that such  as Mr. Abraham walked amongst us.   I oftentimes hear that people disparage when Congress does naming  bills. If anyone was ever deserving of having a VA center named after  them, and the importance of attaching that name and the history for  those who come after, this is the gentleman.   You are going to hear more of this, but Mr. Abraham was born in  Lyndora, Pennsylvania. The stories just keep coming up. Apparently he  was gifted academically and, of course, was a boxer. Again, this is a  point of personal privilege on this, he was actually a Regimental  Sergeant Major for a time when he was in his service. He served in the  Philippines, China, Germany, and Panama. He survived the Bataan Death  March. Having been out on Corregidor Island and hearing the stories of  the people who survived, unimaginable horrors that they survived, and  then imagine after being rescued and being liberated and having a  chance to come home, Mr. Abraham chose to make sure that all of his  comrades came home.   He was a recipient of the Purple Heart and a lifelong member of the  VFW, the American Legion, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the  American Ex-Prisoners of War Organization, the Disabled American  Veterans, and the American Defenders of Bataan; but I think the  chairman brought up something truly remarkable: giving 40,000 hours of  volunteer service to his fellow veterans. This Nation could ask no more  of a single person, and Mr. Abraham continued to give.   To the gentleman from Pennsylvania, the State of Pennsylvania is  represented well here. They were represented well by Mr. Abraham. It is  an honor and a privilege to support this piece of legislation. I  encourage my colleagues to not only support this, but to maybe go read  the bio of this great American.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers and I am  prepared to close.   I would just like to thank the gentleman again for bringing this to  our attention, honoring Master Sergeant Abraham's life. Again, I think  there is a little lesson here of how we conduct ourselves reflects on  the sacrifice that people like Mr. Abraham gave; and the gentleman has  done so honorably and nobly, and I thank him for that. I encourage my  colleagues to support H.R. 609.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 512, as amended, the WINGMAN  Act. I, too, would like to thank the gentleman from Florida for trying  to do all they can to speed constituent services to their folks.   This legislation gives certain designated congressional office  caseworkers access to veterans' electronic disability claim records at  the Veterans Benefits Administration, or VBA. It has broad support in  this House, both Democrat and Republican.   This bill would allow designated congressional employees to have  read-only access to the Veterans Benefits Administration database to  look at veterans' records. Congressional staff would not be able to add  or remove anything from a record, but simply check on the status of a  veteran's claim and check that evidence and documentation are  submitted. The reason this is so important is that a veteran will, at  times, wait months, only to be told a piece of document has been  missing that could have been added months before. It makes sense. It  tracks the system. It ensures that the veteran is getting the fastest,  best possible claim adjudication.   The purpose is to provide that faster status and let them know. There  are privacy safeguards in the bill, which reinforce the necessity for  getting prior consent from the veteran. Also, the bill clearly requires  that congressional employees designated for this access must be full- time employees who provide constituent services.   Veterans service organizations have suggested that the VA should put  a tracking system in place to ensure that these employees are only  assisting constituents from their congressional district, and that  congressional staff be held accountable if found to abuse any aspect of  this new and unprecedented authority. I support that suggestion.   In my district, county veterans service organizations have also asked  to have read-only access to veterans' records so they can assist  veterans. I wish to work with Chairman Roe to examine whether that  might be something that could be included down the road.   There is broad bipartisan support for giving congressional staff  access to veterans' records so they can help veterans navigate a  complex claims system. Often it takes too long to find out the status  of a veteran's claim from the VA. Allowing certain professional staff  to do the checking themselves seems like a simple step in the right  direction, and I support it.   Last Congress, similar legislation to H.R. 512 unanimously passed  this House. I urge my colleagues to support it today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the  Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan), my good friend, a member of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, and a stalwart supporter of this Nation's  veterans and those in uniform.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard) one of our warriors and a veteran of the war in  Iraq, and a staunch advocate for this Nation's veterans.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge support of  H.R. 512.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 244, as amended, the HIRE Vets Act.   I give a special thank-you to my colleague from California, Colonel  Cook, who, himself, is a Vietnam veteran. Since the first day he got  into Congress, he has been our veterans' stanchest supporter, and I  appreciate that.   Mr. Speaker, this is an innovative, bipartisan piece of legislation.  The HIRE Vets Act directs the Department of Labor, or DOL VETS, to  establish a HIRE Vets Medallion Program. This program solicits  voluntary information from private sector employers, which we know they  want to give--and we know they are out there hiring folks--and allows  these employers to display, with other marketing materials, a  recognized medallion as a symbol of their support and willingness to  make sure we hire veterans. Employers who provide community and  charitable services that support veterans will also be eligible.   Hiring veterans isn't just the right thing to do because it is  morally and ethically right; it makes good business sense, and our  folks know that.   The men and women who have served in our military have received  invaluable training and experience that has proven to help them thrive  in post-military employment. What they need is a foot in the door.  Fortunately, we have been seeing encouraging trends in veterans'  employment. Thanks to the hard work of DOL VETS, combined with efforts  within the private sector and Federal and State governments, the  veterans' unemployment rate in January of 2017 was 4.5 percent, which  is lower than the national average. We also know that the unemployment  rate for post-9/11 veterans remains unacceptably high at 8 percent.   We must remain vigilant to make sure that the men and women who  signed up to defend our Nation enjoy opportunities for growth when they  return home. The HIRE Vets Medallion Program represents an additional  incentive for employers to hire and retain veterans, which is something  we can all get behind.   Again, I thank Colonel Cook for offering this bipartisan legislation.  Thank you to the vice chairman for bringing this up and throwing his  support behind it. I am certainly proud to stand in support of this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard), who still serves this Nation in uniform.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I encourage my  colleagues to support H.R. 244, as amended.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 947, the Boosting Rates  of American Veteran Employment Act, or BRAVE Act.   I thank the vice chairman for his kind words on this bill, and I  especially would like to thank the gentlewoman from New York (Miss  Rice), an unwavering advocate of our veterans and author of this smart  piece of legislation.   Both parties agree it is unacceptable that men and women returning  home from our most recent conflicts don't have good, reliable jobs  waiting for them. We can start right here in the Federal Government.  The VA establishes long-term contracts with private companies for  medical equipment, construction, supplies, services, and more.   Currently, the VA gives preferences to veteran-owned small  businesses. That is great. What this piece of legislation does is  expand this contracting preference to allow the VA Secretary to give a  preference to companies that actively search out and employ veterans, a  policy that would incentivize companies to even hire more veterans.  This is already a smart approach for those companies because veterans  bring to a job the skills they have learned over the years and make the  company even stronger.   This bipartisan piece of legislation adds no cost to the taxpayers.  It allows for debarment of any company that knowingly misrepresents its  portion of veteran employees in order to receive the contracting  preference.   The BRAVE Act represents a win-win for the private sector, the  Federal Government, and, most importantly, for our veterans.   Again, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from New York (Miss  Rice), who will tell us a little more about this in a few moments, and  Chairman Roe of Tennessee and Vice Chairman Bilirakis for continuing to  bring good pieces of veterans legislation to the floor. We are grateful  for that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Miss Rice), the author, the lead sponsor of this piece of  legislation, a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee since coming  to Congress, and a fierce advocate for those warriors.   Miss RICE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 974, the  Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act, which I introduced  along with Congressman and Colonel Paul Cook of California.   The BRAVE Act is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will  authorize the VA Secretary, when awarding Federal contracts, to give  preference to contractors with high concentrations of full-time veteran  employees. This bill will cost taxpayers absolutely nothing.   It will, first, reward companies that actively hire and invest in our  veterans, companies that seek out veterans and give them opportunities  to bring their unique skills, training, and experience to the civilian  workforce.   Second, it will create an incentive for other companies to do the  same and bring more veterans into their workforce.   Most importantly, as more and more companies hire more and more  veterans, they will ultimately see that investing in veterans is good  for business. That is the real incentive here. It is not just an  advantage in securing Federal contracts; it is getting the benefit of  employees who have worn the uniform, who have been trained by the  greatest military in the world, and who have learned to get the job  done, no matter what that job is.   We need more businesses in the private sector to recognize the value  of investing in the men and women who have served our country. It is  not an act of charity. Veterans are not looking for a handout; they  just need an opportunity. The BRAVE Act will help ensure that more  veterans have those opportunities.   I want to thank Chairman Roe of Tennessee, Vice Chairman Bilirakis,  and Ranking Member Walz for supporting this bill and for helping to  bring it to the floor today.   This legislation passed unanimously in the last Congress, and I urge  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to, once again, give it the  bipartisan support it deserves.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on my side.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 974.   I yield back the balance of my time.
