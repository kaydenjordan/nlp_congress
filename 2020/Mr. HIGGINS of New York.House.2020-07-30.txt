 Mr. Speaker, August 1 marks the 10th  anniversary of Congress passing landmark legislation to ensure one  level of safety for the American flying public.   The success of this legislation belongs to the courageous advocacy of  the families of flight 3407, who lost their loved ones in a tragic  plane crash in Clarence, New York, in 2009. These families lost sons  and daughters, mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, friends and  loved ones. No one would have blamed them had they gone on to live  their lives in quiet solitude. They did not do that.   They turned their personal tragedy into a life-giving force, a  citizen army to fight for change so that what happened to them would  not happen to others. These families were relentless, pushing Congress  to strengthen pilot training standards, as the National Transportation  Safety Board found pilot error was responsible for the crash. The  families did not blame the pilots, for they, too, were victims. They  attacked the system that allowed pilots who were ill-trained to fly  planes.   There is still much work to be done, but today we honor and express  our graduate to the good and courageous families of flight 3407.                            ____________________
