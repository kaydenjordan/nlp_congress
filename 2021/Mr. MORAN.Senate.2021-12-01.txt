 Madam President, today I would like to recognize  the birthday of Dr. Arris Johnson. Mr. Johnson is a lifetime Kansan and  a personal friend who has reached the remarkable milestone of turning  100 years old this past weekend.   Dr. Johnson was born on November 28, 1921, and attended grade school  in Decatur County. He never strayed far from his roots attending  college at Fort Hays State University and graduate school at Kansas  State University. He still resides in Hays with his wife, Virginia.   Just 6 weeks before his graduation from Fort Hays State, he was  called to serve our Nation. In 1945, Dr. Johnson enlisted and served in  the Elbe River region for the U.S. Army during World War II. It was his  work in the Red Cross division that began his interest in teaching and  counseling work.   Following his service, Dr. Johnson returned to Kansas and continued  his education, receiving his master's from Kansas State University  before returning to Fort Hays State to teach counseling for nearly  three decades.   After retiring in 1985, he was named the freemason grandmaster for  the State of Kansas. Additionally, Dr. Johnson was further honored with  the Distinguished Service Award, which recognizes individuals who have  demonstrated a continuing concern for humanity; support spiritual,  cultural, and educational objectives; and exemplify the highest  standards of character. These characteristics could not describe Dr.  Johnson more appropriately.   Dr. Johnson is a loving husband to his wife Virginia Johnson, and  they will celebrate their 75th anniversary in January with their family  and friends. They continue to reside in Hays, KS, where I hope they  enjoy many more years together.   It is clear to everyone that knows Dr. Johnson that he has made the  most of his 100 years. His contributions to Kansas and our Nation are  worthy of commendation. A beloved husband, father, grandfather, and  soldier, Arris is a tribute to the ``Greatest Generation,'' and a  grateful Nation and State thank him for his service.   I ask that my colleagues join me in wishing a happy birthday to Arris  and a profound thank you for his work in our community. His exemplary  service to America and his local community is emblematic of what makes  America a great Nation.                            ____________________
