 Madam Speaker, I am honored to have a fierce woman from  my district to deliver a historic opening prayer.   Isleta Pueblo Chief Judge Verna Teller is the first Native American  to deliver the opening prayer in the U.S. House.   This is a special time in our country's history and, in honor of  Native American Heritage Month, a time to reflect on the contributions  of Native Americans to this country.   Chief Judge Teller made her own history in New Mexico. She broke  barriers when she was elected as the first woman Pueblo Governor.  Because of the history of colonization, many Pueblos generally don't  allow women to hold leadership positions, but that didn't stop Judge  Teller from knowing her value as a Tribal leader.   I am proud to stand with Chief Judge Teller to highlight the  resilience of indigenous women and our perseverance to uplift our girls  and our women in all of our communities.                            ____________________
