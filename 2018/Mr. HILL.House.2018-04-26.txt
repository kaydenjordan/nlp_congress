 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Schiff, for his  remarks on genocide and turning our back on the facts that we find  around the world. I really appreciate his thoughts.   I want to rise today and talk to my colleagues and the American  people about the atrocities in Syria and call on my colleagues in the  Senate to expeditiously vote on a bill authored here in the House by  the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, H.R.  1677, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2017.   This legislation imposes new sanctions on human rights abusers in the  sad state of affairs in Syria and those who facilitate the Assad  regime's atrocities, and it encourages negotiations to bring about a  lasting political solution there. It also authorizes the State  Department to support entities that are collecting and preserving the  chain of evidence for the eventual prosecution of those who have  committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria since March  of 2011.   The world has witnessed many generational examples of butchery and  genocide by menaces, including Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, and many  others. But in the last 7 years, the world has allowed us to recognize  a new name for evil and cruelty in this millennium: Bashar al-Assad and  his henchmen.   For the last 7 years, the world has expressed outrage, yet twiddled  their thumbs while this modern-day Hitler annihilates the civilian  population of Syria.                                time  1045    Systematically, leader Assad has savagely directed the bombing,  bludgeoning, gassing, electrocution, and torture of his people.   Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons in the 1980s against Iran  appears tame in comparison to the calculated bombing of weaponized  chlorine and sarin dropped into children's hospitals, medical  facilities, and villages across Syria.   I am grateful that, after a little thumb twiddling from the prior  administration, the Trump administration has galvanized our allies  against this genocide and has taken action to stop the use of chemical  weapons against the Syrian people.   I call on the Senate to act with expedition and pass the Caesar Syria  Civilian Protection Act, and finally help obtain the kind of  documentation that we need, Mr. Speaker, to end this step back into  darkness and convict Assad and his co-conspirators and his enablers of  war crimes.             Vilonia Students Returning Lost Items After Tornado     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a group of students  in Vilonia, Arkansas, who are collecting personal items lost after the  devastating tornado that hit their town 4 years ago.   Erin Rappold, the teacher who created this project, was inspired  after finding a baby picture in the debris.   Over the last 4 years, the students have collected 90,000 items, and  only have about 2,000 left to be claimed. They launched their own  website to help people reunite with their photos, their birth  certificates, and their education diplomas.   A memorial dedication planned by those students will be held Friday,  at 10 a.m., to remember the victims of the 2011 and 2014 tornadoes.   In the face of tragedy, these students have furnished us with an  inspirational model for solidarity and hope.   I applaud Ms. Rappold and these courageous students for their efforts  and dedication to the Vilonia community.                            ____________________
