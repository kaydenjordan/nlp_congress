 Mr. President, before the Senator from New Jersey leaves  the floor, I want to say, this Senator has run into few people who are  as articulate and passionate to represent the least among us in our  country. I want the Senator from New Jersey to know how grateful I am  for his advocacy, for his determination, for his civility, for his  passion, and for his heart.   I thank the Senator from New Jersey.    Mr. President, before this sounds like an admiration  society, I will say it is genuinely felt.                       Nomination of James Bridenstine    Mr. President, what I want to do is talk about the leadership of our  civilian space program. Traditionally, the NASA administrator has been  well qualified and is not controversial.   NASA is one of the few remaining areas that has largely avoided the  bitter partisanship that has invaded far too many areas of government  in our society today--until now.   The NASA nominee, Congressman Bridenstine, was nominated to head NASA  last fall. His hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee was among the  most contentious I have ever been a part of. He was voted out of the  committee on party lines, and Senators on both sides of the aisle have  expressed doubts, both publicly and privately, to me on his  qualifications for the job.   The NASA Administrator should be a consummate space professional.  That is what this Senator wants, a space professional, not a  politician, as the head of NASA. That space professional ought to be  technically and scientifically competent and a skilled executive. More  importantly, the Administrator must be a leader who has the ability to  bring us together, to unite scientists, engineers, commercial space  [[Page S2237]]  interests, policymakers, and the public on a shared vision for future  space exploration.   As you know, our goal is going to Mars in the decade of the 2030s. We  set the goal first with the Obama administration and now with the Trump  administration. What pains me is, I believe the one who has been  nominated to head this not partisan, not bipartisan--NASA has always  been nonpartisan--agency, I am afraid we are hitting a different  standard.   My concern comes from having witnessed very directly the tragic  consequence when NASA leadership has failed us.   When it comes to the ultimate frontier of space, there are always  going to be risks involved, but the NASA Administrator bears the  responsibility, accountability, and the final decision for the lives of  astronauts who explore the heavens on behalf of all of us.   I have personally witnessed--in both the Challenger and the Columbia  accidents, we learned that engineers at NASA knew of the dangers and  tried to sound the alarm, but NASA's management and its structure,  while well-intentioned in both of those tragedies, filtered out debate  and dissent, and the warnings of the engineers went unheeded with  heartbreaking consequences. And so it was, in 1986, with the launch of  the Challenger--10 days after this Senator had returned on the 24th  flight of the space shuttle to Earth--there was the tragic consequence.  Even the engineers out in Provo, UT, who were engineers on the solid  rocket boosters, were begging their management the night before the  launch to stop the count when they saw on NASA TV the icicles hanging  on the launch tower.   We learned later in the investigation, knowing as we now know, that  they had received back the solid rocket boosters from previous flights  in January, where they saw blow-by of the hot gases past the field  joints that were supposed to be sealed with the rubberized gaskets,  called O rings, but because of the cold weather, they stiffened and did  not seal the field joint, and the hot gases escaped. As the Challenger  was traveling into the Florida sky, it hit right at the external tank,  punctured the tank, and the crew was lost.   So, too, engineers in 2003 and before and crew members--like one of  the best of the best, CAPT Robert Gibson, U.S. Navy, Retired, five-time  shuttle astronaut, four-time commander--had pointed out after each  flight, examining the orbiter, that it looked as though it had been  shredded. In his words: It was as if you had taken a shotgun out and  just shot buckshot into the delicate silicon tile. As a result, on  launch, on ascent, pieces of the foam of the external tank were falling  off and hitting the delicate silicon tiles of the space shuttle  orbiter.   Of course, on that fateful day in early February of 2003, that is  exactly what happened. A chunk of the insulation foam just about the  size of an insulated cooler, on ascent, as the orbiter is accelerating,  falls in the acceleration and hits the carbon-carbon fiber of the  leading edge of the left wing and knocks a hole in it.   Of course, on ascent to orbit, there is no problem; on orbit, there  is no problem. The problem comes after the deorbit burn and after the  space shuttle falls for 30 minutes through the vacuum of space and then  starts encountering the molecules of air in the upper atmosphere. As  those upper atmosphere air molecules hit the underside of the space  shuttle, the nose of the space shuttle, and the leading edges of the  wing, the temperatures grow to over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and there  is a big hole in the leading edge of the left wing. Of course, the left  wing burns up, and the crew is destroyed high in the descent over east  Texas.   NASA's management structure, well-intentioned, filtered out debate  and dissent, did not listen to those astronaut commanders like Hoot  Gibson, and did not listen years earlier, in 1985 and 1986, to those  engineers at Morton Thiokol. The result is the loss of 2 space shuttles  and 14 souls, including on the Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003, the  first Israeli astronaut, Ilan Ramon.   In the aftermath of Columbia, NASA was reorganized so that safety  concerns from engineering and safety personnel are not squashed like  they were, but instead elevated--ultimately, to whom? To the guy at the  top, the NASA Administrator. To make those decisions, the Administrator  must draw on all of his or her knowledge of the engineering principles  and of space flight, all of his or her experience from managing large  technical organizations, and every bit of judgment, reason, and  impartiality he or she can muster.   Leading NASA is a job for an experienced and proven space  professional. The success or failure of leadership at NASA is, quite  literally, a matter of life and death.   I commend Congressman Bridenstine's time as a pilot, and his service  to our country in the military is commendable. But it does not qualify  him to make the complex and nuanced engineering, safety, and budgetary  decisions for which the head of NASA has to be accountable.   Furthermore, Congressman Bridenstine's recent public service career  does not instill great confidence about his ability to bring people  together. His record of behavior in Congress is as divisive as any in  Washington, including his attacks on Members of this body from his own  party. It is hard to see how that record will endear him--and, by  extension, NASA--to Congress and, most importantly, endear him to the  American people.   Finally, given NASA's mission to study the Earth--that is one of  NASA's missions--Congressman Bridenstine's past statements on climate  change are troubling, to say the least. Particularly in this  administration where words like ``science-based'' and ``climate  change'' are being scrubbed from government documents and where some  scientists have been restricted from speaking publicly about scientific  findings, NASA needs an Administrator--a leader, a strong leader--who  understands the critical importance of studying the Earth and is  willing to put his job on the line to protect NASA's scientists.  Congressman Bridenstine's record suggests that he will do otherwise.   I don't come to this decision lightly. I hold nothing against him  personally. He is a very likable fellow. My decision is not politically  motivated. In fact, I supported the nomination of Chief Financial  Officer Jeff DeWit because he was qualified for the job as Chief  Financial Officer, and he was confirmed without a problem and is in  that job. Of course, if Congressman Bridenstine is, in fact, confirmed,  I will work with him for the good of our Nation's space program.   My opposition to this nomination comes from decades of experience and  an understanding of NASA's history and having lived through some of its  darkest moments.   I have no doubt that the nominee is passionate about our space  program, and I don't doubt his motivation or his intentions. What is  not right for NASA is an Administrator who is politically divisive and  who is not prepared to be the last in line to make that fateful  decision on go or no-go for launch. Therefore, I will oppose this  nominee.   I yield the floor.
