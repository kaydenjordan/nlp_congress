 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to share my  support for H.R. 400, the Investing in Main Street Act of 2023, a bill  which I am proud to co-lead with Congresswoman Judy Chu.   I also thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this up  today.   We often talk about small businesses being the backbone of the U.S.  economy. It is not just a talking point, but a statement of fact. Small  businesses are major contributors to our Nation's overall prosperity;  and in my district on Long Island, small businesses are what fuels  local economic growth.   As we face economic uncertainty due to inflation, labor shortages,  and other ongoing challenges, we look to our small businesses to be  leaders in the private sector and to help revitalize our communities.   For over 60 years, the SBIC program has injected capital into small  businesses by allowing financial institutions or Federal savings  associations to invest in SBICs up to 5 percent. But times change;  programs need updating and, now more than ever, small businesses need  access to additional capital.   The increase from 5 percent to 15 percent stipulated in this bill is  a necessary reform that will help small businesses get back on their  feet.   I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Chu, for her leadership on this  issue, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.
