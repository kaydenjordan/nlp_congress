 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith as well as Ranking  Member Rogers for their leadership to include various measures in the  underlying bill that will aid the Department of Defense's effort to  prevent and mitigate civilian harm, including establishing a Center of  Excellence in Civilian Harm Mitigation and Commission on Civilian Harm.   I thank the HASC staff, including Katy Quinn, Phil MacNaughton, and  Robert Ikoku for their work on this.   It should not be a partisan issue to mitigate civilian harm.   My amendment would simply authorize the resources for the Department  of Defense to implement these policies of reducing civilian casualties,  which Congress already required the Department of Defense to do nearly  4 years ago.   My amendment would allow the Department of Defense to spend $5  million per year to implement the requirements of section 936 of the  John McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019.   Section 936, passed by this body 4 years ago, requires the Department  of Defense to establish uniform processes and standards across  combatant commands for improving tracking, reporting, analysis, and  response to civilian casualties from U.S. military operations.   It is appropriately named after the late Senator John McCain, who  believed deeply that the United States military should minimize  civilian casualties. This is something that everyone in our military  believes.   Now, the Department of Defense has made extraordinary progress in  recent years in preventing civilian harm. Secretary Austin has shown  leadership in accelerating that progress. As he says, ``Our efforts to  mitigate and respond to civilian harm . . . are a direct reflection of  U.S. values.''   Some of my colleagues want to prevent harm because of their own  personal experience in combat or witnessing war zones where civilians  have been killed, and some are motivated because they want to prevent  terrorists from exploiting civilian casualties as a recruiting tool.   But to do this, we need resources. I don't think $5 million a year is  very much. It is less than not just 1 percent, it is less than not just  0.1 percent, it is less than 0.01 percent of the entire budget to help  make sure we have the resources to track and report and minimize  civilian casualties.   I am hopeful that we can get bipartisan support for this amendment. I  recognize that this NDAA does a lot on minimizing civilian harm,  including the establishment of the Center of Excellence. I thank again  Chairman Smith for his leadership on that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I just  point out that a lot of these requirements already have passed. They  are in the 2018 NDAA. The amount of money we are talking about here is  less than 0.01 percent, so it will not have a negative impact on the  total budget.   Mr. Speaker, now that he is here in person, I thank again our  chairman, Chairman Smith, for all of the initiatives in the NDAA.   This NDAA, more than any in my 6 years in Congress, has tackled  civilian casualties, and I hope that there will continue to be a  bipartisan commitment in the House to reduce them to the extent  possible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for his  extraordinary leadership and having a strong amendment to affirm the  U.S.-India defense partnership. I thank Ranking Member Rogers for  making this amendment truly bipartisan.   There is no relationship of greater significance to the United  States' strategic interests than the U.S.-India partnership. It is  necessary to affirm democracies; it is necessary to stop China's border  aggression; it is necessary for us to lead in critical technologies.   This gives a sense that while we are building this relationship, we  should not be sanctioning India under CAATSA, and it also will help  facilitate India getting more of their defense from the United States  and not Russia.   I thank again Chairman Smith for his leadership and making sure that  this is bipartisan. I thank Kate Gould for her work on our staff and  the HASC staff on this and all the other amendments.                                time  2310
