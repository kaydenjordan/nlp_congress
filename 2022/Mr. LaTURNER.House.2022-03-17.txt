 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of George Nettels. A Pittsburg, Kansas, native and U.S. Army  veteran, George attended Pittsburg High School, graduated from the  University of Kansas, had a successful career in the private sector,  and went on to serve as the chair of the Kansas Republican Party.   At a time when many Americans in their fifties would start to slow  down, George was just speeding up. George and his wife, Josie, lived a  full life of travel and adventure and raised a beautiful family. To top  it all off, at the age of 84, George joined his grandson Jack in a  10,000-foot tandem jump.   Beyond teaching me important lessons about being grateful for those  that help you, George has personally inspired me and many others to  live a life of service to others. That is what George did. Whether it  was the community of Pittsburg, southeast Kansas, the State of Kansas,  or our great Nation, George put the well-being of others before  himself.                            ____________________
