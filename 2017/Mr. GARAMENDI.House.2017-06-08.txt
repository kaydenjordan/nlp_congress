 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the memory of  Mayor Steve Hardy of Vacaville, California, a man who dedicated his  life to service, first in the U.S. Navy for 5 years, then as a  policeman, and later in the California State Senate, where I had the  privilege of working with him when he was the staff director of the  Governmental Organization Committee.   During his tenure as mayor, he led the city through a very difficult  period--the Great Recession--revising the city's finances, bringing it  back to vitality, and also continuing the role of Vacaville as one of  the major cities in my district. It was a great pleasure working with  him during those years.   His marriage of 46 years to his wife, Jerri, is a testament not only  to his service to the community, but also to his family. He is survived  by his children. I look forward to his memory and to the future of  Vacaville.                            ____________________
