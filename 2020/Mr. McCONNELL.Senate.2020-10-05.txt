 Mr. President, the Senate has spent the last few days  like all Americans have, praying for quick healing and smooth recovery  for President Trump and the First Lady following their positive COVID- 19 tests.   I spoke to the President by phone twice this past weekend. Both  times, his spirits were high. Both times, we talked about the people's  business: our Nation's fight against this pandemic; his exceptional  nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Barrett; as well as our efforts to  continue rebuilding the economy for working families.   We are also thinking of our friends and colleagues, the senior  Senator for Utah, the senior Senator for Wisconsin, and the junior  Senator for North Carolina, who are currently working from home. The  standard cliche would say that these past few days have provided a  stark reminder of the dangers of this terrible virus, but the truth is  that our Nation did not need any such reminder.   More than 209,000 of our fellow citizens have lost their lives.  Millions have battled illness or had their lives disrupted by positive  tests. This past weekend, my home State of Kentucky just recorded its  highest ever--highest ever--one-day total for new cases. We all need to  remain vigilant. We all need to remain careful.   If the Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader had not spent  months blocking another bipartisan relief package over unrelated, far- left poison pills, we could have put hundreds of billions more dollars  for kids, jobs, and healthcare in the pipeline many weeks ago.   For the sake of our Nation, let's hope they finally lay down their  partisan demands and let our country get back on offense against this  disease.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in just a moment, I will move to  withdraw the pending cloture petitions and recess the Senate with pro  forma meetings until 2 weeks from today. Members will receive at least  24 hours' notice if any votes on urgent matters are scheduled before  October 19. That would take bipartisan consent. Otherwise, the full  Senate will next meet on October 19.  [[Page S6034]]    Obviously, the people's business does not come to a halt in the  absence of votes on the floor. The important work of our committees  will go forward as each committee sees fit. Chairman Graham has already  announced the Judiciary Committee will meet as planned on October 12 to  begin considering Judge Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court. We  are full steam ahead with the fair, thorough, and timely confirmation  process that Judge Barrett, the Court, and the Nation deserve.   The chairman has indicated the committee will use the same hybrid  format--with some participants appearing in person and others appearing  over video--that it has successfully used for more than 20 prior  hearings this year.   Let me say that again. The Judiciary Committee alone--just that  committee--has held more than 20 hybrid hearings since the start of the  pandemic. Many of these saw multiple Senators participating via video  conference. Some of them saw nominees participating by video  conference. At times, the Democratic members of the committee have gone  literally out of their way to praise this technology and the chairman's  flexibility with this format.   Across all of our committees, we have had 150 hybrid hearings since  the pandemic began. The Senate has used this format no fewer than 150  times. We have continued performing our constitutional duties while  protecting health and safety during the pandemic.   Our Democratic colleagues have largely welcomed this approach, and  they have frequently taken advantage of it. So whatever mix proves to  be the right decision at this time next week, it will be completely  consistent with the committee's own precedent and with the ways  committees all across the Senate have adapted and done their work  throughout the pandemic.   Our whole society is using these tools. Earlier today, the Supreme  Court itself resumed conducting oral arguments via teleconference, as  it has done since last spring. The Senate has been using these  processes for months. Just yesterday, the ranking member of the Rules  Committee reminded the country that she actually helped set them up.   It is nonsense for Senate Democrats to turn on a dime and now pretend  these procedures are somehow no longer workable. It is nonsense to  suggest that the tools that Senate Democrats have been happily using  across all of our committees for months have suddenly gone bad  overnight.   Nobody is taking these disingenuous tactics at face value because the  Democrats have told everyone, out loud, about their real intentions.  For weeks now, numerous Senate Democrats have publicly promised they  would try every trick in the book--every trick in the book--every  maneuver available, to obstruct and delay a fair confirmation process.   Weeks ago, the junior Senator from Hawaii pledged: ``I will look for  every procedural tool that I can [find] to make sure that this does not  happen.''   Weeks ago, the senior Senator from Massachusetts: ``We need to use  every tool. . . . We need to think seriously about everything we can do  to try to slow this down.''   The No. 2 Democratic Senator, our friend from Illinois, has said:  ``we [will] use whatever tools we have available'' to ``slow things  down.''   Just yesterday, in the very same press conference where the  Democratic leader claimed that his latest call to delay the hearings  were rooted in health and safety concerns, he gave the game away just  moments later. In that same press conference, he admitted, ``We will  use every tool in the toolbox to delay''--so much about health and  safety concerns.   Our Democratic colleagues have admitted out loud what all these  stalling tactics are about. Senate Democrats have openly admitted they  are grasping at straws to block the exceedingly well-qualified nominee  from receiving a fair and prompt process.   Look, we have months of experience governing this way while  protecting health and safety here in the Senate. This body will not  cease to function just because Democrats are afraid they may lose a  vote. Chairman Graham has all the options and procedures he needs to  supervise a fair, thorough, and hopefully dignified confirmation  hearing next week. That is just what is going to happen.   I look forward to seeing Judge Barrett's brilliance and  qualifications on full display starting 1 week from today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  cloture motions filed on Wednesday, September 30, be withdrawn.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of the Congressional Review Act, H.J.  Res. 90 remain in status quo through October 19, 2020.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the upcoming adjournment of the Senate, the President  of the Senate, the President pro tempore, and the majority and minority  leaders be authorized to make appointments to commissions, committees,  boards conferences, or interparliamentary conferences authorized by  law, by concurrent action of the two Houses, or by order of the Senate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn to then convene for pro  forma sessions only with no businesses be being conducted on the  following dates and times, and that following each pro forma session,  the Senate adjourn until the next pro forma session: Tuesday, October  6, at 11:30 a.m.; Friday, October 9, at 10 a.m.; Tuesday, October 13,  at 8:45 a.m.; Friday, October 16, at 4:30 p.m. I further ask unanimous  consent that when the Senate adjourn until Friday, October 16, it next  convene at 4:30 p.m. Monday, October 19, and that following the prayer  and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of  proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business being  closed; finally, following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to  executive session to resume the Newman nomination.    I object.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 4:47 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, October 6, 2020, at 11:30 a.m.
