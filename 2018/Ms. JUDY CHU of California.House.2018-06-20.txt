 Madam Speaker, today, I brought with me  two young people: Alcides Guandique, age 11, and Jose Guandique, age  13.   When I look at them, I think of 2 days ago when I visited the Trump  detention center at the southern border in San Diego with Members and  Leader Pelosi.   There we saw children torn from the arms of their parents under  Trump's zero-tolerance policy. We talked to the kids. We talked to the  mental health counselors who told us that children are traumatized.   Most of them have come here with their parents because they were  threatened with murder and rape by gangs in Central America and Mexico.  But because of Trump's policy of separation, these children have lost  the one constant person in their lives.   As a psychologist, I took note when the president of the American  Academy of Pediatrics visited detained kids. She said that, normally,  kids like this are rambunctious and running around. But these kids are  either screaming or crying or permanently quiet, and, in fact, that  kind of toxic stress can permanently affect their brains.   There is only one way to describe it: government-sanctioned child  abuse.   President Trump must own up to the policy that is his and his only.  He has the power to stop this terrible cruelty. Instead, he is using  these kids as a bargaining chip for $25 billion for a border wall. It  is time for him to stop. Stop ripping children from the arms of their  parents. America is better than this.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).
