 Mr. Speaker, the outsourcing of American manufacturing  jobs has not only resulted in job losses and lower wages at home, it is  threatening America's standing as an economic superpower on the global  stage.   The CHIPS and Science Act is the bold action we need to maintain our  global standing and provide a strong economic future for American  families, small businesses, and workers.   Critically, this legislation includes an estimated $1.8 billion for  the National Science Foundation's Established Program to Stimulate  Competitive Research, also known as EPSCoR, a critical program that  funds cutting-edge scientific research in smaller States like Rhode  Island with historically underfunded academic communities.   Drawing on the talent, knowledge, and perspectives of academic  institutions from every State, no matter how small, helps maintain our  competitive edge in scientific advancement.   With this and the other investments made in this legislation, we will  boost our domestic manufacturing capabilities and supply chains, end  our dangerous dependence on foreign manufacturers, advance U.S.  scientific research, lower costs for American consumers, and create  100,000 new, good-paying jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical  legislation.
