Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, in less than an hour, we will consider  the nomination of Rod Rosenstein to be Deputy Attorney General of the  United States.   We consider his nomination under highly unusual, if not unique,  circumstances. Only today, there were revelations from the House  Oversight Committee at a bipartisan conference indicating that General  Flynn, formerly the National Security Advisor, may have broken criminal  laws by his concealing payments from Russia--specifically, from Russia  Today--in connection with his speaking fees and travel expenses in  2015. He concealed these payments in security clearance forms submitted  in 2016, SF86 forms. False statements on such forms are a violation of  our criminal laws. His potential criminal liability is a serious and  important allegation that needs to be investigated further.   What we know for sure is that the investigation of this allegation  and others--this very colorful violation of Federal criminal law--can  be done reliably, impartially, and credibly only by a special  prosecutor. That is why I have asked Mr. Rosenstein to commit that he  will appoint a special prosecutor to investigate this allegation as  well as others involving the President's staff, campaign associates,  and staff in connection with Russia's interference with our election.   There is no question that the Russians sought to interfere and that  they did so. That is the conclusion of the investigation that was  already done by our intelligence community, and it is a conclusion that  is virtually universally accepted. The only question now is this: What  was the involvement and potential collusion and aiding and abetting of  Americans in that Russian cyber attack on this country? In my view, it  was an act of war. We can debate that question.   What is undebatable is the need for a thorough, impartial, vigorous,  and aggressive investigation that will give that information to the  American people. It must be an investigation that can pursue criminal  wrongdoing, if it is proved, and that can prosecute it and ultimately  make that investigation transparent to the American people so they know  what actually happened.   I have asked Rod Rosenstein to follow the precedent that was  established by Elliot Richardson under circumstances that were not  unlike the ones we encountered here.   The saying is that history almost never repeats, but it rhymes. What  we have here is a situation that rhymes with the one that Elliot  Richardson encountered when he was Attorney General-designee. He was  requested to appoint a special prosecutor as a condition of his  confirmation. He agreed to do so in 1973. He appointed Archibald Cox.  That, in turn, led to the Watergate investigation and, ultimately, it  vindicated the judgment on the part of our Senate Judiciary Committee  that an independent special prosecutor was necessary under those  circumstances.   My colleague who is presiding, as a former State attorney general,  knows well the importance of independence and credibility in any  judicial role of this kind. This Nation now faces a looming  constitutional crisis--again, not unlike Watergate, which ultimately  resulted in United States v. Nixon before the U.S. Supreme Court, a  subpoena that had to be enforced by that special prosecutor against the  President of the United States.   Only Rod Rosenstein can vindicate that important public interest.  Only the Deputy Attorney General of the United States can appoint a  special prosecutor because the Attorney General rightly has recused  himself. Jeff Sessions has recused himself because of his own  conversations with Russian officials, which he failed to disclose  during testimony to the Judiciary Committee.   Only the Deputy Attorney General can perform that vital function, and  only a special prosecutor can do what is necessary to vindicate the  public interest through a vigorous investigation into any criminal  wrongdoing and to prosecute lawbreakers.   I have confidence that our Intelligence Committee in the Senate will  impartially and objectively do whatever it can to uncover the truth.  But even if it succeeds--and there are obstacles and challenges to its  success--it cannot pursue a criminal investigation,  [[Page S2517]]  and it cannot bring criminal charges and pursue a conviction. It  probably cannot make fully transparent or disclose all of the facts  that it uncovers. Its custom is to issue a report and, when it does so,  redacting information that can be considered classified or sensitive.  It may well lead, in an abundance of caution, toward redacting rather  than disclosing.   That is why I have asked Rod Rosenstein, as a condition of his  becoming Deputy Attorney General, to commit that he will appoint a  special independent prosecutor. Call that office whatever you wish-- special counsel, independent counsel, special prosecutor. The role is  what is significant. It is someone who will uncover the wrongdoing and  follow the evidence and the facts wherever they lead.   Neither Mr. Rosenstein nor Mr. Sessions can do so. Neither Rosenstein  nor Sessions will ever convince the public that they are really  pursuing their boss, the President of the United States, if there is  evidence that leads to his culpability. They report to him. Rod  Rosenstein reports to Jeff Sessions, and he, in turn, reports to the  President of the United States. That is why the appearance and the  reality of independence is so critically important, and that is why  only a special prosecutor can pursue that interest.   If we were in normal times, Rod Rosenstein would be an eminently  acceptable nominee, and I would welcome his nomination without  attaching any kind of request or condition. He is certainly an  honorable public servant. He is a career prosecutor. I admire his  dedication and commitment to public service. As U.S. attorney for  Maryland, he certainly has an admirable record. He is, in some senses,  what we value in the Department of Justice--someone who is committed to  the rule of law. That is why I have been surprised and disappointed  that he has failed to heed my request.   Whatever happens today, I want to ensure my colleagues and, most  especially, him and the loyal and dedicated members of the Department  of Justice that I will support his work in his capacity as Deputy  Attorney General, if he is confirmed today, because the professionalism  of the Department of Justice is of preeminent interest for me  personally, having served as a U.S. attorney and also as attorney  general of my State, but it is also vitally important to the American  people.   We must consider his nomination in the light of the looming  constitutional crisis that our Nation confronts. It is a crisis partly  of the administration's making by its attacks on the judiciary, calling  a member of the bench a ``so-called judge,'' saying to the American  people that a circuit court of appeals will be responsible for any  violence that may occur as a result of its ruling on the  constitutionality of Executive orders related to immigration, demeaning  and disparaging a judge because of his ethnic heritage--a judge born,  in fact, in Indiana.   These kinds of attacks on the judiciary undermine respect and trust  in a branch of government that is the bulwark of our democracy and  that, in my view, when the history of this era is written, will be  regarded as having been one of its finest hours. We will be relying on  it to protect our Nation's fundamental rights and liberties. The  independence of the judiciary is a sacred pillar of our democracy, and  it must be free of political interference.   The other hero of this era, in my view, will be the press, which has  uncovered many of the facts leading to my conclusion, joined by so many  of my colleagues, that there must be a special prosecutor. That  conclusion is not mine alone. It has been joined by many of my  colleagues, 10 of them having cosigned a letter I wrote in mid-February  asking for a special prosecutor.   The independence of our judiciary and of our prosecutors is so  critically important for the trust and credibility of the American  people that the rule of law will prevail and that no official will put  himself above the rule of law. That is the threat and the  constitutional crisis that we potentially face.   Two high-ranking administration officials have been caught  misrepresenting their ties with Russia. One of them is, in fact, the  Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, who did so before the Judiciary  Committee, under oath.   Mr. Rosenstein has said that he wants to be approved by the Senate  before he decides whether to appoint a special prosecutor, but that  delay will mean that a man who was hired and can be fired by President  Trump will decide whether the Trump administration will face a thorough  and complete investigation. This body has a duty to insist on it before  his confirmation. We must seize this opportunity to assure  accountability to the American people and make sure also about their  confidence in our electoral system. While Mr. Rosenstein has claimed he  needs to be in office to familiarize himself with the facts of an  investigation into the Trump administration before he can commit to  appointing a special prosecutor, the row of facts are all a matter of  public record now.    We know Russia interfered in the 2016 election. We know the FBI is  investigating Trump administration lawbreaking associated with that  interference. That investigation has been confirmed by the Director of  the FBI himself. We know Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with  officials of Russia's Government, and yet he said under oath that he  did not meet with those Russians. That is more than ample information  to justify appointing a special prosecutor, but there is much more,  including actions by Carter Page, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone. These  kinds of abundant facts are known now and warrant this action and also  more than justify this body insisting that he commit to appointing that  special prosecutor.   That public information concerning known associates of the President  and their Russian contacts includes General Flynn's actions disclosed  today. On December 10, 2015, General Flynn was paid to attend an event  in Moscow celebrating the 10th anniversary of Russia Today, a  propaganda arm of the Russian Government. He concealed the amount  Russia Today paid him for speaking fees and travel expenses in those  security clearance forms he submitted in 2016, the SF86. He dined with  Vladimir Putin just 18 months after leaving his position leading the  Defense Intelligence Agency. As a retired general, he is prohibited  from receipt of consulting fees, gifts, travel expenses, honorary or  any other kind of salary from a foreign government without  congressional consent. That action also is a potentially prosecutable  action.   After the election, General Flynn spoke repeatedly to Russian  Ambassador Kislyak regarding lifting sanctions on Putin, an amazing act  of disloyalty. Misleading Vice President Pence and the American public  on the nature of these secret discussions, he demonstrated a lack of  candor and credibility inconsistent with the role of National Security  Advisor, and therefore he was compelled to resign.   The President also selected Carter Page to serve during the campaign  on his foreign policy advisory committee. He is the same individual we  have learned who was under investigation for his contacts with Russian  agents.   The President's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, worked for years on  a disinformation campaign to benefit the Putin government and was paid  millions of dollars to do so. The President's son-in-law Jared Kushner  held an undisclosed meeting with both the Russian Ambassador and also  executives from a Russian bank, EDB, a bank built by Putin's cronies.  The President himself has sold real estate to Russian investors seeking  to profit from their corrupt activities in Russia or, as his son,  Donald Trump, put it, ``We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.''   The administration's supposed attempts to investigate itself have  produced mixed signals and clear conflicts of interest such as House  Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes's ill-fated trip to the White House to  discuss his committee findings.   The robust congressional oversight hearings that we all hope will  happen are certainly essential, but only the Department of Justice can  analyze these facts and information which are only the tip of the  iceberg--analyze it, digest it, determine its relevance to a criminal  investigation and to a prosecution, pursuit of a violation of law and  charges. The FBI can investigate, but it cannot bring charges. Only a  lawyer from the Department of Justice can do so, and only a special  prosecutor can make that judgment independently and impartially without  having to  [[Page S2518]]  worry about what his boss thinks or what his boss's boss thinks.   So I have reached the conclusion reluctantly--because Rod Rosenstein  has a very admirable record of public service--that I must vote against  his nomination in just a short time because of his failure to commit to  a special prosecutor. I have no illusions about convincing my  colleagues about joining me to vote on cloture with a degree of realism  about the views of this body on his nomination, but I hope he will heed  the example of Mr. Richardson in 1973 and also of Jim Comey, who at one  point also resorted to a special prosecutor to investigate a  controversial matter that arose during President George Bush's  administration.   There is clear, unmistakable, bipartisan precedent for a special  prosecutor under these circumstances. There is not only precedent,  there is historical imperative. At the root of this constitutional  crisis is a concern for the rule of law, for preserving the public's  faith and trust and respect for our justice system. It is at the  foundation of what we do when we vote. When we make laws, we presume  they will be rigorously and fairly enforced without fear or favor, and  that no official, not even the President of the United States, will be  placed above the law. That is the lesson of Watergate, but it is also  the lesson established throughout our history, going back to the  Founders and the preeminent role played by our U.S. Supreme Court.   I will support Mr. Rosenstein in his efforts to pursue the truth and  pursue justice, as I believe he must do, and I hope he will do because  the credibility the of the Department of Justice and our justice system  is so much at stake.   I urge my colleagues to vote against his nomination, as I will do,  but I also pledge my support for him and the loyal, dedicated,  hardworking members of the Department of Justice if he is confirmed.
