 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about the debate this week  over the Graham-Cassidy proposal with respect to healthcare that is  being considered by the body. I have high regard for both of these  colleagues. I serve with each of them on different committees. I oppose  the bill and want to talk a little bit about why I do but more  specifically about an aspect of the bill that I find puzzling.   It is no surprise to me that there are many in this body who would  like to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. When the Democrats  were in the majority for my first 2 years in the Senate, I often sat in  the chair where the Presiding Officer sits. I heard a lot of people  giving speeches on the floor. I was in the Chair during an all-night  sort of filibuster by the Senator from Texas about the repeal and  replacement of the Affordable Care Act. I get that there are arguments  about it. While I support the Affordable Care Act--I strongly did in  2010 and still do--I do want to work with my colleagues to find  solutions to improve healthcare. There are differences of opinion about  it.   One thing I never heard during all of the speeches that I heard,  either as a presider or paying attention on the floor, was Members  getting up and saying they wanted to dramatically cut Medicaid. That is  not anything that anybody has filibustered about. That is not anything  that people speak about.   When President Trump campaigned, he said: I am unique on the forum  right now of all these candidates in that I will not cut the Medicaid  Program. When the Senate started to consider versions of the ObamaCare  repeal and replacement over the summer, after the House acted, what  interested me was not the portions of the bill that attempted to  replace the Affordable Care Act but the significant changes to the  Medicaid Program that were never advertised. There was never this  discussion: We are going to repeal ObamaCare, and we want to cut  Medicaid. It was always about ObamaCare.   I am puzzled, standing here today, considering a Graham-Cassidy  proposal that not only would be a fundamental change of repeal and  replacement of the Affordable Care Act but also contains a very  significant revision of Medicaid that would hurt my State and would  hurt a lot of people I care about. That never seems to be acknowledged,  and I am puzzled about why.   As to the Graham-Cassidy proposal, again, I respect my colleagues,  and I think they are putting it on the table because they think it  would be preferable to the current system. I don't question their  motives. I was a Governor, and the notion of block grants and  discretion and dollars back to the State can be a good thing. Quickly,  before I get to the Medicaid piece, the problem is if you take the  Graham-Cassidy proposal, it takes the dollars that are currently being  delivered to the States through the Affordable Care Act, shrinks them  by about $240 billion over 10 years, and then eliminates them. Even  with the shuffling of the deck on a block grant that might benefit one  State over another, you can't take $240 billion out of the system, in  my view, without making people's premiums go up.   The money that is being delivered to States is largely delivered to  help people either get a tax credit premium or pay out-of-pocket costs.  If you take that much out of the system over 10 years, people's  premiums are going to go up. That breaks a promise of President  Trump's, who said that nobody is  [[Page S6104]]  going to lose coverage and nobody is going to pay more. People will pay  more, if Graham-Cassidy passes, in the short term, over the next 10  years. Then, when all of the money expires after 10 years, they will  pay a lot more. I oppose that.   Second, I also oppose the way this bill treats preexisting  conditions. By allowing States to waive essential health benefits, it  might be technically true to say that you could get a policy even if  you had a preexisting condition, but the insurance company could say to  you: I will write you a policy, but you are a diabetic; so the policy  will not cover insulin. Or I will write you a policy, but you are a  woman of childbearing age; the policy will not cover maternity care.   If the policy doesn't cover your preexisting condition, then  preexisting conditions are not protected. To my read of the 141-page  bill--which has been revised a little bit, or so I hear, since I got  the most recent version Friday to read it over the weekend--that is  exactly what States can do. Because 43 of 50 States did not protect  people with preexisting conditions before the Affordable Care Act,  handing this power back to the States and allowing them to waive these  benefits, I think, would jeopardize the tens of millions of Americans  who do have preexisting conditions.   Finally, I don't like the fact that the current bill, as I understand  it, ends funding for Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood doesn't  have a line item in the budget. To the extent that Planned Parenthood  gets funding, it gets funding for this reason: It provides primary  medical care to women who are Medicaid-eligible, and they get services  at Planned Parenthood that are Medicaid-eligible to be reimbursed.   Since Federal funding cannot be used for abortion services, the  defunding of Planned Parenthood basically says that if you serve a  woman who chooses to go to you for her primary healthcare and she is  Medicaid eligible, we will not pay you for that service. That seems, to  me, to be wrong. If women are choosing to go to Planned Parenthood, and  they think that is the best place to go for primary care, why would we  disable them and force them to go elsewhere by disabling Planned  Parenthood from reimbursement?   All right. Those are some challenges I have, but I want to get to the  real guts of my concern, which is the effort to go after Medicaid.   The Graham-Cassidy bill--and it is similar to the skinny repeal bill  and other bills that were on the table that the Senate considered--goes  into the Medicaid Program that was passed in 1965, which was long  before the Affordable Care Act--long before it--and it puts caps on the  program to restrict the growth of Medicaid spending. The estimate is  that over the next 10 years, it will take $1.2 billion out of Medicaid.  Yet no description of Graham-Cassidy that I have ever heard a sponsor  mention and no description of any of the bills that have been pending  on the Senate floor say we are going to repeal ObamaCare and that we  want to go into the Medicaid Act of 1965 and dramatically cut Medicaid.   Why is that never made plain as it is a core feature of these bills?  I would argue, it is sort of the core within the Trojan horse of the  repeal of the Affordable Care Act to go in and change Medicaid. Yet it  is never advertised that way, and it is never explained. You could have  put a bill on the table to repeal the Affordable Care Act and could  have left Medicaid alone. You would have touched the Medicaid expansion  that was part of the Affordable Care Act, certainly, but you could have  left the core Medicaid Program alone. Why was there an effort to both  repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut Medicaid but not to say we are  cutting Medicaid?   Maybe it is because, if you were to say that, you would directly  counter a promise the President made, ``I am not going to cut  Medicaid.'' Maybe there is a concern about, boy, we are taking $1.2  billion out of Medicaid, and we are about to come up with a big tax  proposal that might give tax breaks for the wealthiest. We do not want  to take money away from a program that is for the poor, elderly,  disabled, or children and then immediately turn right around and  increase the deficit by a tax cut.   I find this to be the big mystery of this entire debate, in that  every proposal that is on the floor makes massive cuts to the core  Medicaid Program even though it has nothing to do with the Affordable  Care Act. Nobody ever acknowledges it, and nobody ever explains it, but  I am here to both say it is real and to challenge it.   Who are Medicaid recipients? I think there tends to be a little bit  of a misconception about who gets Medicaid in this country.   In Virginia, 50 percent of Medicaid recipients are children. The  proposal, under Graham-Cassidy, calls for a $1.2 billion cut in  Medicaid in Virginia over the next 10 years and a $120 billion cut in  Medicaid nationally. In Virginia, 50 percent of Medicaid recipients are  kids. One in three births in Virginia--one in three births every year-- is compensated by Medicaid. Two in three nursing home residents are  supported by Medicaid. There are a lot of people with disabilities in  Virginia who are supported by Medicaid. The home and community-based  waiver programs, under the core Medicaid bill, support nearly 50,000  Virginians in community settings of their own choosing. Medicaid is  also the primary payer for behavioral health services--mental health  treatment, substance abuse prevention treatment.   That is what this bill goes after even though that Medicaid funding  has nothing to do with ObamaCare, nothing to do with the Affordable  Care Act. So reducing Medicaid spending by the $120 billion-plus over  10 years or more in the out-years would not hand more power to States.  No, it would dramatically limit the States' ability to provide the  kinds of services that are needed by our most vulnerable--kids, seniors  in nursing homes, and people with disabilities.   Later today, I am going to have a meeting in my office with folks who  have communicated with me over the course of this debate--really since  January when I was added to the HELP Committee. They are coming in to  tell me how frightened they are about what will happen if Graham- Cassidy passes.   Samantha and Justin McGovern are parents. They have a girl,  Josephine, who is 1\1/2\ years old. They are from Springfield, which is  right here in Northern Virginia. Josephine is about 18 months old, and  she was very premature--24 weeks gestation. She was 1 pound 12 ounces  when she was born. That is the size of six sticks of butter. That is  how tiny this little girl was. She was hospitalized, after her  premature birth, for 407 days, across three units, in two hospitals, in  two States. She is home and thriving now, but she is supported by a  ventilator 24/7 via a tracheostomy, and she is fed primarily through a  gastrointestinal tube.   Her mother Samantha writes:         We are fortunate that we get to focus on her health rather       than medical crippling bills. We estimate that her hospital       stay would have exceeded $4 million, and the cost for her       monthly medical expenses (baseline . . . not sick) is about       $26,000 a month (if we didn't have insurance or Medicaid       coverage).    Here is what she writes:         We are fortunate we have amazing private insurance through       our employer. However, if it were legal to have annual or       lifetime caps, I don't know what would happen to us. Part of       our Medicaid covers private duty nursing so that we can sleep       and go to work. Without nursing, one of us would have to       leave their job, and there would be no way we could continue       to live in our house [or pay our insurance]. If there are       caps and we lost our insurance, we would depend on Medicaid       even more than we do now, and we would have less coverage       than we currently have, making it virtually impossible for       Josephine to continue to be followed by the doctors who saved       her life.        Basically, if [this bill] passes, life as we know it could       fall apart. I don't know how we would be able to support our       daughter, how we could keep her home and not in an       institution. She deserves to be home. She deserves to have       every opportunity to thrive.    I met Rebecca Wood at a forum in Charlottesville. She has a 5-year- old daughter, Charlie. I met them in July.   Charlie's mom says:         Charlie . . . is five-years-old and loves playing outdoors,       live music, things with numbers, and anything with animals.       Charlie was born more than three months early and, as a       result, is developmentally delayed. Currently, Charlie       requires physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT),       and speech therapy. She has a . . . (feeding tube) and wears       orthotics. Affordable care is the difference between       independence as an adult or a permanent disability. Due to       a three month NICU stay [when she was born], Charlie would       have exceeded her lifetime cap before she ever came home       for the first time.  [[Page S6105]]       Then, she would have been uninsurable due to her birth       being a preexisting condition. Also, Institutional       Medicaid paid for a large portion of her NICU stay. Upon       discharge, a Medicaid waiver helps with out of pocket       costs and provides services that [our private] insurance       doesn't cover. She would not be where she is without any       of these things. The changes in the proposed healthcare       bill would cause Charlie to drastically lose access to       these services. Receiving healthcare services is her       chance to leave a life-limiting disability behind.    The last story I will tell is of Eric Young, from Norfolk, on behalf  of his son, Ethan.   Eric has major concerns about Graham-Cassidy. His son, Ethan, has  what is called heterotaxy syndrome, which is an incredibly complex  congenital heart defect. There are seven defects that are combined in  this brave and thriving youngster. Eric said that Ethan has had two  open heart surgeries and is having his third in November.   Eric writes:         I anticipate his healthcare charges to surpass the $1M mark       before the end of the year. It's not an ``if'' for Ethan--      it's when. ``He'' will have spent more on healthcare in his       first 2 years of life than most people will during their       entire lives. He's the outlier. But he's exactly the type of       kid that needs protecting.        Dealing with such a critical issue when your baby is first       born is overwhelming--having to worry about whether or not       your decisions to save your child will affect whether he . .       . [can] even obtain health insurance when he gets to be an       adult is just wrong.    Eric writes about the ACA, as Eric works in the healthcare industry:         The ACA is not perfect--it needs to be changed. I work in       healthcare--so I have the perspective of seeing it from my       job and as a parent. But, we need a real bill that is well       thought out, not something just for the sake of passing.    I wanted to come and really just talk about these youngsters. One out  of every three children born in Virginia is able to be born in a  hospital because of Medicaid, and 50 percent of Medicaid recipients are  kids. If you were a child and you needed a wheelchair, your private  insurance likely would not cover it. If you get a wheelchair, it is  usually Medicaid that pays for it. If you go to school and then you get  an individualized education plan and your public school system provides  you some services, it is Medicaid that is usually paying the school  system to reimburse it for the services that are provided.   My wife used to be a juvenile court judge, and this was the situation  she would face all the time with kids in the court. It would be a  heartbreaking situation, but there was an answer. You would have  teenagers who were working so hard to be successful--not in court  because of violating the law, not in court because of trouble but in  court because their families were so dysfunctional nobody could take  care of them. As a judge, my wife would have to grapple with this:  Where is this child going to live? Who is going to help this child get  to school? This kid is trying to succeed. Do I have to put the child in  a group home or institutionalize the child because there is no family  support there?   What my wife could do as a juvenile court judge--and this happens all  over Virginia every day and all over the country every day--is say: OK.  The child is capable of success, but the family is dysfunctional. May I  send a counselor to the home? May I find an aunt or uncle, and maybe  with some support of counseling, provide some stability so this child  does not have to be institutionalized and can be successful? When my  wife would order that, it was Medicaid that was paying for it.   Medicaid pays for your birth, Medicaid pays for your wheelchair, and  Medicaid pays for the services a local school system will provide so  you can have a life of independence. If your whole world is falling  apart around you and you are doing everything you can to succeed,  Medicaid can actually pay for counseling so you can keep it together  and graduate from high school and go on and go to college and be  successful.   Medicaid is advancing these challenged kids toward lives of  independence and success. Yet the bill that is on the floor before us  would cut, by the most recent estimate, $120 billion out of Medicaid  over the next 10 years and more beyond. Why? Why is that not  acknowledged? Why would you use the bill to cut Medicaid when all of  the rhetoric about it is that we have to repeal the Affordable Care  Act?   I think the right answer to this question is just staring us in the  face, and it was what we gave Senator McCain a standing ovation for in  July when he came back after getting his tough diagnosis. He came back,  and he said: Look, healthcare is just too important. It is just too  important. It is the most important expenditure anybody ever makes. It  is the biggest sector of the American economy. It is the kind of thing  that keeps parents up at night, worrying about what is going to happen  to their children tomorrow or in 20 years, when the parents are  deceased, and they want to know the children can have independent  lives.   We just cannot afford to get this wrong, and the answer about getting  it right is staring us right in the face. Let the HELP Committee, on  which I serve--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee-- and let the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid and  Medicare, take up everybody's ideas: the Graham-Cassidy bill and Bernie  Sanders' bill. I have a bill about reinsurance, but it is so wonky it  is never going to be on a bumper sticker. I think it would be a good  bill, but I have not been able to have a hearing on it.   Let the committees that are of a Republican majority but with  Democrats who know some things about healthcare take up these bills,  hear from the parents, hear from the hospitals, hear from the doctors,  and come up with a bipartisan set of solutions that will make  healthcare better, not worse.   We were on the verge of doing that in the HELP Committee. We had 4  hearings with about 20 witnesses. We not only had committee members  involved, but Chairman Lamar Alexander and Ranking Member Patty Murray  did a good thing--they opened up a coffee before every hearing and  said: Hey, if you are not on the committee but you want to meet these  witnesses and hear what they have to say, come and talk and ask them  questions. We had over 50 Senators participate. We were working on a  bipartisan bill and basically had a handshake deal last week to  stabilize the individual insurance market for a couple of years. In a  deliberate way, in a careful way, we considered Republican and  Democratic ideas for improving health insurance.   Then, last Wednesday, the President tweeted out, in working with the  Speaker and the majority leader, that they did not want the bipartisan  effort to go forward. No. We have to push the Graham-Cassidy bill--the  bill that is about the repeal of ObamaCare but that also has within the  Trojan horse these massive cuts to Medicaid that will hurt kids.   I don't know why we had to set aside the bipartisan effort. I don't  know why we had to submarine the good-faith work of the committee under  the leadership of a great chair and a great ranking member. It is my  hope that at the end of the week, we will have defeated the Graham- Cassidy bill and that we will go back to being the Senate we should be.   I will just say what I have said a couple of times on this floor.  This is one we cannot afford to get wrong. The parents of these kids  already have enough to worry about. Why would we make it harder on  them? We do not have to. We can be better than that. That is what I ask  we do.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
