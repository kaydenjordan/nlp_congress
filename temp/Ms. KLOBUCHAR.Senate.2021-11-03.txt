 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators  Hoeven, Murray, McConnell, and I be able to complete our remarks prior  to the scheduled vote.    Madam President, Senator Hoeven and I are here to  speak in favor of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works,  but I did want to first thank Senator Murkowski for her well-reasoned  remarks and for her willingness to go forward with this debate. This is  a debate about fundamental voting rights. We may not agree on  everything, but she wants to have the debate, and that is all we are  asking for.   We are asking to move forward with this very important piece of  legislation. If there are things people don't like or things they like,  we can discuss them, but this place has got to start working. We need  to restore the Senate so we can debate the big issues of our time.   I truly appreciate Senator Murkowski's willingness to do this today  with her vote.    With that, I will turn it over to Senator Murray.   Thank you very much, Senator Hoeven.    Mr. President, I look forward to responding to my  colleague in the future, but I can tell you that people I know around  the country want to see their costs go down, and that is exactly what  this bill is about. It is about bringing families' costs down, from  childcare to taking care of loved ones; seniors; to bring down the cost  of prescription drugs--something that has eluded our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, despite a lot of claims that they would do  something about it.   So we look forward to debating this bill and getting it done.                  American Innovation and Choice Online Act    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on behalf of a very  important piece of new legislation that is bipartisan.   I introduced this bill, the American Innovation and Choice Online  Act, in the last month with Senator Grassley, who was here with us  today and will be here shortly; as well as my colleagues Senator  Durbin, the chair of the Judiciary Committee; Senator Lindsey Graham,  the former chair of the Judiciary Committee; Richard Blumenthal, who is  here with us today; Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana; Senator Cory  Booker; Senator Josh Hawley; Senator Cynthia Lummis; and Senator Mazie  Hirono, who is here with us today; as well as Senator Mark Warner.   America has a major monopoly power problem, and nowhere is this more  obvious than with tech. It is because, in part, it is 20 percent of our  economy.  [[Page S7709]]  And while we love the new jobs, the new ideas, the new technology that  have come out, we all know that you can't just do nothing on privacy,  do nothing on competition, and that our competition laws haven't been  updated in any serious way since the invention of the internet.   I am here, again, joined with Senator Grassley. I am going to let him  go ahead of me and then turn to Senator Blumenthal and Senator Hirono,  and I will finish up because they have been very patient.   I so appreciate Senator Grassley's leadership in this area; one, to  make sure the FTC and the Department of Justice Antitrust have the  funding they need with the bill that we passed through this Chamber to  update merger fees, as well as the work that we are doing right now. It  is so important on self-preferencing.   It is this simple: Companies, just because they are dominant  platforms, shouldn't be able to put their own stuff in front of  everyone else that advertises on our platform. They shouldn't be able  to steal ideas and data and develop products off the people who are  simply trying to advertise their products on the platform and develop  knockoffs, which is exactly what we know, from some really good  reporting from the Wall Street Journal and others, has been happening.   And they shouldn't be able to, because they are dominant platforms,  tell people who advertise: Hey, if you want to get your stuff near the  top of the search engine, then you are going to have to buy a whole  bunch of things from us.   That is what reunites us on this bill, the simple concept of  competition.   I turn it over to my friend, my neighbor from the State of Iowa,  Senator Grassley.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for his  leadership in working with colleagues, and I am glad he mentioned  Representatives Cicilline and Buck. They are quite the bipartisan duo.  But, then, we worked with them to make some changes to this legislation  in order to bring it to our colleagues, and we are very proud of the  work we have done. We think it is going to make a big, big difference.   With that, I will turn it over to Senator Hirono.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to speak up to 7 minutes; Senator Merkley, up to 15 minutes;  and Senator Durbin, up to 10 minutes prior to the scheduled votes.    Madam President, I want to thank my colleague Senator  Grassley, the Republican lead on this bill; Senator Blumenthal, who has  done so much work in the area of competition and protection of  children; and Senator Hirono, who came to the floor today; as well as  our original cosponsors of this bill, with many more supporters out  there. And that includes Senator Durbin, the Chair of the Judiciary  Committee; Senator Lindsey Graham, the former chair; Senator Kennedy;  Senator Cory Booker; Senator Josh Hawley, Senator Lummis; and Senator  Warner.   So, as we noted, as you heard the speakers today, this is a real- world problem. This isn't something where the tech companies can say  ``just trust us, we've got this.''   I think anyone who heard the whistleblower a few weeks back in  Commerce knows that is not true; or heard the parent I heard from last  week, who told me that, as she tries to protect her kids, as she tries  to find the right filter or to get them to stop clicking on a link or  doing something that is going to expose them to bad content and bad  accounts, she said she feels like it is a faucet that is on and it is  overflowing in a sink, and she is trying to mop it up, and then the  water just keeps coming out as she goes from kid to kid to kid.   I think that pretty much sums it up for how a lot of parents feel  right now.   And the other thing that is going on when you have dominant platforms  and you don't have enough competition and you can't get competitors  that might have developed the bells and whistles that would have  protected us from misinformation and from bad information for our  kids--well, that is what happens when you have dominant platforms.   And you know what else happens to you when you go to search for  restaurant reviews, you might not be able to see what you really want  to see. Instead, you get pushed towards less reputable and less  informative reviews; or when you go to try to book a flight, you might  be missing out on a better deal because of certain dominant platforms'  own booking tool is being pushed to the top of your results. You are  basically getting ripped off. That is it, plain and simple.   It also means a dominant platform using nonpublic data--nonpublic  data, stuff it gathered from you. And, by the way, one example,  Facebook makes $51 a quarter--a quarter--off of every one of the pages  that is sitting here in front of us, off of Senator Merkley, who is  patiently waiting to speak. Fifty-one dollars a quarter is how much  they make because they have got access to all this information, and  then the ads get targeted to us. And we don't get any of that money.   Dominant platforms, using nonpublic data that they gather from small  businesses can use their platforms--and this is in the retail space; we  are talking here, like, Amazon--to build knockoff copies of their  products and then compete against the people who we are paying to  advertise on their platform.   This isn't your local grocery store chain selling store brand potato  chips to compete with a brand-name product. This is Amazon using  incredibly detailed, nonpublic information that they get from their  sellers on their platform to create copycat products and box out  competition from small innovators.   What does it look like?   In one case, an employee of Amazon's private label arm accessed a  detailed sales report with 25 columns of information on a car trunk  organizer produced by a small Brooklyn company called Fortem. In  October 2019, Amazon started selling three trunk organizers of its own.  When shown the collection data Amazon had gathered about his brand  before launching of their own product, Fortem's cofounder called it a  big surprise.   Yeah, I don't think most of us assume that trillion-dollar companies  put their troves of data to work boxing small businesses out of the  trunk organizer market. But it happened.   That is why we are here supporting the American Innovation and Choice  Online Act.   Yeah, you have got to update your competition laws when they haven't  been changed since the internet was invented.   What does this mean?   Apple won't be able to stifle competition by blocking other  companies' services from interoperating with their platform. Amazon  won't be able to misuse small businesses' data in order to copy their  products. And Google won't be able to bias their platform's search  results in favor of other products--their own products.   The result?   A fairer playing field for small and medium businesses, more options,  more flexibility, and more access to markets and fostering  entrepreneurship for the new kids on the block.   And, by the way, as Senator Grassley outlined, this bill does not  outlaw Amazon Prime. Let's go for the lie. It does not do that. That is  what they have been saying because they want to stop this in its  tracks; or free shipping; or stop Apple from freeloading useful apps  onto their iPhones. No, no, no. This is the kind of stuff they have  been saying for a while.   And that is why Senator Grassley and I spent the entire summer  working on this bill, to make sure it did none of that. That is why we  have such broad support, because this is targeted at anti-competitive  conduct.   We are really excited about this bill. The positive opinions it has  been getting--Boston Globe, Washington Post: ``Finally a promising  piece of tech antitrust legislation in Congress.''   I think there are other ones, but that is what they said in there.   So commonsense rules of the road for major digital platforms,  allowing them to continue to operate their businesses. We are glad for  these products. We like these products. We want to keep these companies  strong. But they don't need to engage in this kind of behavior. That is  why we are here today, and we are looking very forward to getting this  bill before the Judiciary Committee and passed through the Senate.  [[Page S7712]]    I yield the floor.
