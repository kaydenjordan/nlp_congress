 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Financial Literacy  Month, which is celebrated every year in April.   Whether it is purchasing your first car, getting a job, going to  college, starting a family, or even saving for retirement, it is  imperative that Americans of all ages have the capacity to make sound  financial decisions. That is precisely what I have been fighting for  these last two decades.   In the Ohio Statehouse, I successfully spearheaded legislation  requiring all public high school students to complete a financial  literacy class prior to graduation. Now I am proud to continue this  important work in the Halls of Congress.   Working with the Jump$tart Coalition and serving as the co-chair of  the House Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus, I had the opportunity  to recently host and honor students during Financial Literacy Day on  the Hill.   Mr. Speaker, I am asking all of our colleagues, Democrats and  Republicans, to join us in Financial Literacy Month.                            ____________________
