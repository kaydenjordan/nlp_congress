 Mr. Speaker, there are some things in this bill that  probably make sense, and there are some things in this bill that I  think are very poorly crafted and will have adverse implications for  juvenile law or for sentencing reform.   We should have had a hearing. We should have looked into this whole  [[Page H7932]]  matter and come up with something that we could all support.   Now, one of the things, I hate to say, is that there is a sense of  urgency here. The problem is the majority sat on their hands.   This decision of the Supreme Court was April 17 of this year. What  did the committee do in response? Nothing. Nothing. No bill was  introduced. No hearings were held. Then, last week, this piece of  legislation was introduced and rushed to the floor without adequate  thought.   So, yes, we need to act, but we need to act like grownups. We need to  make sure that we are doing something that makes sense.   I am actually going to vote ``present'' on this vote, because I don't  want a ``no'' vote on the portions of the bill that I know are correct  having to do with child abduction.   But I can't support something that is so poorly crafted, that is a  product of such disdain for the need to be serious about this issue.   If we don't want to trample on the good work we did, and we have yet  to bring to fruition on sentencing reform the juvenile justice issues  that loom so large in our communities, we just can't go ahead blindly  on this bill.   I thought it was important to point out that the majority has a  responsibility to react to court decisions, and they failed in this  case.
