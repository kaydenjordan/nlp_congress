 Madam Chair, I thank my friend from Michigan,  Representative Levin, for yielding.   Madam Chair, preventing foreign election interference is a bipartisan  issue. This amendment is proof of that statement. I am proud to support  this amendment, a commonsense measure to close a loophole that is  allowing illegal political spending by foreign nationals in United  States elections.   In the 2016 election, millions of Americans saw and engaged with  political advertisements paid for by foreign nationals. Last year,  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed in sworn testimony before  Congress that foreign nationals were purchasing campaign ads and issue  ads through American shell companies.   As elected officials, we took an oath to defend the Constitution of  the United States of America against both foreign and domestic  adversaries and threats. That includes the cornerstone of our  democracy, free and fair elections.                                time  1615    This amendment and the underlying bill seek to end a dangerous and  well-documented form of foreign election interference.   I thank Representatives Levin and McCaul for offering this important  amendment, and I look forward to continuing to work with them to  address this critical issue.
