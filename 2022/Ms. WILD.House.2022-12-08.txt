 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of, and to  wish a happy birthday to, Allentown's outgoing State Senator Pat  Browne.   Over the span of his 28 years in public service, Pat Browne  represented the Lehigh Valley in the Pennsylvania House of  Representatives and in the Senate, ascending to chair of the Senate  Appropriations Committee.   While we did not agree on every issue, Senator Browne's dedication to  Allentown's school district and the city's revitalization earned him  popularity with Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike,  something that is altogether too rare in today's political environment.  It has been an honor to work with his office over the past 4 years to  bring resources to our community, and I thank him for his service and  wish him a very happy birthday.                            ____________________
