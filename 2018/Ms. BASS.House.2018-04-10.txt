 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 128,  Supporting Respect for Human Rights and Encouraging Inclusive  Governance in Ethiopia, and I want to thank our committee chair, Mr.  Smith, for his many years of effort in this direction.                                time  1730    The resolution calls on the government of Ethiopia to take clear,  decisive steps towards becoming more inclusive, more democratic, and  more respectful of the basic human rights of its citizens.   Ethiopia is an important partner of the U.S. in many arenas,  including regional security, especially through its contributions to  international peacekeeping.   Over the past few years, Ethiopia has made significant strides in  addressing poverty and expanding economic development. The country has  also addressed significant challenges in global health and food  security. These are extremely important gains.   We are here today, however, because the country continues to have a  way to go, especially in the arenas of inclusive governance and respect  for human rights.   Since November 2015, there have been ongoing protests in Ethiopia's  largest region of Oromia. These protests expanded to the Amhara region  in August 2016. In response, security forces have used live ammunition  to disperse largely peaceful protests, killing hundreds and arresting  tens of thousands.   Activists, journalists, and others have also faced repeated arrests.   The Ethiopian Government has responded by imposing a state of  emergency that included curfews and restrictions on the assembly,  expression, and movement of its citizens. Meanwhile, earlier this year,  the government began releasing prisoners, including opposition leaders,  journalists, and protesters. The government also focused on an infamous  detention center. Of course, this is a step in the right direction.   We are also encouraged by the recent transfer of power. The new prime  minister, Dr. Abiy Ahmed, recently delivered a speech where he  highlighted that the government plans to address unity and national  reconciliation as well as good governance based on the rule of law. It  also seeks to crack down on corruption.   Again, this is encouraging and it could be an important turning point  for the country that could provide an opportunity to widen the  political space, but what remains concerning, however, is that Ethiopia  is still under a state of emergency, and just last month, the defense  minister announced the arrest of a number of individuals who they say  were linked to protests.   We encourage the Government of Ethiopia to keep the positive momentum  going by lifting the state of emergency, ensuring freedom of expression  and assembly, and opening up democratic space.   The current challenges facing Ethiopia are best addressed through  inclusive discourse and political processes rather than through the  imposition of restrictions.   Mr. Speaker, I therefore encourage Members to vote in favor of this  resolution that supports respect for human rights and encourages  inclusive governance in Ethiopia.
