 Madam Speaker, and still I rise, because I love  my country.   I rise today, Madam Speaker, to thank the Speaker of the House for  standing up for this country, advancing the cause of justice, and  taking on the challenge to protect our Nation, when it is obvious that  national security is of great concern.   I rise because there were persons who made yesterday possible. There  are some who say that yesterday was a tipping point, others say that  things happened that were the equivalent of a straw that broke the  camel's back as it relates to impeachment, but I say that yesterday was  a seminal moment in time that has the potential to impact the rest of  our time.   I say that yesterday was a moment of truth, and I say that there were  people who made yesterday possible.   I would like to read a statement into the Record that will address  many of the people, not all, but many of the people who made yesterday  possible.   My statement reads: ``On behalf of people of goodwill, I thank the  first 58 who voted to move Articles of Impeachment on November 6, 2017,  the historic 66 who voted to move Articles of Impeachment on January  19, 2018, and the noble 95 who voted to move Articles of Impeachment on  July 17, 2019.   For their tireless and progressive efforts, I would also like to  thank By the People; Center for Popular Democracy; Citizens Impeachment  Coalition; Common Cause; Courage Campaign; CREDO; CREW; D.C. Action  Lab; Democracy for America; Free Speech for People; Indivisible;  Lawyers for Good Government; Mainers For Accountable Leadership; March  for Truth; March for Truth--Boston; MoveOn; National Association for  the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP; Need to Impeach; NextGen  America; Our Revolution; Popular Democracy; Progressive Democrats of  America; Revolving Door Project; Social Security Works; Stand Up  America; and Women's March.   With nearly 200 Members of the House of Representatives favoring  impeachment inquiry, we have been vindicated. However, our approach is  not one that has ended as of yesterday. We need 218 to vote for  impeachment. There is more to be done.                            ____________________
