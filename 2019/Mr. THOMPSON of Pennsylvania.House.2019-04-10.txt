 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, during  National Volunteer Week, to acknowledge the many Americans who  generously give their time and talents to help improve the lives of  others.   Since the founding of the United States, Americans have always been  committed to serving others and working for the common good. During  National Volunteer Week, we celebrate that spirit and generosity that  inspires Americans to make our communities safer, healthier, and  stronger.   Mr. Speaker, right here in the House, I am proud to be working with  Congressman  Jim Panetta creating a caucus to empower and promote the  goals of national service organizations. Soon, we will launch the  National Service Organization Caucus, which will support the many  organizations that are dedicated to giving back to their communities. I  encourage my colleagues to join this important caucus.   The gift of time is priceless. Every day Americans are helping  students, caring for seniors, working to support our veterans, aiding  those impacted by natural disasters, and so much more. There is always  an opportunity to volunteer, and I am grateful that so many Americans  make it a part of their daily lives.                            ____________________
