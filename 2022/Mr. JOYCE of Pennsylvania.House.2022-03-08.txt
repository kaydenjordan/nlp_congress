 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, we are here tonight to call  attention to the energy crisis that is being felt both at home and  abroad.   This crisis has sent prices skyrocketing and has caused deep  uncertainty that leaves our businesses vulnerable and American families  less secure.   Let's be very blunt. This energy crisis is a crisis that exists for  two reasons. The first reason is the recent rise in gas prices that has  been caused by Vladimir Putin's unlawful war against the people of  Ukraine. The second reason is President Biden's long-term refusal to  support American energy producers by canceling the Keystone XL pipeline  and by stopping new drilling here at home.   By threatening new and burdensome taxes on energy producers, the  Biden administration has deliberately raised energy prices on all  American families, all for the sake of appeasing radical  environmentalists.   As we stand here today, there are untapped energy reserves under the  feet of my constituents, and these can be used to address the crisis  that we are talking about tonight. It is time to unleash that energy,  and it is time to unleash American energy dominance.   Americans can't afford what is happening right now. Gas prices are up  over 11 percent in just the last month, forcing families to make hard  choices about what they can afford.   Over the course of this Special Order, you will hear from many of my  colleagues about the state of our energy industry. You will hear real  solutions that can help lower costs while at the same time reinforcing  our necessary national security.   This is a time to talk about these real solutions. Right now, we have  an incredible number of opportunities to help lower energy costs while  driving innovation at the same time. Through American ingenuity, we can  create millions of new family-sustaining jobs in our energy industry.   It won't be easy. It will take Congress and the administration  working alongside our energy industry to reform cumbersome regulations  that limit our energy production. Now is the time to give our producers  the tools that they need to develop new technologies to modernize the  electric grid and our oil and natural gas infrastructure and unlock new  and exciting opportunities.   I thank so many of my colleagues for joining me here tonight for this  important Special Order, and I yield to my colleague from Iowa (Mrs.  Miller-Meeks).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Hern).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his comments, and I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Balderson).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman).   MR. BERGMAN: Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   A lot of us were here on the House floor just a few months ago  highlighting the problems with the Biden administration's energy  policies. We were here. We are back again.   Being here again, we are saying the same things, only maybe a little  farther down the road facing another self-inflicted completely  avoidable crisis.   From day one, President Biden has put America last when it comes to  our energy needs. And Americans are paying for it, quite literally.   While gas prices are up all over the country, in my district we are  seeing some of the highest prices in the entire State of Michigan.   And let's be clear, the administration's approach to energy has been  a problem long before Russia invaded Ukraine. Gas prices have been  going up for months in response to heavy inflation brought about from  out-of-control spending.   House Republicans have been sounding the alarm on the national  security implications of our energy dependence and the problem with  relying on nations like Russia for our energy needs.   But those legitimate concerns have largely been ignored. And now we  are seeing the consequences of this administration's policies.   So where is America supposed to turn for oil and gas? Instead of  promoting our domestic energy industry and working to make us more  independent, the administration is looking to nations like Iran and  Venezuela.   How can President Biden think it is a good idea to go from one bad  actor to another in search of a solution to this self-induced energy  crisis?   The only way to solve our energy crisis while ensuring our national  security is to break the chains this administration has put on our  energy producers. It is way past time. Let's break those chains now.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time.                                time  2015     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his insight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Burchett), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman and  appreciate his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), my  colleague and friend from the Doctor's Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg),  my colleague and friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Michigan.   Madam Speaker, one issue that needs to be addressed tonight is how  the rising cost of gas disproportionately affects rural Americans who  drive longer miles to get to work, to get to the grocery store, even to  get to their kids' schools.   Today, the average cost for a gallon of gas in Pennsylvania is $4.23  a gallon. And now it is estimated that the average family will pay an  extra $1,300 for gas this year alone. It is unaffordable. And it is  time to unleash American oil drilling to help bring the prices down and  once again establish American energy dominance.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves),  my friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), my  colleague and friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Kansas.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Meuser), the energy-rich Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for his remarks.   Madam Speaker, right now, our thoughts and prayers are with the  people of Ukraine and their fight against Putin's unlawful war.  Refusing to buy Russian oil will go a long way towards showing Putin  and his corrupt Russian oligarchs that they will pay a steep price for  this war.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of Minnesota  (Mr. Stauber), my colleague and friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his excellent remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud), my  colleague and friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice),  my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  from Oklahoma.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jacobs),  my colleague and friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  New York. One thing is abundantly clear from the speakers tonight,  there is a growing need to utilize American innovation. Americans and  our know-how have always stepped up and bend the individuals who can  get us through crises.   Yet, we are not utilizing the resources that are under the feet of  Americans. American ingenuity is the answer. American businesses have  already cut our energy emissions by  [[Page H1364]]  more than any other country over the past 20 years. We were able to do  this because of new and innovative technologies that our American  businesses produced.   The answer is clear: we need to bring more American technologies to  market as soon as possible. That message has been reiterated by my  colleagues throughout tonight's Special Order.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa), my colleague and friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his excellent remarks. I would like to thank all the Members who have  been here tonight. When I proposed holding this Special Order, we  received an overwhelming response. Perhaps that is exemplified by the  number of Members who stayed late into the evening to discuss the  energy crisis that right now is affecting every American.   This truly shows the commitment that congressional Republicans have  to working to revitalize American energy dominance. It is a testament  to how important this issue is. We truly have been able to discuss the  issues that have dreadful effects on so many American families right  now, this evening. This energy crisis that President Biden created is  impactful tonight, tomorrow, and until we use American innovation to  respond correctly.   Madam Speaker, what we have shown here tonight is a road map back to  American energy dominance.   It is a plan to increase innovation. It is a plan to rebuild our  energy grid. It is a plan to cut harmful regulations and a plan to  ensure that the American people have safe, reliable, and affordable  energy.   So, once again, Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their  remarks, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
