 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  tragic passing of Devin Willock and Chandler LeCroy of the University  of Georgia. Following the Georgia football national championship  parade, Devin and Chandler were in a tragic accident that claimed their  lives.   Devin played offensive line for the Bulldogs and was a key part of  their national championship run this past season. Devin will be  remembered by all as a kind soul that loved his family, the game of  football, and his teammates.   Chandler graduated from the University of Georgia in 2020 with a  master's degree and then went on to work as a recruiting analyst for  the Bulldogs. Members of the Georgia football staff spoke about her  passion for Georgia athletics and how she always went above and beyond  in her work. Her warm spirit and love for her beloved Bulldogs will be  remembered by all.   I know that I speak for the entire First District, for the State of  Georgia, and for the Bulldog Nation when I say that we will miss Devin  and Chandler, but I know that their legacy will live on.                       Recognizing Hinesville, Georgia     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Hinesville, Georgia, for being a great place to live, work, and raise a  family.   Recently, Hinesville was erroneously named as one of the most  miserable places to live in all of the State of Georgia. Nothing could  be further from the truth. In fact, Hinesville is not only one of the  best cities in the First District of Georgia, but it is arguably one of  the best cities in all of the State.   Hinesville is one of the fastest growing cities in all of southeast  Georgia. It is home to Fort Stewart and the 3rd Infantry Division, the  largest Army installation east of the Mississippi River.   Across the city, Spanish moss gracefully drapes from the magnificent  oak trees. There is a farmers market every Thursday and countless  festivals throughout the year.   Hinesville is a wonderful community, full of southern hospitality and  a relaxed way of life. The only thing miserable about this city are the  attitudes of people who won't give it a fair shake. I am proud of  Hinesville. It is a great city.                         Honoring Coach Paul Johnson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  legendary college football coach Paul Johnson for his induction into  the College Football Hall of Fame.   Utilizing his patented spread offense, Johnson compiled a career  record of 189-99 in 22 seasons. In 11 seasons at Georgia Tech, he had a  record of 82-60. His 82 wins are fourth-most in Tech history.   Johnson is responsible for two 10-win seasons and one 11-win season  at Tech. He led the Jackets to nine bowl appearances and three Atlantic  Coast Conference Championship games. Johnson received ACC Coach of the  Year honors three times in his career and National Coach of the Year  honors twice.   When he stepped down at Tech at the end of the 2018 season, his 189  career victories ranked fourth among NCAA Division I FBS head coaches.   While I may be a Georgia Bulldog, I want to congratulate Coach  Johnson for his legendary career and his induction into the College  Football Hall of Fame.                           Recognizing Olympia Cafe     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Olympia  Cafe located in Savannah, Georgia.   The Olympia Cafe has been ranked in the top 10 percent of restaurants  worldwide by a popular online travel company. Owner Nick Pappas started  the restaurant in Savannah over 30 years ago. Before opening in the  city, he had been told numerous times that Savannah was not the best  place to open a cafe. However, those people were wrong. Pappas has  found the perfect location.   Olympia Cafe regularly hosts famous movie celebrities and worldwide  travelers. He is proud of the restaurant's award because it relies on  customer reviews, which reflects the cafe's hard work.   I would like to congratulate Pappas and everyone at the Olympia Cafe  for winning this wonderful award.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor the life of Marcy Goodyear.   Marcy was born in 1971 in East Point, Georgia. She moved to Albany in  1974, where she attended Westover High School.   In 2009, after living in Albany for many years, Marcy found her way  to Darien, Georgia, located in the First Congressional District of  Georgia.   Marcy loved traveling and spending time with friends and family. She  enjoyed working at Skippers' Fish Camp with her family as well as her  time as a city councilwoman with the city of Darien.   Marcy's smile was infectious, and she never met a stranger. She will  be dearly missed by all of those who knew her.   On behalf of myself and everyone in the First Congressional District,  our thoughts and prayers are with Marcy's family and friends.                            ____________________
