 Madam Speaker, on January 6, Donald Trump  incited his white nationalist supporters to initiate an attempted coup  against the heart of our democracy, the United States Capitol. This  heinous act of domestic terrorism demands that Congress act to remove  this President.   Donald Trump has been, and remains, a threat to our national security  and our democracy, and he is wholly unfit to serve as President. He and  his supporters must be held accountable for inciting violence against  the Government of the United States. Congress must act immediately to  remove this clear and present danger from our country.
