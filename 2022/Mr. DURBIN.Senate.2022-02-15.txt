 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to take a moment to say a special  word of thanks to a former member of my staff who has meant a lot to me  and has performed great service in my office.   Corey Tellez was part manager and part legislative magician. She was  also my deputy chief of staff. She was one of the first persons I would  reach out to. She seemed to always find a way to translate big ideas  into legislation and then legislation into law.   Corey is driven by solid values. She has a special talent for  management and organization. Every Senator  [[Page S682]]  should be so lucky to have a Corey Tellez on their staff.   Corey joined my staff nearly 11 years ago as my economic policy  adviser. Her first assignment was to help craft and build support for a  bill called the Marketplace Fairness Act. Here was the goal: give Main  Street businesses across America, mom-and-pop shops, a level playing  field on which to compete against the giant online retailers by giving  States the option to require out-of-State businesses to collect sales  tax on online sales, the same way local businesses do.   The big online retailers resisted. Corey would not back down. She  worked with the staff in the offices of our main cosponsors--Senators  Mike Enzi, Heidi Heitkamp, and Lamar Alexander--and together they came  up with a solution that won support on both sides of the aisle and even  won the support of some of the giant retailers.   In 2013, the Marketplace Fairness Act passed the Senate. Corey was  still working on getting the bill signed into law when, to our  surprise, in 2018, the Supreme Court issued a ruling negating the need  for it by giving the States the same option our bill created.   Corey had made her mark, and she became a critical part of our  legislative team. Six years ago, I moved her up to be my legislative  director. Three years ago, she became my deputy chief of staff.   At the end of last year, to my disappointment, she announced she was  moving on from the Senate for a new opportunity, working for the  Department of the Treasury in their congressional relations office. She  is returning to the field she loves, with a special emphasis on  international economic policy. I have no doubt she is going to be  successful just as she was in the Senate.   Corey first came to the Hill 15 years ago, working in the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus as an intern to the office of  Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas. She already had a degree in  political science and history and a law degree from the University of  Illinois.   She worked on the House side as a legislative assistant for  Representative Carolyn McCarthy of New York and as deputy chief of  staff and counsel for Representative Debbie Halvorson of Illinois.   It is an impressive resume, but I think that Corey has put as much  effort and passion into advancing the careers of others as she has her  own. My own staff is filled with talented men and women whom she  encouraged and gave a chance to grow professionally.   There is a danger, when you work with policy and dry legislative text  for a long time, that you might forget the people whose hopes and  dreams ride on the laws we enact. That never was a problem for Corey.  While growing up, Corey's mom was a single mother.   She views every bill and every initiative through the eyes of a  proud, hard-working American, just like her mom. Basically, she has two  basic questions when it comes to these issues: Are they true to the  Constitution? Do they treat working families with fairness and dignity?  That was her litmus test for any legislative undertaking. I can't think  of a better one.   Since joining my staff, she became a mother too. She and her husband  are parents to a little daughter, Elliott.   With her move to her next exciting assignment, I want to say again:  Thank you, Corey, for all that you have given our office, the Senate,  and our State of Illinois. I am wishing you the very best of luck in  your new position.    I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3654         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
