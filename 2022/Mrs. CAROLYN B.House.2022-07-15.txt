 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, 1973 Roe is  decided. From that day forward, Republicans have been desperate to  overturn it. Twenty-one days ago, a rightwing majority on the Supreme  Court overturned Roe v. Wade.   Make no mistake, these rightwing extremists are not pro-life, but  pro-controlling the bodies of women, girls, and anyone who can become  pregnant.   Abortion is now illegal in 16 States, and anti-abortion legislators  are following suit, threatening to make abortion inaccessible for  roughly 33 million women across America. And they are not done.  Republicans have been clear they will not stop until abortion is banned  nationwide.   Later today, the House will pass an updated version of the Women's  Health Protection Act, which would establish a Federal statutory right  to abortion. The Senate must follow suit and abolish the filibuster,  and we must secure pro-choice majorities in the House and Senate. Our  lives depend upon it.                            ____________________
