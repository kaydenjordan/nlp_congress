 Mr. Speaker, I have visited our southern  border three times since I have been in office, and the crisis is only  getting worse.   Not only have we seen the most illegal crossings on record over the  past year, but also fentanyl overdoses are the leading cause of death  for Americans ages 18 to 45, and the top source of fentanyl is the  U.S.-Mexico border.   The Biden administration's decision to end title 42 without a plan  will only worsen this crisis.   It is past time to stop playing politics with border security.  Federal law requires the Department of Homeland Security to create and  implement a strategy to secure our northern border, but we currently  don't have one that addresses the southern border crisis.   I introduced the Comprehensive Southern Border Strategy Act to change  that and direct the Department of Homeland Security to create a  strategy to secure our U.S.-Mexico border.   Our economic prosperity, national security, and public safety  requires secure borders.                            ____________________
