 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the incredible  achievements of the American Rescue Plan, which will put shots in arms,  money in pockets, children in schools, and people in jobs.   President Biden's American Rescue Plan will power our efforts to  defeat this virus and move America forward. Significantly, experts  agree that the American Rescue Plan will cut child poverty in half by  expanding the child tax credit and sending $300 per month per child to  struggling families on top of the $1,400 check that the American Rescue  Plan will put in the pockets of every American.   The American Rescue Plan will give schools the resources they need to  safely reopen and stay open. It will enable our businesses to hang on  and safely cater to their customers while retaining their employees and  planning for a better future.   Job one for this new Congress and the new administration was always  to beat back the virus and lift up our Nation. The American Rescue Plan  takes direct aim at COVID-19 and charts the course to bring America  back to normal.                            ____________________
