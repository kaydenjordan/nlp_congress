 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent for all Members to  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, tonight lying in state in the rotunda of  this Capitol Building is Robert Joseph Dole. Bob Dole was an American  statesman, a former Member of this House of Representatives, a former  U.S. Senator, a World War II veteran, a tireless fighter for what is  right, and, last but not least, a Kansan.   Tonight, we want to reflect on and honor the actions and  accomplishments of this great American hero. Today, I am here with my  colleagues from the Sunflower State and other Members of the House of  Representatives to honor Robert Joseph Dole, one of the finest  Americans to ever serve in this institution.   Bob Dole has a record of devotion and service to this country--a  World War II hero, the majority leader of the Senate, and a Republican  nominee for President. But to truly understand the man Bob was, Madam  Speaker, you have to know a bit about where he was from because out of  all the things Bob did and accomplished through his long life, I know  that Bob always epitomized what it meant to be a son of Kansas.   Our State is situated in the very heart of our great Nation, more  than 1,000 miles west of Washington. It is imbibed with a strong sense  of freedom and with great compassion for our fellow man. The vivid  sunsets of amber waves of grain are a constant reminder of the beauty  and grace that only come from a loving God. And our climate, which can  include some of the harshest winters or cloudless summers, produces  hardy people who are resolute, undeterred, and quick to adapt to any  challenges they may face.   It is from Kansas where Bob Dole first entered the world in the  summer of 1923.   A natural athlete, he was recruited by famed basketball coach Phog  Allen and was a Jayhawk basketball player and football player, and he  ran track at the University of Kansas. But the grave threats against  our freedom and our Nation called Bob away from his studies at KU and  placed him in battle overseas during World War II.   His enlistment in the United States Army would take him far from the  flat plains of Kansas to another continent, and he returned to the  shores of America with two Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star, and scars of  war.   Permanent damage would restrict him to a hospital for more than a  year and limit the mobility in his right arm for the rest of his life.  Bob Dole's service to our country during World War II is more than most  of us will ever give back to the country in our entire lifetime.   But Bob wasn't done yet. After returning to school, this time at  Washburn University in Topeka, he served in the Kansas House of  Representatives and then as Russell County attorney.   In 1961, Bob Dole brought his grit, optimism, and wit to the Chamber  we are standing in today, having been elected by Kansans of the Sixth  District, and then again by the First District after redistricting. He  represented Kansas in the people's House for 8 years before the entire  Sunflower State sent him across the Capitol to the Senate. His passion  for the United States, ability to bring colleagues together, and sense  of humor elevated him to lead the Republican Party.   But Dole would also seek to serve the American people from 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue. He was the running mate to President Gerald Ford  and eventually earned the respect of voters across the country to be  the Republican nominee for President. It was at that time that he left  the Senate, noting that the next chapter of his life would either be in  the White House or a return to his beloved home State of Kansas. As  votes were tallied on November 5, 1996, it became clear that Russell,  Kansas, would welcome their son home.   But I can tell you with certainty, Madam Speaker, that his commitment  to the United States did not end with electoral defeat, as he continued  to stay active in the causes he fought for as a public servant and  remained a critical activist in Kansas politics.   Madam Speaker, most of the Representatives in this Chamber are  familiar with Bob Dole as a war hero, a statesman, and a Presidential  nominee. But I had the privilege of traveling throughout Kansas with  him. While the country has gotten to know Bob on the Senate floor or  the campaign trail, I saw Bob in small towns and coffee shops with  small business owners and farmers.   My wife, Susan, and I were blessed to have known Bob and his wife,  Elizabeth--another dedicated public servant--and to witness his genuine  warmth and devotion firsthand.   In his farewell address to the Senate on June 11, 1996, Senator Dole  quoted the opening verse to Ecclesiastes chapter 3, saying: ``To  everything there is a season.'' He went on to say that his season in  the Senate was about to end. Today, we recognize that another season  for Bob Dole has come to a close.   The Scripture that Bob started to read from continues, saying, ``a  time to be born and a time to die.'' And later, it says, ``a time to  weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance.''   This week is a time for mourning. We grieve the loss of our friend,  and we pray for his beloved wife, Elizabeth, and daughter, Robin.  [[Page H7624]]    This is also a time to honor, which is why my colleagues and I were  humbled to introduce the resolution that formally allowed for Bob Dole  to lie in state at the United States Capitol rotunda. During his nearly  four decades of service in the House and Senate, I know Bob Dole walked  through the rotunda with Kansans and colleagues, working to protect our  liberties and make our country better for all Americans.    It is fitting that he be honored in that space today. I can think of  no other person right now who deserves to lie in state more than my  friend and fellow Kansan, Senator Bob Dole, and I believe it will be a  long time before we see someone of his stature again.   In the meantime, it is up to the rest of us to carry on his legacy,  advance freedom, and maybe even provide some humor to our Nation and  our world.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann), who  is my friend, colleague, and the current Representative of Senator  Dole's hometown of Russell, Kansas.    Madam Speaker, it is great and commendable that the  current Representative for his hometown is here to be able to speak as  a fellow Kansan and representative for Bob.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner).  The gentleman is one of my other fellow colleagues from the State of  Kansas who represents the Second Congressional District and was a  former State treasurer as I was before I came to Congress.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman LaTurner,  for being here to be able to talk about our fellow Kansan and such a  great American hero.   At this time, Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman saying those  kind words about a son of Kansas and a fellow American hero that we  appreciate so much.   We have spent a lot of time tonight talking about all of the great  things about Bob Dole and his relationship with Kansas, but he had a  bigger impact on people across the country, including his relationship  with his wife, Elizabeth, and all the relationships there.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Rouzer), a former policy adviser for Senator Elizabeth Dole.    Madam Speaker, it is great to be able to have broader  reflections of Bob Dole and all of the things and the people that he  has touched. He served, obviously, a long time in the Senate, including  as majority and minority leader, and with his wife, Elizabeth as well.   Madam Speaker, I actually have a couple of quotes from our current  Senators from Kansas, and I wanted to just mention those as part of  this Special Order hour tonight.   The senior Senator from Kansas, Jerry Moran, said: Whether it was on  the battlefields, in the Halls of Congress, or in his everyday life,  Senator Dole's passion and dedication to his fellow Kansans and to his  country was a steady reminder that a single person can make a  difference and change the world.   He held an unmatched patriotism born out of wartime sacrifice that  marked every day of his existence. Yet rather than ask for help, he  offered it. Senator Dole used his horrific wartime experience to be a  champion every day for those with disabilities and for veterans, and I  thank him for his service to Kansas and to this country.                                time  1745    Senator Roger Marshall shared: ``As one the heroes from our Greatest  Generation, you would be hard-pressed to find somebody with a bigger  heart and more resilience than Senator Dole. He was an American hero, a  statesman of the highest order, and one of the greatest legislators of  all time. While he had incredible negotiating skills and was tough as  nails, it was his huge heart and ability to work across the aisle that  constantly led the way and delivered results for all Americans.''   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Meijer), a U.S. Army veteran and a friend of mine.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Meijer bringing that up.  As we talk about different stories about Bob Dole, his time in the  hospital, when he spent 39 months going through and recovering from his  injuries, obviously there are some in-depth stories of his time there  as well as others.  [[Page H7627]]    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter.)    Madam Speaker, as a fellow Kansan, Bob Dole was able to  reach out and have such an impact on so many people's lives across the  country and, in some cases, across the world.   I do want to make one comment about just one of the other people that  Bob Dole actually touched in his life. There are countless Kansans that  worked for Bob Dole and people from Kansas that were involved in the  work that he did in the House and the Senate during his time there. It  is amazing the number of people around D.C. or back in Kansas or  elsewhere in the country.   One particular staff member, David Spears, served for 3 years in  Senator Dole's D.C. office as an agriculture legislative assistant and  4 years as state director in Kansas. He wrote me saying: ``It was an  honor and privilege of a lifetime to serve on Senator Dole's staff and  to serve the constituents of Kansas. I learned many leadership lessons  from him that carried over into my additional years of public service  as well as my career in the private sector. Senator Dole provided great  examples of strong leadership that included listening to all sides and  an ability to build a consensus on very difficult and divisive issues.  He was a statesman and great American. He made a huge difference in my  life and will be missed.''   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Tenney, and I appreciate that  tribute to our great Senator from Kansas.   Bob Dole touched so many people's lives around the country and around  the world. I do want to just mention some of those folks that we have  some comments from. So I will refer to some of those.   Kansas is an agriculture State. Senator Dole served as the ranking  member on the Senate Agriculture Committee from 1975 to 1978. The  Kansas Association of Wheat Growers president, Justin Knopf, said, in  part: ``Wheat farmers across Kansas are pausing to reflect and honor  the life and legacy of Senator Bob Dole, a lifetime friend to Kansas  wheat growers. Wheat fields planted to the variety bearing his name  will carry extra significance this season as I and other farmers tend  to them along their journey in producing grain to feed and nourish  people. Senator Dole was an endless champion for farmers and also for  those who were food insecure, and saw the potential in connecting grain  from Kansas wheat fields to those here at home and around the world who  were in need.''   Another thing, as we talk about Senator Dole, obviously we talk a lot  about his involvement during World War II. As a World War II veteran,  Bob Dole spent a great deal of time working to thank and assist the men  and women who sacrificed for our country.   Paralyzed Veterans of America National President Charles Brown  released a statement saying, in part: ``PVA joins the Nation in  mourning the  [[Page H7628]]  passing of Senator Bob Dole and extends our heartfelt prayers to  Senator Elizabeth Dole and the entire Dole family. Prior to becoming  one of America's longest-serving U.S. Senators, Dole served in the U.S.  Army and later became a decorated World War II veteran and two-time  Purple Heart recipient. A champion of the Americans with Disabilities  Act, he devoted his entire life to advancing the cause of people with  disabilities as well as advocating for servicemen and women who  sacrificed their lives for this Nation. Following his tenure in  Congress, Dole worked tirelessly on seeking U.S. ratification of the  Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.''    The effects of war left Senator Dole with lasting challenges in his  life, something that strengthened his resolve to help Americans with  disabilities.   Maria Town, president and CEO of the American Association of People  with Disabilities, said in a statement: ``The world as we know it today  is more accessible and inclusive for people with disabilities because  of Senator Bob Dole. Senator Dole worked to elevate the voices and  perspective of people with disabilities, encouraging greater leadership  opportunities for disabled people, and sharing his experience of  disability with his colleagues to build bipartisan consensus for  disability policy issues. His passing represents an enormous loss for  AAPD, the disability community at large, and the Nation.''   Senator Dole, through all of his work and his life activities, has  earned the respect of countless leaders, including our former  Presidents from both sides of the aisle.   Former President Donald Trump released a statement saying: ``Bob Dole  was an American war hero and true patriot for our Nation. He served the  great State of Kansas with honor, and the Republican Party was made  stronger by his service. Our Nation mourns his passing, and our prayers  are with Elizabeth and his wonderful family.''   Former President Barack Obama said in part: ``His sharp wit was  matched only by his integrity, and he lived his life in a way that made  it clear just how proud he was to be an American and how committed he  was to making this country everything he knew it could be.''                                time  1800    Many of us recall the moving moment when former President George H.  W. Bush was lying in State and Senator Dole stood and saluted his  friend. It was a moment that reminded us of patriotism, camaraderie,  and devotion.   His son and former President George W. Bush said: ``Laura and I are  saddened by the passing of a great patriot, Senator Bob Dole. This good  man represented the finest of American values. He defended them in  uniform during World War II. He advanced them in the United States  Senate, and he lived them out as a father, husband, and friend. Our  entire family benefited from that friendship, including my father. I  will always remember Bob's salute to my late dad at the Capitol, and  now we Bushes salute Bob and give thanks for his life of principled  service. Laura and I send our heartfelt condolences to Elizabeth and  join our fellow citizens in prayer for her comfort.''   Former President Bill Clinton, his political rival, who would later  honor the late Senator with a Presidential Medal of Freedom said: ``Bob  Dole dedicated his entire life to serving the American people, from his  heroism in World War II to the 35 years he spent in Congress. After all  he gave in the war, he didn't have to give more. But he did. His  example should inspire people today and for generations to come.''   Tonight, I and a lot of the speakers here have talked a lot about the  life of Bob Dole, and we have talked about different things regarding  his life in Russell, Kansas, the small town that he was born in and  grew up in, and his early outlook as a football, basketball, and track  star before the war cut that plan short for him.   We talked a lot about his war service, talked a lot about how he was  injured in the line of duty trying to rescue somebody else and suffered  consequences of war, and the time it took for him to recover in the  field, the hospitalization.   His small town of Russell, Kansas, started a crowdfunding process to  help him with his recovery, and there was actually a cigar box where  friends and family members made donations to help with the 39 months  that it took for Bob to go through his hospitalizations and his  recovery.   We have talked tonight about his years of service in the House and  the Senate. We have talked some about his involvement with the World  War II Memorial and how he was a big driving force on making sure that  that memorial got implemented and was available for us as a country to  see and recognize the work that the Greatest Generation did in keeping  and providing the freedoms for us.   We have talked some about the Honor Flights and the effort that Bob  took. Even when the weather wasn't good, even when he may not have been  feeling well himself, he would come out and greet all these World War  II veterans and veterans from other wars who were coming to the  memorial that he had helped implement.   My father, before he passed away, was one of those veterans who was  able to come and attend an Honor Flight and participate in that  process. It meant so much to watch those veterans as they come through  that process. They are actually like little kids again when they get  off the bus and tour through the monuments. In some cases, they relive  some past life, but in other cases, they just reconnect with their  brothers in arms.   We have talked some about Kansas, and we talked about the friends and  family of Bob Dole. One of his favorite sayings was: ``Remember where  you are from.'' That is important for us, particularly as Kansans, to  remember where we are from and what we should do and what we should  stand up for and be responsible for.   I had the honor as State treasurer to participate in a lot of the  stops through the counties that Bob Dole participated in, and it was a  time for him to reconnect with old friends. It was amazing to see the  respect and admiration that came from his fellow Kansans as they sat  down and talked with their friend Bob.   The funny thing about that, or the inspiring thing maybe is a better  word for me to use, was just to watch his interaction with fellow  Kansans, people who he may not have seen for years or in some cases  decades, but he could talk about the same issues with them. He could  talk about their family members, be able to connect with the stories  that they had and be able to ask questions about: Now, do you still  have that big rock on the hill that was in the way when you were trying  to work through with the cropland?   It was an interesting life to be able to watch and watch him lead.   He has had an impact on not just Kansas but Americans and  internationally. The influence on people who he has been able to touch  throughout his life will never be known by all of us, but his  engagement, his ability to win friends, his ability to help lead and  solve problems will be forever admired.   There is maybe a small army, if you want to call it that, of people  who have worked with Senator Dole throughout his life and were engaged  with him either as an intern or a staffer in his office or connected  with one of his campaigns or connected with one of his causes that he  got engaged in. It is important that all of us recognize the value that  he has created for the world today.   Last but not least, let's not forget his humor and wit. I mean, we  talk about all the commentary, and several of the stories that were  told tonight talked about the way he approached life and the comments  that he made that were just reflective of what type of man he was.   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say, may God bless Bob Dole and  care for his wife, Elizabeth, and daughter, Robin. Kansans, Americans,  and people throughout the world will miss him, but we are better off  for having known him and for his years of service that he provided to  us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
