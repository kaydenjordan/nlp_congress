 Madam Speaker, Latin America's dictators exploit their  children just like they exploit their own people.   The best example is Nicaragua's dictator, Daniel Ortega. Ortega leads  his corrupt, oppressive, dictatorial regime along with his wife and  Vice President, Rosario Murillo. Their daughter, Camila Ortega, has  defalcated millions and millions of dollars from the Nicaraguan people  while her mother and father continue oppressing anyone who opposes  them.   Madam Speaker, 10 days ago, the United States Government blacklisted  Camila Ortega for corruption. She is officially sanctioned. Her bank  accounts are frozen. No one can do business with her at this hour. She  will no longer lavishly spend the people's money in the streets of  Miami, my district, where I represent thousands and thousands of the  Nicaraguan exile community who fled her father's regime and his  oppression.   Madam Speaker, from the floor of the United States Congress, from  this floor, we ask the European Union and Canada to join America in  holding Camila Ortega accountable.   Ortega wants to steal the elections by jailing anyone who opposes  him. But make no mistake, he and his family will pay for these  atrocities.                            ____________________
