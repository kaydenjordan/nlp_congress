 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2126 which  will rename our federal building in Cheyenne, Wyoming, to honor one of  our state's most distinguished heroines: Louisa Swain.   On September 6, 1870, Louisa Swain became the first woman to cast a  ballot in a general election in the United States. She cast her  historic vote just a few blocks from the federal building that will now  bear her name. Louisa's action that day represented the very best of  what Wyoming represents: independence, leadership, grit, integrity, and  equality.   In 1869, Wyoming became the first place in America where women had  the right to vote. Our state constitution included suffrage for women.  When we applied for statehood in 1890, Congress responded that we would  not be admitted to the union so long as we provided women with the  right to vote. In response, Wyoming's state legislators said, ``If we  can't come in with our women, we aren't coming in.''   Wyoming became a state in 1890, the first state in the union where  women could vote.   The track record of female leaders in Wyoming is long and extensive.  It runs through who we are as a state, whether that's Esther Hobart  Morris service as the first female justice of the peace in Sweetwater  County in 1870, Susan Johnson serving as a postmaster in Cheyenne in  1880, Mary Bellamy being elected to the Wyoming House of  Representatives in 1911, or my own grandmother, Edna Vincent, who was  the first female Deputy Sheriff in Natrona County.   It's appropriate that we acknowledge Wyoming's historic leadership  when it comes to advancing rights and opportunities for women. Renaming  our Cheyenne federal building after Louisa Swain will serve as an  important reminder and honor for all the trailblazing women who have  come before us, and will put Wyoming's proud history and heritage on  display as an example for the entire Nation.
