 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  welcoming Scott Keith to the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame in the  class of 2022. While Scott sadly passed away in 2020, I know he would  be pleased that so many people he worked with over the years have  honored him with this remarkable posthumous recognition.   Being inducted into the hall of fame is truly one of the highest  achievements anyone can meet. It means your peers and colleagues  believe you are among the best of the best, you have made the industry  better, and during your lifetime, you have set an example for those who  wish to follow in your footsteps.   Scott was introduced to the world of agriculture at an early age,  having been born in Buffalo and raised on a ranch near Kaycee. It did  not take long for him to learn to love and appreciate agriculture in  Wyoming and realize that, when he grew up, that is what he wanted to do  with his life. In order to help facilitate that dream, Scott enrolled  at Casper College and eventually the University of Wyoming, where he  earned a bachelor's degree in agriculture business.   Eventually, Scott and his new bride, Brenda, decided to move to  Casper to settle down and raise a family. While in Casper, not only did  Scott spend time fostering further relationships in the agriculture  industry through his work as a loan officer with the Production Credit  Association and First Interstate Bank in Casper, he also made sure to  leave his mark on the community through numerous volunteer projects in  Casper. Scott had served on the Casper Chamber of Commerce Ag  Committee, as well as on the Natrona County Conservation District. He  was also a very passionate supporter of the Kelly Walsh High School  football team and the Casper Swim Club, where he could be found behind  the grill at football games and on the pool deck during swim meets.  Needless to say, he loved his family and enjoyed supporting his local  community any way he could.   In 2002, Scott joined the Wyoming Business Council Agribusiness  Division as the forage and co-op development program specialist, which  eventually led to a promotion to be the livestock and forage program  manager. In that role, Scott was instrumental in promoting the Wyoming  hay and forage industry across the United States and abroad. Scott also  played a significant role in creating numerous associations related to  the promotion of Wyoming Agriculture through the Wyoming Hay and Forage  Association and the Future Cattle Producers of Wyoming. His work with  the Wyoming Hay and Forage Association led Wyoming hay producers to  victory at the World Forage Analysis Superbowl in Madison, WI--twice. I  know there are many members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame who have  no Super Bowl wins, but Scott was able to claim being a two-time winner  of the World Forage Analysis Superbowl.   Scott also took an interest in teaching and promoting agriculture to  youth in Wyoming. Being an expert in judging cattle, among other  talents, through the Future Cattle Producers of Wyoming program, Scott  would encourage high school students to learn how to raise cattle by  working with local producers and a donated heifer. This not only gave  high school students firsthand experience in learning how to raise  cattle, but it also played a vital role in making sure that Wyoming  continues to be a worldwide leader in quality beef.   After the passing of his wife Brenda, Scott met Tracy Smith in  Casper, and in 2016, he began working as a contractor for Big Iron  Auctions. He was quickly promoted to district manager and was able to  help those involved in Wyoming agriculture buy and sell their  equipment.   In addition to all of his work throughout his career, he still found  time to be a part of the Wyoming Wool Growers Association, the Wyoming  Stock Growers Association, and even was able to serve as the chairman  of Wyoming AgXpo. He truly was an amazing person and a role model to  all of us in Wyoming.   I wish that Scott had been able to receive this recognition in  person. He dedicated his life to the promotion of Wyoming agriculture,  and many are benefiting from his hard work. But, I am glad that his  legacy will continue to live on through his membership in the Wyoming  Agriculture Hall of Fame.                            ____________________
