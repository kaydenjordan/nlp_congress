 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislative  package to fund the government and to authorize CHIP, the longest such  authorization for CHIP ever.   Chairman Frelinghuysen secured passage of all 12 appropriations bills  before the beginning of the new fiscal year on October 1. It is the  Democrats in the Senate who have refused to permit these bills to come  to the floor. No good explanation has been given as to why that  occurred.   Chairman Walden brought through the Energy and Commerce Committee a  CHIP reauthorization package that passed this House in November. We  must continue to ensure governmental operations such as paying our  troops on time and making sure our homeland security apparatus is fully  operational.   The CHIP portion of this bill is a major accomplishment. Nine million  low-income children depend on CHIP, and the Congressional Budget Office  estimates that CHIP will actually save taxpayer funds in the long run.  Let's keep the government open, and let's fund CHIP.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote in favor of this  legislation.
