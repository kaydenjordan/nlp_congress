 Madam Speaker, while it might be raining lately in  California, we still need additional water supply infrastructure to  meet the needs of agriculture and a growing population. The Sites  Reservoir is the only project in California that will improve the water  supply for cities, farms, as well as for the environment.  [[Page H618]]    If the Sites Reservoir were in place today, California would have an  estimated additional 600,000 acre-feet of water stored so far this  winter in addition to similar amounts from last year and even water  that could have been impounded during the high flows during the drought  years. Had we had this infrastructure in place, we would have had  enough water to supply 4.8 million Californians for an entire year just  on this winter's flows, and the winter is not even over yet. The Sites  Reservoir will not only capture enough high winter flow, but it will  also allow for the reuse of water released from Lake Shasta so that  human and environmental water use are no longer mutually exclusive.   Madam Speaker, let's not lose this opportunity to conserve water and  to not be delayed again and again.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Smith), my colleague, for his continued leadership on this very  important topic, a moral one, I think, that reflects truly an important  part of the fiber of our country.   Which way are we going to go on this? What are our values going to  be?   The gentleman has been a consistent leader way before my time during  Congress as well.   As we reflect on this week, landmark legislation again passed  tonight, H.R. 7, that would prohibit funding for abortion in this  country, on the heels of the Mexico City solution that President Trump  just signed today as well.   We are seeing that hearts are turning in this country on this issue.  And when you look at it in the categories of people across the country,  about half and half, rough numbers. Half the country might label itself  pro-life, and the other half that favors Roe v. Wade being the law of  the land, that might label themselves as pro-choice or pro-abortion.   When we get down to H.R. 7, we find that the half that is pro-life  can be joined by many additional people on the other side of that  argument that don't think it is appropriate to have government funding,  their taxpayer dollars, used for abortion as a birth control tool in a  lot of cases.   So this shows that we do have the tide going in this direction on  that, as people become more and more informed on this and understand  and don't listen to the rhetoric and don't listen to misinformation on  what this really is. This is a baby you are talking about. It doesn't  form into something else. Each pregnancy will result in a human baby.   So when we fight this battle, we find it is those that would speak on  this side of the issue come under a lot of persecution. Many, many  people will be joining together in this town later this week in the  March for Life. You will be persecuted to some extent or another. You  will be called things. But, you know, we know from the Bible that those  that speak the truth are often persecuted as well, and we all need to  be strong and firm in that.   God is watching what we do here. God will be watching later this week  and at all times on those that are marching for life. So be strong.   Also, put your arms around those folks that might be strongly  opposed, because there are a lot of people hurting on that. We  understand. People that have had to make a difficult abortion choice  and chosen to do so, they need healing as well. They need understanding  and compassion on that. If we can show them that, and if we can show  that those that are contemplating abortion, there are alternatives out  there. There are many alternatives. If we can just come alongside them  and show them that there is more than one way to do this, and there are  people willing to help and willing to counsel you in that, because that  is really what it comes down to.   When you talk about a choice, show that woman in crisis, in that  situation that she has many choices, informed choices to make; and, by  and large, maybe she will make the right one. In a lot of cases I  believe she will.   So God bless those that are going to come for this march later this  week and stand for this, put up with the level of persecution that  comes with any of these types of issues, including the one on being  pro-life.   Again, God bless you, Mr. Smith of New Jersey, for being a consistent  leader on this.
