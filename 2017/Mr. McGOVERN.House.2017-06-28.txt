 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  closed rule, and in strong opposition to the underlying bill, H.R.  3003.   Mr. Speaker, today the House will consider its 37th closed rule for  the year, and tomorrow it will take up number 38. My Republican friends  are breaking all kinds of records here.   While I often wonder just why the Republican leadership is so afraid  of open debate in the United States House of Representatives, I do  recognize that it goes right along with the Republican majority's  complete rejection of regular order.   The House of Representatives, I am sad to say, has ceased being a  deliberative body where important issues are debated freely. The  Republican leadership has shut this place down, and this is yet another  example of it.   Look up the history of the bill the House will debate later today or  tomorrow, H.R. 3003, the so-called No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. It  was introduced on June 22. That was last Thursday. Like its 2015  predecessor, it has had no hearings, no markup, no input from local law  enforcement, no regular order.   No one had a chance to testify about this bill. Not the U.S.  Conference of Mayors that includes the mayors of over 1,000 cities and  towns, Democrat and Republican alike, who represent over 150 million  people.   Not the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic Charities,  Church World Service, and religious and faith leaders from all across  the land.   Not the National Fraternal Order of Police, the Law Enforcement  Immigration Task Force, or the National Task Force to End Sexual and  Domestic Violence.   Not the NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the YWCA, or hundreds  of national civil rights, human rights, labor, immigration, and  humanitarian organizations.   Mr. Speaker, on a bill that would affect hundreds of cities and towns  and counties across America, why wouldn't we want to hear the views of  these important law enforcement, State and local government, religious,  civil society, and victims' organizations?   The answer is simple, Mr. Speaker. Because they all oppose this  legislation. All of them.    It is much easier for Republicans to close down the process and  steamroll this terrible bill through Congress than to actually get  feedback from the American people and the leaders charged with keeping  them safe.   If you are going to pass a bill that has so much public opposition, I  guess it makes sense to do it quickly and with as little debate as  possible.   Welcome to the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, where the  voices of the American people are shut out as Republicans continue to  ram through their radical agenda.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3003 does nothing to advance cooperation between  local law enforcement with the Federal Immigration and Customs  Enforcement.  [[Page H5246]]  Cooperation between local and Federal agencies to apprehend, try, and  punish serious criminal offenders, and in the case of foreign  nationals, to imprison and then deport them, has always been a high  priority. These are matters of national security.   But instead of continuing to foster cooperation and strengthen this  priority, this bill chooses to blackmail, coerce, and penalize local  law enforcement agencies and demand that they potentially violate the  Constitution of the United States, in particular the Fourth Amendment,  the 10th Amendment, and the 14th amendment.   I wish my Republican friends were as faithful to the rights enshrined  in these amendments of the Bill of Rights as they are to the Second  Amendment, but then that is a whole other debate.   And let's think about this for a minute. What are they proposing to  do?   For communities and local law enforcement that believe that doing  what this bill asks them to do would make it more difficult for them to  do local policing, and would make it more difficult for them to have  the trust of members in their community to report crimes. What my  Republican friends propose to do is take away important Federal funding  to help keep these communities safe.   What are we talking about here?   I think it is important for people to understand this. Programs like  the COPS programs, the Community Oriented Policing Services; the State  Criminal Alien Assistance Program; the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant  program; and national security programs, those things would be taken  away from local communities. It doesn't make any sense.   For example, the Bynre JAG is a major source of criminal justice  funding for local law enforcement and provided $275 million in fiscal  year 2016 for prevention and education programs, drug treatment and  enforcement, crime victim and witness initiatives, and other community- based programs.   Other funding programs and grants that are threatened under this bill  are used to address sexual assault, gang violence, and trafficking such  as the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, the Violent Gang and Gun Crime  Reduction Program, and the Reach and Evaluation on Trafficking in  Persons program.   Maybe nobody read what this bill does before they brought it to the  floor. I just don't understand the logic of basically trying to  blackmail communities by taking away important funding that is designed  to protect the citizens of various communities across this country.   Mr. Speaker, this so-called sanctuary cities bill, as I mentioned,  threatens to strip local jurisdictions of Federal grants and funding.  It specifically targets law enforcement, counterterrorism, and national  security grants when they prioritize working with immigrant communities  to keep our neighbors and cities and towns safe.                                time  1245    I don't think Washington knows best all the time, unlike my  Republican colleagues. I trust my local police departments on this  issue more than I trust my friends on the other side of the aisle.  Republicans would rather demonize these cities, towns, and local police  agencies and force them to squander scarce local resources on  immigration enforcement instead of local policing, making our cities  and our communities less safe, not more safe.   This is why law enforcement and city governments oppose this bill. It  deliberately and cynically undermines their ability to protect their  communities, nurture public trust in the police and our legal system,  and strengthen public safety.   Mr. Speaker, this bill reeks of prejudice. It isn't meant to solve  any problem. It is meant to punish cities that don't embrace the  radical views of the anti-immigrant rightwing of the Republican Party.  It is meant to demonize all immigrants as criminals. It is meant to  turn our local police into the lackeys of ICE.   Mr. Speaker, this House continues to wait and wait and wait for the  Republican majority to show some leadership and bring up a  comprehensive immigration reform bill. It has been more than 4 years  since the Senate passed a strong, bipartisan immigration reform bill,  and we are still waiting for House Republicans to step up and act, to  actually try to solve a problem rather than continue to divide our  country and continue to act in a way that is polarizing.   What we need is a way to bring 11 million of our neighbors, friends,  colleagues, small-business owners, and hardworking residents out of the  shadows. That is what makes America stronger. That is why 9 out of 10  Americans support immigration reform that creates a path to citizenship  for the undocumented, according to a March 2017 poll by CNN/ORC.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article about the poll.                       [From cnn.com, Mar. 17, 2017]       CNN/ORC Poll: Americans Break With Trump on Immigration Policy                    (By Tal Kopan and Jennifer Agiesta)         Washington (CNN).--Americans disagree with President Donald       Trump's immigration priorities, according to a new CNN/ORC       poll, with nearly two-thirds of Americans saying they'd like       to see a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants       rather than deportations.        Trump has made tough border security and strict enforcement       of US immigration laws a focal point of his campaign and       presidency--using some of his first executive orders to pave       the way for far more deportations and detentions as well as       ordering the construction of a Southern border wall.        But a CNN/ORC poll released Friday finds that the public is       actually moving in the opposite direction since Trump has won       election.        Americans are more likely to say that the nation's top       immigration priority should be to allow those in the US       illegally to gain legal status--and six in 10 say they are       more concerned that deportation efforts will be overzealous       than they are that dangerous criminals will be overlooked.        All told, 60% say the government's top priority in dealing       with illegal immigration should be developing a plan to allow       those in the US illegally who have jobs to become legal       residents.        In contrast, 26% say developing a plan to stop illegal       border crossings should be the top priority and 13% say       deportation of those in the US illegally should be the first       priority.        The number who prioritize legal status for those working in       the US illegally is up from 51% who said so last fall. That       shift comes across party lines, with Democrats and       independents each 10 points more likely and Republicans 8       points more likely to choose a plan for legal status now       compared with last fall.        While Trump campaigned heavily against ``amnesty'' for       undocumented immigrants, he has avoided rescinding an Obama       administration program offering protections and work permits       to those who were brought to the US as children, and in a       recent meeting with reporters a senior administration       official indicated Trump could be open to a compromise that       included a path to legalization, if not citizenship, if it       came to his desk.        Trump told Congress in his joint address last month that he       supported the idea of an immigration reform compromise, but       offered few details.        Offering citizenship to those immigrants who are living in       the US illegally but hold a job, speak English and are       willing to pay back taxes is immensely popular, with 90%       behind such a plan. That's consistent across party lines,       with 96% of Democrats, 89% of independents and 87% of       Republicans behind it.        The President has described his immigration policies as       focused on removing criminals, though critics of his       administration say enforcement agencies' definition of       criminal is too expansive and sweeps up people who only broke       immigration laws.        He has also ordered the creation of offices and reports       focused on publicizing victims of crimes committed by       undocumented immigrants.        Americans say, however, they are more concerned about the       effects of deportations than they are about immigrant crimes.        Overall, 58% say they're more concerned that deportation       efforts will go too far and result in deportation of people       who haven't committed serious crimes, while 40% say they're       more concerned that those efforts will not go far enough and       dangerous criminals will remain in the US. That number is       largely driven by Democrats--more than two-thirds of       Republicans say they are concerned efforts won't go far       enough.        As for deportation priorities, seven in 10 say the       government should not attempt to deport all immigrants living       in the country illegally, up from 66% in the fall.        A wide majority, nearly eight in 10, support deporting       undocumented immigrants who have committed other crimes,       however, an area Trump says is his focus. There has been a       small uptick, nevertheless, in the share who say the       government shouldn't be deporting those living in the US       illegally who have been convicted of other crimes, from 15%       to 19%.        Opinions vary by party on both of these questions, though       majorities across party lines are on the same side of both       arguments. Among Republicans, 55% oppose attempts to deport       all people living in the US illegally, below the 86% of       Democrats and 71% of independents who feel that way.       Considering deportation of those in the country illegally  [[Page H5247]]       who have been convicted of other crimes, 64% of Democrats       favor that, below the 79% of independents and 93% of       Republicans who say the same.        CNN/ORC interviewed 1,025 American adults by phone from       March 1 to 4 for the poll, which has a margin of error of       plus or minus 3 percentage points. Results by party have a       margin of error of plus or minus 6 points.     Mr. Speaker, instead of working together to find  commonsense solutions to immigration, the Republican leadership offers  extreme, deportation-only bills that undermine public safety and hurt  our communities. Let them register; let them pay a fine; let them be  documented and not fear talking with the police; and let us recognize  their many contributions to communities across America.   These are our friends, our colleagues, and our neighbors. Our kids go  to school together. We shop at the same grocery stores and eat at the  same restaurants. We serve together on the PTA and worship together at  church. Our country is strongest when we lift up our neighbors. This  bill will only drive us apart.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is just more of the same old divisive  Republican anti-immigrant formula. It will sow fear among the immigrant  community, regardless of their status; it will tear families apart; it  will subvert public trust of local law enforcement and police; and it  will undermine the Constitution of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, America is better than this. I urge my colleagues to  reject this closed rule and to oppose the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is clear that the laws aren't working. That is why we need  comprehensive immigration reform, and that is why it is so unfortunate  that the Republicans in this House have stalled on that issue. We had  bipartisan support a few years ago for comprehensive immigration  reform, but people here, for some reason, would rather just demagogue  the issue than do something about it.   As I said before, I actually trust my local officials, my local  police, more than I do my Republican friends who are speaking here  today and who spoke in the Rules Committee last night.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to all of us from the  National Fraternal Order of Police, which is strongly opposed to this  bill; a letter to all of us from The United States Conference of  Mayors, which is strongly opposed to all of this; a letter to all of us  from the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, which is strongly  opposed to this bill; and a letter to all of us from Cities for Action,  which is strongly opposed to this bill.                                                            National                                       Fraternal Order of Police,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Representatives McCarthy, Pelosi and       Hoyer: I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal       Order of Police to reiterate the FOP's opposition to any       amendment or piece of legislation that would penalize law       enforcement agencies by withholding Federal funding or       resources from law enforcement assistance programs in an       effort to coerce a policy change at the local level. The       House will consider H.R. 3003 on the floor this week and       Section 2 of this bill would restrict the hiring program       administered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing       Services (COPS), the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance       Grant (Byrne-JAG) programs, as well as programs administered       by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.        The FOP has been very clear on this issue: we strongly       believe that local and State law enforcement agencies should       cooperate with their Federal counterparts. That being said,       withholding needed assistance to law enforcement agencies--      which have no policymaking role--also hurts public safety       efforts.        Local police departments answer to local civilian       government and it is the local government which enacts       statutes and ordinances in their communities. Law enforcement       officers have no more say in these matters than any other       citizen and--with laws like the Hatch Act in place--it can be       argued they have less. Law enforcement officers do not get to       pick and choose which laws to enforce, and must carry out       lawful orders at the direction of their commanders and the       civilian government that employs them. It is unjust to       penalize law enforcement and the citizens they serve because       Congress disagrees with their enforcement priorities with       respect to our nation's immigration laws.        The FOP issued a statement in January of this year       regarding the approach of the Administration on sanctuary       cities as outlined in President Trump's Executive Order. The       President recognized that it is unfair to penalize the law       enforcement agencies serving these jurisdictions for the       political decisions of local officials. It allows the U.S.       Attorney General and Secretary of the U.S. Department of       Homeland Security to make an informed decision about the       public safety impact without an automatic suspension from       Federal grant programs. In Section 2 of H.R. 3003, there is       no such discretion and it countermands the Administration's       existing policy.        The FOP opposed several bills in the previous Congress,       which were outlined in a letter to the Senate leadership, and       we will continue to work against proposals that would reduce       or withhold funding or resources from any Federal program for       local and State law enforcement. If Congress wishes to effect       policy changes in these sanctuary cities, it must find       another way to do so.        On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I want to urge the House to reject H.R.       3003's punitive approach and work with law enforcement to       find a better way to improve public safety in our       communities. Please feel free to contact me or my Senior       Advisor Jim Pasco in my Washington office if I can be of any       further assistance.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____                                                   The United States                                            Conference of Mayors,                                      Washington, DC, June 26, 2017.        Dear Representative: I write to register the strong       opposition of the nation's mayors to H.R. 3003, a partisan       bill that seeks to punish so-called ``sanctuary cities,''       which is expected to be considered by the full House this       week.        The U.S. Conference of Mayors represents well over a       thousand mayors and nearly 150 million people. Today, we       concluded the 85th Annual Meeting of The U.S. Conference of       Mayors and adopted policy that reinforces and builds on       previous positions we have taken which oppose provisions in       this bill. Specifically, the nation's mayors:        urge members of Congress to withdraw legislation that       attempts to cut local law enforcement funding necessary to       ensure the safety of our communities, indemnify conduct that       violates the constitutional rights afforded to both United       States citizens and immigrant populations, and further       criminalizes immigration and infringes on the rights of       immigrant;  [[Page H5248]]         oppose punitive policies that limit local control and       discretion, and urge instead that Congress and the       Administration pursue immigration enforcement policies that       recognize that local law enforcement has limited resources       and community trust is critical to local law enforcement and       the safety of our communities;        oppose federal policies that commandeer local law       enforcement or require local UN authorities to violate, or be       placed at risk of violating, a person's Fourth Amendment       rights; expend limited resources to act as immigration       agents; or otherwise assist federal immigration authorities       beyond what is determined by local policy.        HR 3003 would do all of these things and more:        It would jeopardize public safety by withholding critical       public safety funding from jurisdictions that tell their       police officers not to ask an individual their immigration       status. Many departments have such policies to encourage       crime victims and witnesses to report crimes and to build       trust with immigrant communities.        It would put jurisdictions at risk of violating an       individual's Fourth Amendment rights by establishing probable       cause standards for ICE's issuance of detainers that do not       require a judicial determination of probable cause. Numerous       federal courts have found that continued detention under an       ICE detainer, absent probable cause, would state a claim for       a violation of the Fourth Amendment and subject the detaining       officer or jurisdiction to civil liability.        While it says it would provide immunity to jurisdictions       which comply with detainers and hold them harmless in any       suits filed against them, they would still be subject to       Fourth Amendment challenges.        Further compelling and expanding compliance with certain       enforcement provisions, such as immigration detainers, and       cutting off federal funding to jurisdictions which do not       comply with these provisions likely conflict with the Tenth       Amendment.        H.R. 3003 is a bad bill for our cities and their residents       and for our nation. It would jeopardize public safety,       preempt local authority, and expose local governments to       litigation and potential findings of damages. America's       mayors call on you to do the right thing and vote against       H.R. 3003 when it is considered on the floor.        The U.S. Conference of Mayors urges you instead to focus on       positive legislation that will fix our broken immigration       system and make our cities safer. The nation's mayors pledge       to work with you on bipartisan immigration reform legislation       that will fix our nation's broken immigration system. We need       to move beyond punitive bills like H.R. 3003 and develop an       immigration system that works for our nation, our cities and       our people.        To make our cities safer we urge you to consider       legislation that will help us to fight crime and prevent       terrorism. The U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Major Cities       Chiefs Association agree that to make the streets of America       safe, Congress must act to strengthen bonds between       communities and police, expand homeland security grants,       invest in mental health and substance abuse services, reduce       gun violence, and reform the criminal justice system and       strengthen reentry services.            Sincerely,                                              Mitchell J. Landrieu,      Mayor of New Orleans, President.                                   ____                                                       Law Enforcement                                          Immigration Task Force,                                                      June 28, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: As law enforcement leaders       dedicated to preserving the safety and security of our       communities, we have concerns about legislative proposals       that would attempt to impose punitive, ``one-size-fits-all''       policies on state and local law enforcement. Rather than       strengthening state and local law enforcement by providing us       with the tools to work with the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) in a manner that is responsive to the needs of       our communities, these proposals would represent a step       backwards.        Attempts to defund so-called sanctuary cities regularly       sweep too broadly, punishing jurisdictions that engage in       well-established community policing practices or adhere to       federal court decisions that have found federal immigration       detainers to violate constitutional protections. We oppose       these approaches and urge Congress to work to encourage--      rather than compel--law enforcement agency cooperation within       our federal system.        We believe that law enforcement should not cut corners.       Multiple federal courts have questioned the legality and       constitutionality of federal immigration detainers that are       not accompanied by a criminal warrant signed by a judge. Even       though the legality of such immigration holds is doubtful,       some have proposed requiring states and localities to enforce       them, shielding them from lawsuits. While this approach would       reduce potential legal liability faced by some jurisdictions       and departments, we are concerned these proposals would still       require our agencies and officers carry out federal       directives that could violate the U.S. Constitution, which we       are sworn to follow.        Immigration enforcement is, first and foremost, a federal       responsibility. Making our communities safer means better       defining roles and improving relationships between local law       enforcement and federal immigration authorities. But in       attempting to defund ``sanctuary cities'' and require state       and local law enforcement to carry out the federal       government's immigration enforcement responsibilities, the       federal government would be substituting its judgment for the       judgment of state and local law enforcement agencies. Local       control has been a beneficial approach for law enforcement       for decades--having the federal government compel state and       local law enforcement to carry out new and sometimes       problematic tasks undermines the delicate federal balance and       will harm locally-based policing.        Rather than requiring state and local law enforcement       agencies to engage in additional immigration enforcement       activities, Congress should focus on overdue reforms of the       broken immigration system to allow state and local law       enforcement to focus their resources on true threats--      dangerous criminals and criminal organizations. We believe       that state and local law enforcement must work together with       federal authorities to protect our communities and that we       can best serve our communities by leaving the enforcement of       immigration laws to the federal government. Threatening the       removal of valuable grant funding that contributes to the       health and well-being of communities across the nation would       not make our communities safer and would not fix any part of       our broken immigration system.        Our immigration problem is a national problem deserving of       a national approach, and we continue to recognize that what       our broken system truly needs is a permanent legislative       solution--broad-based immigration reform.

Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Members of Congress: Cities for Action (C4A) is a       coalition of over 150 mayors and municipal leaders that       advocates for policies and programs that promote inclusion of       foreign-born residents. Our coalition has a deep commitment       to promoting public safety and building trust between law       enforcement and immigrant communities. We are writing to you       today to urge that you oppose the No Sanctuary for Criminals       Act, H.R. 3003.        Cities and counties are united in our opposition to       Representative Goodlatte's bill, which would undermine local       public safety efforts. Nearly 600 jurisdictions have a       variety of policies that would put them at risk of losing       millions of dollars in federal funding for local law       enforcement, national security, drug treatment, and crime       victim initiatives. These policies were adopted due to       constitutional concerns and judgements made on the best use       of limited resources. Rather than empowering localities to       adopt measures designed to enhance the general welfare of       their residents, H.R. 3003 would strip localities of the       ability to enact common-sense crime prevention policies that       ensure victims of crime will seek protection and report       crimes.        Among the types of grants that would be at risk are: the       Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, which addresses the growing       number of unsubmitted sexual assault kits in law enforcement       custody and aims to provide help for victims; the Violent       Gang and Gun Crime Reduction Program, which is designed to       create safer neighborhoods through a sustained reduction in       gang violence and gun crime; and the Research and Evaluation       on Trafficking of Persons, which helps support cities'       efforts to respond to the challenges that human trafficking       pose in their jurisdiction.        This bill also raises serious concerns by undermining local       laws and criminal prosecutions. It would prevent states or       localities from establishing laws or policies that  [[Page H5249]]       prohibit or ``in any way'' restrict compliance with or       cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. This       intrudes into local policies that help foster a relationship       of trust between law enforcement officials and immigrants       that will, in turn, promote public safety for all our       residents.        This also raises serious constitutional concerns. The Tenth       Amendment to the U. S. Constitution limits the federal       government's ability to mandate particular action by states       and localities, including in the area of federal immigration       law enforcement and investigations. The federal government       cannot force states or localities to enact or administer a       federal regulatory program, or compel state or local       employees to participate in the administration of a federally       enacted regulatory scheme.        In addition, this bill permits DHS to ignore validly issued       state or local criminal warrants, which would prevent       jurisdictions from completing their prosecution of criminals.       The provisions of this bill undercut local law enforcement       and will jeopardize public safety efforts.        Local governments have a strong interest in protecting all       residents and maintaining public safety. Therefore, we urge       you to oppose the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003,       and ensure it never becomes law.        Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter,                                                 Cities for Action.     Mr. Speaker, I know my friends think Washington knows  best, but I trust my local police more.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren), the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman, my friend, says that this is a constitutional  question. We agree that the Constitution is an important document, and  it goes to the heart of why we are opposed to the bill that the  gentleman is supporting here. The reason why we say that is because we  have had Federal courts that have decided in ways in the past that  cause great concern that much in this bill may be unconstitutional.   Now, that is why we should have had hearings, that radical idea that  we keep on bringing up, like hearings where people come and testify.  But I guess that is too much to ask.   One of the reasons why we are opposed to this is because we are  concerned that it may undermine the Constitution, and that is a pretty  big deal. I am happy to give the gentleman my copy of the Constitution  and references to court cases if he would like to do a little research,  but, boy, it would have been nice to have a hearing.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter on behalf of 407 local,  State, and national immigrant, civil rights, faith-based, and labor  organizations in strong opposition to H.R. 3003.                                                      June 28, 2017.      Re Vote NO on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003,           and Kate's Law, H.R. 3004.      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 407 undersigned       local, state, and national immigrant, civil rights, faith-      based, and labor organizations, we urge you to oppose the No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate's Law, H.R.       3004, and any similar legislation that jeopardizes public       safety, erodes the goodwill forged between local police and       its residents, and perpetuates the criminalization and       incarceration of immigrants. H.R. 3003 would strip badly       needed law enforcement funding for state and local       jurisdictions, runs afoul of the Tenth and Fourth Amendment,       and unnecessarily expands the government's detention       apparatus. H.R. 3004 unwisely expands the federal       government's  [[Page H5250]]       ability to criminally prosecute immigrants for immigration-      based offenses, excludes critical humanitarian protections       for those fleeing violence, and doubles down on the failed       experiment of incarceration for immigration violations.        Over 600 state and local jurisdictions have policies or       ordinances that disentangle their state and local law       enforcement agencies from enforcing federal immigration law.       The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, seeks to       attack so-called ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions (many of whom do       not consider themselves as such) by penalizing state and       local jurisdictions that follow the Fourth Amendment of the       U.S. Constitution by refusing to honor constitutionally       infirm requests for detainers. H.R. 3003 penalizes       jurisdictions by eliminating various federal grants,       including funding through the Cops on the Beat program, the       Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and       any other federal grant related to law enforcement or       immigration. Importantly, using the threat of withholding       federal grants to coerce state and local jurisdictions likely       runs afoul of the Tenth Amendment's prohibition on       commandeering, a position supported by over 300 law       professors.        ``Sanctuary'' policies are critical to promote public       safety for local communities. Fearing referral to U.S.       Immigration and Customs Enforcement, victims and witnesses of       crime are significantly less likely to communicate with local       law enforcement. Local law enforcement authorities have       repeatedly echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that       community policing policies are paramount to enhancing public       safety. Indeed, ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions have less crime       and more economic development than similarly situated non-      ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions. Withholding critically-needed       federal funding would, paradoxically, severely cripple the       ability of state and local jurisdictions to satisfy the       public safety needs of their communities.        Kate's Law, H.R. 3004, would further criminalize the       immigrant community by drastically increasing penalties for       immigrants convicted of unlawful reentry. Operation       Streamline encapsulates our nation's failed experiment with       employing criminal penalties to deter migration. Under       Operation Streamline, the federal government prosecutes       immigrants for reentry at significant rates. By all practical       measures, Operation Streamline has failed to deter migration,       wasted billions of taxpayer dollars, and unfairly punished       thousands of immigrants who try to enter or reenter the       United States to reunite with their children and loved ones.       We fear that H.R. 3004's increased penalties for reentry       would double down on this failed strategy, explode the prison       population, and cost billions of dollars.        Instead of passing discredited enforcement-only       legislation, Congress should move forward on enacting just       immigration reform legislation that provides a roadmap to       citizenship for the nation's eleven million aspiring       Americans and eliminates mass detention and deportation       programs that undermine fundamental human rights. Legislation       that erodes public safety, disrespects local democratic       processes, and raises serious constitutional concerns       represents an abdication of the Congress' responsibility to       enact fair, humane, and just immigration policy. In light of       the above, we urge you to vote NO on the No Sanctuary for       Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate's Law, H.R. 3004.

And if we do defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to this rule to bring up Representative Bobby Scott's Raise  the Wage Act, H.R. 15, which would finally give workers the raise they  deserve, and increase the Federal minimum wage to $15 an hour within 7  years.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, the reason why we are trying to bring this  to the floor by way of defeating the previous question is because the  Republican majority in this House had basically locked everything down  so we can't get important bills to the floor.   We can't even get amendments to the underlying bill that we are  debating here today. It is really unfortunate and sad for this  institution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to the entire Congress  from the American Immigration Lawyers Association in opposition to this  bill; a letter from Amnesty International in opposition to this bill;  and a letter from Church World Services in opposition to this bill.  Statement of the American Immigration Lawyers Association Opposing the  ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law'' (H.R.                           3004), June 27, 2017.         As the national bar association of over 15,000 immigration       lawyers and law professors, the American Immigration Lawyers       Association (AILA) opposes ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act''       (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004). AILA recommends       that members of Congress reject these bills which are       scheduled to come before the House Rules Committee on June 27       and to the floor shortly thereafter. Though Judiciary       Chairman Goodlatte stated that the bills will ``enhance       public safety,'' they will do the just the opposite:       undermine public safety and make it even harder for local law       enforcement to protect their residents and communities. In       addition, the bills which were made public less than a week       before the vote and completely bypassed the Judiciary       Committee, include provisions that will result in violations       of due process and the Fourth and Tenth Amendments to the       Constitution.        At a time when over 9 out 10 Americans support immigration       reform and legalization of the undocumented, Republican       leadership is asking the House to vote on enforcement-only       bills that will lead to more apprehensions, deportations, and       prosecutions of thousands of immigrants and their families       who have strong ties to the United States. Instead of       criminalizing and scapegoating immigrants, Congress should be       offering workable reforms that will strengthen our economy       and our country.                The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003         H.R. 3003 would undermine public safety and interfere with       local policing: H.R. 3003 would amend 8 Sec. U.S.C. 1373 to       prevent states or localities from establishing laws or       policies that prohibit or ``in any way'' restrict compliance       with or cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The       bill dramatically expands 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1373 which is more       narrowly written and prohibits local law enforcement from       restricting the sharing and exchange of information with       federal authorities, but only with respect to an individual's       citizenship or immigration status.        Rather than empowering localities, the extremely broad       wording of H.R. 3003 would strip localities of the ability to       enact common-sense crime prevention policies that ensure       victims of crime will seek protection and report crimes. The       bill would also undermine public safety by prohibiting DHS       from honoring criminal warrants of communities deemed       ``sanctuary cities'' if the individual being sought by local       law enforcement has a final order of removal.        Under H.R. 3003, localities that fail to comply with       federal immigration efforts are penalized with the denial of       federal funding for critical law enforcement, national       security, drug treatment, and crime victim initiatives,       including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program       (SCAAP), Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and       Byrne JAG programs that provide hundreds of millions of       dollars to localities nationwide.        In an effort to force localities to engage in civil       immigration enforcement efforts, including those against       nonviolent undocumented immigrants, the bill would make it       far more difficult for many localities, including large       cities, to arrest and prosecute potentially dangerous       criminals. The bill could even offer criminals a form of       immunity, knowing that any crimes they commit in a designated       sanctuary city would result, at most, in their removal from       the country as opposed to criminal prosecution.        H.R. 3003 would run afoul of constitutional safeguards in       the Fourth Amendment: By prohibiting localities from       restricting or limiting their own cooperation with federal       immigration enforcement, H.R. 3003 effectively compels       localities to honor ICE detainer requests--a controversial       and constitutionally suspect practice that is nonetheless       widely-used by ICE. Federal courts have found that ICE use of       detainers violates the Fourth Amendment, and that localities       may be held liable for honoring them.        The bill also expands detainer authority by establishing       that ICE may issue detainer requests for localities to hold       undocumented immigrants for up to 96 hours--twice what is       currently allowed--even if probable cause has not been shown.       Courts have concluded that localities cannot continue       detaining someone unless ICE obtains a warrant from a neutral       magistrate who has determined there is probable cause, or in       the case of a warrantless arrest, review by a neutral       magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. The expansive       provisions in H.R. 3003 would force localities to choose       between detaining people in violation of the Constitution or       being punished as a ``sanctuary city.''        Furthermore, this bill provides government actors and       private contractors with immunity if they are sued for       violating the Constitution. Provisions in this bill transfer       the financial burden of litigation by substituting the       federal government for the local officers as the defendant.       If H.R. 3003 becomes law, American taxpayers would be stuck       paying for lawsuits brought by those who are unjustly       detained.        The bill goes even further by creating a private right of       action allowing crime victims or their family members to sue       localities if the crime was committed by someone who was       released by the locality that did not honor an ICE detainer       request.        H.R. 3003 would violate the Tenth Amendment: H.R. 3003       would compel states and localities to utilize their local law       enforcement resources to implement federal civil  [[Page H5254]]       immigration enforcement in violation of the Tenth Amendment's       ``commandeering'' principle. The Tenth Amendment does not       permit the federal government to force counties and cities to       allocate local resources, including police officers,       technology, and personnel, to enforce federal immigration       law. The federal government also cannot withhold funds from       localities refusing to participate in federal efforts if the       programs affected are unrelated to the purpose of the federal       program, or if the sanctions are punitive in nature.        H.R. 3003 would expand detention without due process: H.R.       3003 would increase the use of detention without ensuring       those detained have access to a bond determination. Under the       bill, nearly anyone who is undocumented, including those who       have overstayed their visa would be subject to detention       without a custody hearing. The bill also establishes that DHS       has the authority to detain individuals ``without time       limitation'' during the pendency of removal proceedings.       These provisions would dramatically expand the federal       government's power to indefinitely detain individuals, and       would likely result in ever growing numbers of undocumented       immigrants held in substandard detention facilities.                            Kate's Law, H.R. 3004         H.R. 3004 would expand the already severe penalties in       federal law for illegal reentry (NA 276; 8 U.S.C. 1326). The       number of people prosecuted for illegal reentry has grown       steadily to about 20,000 prosecutions each year, and such       cases comprise more than one quarter of all federal criminal       prosecutions nationwide. H.R. 3004 adds sentencing       enhancements for people who are convicted of minor       misdemeanors and people who have reentered multiple times but       have no criminal convictions. This bill will not improve       public safety and will undermine due process and protections       for asylum seekers. H.R. 3004 would waste American taxpayer       funds by imposing severe prison sentences upon thousands of       people who pose no threat to the community and who have       strong ties to the country and are trying to unite with their       loved ones.        H.R. 3004 would impose severe sentencing enhancements upon       people with minor offenses: H.R. 3004 would add sentencing       enhancements for minor misdemeanor convictions, including       driving without a license and other traffic-related offenses.       Under the current version of INA Sec. 276, if a person is       charged with reentering the U.S. after being removed, their       punishment is enhanced by up to ten years only if they have       been convicted a felony or three or more misdemeanors       involving drugs or violence. Under H.R. 3004 someone who has       been convicted of any three misdemeanors regardless of       severity would be subject to a term of up to ten years.        This expansion would unfairly target large numbers of       people who are not a threat to public safety but instead are       trying to reunite with family members and have other strong       ties to the United States. Currently half of all people       convicted of illegal reentry have one child living in the       country. Increasing sentences for illegal reentry would also       waste taxpayer dollars, costing huge amounts of money to lock       up non-violent people.        H.R. 3004 would punish people who attempt to seek asylum at       the border: H.R. 3004 expands the provisions of INA 276 to       punish not only people who reenter the U.S. or attempt to       reenter the U.S., but also people who cross or attempt to       cross the border. The bill goes on to define ``crosses the       border'' to mean ``the physical act of crossing the border,       regardless of whether the alien is free from official       restraint.'' That means that people who present themselves at       ports of entry to request asylum and are taken into custody       by CBP to await a fear screening would be subject to criminal       charges based on a past removal, even though they are seeking       refuge in the U.S.        H.R. 3004 would impose severe sentencing enhancements for       people with multiple entries: The bill would also create new       sentencing enhancements for people who have reentered the       U.S. multiple times, even if they have no other criminal       convictions. If someone has been removed three or more times,       and is found in the United States or attempts to cross the       border again, H.R. 3004 law would provide for sentencing       enhancements of up to ten years. The bill makes no exception       for bona fide asylum seekers, which means that people who are       seeking refuge in the U.S. from atrocities abroad could be       subject to a lengthy prison sentence under these provisions.        H.R. 3004 would undermine due process by blocking       challenges to unfair removal orders: The bill will prevent an       individual from challenging the validity of a removal order,       even it was fundamentally unfair in the first place. The       Supreme Court held in U.S. v. Mendoza-Lopez,481 U.S. 828       (1987) that due process requires that a challenge be allowed       if a deportation proceeding is used as an element of a       criminal offense and where the proceeding ``effectively       eliminate[d] the right of the alien to obtain judicial       review.'' This provision in H.R. 3004 is likely       unconstitutional and will cause grave injustice to       defendants, such as asylum seekers who were deported without       the opportunity to seek asylum.                                   ____                                            Amnesty International,                                                      June 28, 2017.     Amnesty International USA urges a vote ``NO'' on H.R. 3003 and H.R.                                    3004         Dear Representative: On behalf of Amnesty International USA       (``AIUSA'') and our more than one million members and       supporters nationwide, we strongly urge you to oppose the No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) and Kate's Law (H.R.       3004). Both bills are scheduled for House floor votes as       early as June 28. If passed, both bills would pave the way       for and accelerate the implementation of policies that       increase the criminalization and detention of immigrants and       asylum seekers, thereby violating the United States'       obligations under international law.        AIUSA will be scoring these votes.        I. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) would       prevent municipalities from determining how law enforcement       agencies are engaging in immigration enforcement, and would       dramatically expand indefinite detention and mandatory       detention of immigrants in jail-like facilities with subpar       dangerous conditions, in violation of international human       rights standards.        H.R. 3003 would prevent localities from enacting community       trust policies that instruct local police not to carry out       federal immigration enforcement, thereby undermining policing       practices designed to build trust and confidence between       local law enforcement and the communities they serve. This       bill would open the door to racial profiling against Latinos       and other communities of color, including U.S. citizens.        International law firmly prohibits discrimination, and the       United States' commitment to those obligations applies to       citizens and non-citizens alike.        States that have passed anti-immigrant legislation that       requires local law enforcement to cooperate with immigration       agencies or to inquire about immigration status regarding any       interactions with law enforcement have compromised the right       to justice for immigrant communities by discouraging       immigrant survivors from reporting crimes.        The U.S. government has an obligation to prevent and       address abuse of immigrants and ensure that all immigrants       are able to access available remedies. This includes acting       with due diligence to investigate and punish criminal conduct       committed by private individuals, and guaranteeing access to       justice for immigrant victims of crime.        Amnesty International has also documented how the increased       involvement of state and local law enforcement agencies in       immigration enforcement, without adequate oversight and       accountability to prevent abuses, contributes to the rise in       reports of racial profiling for Latino communities and other       communities of color. Numerous studies have demonstrated that       programs that integrate the criminal justice system and law       enforcement as an entry point for immigration enforcement       have led to racial profiling and other abuses.        In addition, H.R. 3003 would dramatically expand the       Department of Homeland Security (``DES'') immigration       detention powers by authorizing mandatory detention ``without       time limitation.'' This would empower the DHS to detain       untold numbers of immigrants for as long as it takes to       conclude immigration court removal proceedings, even if that       takes years. Section 4 would also authorize indefinite       mandatory detention Without providing the basic due process       of an immigration judge bond hearing to determine if the       immigrant's imprisonment was justified in the first place.       Finally, section 4 would expand mandatory detention of       immigrants with no criminal record whatsoever, including       immigrants who overstayed a visa or lack legal papers.        The mandatory detention system, which provides for the       automatic detention of individuals, amounts to arbitrary       detention, and is in violation of international law, which       requires that detention be justified in each individual case       and be subject to judicial review. The expansion of offenses       which would fall under mandatory detention as demonstrated in       H.R., as proposed by H.R. 3003, amounts to arbitrary       detention, and is in violation of international law, which       requires that detention be justified in each individual case       and be subject to judicial review. U.S. federal courts have       also consistently held that detaining immigrants for months       and years without bond hearings raises serious problems under       the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.        The proposed dramatic expansion of immigration detention       powers envisioned in H.R. 3003 comes at a time when       immigration detention has already hit record-highs, with the       average daily population (``ADP'') exceeding 40,000 in       comparison to a 34,000 ADP for the preceding seven years.       This sharp escalation in the number of detained immigrants       also comes at a time when Human Rights Watch (``HRW'') has       reported new evidence of dangerously subpar medical care in       immigration detention, including unreasonable delays in care       and unqualified medical staff that are likely to expose a       record number of immigrants to dangerous conditions. This       recent HRW report is only the latest of a series of shocking       reports documenting DHS's failure to provide care to ill or       injured immigrants in its custody.        The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights       (ICCPR), which the United States has ratified, guarantees all       people the rights to be free from discrimination and       arbitrary arrest and detention, and the right to due process,       including fair deportation procedures. Finally, noncitizens       who are detained have a right to humane conditions of       detention and are entitled to prompt review  [[Page H5255]]       of their detention by an independent court. The mass       expansion of mandatory detention and immigration detention       proposed by H.R. 3003 violates all of these international       human rights standards.        II. H.R. 3004 would increase mass incarceration of       immigrants, including survivors of persecution or torture, by       increasing criminal penalties for the mere act of migration--      in violation of international human rights standards.        Current law already criminalizes illegal reentry in       violation of international law and standards under 8 U.S.C.       Sec. 1326, imposing a sentence of up to 20 years on anyone       convicted of illegal reentry after committing an aggravated       felony. According to data compiled by the Transactional       Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, in       fiscal year 2016 federal criminal prosecutions for illegal       entry, reentry, and similar immigration violations made up 52       percent of all federal prosecutions nationwide--surpassing       drugs, weapons, fraud and thousands of other crimes.        Criminal penalties for unauthorized entry are obstacles for       identifying the victims of human rights abuses, and prevent       victims from seeking justice. They undermine human rights       protections afforded in international law, including the       right to seek asylum. The Special Rapporteur on the Human       Rights of Migrants has repeatedly stressed that where       detention is used as a punitive measure, it is       disproportionate and inappropriate, and stigmatizes       undocumented immigrants as criminals.        The criminal prosecution of illegal reentry has grown       exponentially over the past decade. In 2002 there were 8,000       prosecutions for illegal reentry; in 2012 these prosecutions       had increased to 37,000. Nearly 99 percent of illegal reentry       defendants were sentenced to federal prison time, ranging       from a few days to 10 years or more for felony reentry before       they are eventually deported.        Beyond the trend towards more aggressive criminal       prosecutions for illegal reentry, a 2015 U.S. Sentencing       Commission report found nearly 50 percent of people sentenced       in fiscal 2013 for illegal re-entry had at least one child       living in the U.S. Many of the individuals charged with       illegal reentry previously resided in the U.S. for many years       and are desperate to return to their family in the U.S.        On top of this longstanding trend of harsher criminal       prosecution for illegal reentry--the sponsors of H.R. 3004       would seek to expand the category of individuals subject to       illegal reentry prosecution to include people who surrender       themselves at the southern border to seek protection in the       U.S. The bill would also expand sentencing enhancements for       illegal reentry, and would prosecute people for illegal       reentry even if their previous removal orders were unlawful       or deprived them of the opportunity to seek protection. For       example, the bill would criminalize asylum seekers who return       to the U.S. after being previously denied the opportunity to       present their claims for protection.        While all sovereign states have a legitimate interest in       regulating entry into their territories, they can only do so       within the limits of their obligations under international       law. The U.S. government has an obligation under       international human rights law to ensure that its laws,       policies, and practices do not place immigrants at an       increased risk of human rights abuses. Specifically,       individuals have a right to seek asylum from persecution and       protection from refoulement, and prosecuting asylum seekers       prior to adjudication of their asylum applications violates       U.S. obligations under the Refugee Convention. Similarly the       Convention Against Torture prohibits a State from expelling,       returning, or extraditing a person to another State where       there are substantial grounds for believing that s/he would       be in danger of being subjected to torture. Finally, all       individuals, regardless of immigration status, have a right       to family unity which can include limits on the State's power       to deport, as recognized by the Human Rights Committee's       interpretation of ICCPR obligations        All of these international human rights standards are       violated by H.R. 3004.        AIUSA strongly urges you to oppose both H.R. 3003 and H.R.       3004.            Sincerely,                                                     Joanne Lin,                                           Senior Managing Director,      Advocacy and Government Affairs.                                   ____     CWS Statement to Opposing H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals                       Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law         As a 71-year old humanitarian organization representing 37       Protestant, Anglican, and Orthodox communions and 34 refugee       resettlement offices across the country, Church World Service       (CWS) urges all Members of Congress to support the       longstanding efforts of law enforcement officials to foster       trusting relationships with the communities they protect and       serve. As we pray for peace and an end to senseless acts of       violence that are too prevalent in this country, CWS       encourages the U.S. Congress to refrain from politicizing       tragedies or conflating the actions of one person with an       entire community of our immigrant brothers and sisters and       oppose H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and       H.R. 3004, Kate's Law.        H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, would target       more than 600+ cities, counties, and states across the       country and threaten to take away millions of dollars in       federal funding that local police use to promote public       safety. Communities are safer when they commit to policies       that strengthen trust and cooperation between local law       enforcement, community leadership and institutions, and all       residents, regardless of immigration status. The Federal       government should not hurt intentional, community-based       policing efforts that are vital in communities across the       country. Many cities have already recognized that requests by       Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold individuals       beyond their court-appointed sentences violate due process       and have been found unconstitutional by federal courts. This       bill would raise profound constitutional concerns by       prohibiting localities from declining to comply with ICE       detainer requests even when such compliance would violate       federal court orders and the U.S. Constitution. Local police       that refuse ICE detainer requests see an increase in public       safety due to improved trust from the community. It is       precisely this trust that enables community members to report       dangerous situations without the fear of being deported or       separated from their families. When local police comply with       ICE detainer requests, more crimes go unreported because       victims and witnesses are afraid of being deported if they       contact the police. This bill would also undermine local       criminal prosecutions by allowing the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) to ignore state or local criminal warrants and       refuse to transfer individuals to state or local custody in       certain circumstances. This bill would reduce community       safety by preventing state and local jurisdictions from       holding people accountable.        The United States already spends more than $18 billion on       immigration enforcement per year, more than all other federal       law enforcement agencies combined. H.R. 3004, Kate's Law,       would expand the federal government's ability to prosecute       individuals for ``illegal reentry'' and impose even more       severe penalties in these cases--even though prosecutions for       migration-related offenses already make up more than 50% of       all federal prosecutions. Yet, this bill does not include       adequate protections for individuals who reenter the U.S. in       order to seek protection, which would place asylum seekers at       risk of being returned to the violence and persecution they       fled. We have seen how Border Patrol's current practices       violate existing U.S. law and treaty obligations by       preventing viable asylum claims from moving forward. DHS has       found that in some areas, Border Patrol refers asylum seekers       for criminal prosecution despite the fact that they have       expressed fear of persecution. In May 2017, a report was       released highlighting that many asylum seekers, who had       expressed a fear of returning to their home countries are       being turned away by GBP agents. New barriers to protection       are unnecessary and would dangerously impede our obligations       under international and U.S. law.        Federal, state, and local policies that focus on       deportation do not reduce crime rates. Individuals are being       deported who present no risk to public safety and who are       long-standing community members, including parents of young       children. Immigrants come to this country to reunite with       family, work, and make meaningful contributions that enrich       their communities. Several studies over the last century have       affirmed that all immigrants, regardless of nationality or       status, are less likely than U.S. citizens to commit violent       crimes. A recent report found a correlation between the       increase in undocumented immigrants, and the sharp decline in       violent and property crime rates. Immigration is correlated       with significantly higher employment growth and a decline in       the unemployment rate, and immigrants have high       entrepreneurial rates, creating successful businesses that       hire immigrant and U.S. citizen employees.        As communities of faith, we are united by principles of       compassion, stewardship, and justice. CWS urges all Members       of Congress to oppose H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for       Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law. What we need are       real solutions and immigration policies that treat our       neighbors with the dignity and respect that all people       deserve and affirm local law enforcement officer's efforts to       build trust with their communities.     Again, Mr. Speaker, our objection is that Washington  doesn't always know best. We ought to trust our local law enforcement  officials, our local police as to what is effective in terms of  protecting the citizens of our community.   To introduce legislation that would essentially punish our local  police for doing what they think is in the best interest of their  communities, this bill should be renamed ``punish our local police,''  because that is what it does.   I can't believe that we are going down this road. Maybe it is a nice  sound bite, maybe it is a nice press release, maybe it fits in with the  Trump campaign rhetoric on immigrants and immigration; but this is just  a lousy idea. And I think if we did hearings on this bill, if we  actually spent some time being thoughtful about this issue, my  colleagues would come to that conclusion.   Again, I would say that what we should be talking about is fixing our  [[Page H5256]]  broken immigration system. We need comprehensive immigration reform.  The Senate, in a bipartisan way, stepped up to the plate and did it. It  is about time Members of this House have the guts to bring a  comprehensive immigration reform bill to the floor and fix our broken  immigration system.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I include in the Record a letter to every Member of Congress from The  Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights in opposition to this  bill; a letter to all of us from the ACLU in opposition to this bill; a  letter to every Member of Congress from the National Task Force to End  Sexual & Domestic Violence that is in opposition to this bill; as well  as a letter to Members of Congress from the United States Conference of  Catholic Bishops and Catholic Charities USA in opposition to this bill;  and a letter from NETWORK, which is a lobby for Catholic social justice  in opposition to this bill.                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.   Oppose the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's                             Law'' (H.R. 3004)         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200       national advocacy organizations, I urge you to oppose H.R.       3003, the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' and H.R. 3004,       ``Kate's Law.'' These two bills may sound ``tough,'' but they       would ultimately make the problems with our national       immigration system even worse than they already are.        H.R. 3003 would unnecessarily and unwisely penalize states       and municipalities that are attempting to strike the delicate       balance between cooperating with federal immigration       authorities, on one hand, and respecting the constraints       imposed on them by the U.S. Constitution, on the other. At       the same time, it would do nothing to address the       constitutional concerns raised by the use of immigration       ``detainer'' requests, concerns that the Department of       Homeland Security (DHS) itself has recognized in the past.        Among its provisions, H.R. 3003 would eliminate various       federal law enforcement grants to states and municipalities,       such as the ``Cops on the Beat'' program, unless       jurisdictions comply with all DHS detainer requests. It aims       to overturn local policies adopted by over 300 jurisdictions       across the country that have determined, as a matter of       constitutional law and sound public policy, including       community policing efforts, that they cannot hold individuals       beyond their release dates solely on the basis of a DHS       detainer request.        The senseless and tragic 2015 killing of Kathryn Steinle in       San Francisco has renewed the debate over so-called       ``sanctuary cities.'' Yet the term suggests, incorrectly,       that certain states and municipalities are refusing to work       with federal immigration enforcement authorities. The truth       is that state and local law enforcement agencies (``LEAs'')       throughout the country already aid in the identification of       individuals who are subject to immigration enforcement action       through the sharing of fingerprints of those who are taken       into custody. LEAs with limited detainer policies have       determined, however, that they cannot continue to detain       individuals for immigration enforcement purposes, under the       Fourth Amendment and pursuant to numerous court rulings,       unless DHS obtains a judicial warrant, as all other law       enforcement agencies are required to do.        H.R. 3003 would not address the Fourth Amendment concerns       raised by the use of DHS detainers. Instead, it would leave       many state and municipal governments in an untenable       position: either they must disregard their constitutional       responsibilities and erode the trust they have built between       the police and the communities they serve, or they will face       the loss of vital federal law enforcement funding that helps       them fight crime in their jurisdictions. Congress should not       force such an arbitrary and unwise choice on cities.        H.R. 3004, the other immigration-related bill expected to       come to the House floor this week, would significantly       increase sentences for previously-removed individuals who       reenter the country. While the bill is an improvement over       other bills by the same name, in that it does not include       mandatory minimum sentencing provisions, it would still lead       to a likely increase in the federal prison population without       any tangible benefits. The Department of Justice's       ``Operation Streamline'' program, upon which this bill would       build, has already shown that increased criminal prosecutions       do little but waste resources while failing to deter       unauthorized border crossings. It should be ended, not       expanded.        For these reasons, I urge you to vote against H.R. 3003 and       H.R. 3004.            Sincerely,                                                      Vanita Gupta,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                   American Civil Liberties Union,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.      Re ACLU Opposes H.R. 3003 (No Sanctuary for Criminals Act)           and H.R. 3004 (Kate's Law).      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       the American Civil Liberties Union (``ACLU''), we submit this       letter to the House of Representatives to express our strong       opposition to H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,       and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law.                  no sanctuary for criminals act (h.r. 3003)         H.R. 3003 conflicts with the principles of the Fourth       Amendment.        H.R. 3003 defies the Fourth Amendment by amending 8 USC       Section 1373 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA'')       to force localities to comply with unlawful detainer requests       or risk losing federal funding. This is despite the fact that       an ``increasing number of federal court decisions'' have held       that ``detainer-based detention by state and local law       enforcement agencies violates the  [[Page H5257]]       Fourth Amendment,'' as recognized by former Department of       Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2014.        Disturbingly, H.R. 3003 seeks to penalize the 600+       localities that abide by the Fourth Amendment. These       jurisdictions have recognized that by entangling local       authorities and federal immigration enforcement, immigration       detainers erode trust between immigrant communities and local       law enforcement. In this way, immigration detainers       ultimately undermine public safety, as entire communities       become wary of seeking assistance from police and other       government authorities that are supposed to provide help in       times of need. Thus, by forcing jurisdictions to comply with       unlawful detainer requests, H.R. 3003 will only make       communities less safe, not more.        H.R. 3003 would also amend Section 287 of the INA to allow       the Department of Homeland Security (``DHS') to take custody       of a person being held under a detainer within 48 hours       (excluding weekends and holidays) ``but in no instance more       than 96 hours'' following the date that the individual would       otherwise be released from criminal custody. This, again,       raises serious Fourth Amendment concerns, as the Supreme       Court has stated that the Constitution requires a judicial       finding of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest. This       provision would disregard the Court's ruling entirely and       allow a local law enforcement agency to hold a person for up       to 7 days before requiring DHS intervention--and never       requiring the person be brought before a judge for a probable       cause hearing.        Protection against unreasonable detention by the government       is the bedrock of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which       provides that the government cannot hold anyone in jail       without getting a warrant or approval from a neutral       magistrate. This constitutional protection applies to       everyone in the United States--citizen and immigrant alike.        Immigration detainers, however, do not abide by these       standards. Detainers are one of the key tools that DHS uses       to apprehend individuals who come in contact with local and       state law enforcement agencies. An immigration detainer is a       written request from DHS to that local law enforcement       agency, requesting that they detain an individual for an       additional 48 hours after the person's release date, in order       to allow immigration agents extra time to decide whether to       take that person into custody for deportation purposes.        DHS' use of detainers to imprison people without due       process, without any charges pending, and without probable       cause of a criminal violation flies in the face of our Fourth       Amendment protections. Policies that allow DHS to detain       people at-will are ripe for civil and human rights violations       and have resulted in widespread wrongful detentions,       including detentions of U.S. citizens. That is why many of       the 600+ localities targeted by H.R. 3003 have decided not to       execute a DHS immigration detainer request unless it is       accompanied by additional evidence, a determination of       probable cause, or a judicial warrant.        Unfortunately, H.R. 3003 does nothing to address the       fundamental constitutional problems plaguing DHS's use of       immigration detainers. Rather than fix the constitutional       problems by requiring a judicial warrant, the bill       perpetuates the unconstitutional detainer practices and       forces the federal government to absorb legal liability for       the constitutional violations which will inevitably result.       This is irresponsible lawmaking. Instead of saddling       taxpayers with the liability the federal government will       incur from Fourth Amendment violations, Congress should end       the use of DHS's unconstitutional detainer requests.        H.R. 3003 violates the Due Process Clause by allowing DHS       to detain people indefinitely without a bond hearing.        Section 4 of H.R. 3003 radically expands our immigration       detention system by amending Section 236(c) of the INA to       authorize mandatory detention ``without time limitation.''       This empowers DHS to detain countless immigrants for as long       as it takes to conclude removal proceedings--even if that       takes years--without the basic due process of a bond hearing       to determine if their imprisonment is even justified. This is       a clear constitutional violation, as the federal courts have       overwhelmingly held that jailing immigrants for months and       years without bond hearings raises serious problems under the       Due Process Clause.        Although the bill claims to provide for the ``detention of       criminal aliens,'' it massively expands mandatory detention       to people with no criminal record whatsoever, including       immigrants who lack legal papers or who overstay a tourist       visa. The ``lock `em up'' approach to immigration enforcement       is cruel, irrational, and unconstitutional. The Supreme Court       has permitted brief periods of mandatory detention only in       cases where individuals are charged with deportation based on       certain criminal convictions. The Court has not endorsed the       mandatory lock-up of people who have never committed a crime.                            Kate's Law (H.R. 3004)         H.R. 3004 is piecemeal immigration enforcement that expands       America's federal prison population and lines the coffers of       private prison companies.        Increasing the maximum sentences for illegal reentrants is       unnecessary, wasteful, and inhumane. H.R. 3004 envisions a       federal criminal justice system that prosecutes asylum-      seekers, persons providing humanitarian assistance to       migrants in distress, and parents who pose no threat to       public safety in returning to the U.S. to reunite with       children who need their care (individuals with children in       the United States are 50 percent of those convicted of       illegal reentry).        Current law already imposes a sentence of up to 20 years on       anyone convicted of illegally reentering the country who has       committed an aggravated felony. U.S. Attorneys' Offices       aggressively enforce these provisions. According to the U.S.       Sentencing Commission, immigration prosecutions account for       52 percent of all federal prosecutions--surpassing drugs,       weapons, fraud and thousands of other crimes. Nearly 99       percent of illegal reentry defendants are sentenced to       federal prison time.        H.R. 3004 would drastically expand America's prison       population of nonviolent prisoners at a time when there is       bipartisan support to reduce the federal prison population.       It offends due process by cutting off all collateral attacks       on unjust prior deportation orders, despite the Supreme       Court's contrary ruling in United States v. Mendoza-Lopez.       Profiteering by private prison companies has been the main       consequence of border-crossing prosecutions, which the       Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of       Inspector General have criticized as lacking sound deterrent       support.        H.R. 3004 is an integral part of this administration's mass       deportation and mass incarceration agenda. Longer sentences       for illegal reentry are not recommended by any informed       federal criminal-justice stakeholders; rather they represent       this administration's anti-immigrant obsession and would       expensively expand substandard private jail contracting       despite the life-threatening conditions in these facilities.        In conclusion, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 are fraught with       constitutional problems that threaten the civil and human       rights of our immigrant communities, undercut law       enforcement's ability to keep our communities safe, and would       balloon our federal prison population by financing private       prison corporations. Rather than taking a punitive approach       to local law enforcement agencies that are working hard to       balance their duties to uphold the Constitution and to keep       their communities safe, Congress should end DHS's       unconstitutional detainer practices or fix the constitutional       deficiencies by requiring judicial warrants for all detainer       requests. Congress should also repeal mandatory detention so       that all immigrants receive the basic due process of a bond       hearing and reject any attempt to unfairly imprison       individuals who are not a threat to public safety.

Lorella Praeli,        Director of Immigration Policy and Campaigns.                                   ____                                          National Task Force to End                                    Sexual and Domestic Violence,                                                      June 27, 2017.        The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence       (NTF), comprised of national leadership organizations       advocating on behalf of sexual assault and domestic violence       victims and representing hundreds of organizations across the       country dedicated to ensuring all survivors of violence       receive the protections they deserve, write to express our       deep concerns about the impact that H.R. 3003, the ``No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' and H.R. 3004, or ``Kate's       Law,'' will have on victims fleeing or recovering from sexual       assault, domestic violence, or human trafficking, and on       communities at large.        This year is the twenty-third anniversary of the bipartisan       Violence Against Women Act (``VAWA'') which has, since it was       first enacted, included critical protections for immigrant       victims of domestic and sexual violence. H.R. 3003 and H.R.       3004 will have the effect of punishing immigrant survivors       and their children and pushing them into the shadows and into       danger, undermining the very purpose of VAWA. Specifically,       the nation's leading national organizations that address       domestic and sexual assault oppose H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004       because:        Community trust policies are critical tools for increasing       community safety. Laws that seek to intertwine the federal       immigration and local law enforcement systems will undermine       the Congressional purpose of protections enacted under VAWA       and will have the chilling effect of pushing immigrant       victims into the shadows and undermining public safety.       Immigration enforcement must be implemented in a way that       supports local community policing and sustains community       trust in working with local law enforcement. H.R. 3003 runs       contrary to community policing efforts and will deter       immigrant domestic violence and sexual assault survivors not       only from reporting crimes, but also from seeking help for       themselves and their children. While H.R. 3003 does not       require that local law enforcement arrest or report immigrant       victims or witnesses of criminal activity, the language in       the bill provides no restriction prohibiting such practices.        Perpetrators use fear of deportation as tool of abuse.       Local policies that minimize the intertwining of local law       enforcement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  [[Page H5258]]       (ICE) help protect the most vulnerable victims by creating       trust between law enforcement and the immigrant community,       which in turn help protect entire communities. Abusers and       traffickers use the fear of deportation of their victims as a       tool to silence and trap them. If immigrants are afraid to       call the police because of fear of deportation, they become       more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Not only are the       individual victims and their children harmed, but their fear       of law enforcement leads many to abstain from reporting       violent perpetrators or seeking protection and, as a result,       dangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished.        As VAWA recognizes, immigrant victims of violent crimes       often do not contact law enforcement due to fear that they       will be deported. Immigrants are already afraid of contacting       the police and HR 3003 proposes to further intertwine federal       immigration and local law enforcement systems will only       exacerbate this fear. The result is that perpetrators will be       able to continue to harm others, both immigrant and U.S.       Citizen victims alike. Since January of 2017, victim       advocates have been describing the immense fear expressed by       immigrant victims and their reluctance to reach out for help       from police. A recent survey of over 700 advocates and       attorneys at domestic violence and sexual assault programs       indicate that immigrant victims are expressing heightened       fears and concerns about immigration enforcement, with 78% of       advocates and attorneys reporting that victims are describing       fear of contacting the police; 75% of them reporting that       victims are afraid of going to court; and 43% reporting       working with immigrant victims who are choosing not to move       forward with criminal charges or obtaining protective orders.        In addition, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie       Beck, reporting of sexual assault and domestic violence among       Latinos has dropped significantly this year, possibly due to       concerns that police interaction could result in deportation.       According to Chief Beck, reports of sexual assault have       dropped 25 percent among Los Angeles' Latino population since       the beginning of the year compared to a three percent drop       among non-Latino victims. Similarly, reports of spousal abuse       among Latinos fell by about 10 percent among Latinos whereas       the decline among non-Latinos was four percent. The Houston       Police Department reported in April that the number of       Hispanics reporting rape is down 42.8 percent from last year.       In Denver, CO, the Denver City Attorney has reported that       some domestic violence victims are declining to testify in       court. As of late February, the City Attorney's Office had       dropped four cases because the victims fear that ICE officers       will arrest and deport them. Both the City Attorney and       Aurora Police Chief have spoken on the importance of having       trust with the immigrant community in order to maintain       public safety and prosecute crime.        HR 3003 Will Unfairly Punish Entire Communities.        H.R. 3003 punishes localities that follow Constitutional       guidelines and refuse to honor detainer requests that are not       supported by due process mandates. H.R. 3003 likely covers       more than 600 jurisdictions across the country, most of which       do not characterize their policies to follow constitutional       mandates as ``sanctuary'' policies. H.R. 3003 penalizes       jurisdictions by eliminating their access to various federal       grants, including federal law enforcement grants, such as the       Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and       other federal grants related to law enforcement or       immigration, such as those that fund forensic rape kit       analysis. Withholding federal law enforcement funding would,       ironically, undermine the ability of local jurisdictions to       combat and prevent crime in their communities.        In addition, the fiscal impact of both H.R. 3003 and H.R.       3004 will result in limited federal law enforcement resources       being further reduced as a result of shifting funding from       enforcing federal criminal laws addressing violent crimes,       including those protecting victims of domestic violence,       sexual assault, and human trafficking, to the detention and       prosecution of many non-violent immigration law violaters.        H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 Will Unfairly Punish Victims.        By greatly expanding mandatory detention and expanding       criminal penalties for reentry, H.R. 3003 and H.R.3004 will       have harsh consequences for immigrant survivors. Victims of       human trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence are       often at risk of being arrested and convicted. In recognition       of this fact, existing ICE guidance cites the example of when       police respond to a domestic violence call, both parties may       be arrested or a survivor who acted in self-defense may be       wrongly accused. In addition, if the abuser speaks English       better than the survivor, or if other language or cultural       barriers (or fear of retaliation from the abuser) prevent the       survivor from fully disclosing the abuse suffered, a survivor       faces charges and tremendous pressure to plead guilty       (without being advised about the long-term consequences) in       order to be released from jail and reunited with her       children. In addition, victims of trafficking are often       arrested and convicted for prostitution-related offenses.       These victims are often desperate to be released and possibly       to be reunited with their children following their arrests or       pending trial. These factors--combined with poor legal       counsel, particularly about the immigration consequences of       criminal pleas and convictions--have in the past and will       likely continue to lead to deportation of wrongly accused       victims who may have pled to or been unfairly convicted of       domestic violence charges and/or prostitution. H.R. 3003       imposes harsh criminal penalties and H.R. 3009 imposes       expanded bases for detention without consideration of       mitigating circumstances or humanitarian exceptions for these       victims.        In addition, HR. 3004 expands the criminal consequences for       re-entry in the U.S. without recognizing the compelling       humanitarian circumstances in which victims who have been       previously removed return for their safety. Victims of       domestic and sexual violence and trafficking fleeing violence       in their countries of origin will be penalized for seeking       protection from harm. In recent years, women and children       fleeing rampant violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and       Honduras, have fled to the United States, seeking refuge.       Frequently, because of inadequate access to legal       representation, they are unable to establish their       eligibility for legal protections in the United States,       resulting in their removal. In many cases, the risk of       domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or human trafficking       in their countries of origin remain unabated and victims       subsequently attempt to reenter the U.S. to protect       themselves and their children. Other victims of domestic and       sexual violence and trafficking may be deported because their       abusers or traffickers isolate them, or prevent them from       obtaining lawful immigration status. They are deported, with       some victims having to leave their children behind in the       custody of their abusers or traffickers. Under H.R. 3004,       these victims risk harsh criminal penalties for re-entry for       attempting to protect themselves and their children.        On behalf of the courageous survivors of domestic violence,       sexual assault, dating violence, stalking and human       trafficking that our organizations serve, we urge you to vote       against HR 3003 and 3004, and to affirm the intent and spirit       of VAWA by supporting strong relationships between law       enforcement and immigrant communities, which is critical for       public safety in general, and particularly essential for       domestic and sexual violence victims and their children.            Sincerely,        The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence       (www.4vawa.org).                                   ____                                                      June 26, 2017.        Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the Committee on       Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB/      COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our       opposition to H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004.        The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare       of migrants and how our nation welcomes and treats them. Our       parishes include those with and without immigration status,       unfortunately some who have witnessed or been victims of       crime in the United States, including domestic violence,       armed robbery, and assault. We understand the importance of       fostering cooperation and information-sharing between       immigrant communities and local law enforcement.        We oppose H.R. 3003 because it would impose obligations on       local governments that we fear--and that many of them have       warned--would undermine authority and discretion of local law       enforcement. This, in turn, would hamper the ability of local       law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure       public safety in all communities.        Furthermore, Section 2 of H.R. 3003 would deny to       jurisdictions vital federal funding related to law       enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and       naturalization if those jurisdictions are deemed to be non-      compliant with H.R. 3003. The Catholic service network,       including Catholic Charities, works in partnership with the       federal government on a number of Department of Justice and       Department of Homeland Security initiatives, including       disaster response and recovery, naturalization and       citizenship services, and services for the immigrant,       including victims of human trafficking, and domestic       violence. These services are incredibly valuable to the       protection and promotion of the human person and in some       instances life-saving. Cutting grants related to these       important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not       humane or just, nor is it in our national interest.        Also, we oppose H.R. 3004 as it would lead to an expansion       of incarceration and does not include adequate protections       for people who re-enter the U.S. for humanitarian reasons or       seek protection at the border. While H.R. 3004 makes notable       efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent       criminal offenses, the legislation goes far beyond this goal       by expanding the government's ability to prosecute illegal       re-entry cases and heightening the criminal penalties in       these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that       important judicial resources are efficiently utilized to       prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent       crimes. Expanding who is eligible to be prosecuted for entry       or re-entry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does       not advance the common good nor will it ensure that       communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as       introduced, H.R. 3004 would also prevent vulnerable asylum       seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented       themselves repeatedly at the U.S. border in the flight from       violence), from being able to access protection, and instead       face fines, imprisonment or both.  [[Page H5259]]         We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of       a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration       reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family       unity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs       and rights of immigrants with our nation's best interests and       security.        The United States has a long and proud history of       leadership in welcoming newcomers regardless of their       circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready       to work with you on legislation that more closely adheres to       this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of       our views in this regard.            Sincerely,      Most Rev. Joe Vasquez,        Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration.      Sr. Donna Markham, OP, PhD,        President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA.                                   ____                                                      June 27, 2017.        Dear Representative McGovern: NETWORK Lobby for Catholic       Social Justice stands in strong opposition to the ``No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law''       (H.R. 3004) to be considered this week by the House of       Representatives. We urge Congress to reject these bills. In a       country that prides itself on being the land of welcome and       opportunity, we must ensure that our immigration laws reflect       our shared values.        As Congress continues to delay comprehensive immigration       reform and a permanent solution for the nation's 11 million       undocumented immigrants, we are left with the status quo--an       enforcement-only approach that tears apart families and keeps       people in the shadows. Despite the gridlock in Congress,       localities across the country still have the responsibility       to uphold safety and peace in their communities. To fulfill       this goal, local police and residents have fostered mutual       trust to root out crime and promote public safety,       encouraging community members to cooperate with local       authorities. The ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R.       3003) does nothing to promote public safety and instead will       make communities more dangerous while striking fear in the       hearts of our immigrant families.        Likewise, ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004) would criminalize       immigrants who simply want an opportunity to succeed in the       United States, and often are simply trying to be reunited       with their family. Punishing immigrants for wanting to       provide for their families with fines and imprisonment is       harsh and cruel--we, as a nation, are called to be better       than that. Again, we ask Congress to abandon the       ``enforcement first'' policies that have been the de facto       U.S. strategy for nearly thirty years, yielding too many       costs and too few results. Our antiquated system that does       not accommodate the migration realities we face in our nation       today does not serve our national interests and does not       respect the basic human rights of migrants who come to this       nation fleeing persecution or in search of employment for       themselves and better living conditions for their children.        Pope Francis cautions that ``migrants and refugees are not       pawns on the chessboard of humanity'' and he asks political       leaders to create a new system, one that ``calls for       international cooperation and a spirit of profound solidarity       and compassion.'' This is a holy call to embrace hope over       fear. Congress should recognize the God-given humanity of all       individuals and uphold our sacred call to love our neighbor       and welcome the stranger in our midst. Any action that       further militarizes our borders, criminalizes assistance to       immigrant communities, or weakens legal protection of       refugees is neither just nor compatible with the values that       we, as Americans, strive to uphold.            Sincerely,                                       Sr. Simone Campbell, SSS,                                                 Executive Director,                         NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice.     Mr. Speaker, I, again, would simply say that if we  really want to do something about immigration, we ought to come  together, like the Senate did not long ago, and pass comprehensive  immigration reform. But, apparently, that is not in the DNA of the  current leadership of this House.   Instead, we have bills that demagogue the immigration issue, that  demean immigrants, that cause hysteria, and I find that very  unfortunate.   This bill is a bad idea. It falls in the same category as that other  bad, stupid idea of building a wall across our country.   What we ought to be doing is serious legislating, enough demagoguing,  and let's get back to doing the people's business, and that includes  comprehensive immigration reform.   Mr. Speaker, as I said, we need to fix our immigration laws. When a  mother in the Philippines has to wait 25 years or more for a visa to  reunite with her son in the United States, is that system working? No.   To lose the entire childhood and young adulthood of your son? What  mother wouldn't try to enter the United States some other way, in fact,  any way that she could in order to be with her child?   When your daughter is threatened with rape and murder if she doesn't  become a sexual slave to gang members; when your son and the entire  family is threatened with death if the boy doesn't join the gangs,  wouldn't you run away and try to find safety someplace else?   And when the family arrives at the U.S. border and they actively seek  out the U.S. Border Patrol and voluntarily surrender to them and ask  for safe refuge and asylum, is that really entering our borders  illegally?   You know, when you have been an upstanding member of the community  for 10, 15, 20 years or more in the United States, and you get pulled  over because the tags have expired on your car, or your license, do you  really deserve to be deported, to tear apart your family, to leave  behind the businesses that you have spent a lifetime creating?   And does anyone in this Chamber honestly think that if this father or  mother is deported, that they won't do everything they can to try to  come back to be with their kids?   I mean, these are real stories. It is not fiction. They are not  fantasies. It is real. And if you listened to people in your community,  you would know these stories.   If you paid attention to your local police, you would know why it is  so damaging to turn them in to ICE, because they rely on these  community members to inform them of criminal activities in their  community. The police don't want to do what you are asking them to do.  Why would you force this on them? And why would you punish them by  taking away essential Federal funding to help them protect the citizens  of this country?   This is a bad idea. I guess, maybe it is a good press release. Maybe  Steve Bannon thinks it is a good idea. Maybe it is a good sound bite  for Trump. Who knows what the rationale behind this is. But it is not  sensible. It is not thoughtful.   So if you want to get serious about these issues, you know, come  together, like the Senate did, in a bipartisan way, and come up with  comprehensive immigration reform. That is our duty. That is our job, as  Members of Congress, not this garbage. This is a waste of time. This is  an insult to the American people. We ought to be able to do better.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this. I urge them to  defeat the previous question so we can have a debate and vote on  whether or not to increase the minimum wage to $15 to give people a  raise. Again, we have to do that because this House is being so tightly  controlled that you can't get anything to the floor.   I would remind my colleagues that the underlying bill that we are  talking about here today on immigration is under a closed rule. We will  have another closed rule tomorrow. So much for democracy. So much for  deliberative process. So much for openness. There is no such thing  here. I mean, the Rules Committee has become a place where democracy  goes to die, where everything gets shut down.   We need to do better. This process stinks, and this bill is lousy. I  urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question, vote ``no''  on the rule, and if it gets to the point we have to debate this, vote  ``no'' on the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
