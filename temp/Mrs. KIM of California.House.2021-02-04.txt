 Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my  community in recognizing and celebrating the Lunar New Year.   2021 is the Year of the Ox, which represents strength, determination,  and perseverance.   We have seen this spirit in the American people during the COVID-19  pandemic. And while we have faced unprecedented challenges, we have  also shown that the American people are resilient. And I hope this  year, this new year is filled with many blessings, joy, and renewal. I  pray that this year brings success and happiness to all.   I hope to be a voice for our community to ensure that the American  Dream that I was able to achieve is available for everyone and for our  next generation. Together, I know we can make a better world.   I would like to extend a happy new year to everyone.   (English translation of the statement made in Korean, Mandarin,  Cantonese, and Vietnamese is as follows:)   ``Happy new year.''   Korean: ``saehae bok mani badeuseyo''   Mandarin: ``Xinnian kuaile''   Cantonese: ``Gong hei fat choy''   Vietnamese: ``Chuc Mung Nam Moi''
