 Mr. Speaker, Hawaii has a proud immigrant tradition, with  many of us able to trace our roots across the globe.   Few places in Hawaii exemplify our diversity more than Lahaina, where  nearly a third of the residents are foreign-born. They came from the  Philippines, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, the Marshall Islands,  Micronesia, and more. They are the backbone of Maui's economy, working  in hotels, restaurants, retail shops, and golf courses. They clean  homes and are caregivers for ``keiki,'' ``children,'' and ``kupuna,''  ``elders,'' alike.   On a day when fire did not discriminate what it took, Lahaina's  immigrant community bore more than its fair share of loss. A quarter of  the deceased had ties to the Philippines. Too many lost documents and  lifesavings.   Now, immigrants in Lahaina face impossible decisions. They are too  scared to seek out the help that they need, and they are afraid to  travel or relocate due to their legal status.   They need our help, and we have to meet them where they are through  trusted partners so they can focus on healing and rebuilding.   Four generations ago, my family immigrated to Hawaii with the same  hopes and dreams many in our Lahaina ``ohana,'' ``family,'' have. We  can't forget our roots, and we must meet this moment with the aloha  that they would have wanted.                            ____________________
