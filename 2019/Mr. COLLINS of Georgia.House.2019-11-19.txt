 Thank you, Mr. Scott, for yielding. To be  here, to hear just the accomplishments of Senator Isakson. He's one of  the people that as you go along you find in life that you have to know  him by title or you have to know him by last name, in the State of  Georgia when you say, ``Johnny,'' everybody knows who you are talking  about, especially when it comes to our politics.   And for me to rattle off everything that has already been said, it is  breathtaking what you have done and what you have accomplished from  business to career, and those are the things that are worthy of the  page in your life.   But for many of us here, just as my friends were saying earlier, the  Senator has a personal attachment to many of us, whether he realizes it  or not. For those of us who come forward in public service, you need  role models and mentors, and you hear about those who succeeded and  failed and succeeded and failed, which is something many of us have to  get used to, whether we want to or not.   For me it is watching the Senator in the times when probably he  didn't know he was being watched. There were times when I watched the  Senator, as a young person in the State House in Georgia going to a  meeting and they would recognize him and say, you know, Johnny is here,  would he like to say a few words?   And for most of us, it is struggling just to come up with a couple  words that actually sound good together, much less sentences, but  Johnny Isakson would stand up and for the next 5 minutes rattle off a  speech that you would have sworn had been honed for years, and it  touched the very soul of everybody there.                                time  1600    I was in awe. And I watched him do it so many times. He listened. In  this business, that is pretty impressive. That is why he got stuff  done.   I remember, every time I would come to him, there would be times when  I would be asking a question, and I would go along, and he would listen  and answer the question. I went away feeling better just by being with  him.   I remember when I talked to him right after he announced to us that  he was going to leave a big hole in our delegation. The first thing he  said to me when I picked up the phone, as he did almost every time,  was, ``Doug, thank you. You are doing a great job,'' even when I knew  that probably wasn't true.   When you understand, though, what it takes to lift people up, you  leave a mark. You leave a special mark.   For those of us in politics who struggled many times over the past  few years to go into groups that would call us names and not like us  even when they supposedly were on our side, I watched what he did. He  would go into those groups and sneak in the back after the meeting  started. They would see him there. They would recognize him, and he  stood and spoke. He never backed up. He never backed down. But he made  a lot of converts simply by being there.   For those of us in public service, if he showed me or showed anybody  anything, it is that being in the room, being a participant, listening  to people, and caring about them, even if we disagree with them, is the  largest step we can take to make sure that we have a union that  matters.   From me and my house, for a profession that many have taken on that  needs role models, we stand on his shoulders. He is the giant in the  room, from our perspective of watching what happens and how it happens.   When I got to Washington, DC, I knew the one thing that I wanted to  do  [[Page H9046]]  was actually pass legislation because I had heard him say one time  before: Why do we come up here if we don't get anything done?   Madam Speaker, Johnny is far beyond the policy. He went to the heart  of people, and it will be missed in this place. But it is alive now,  and we turn to him and that vision more than anything.   Of course, as Senator Isakson knows, I still represent part of Athens  and Clarke County. He is a Georgia graduate, and as we say around those  parts, ``You are a damn good Dawg.''
