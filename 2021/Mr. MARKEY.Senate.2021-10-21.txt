 Mr. President, yesterday, the U.S. Senate was once again  presented with the opportunity to protect the will and the voices of  the American people. We had a chance to protect the sanctity of our  electoral processes and to preserve our democracy. We had a chance to  extend voting rights. But yesterday, for the second time this year,  Republicans unanimously chose obstruction over debate, suppression over  representation.   All Democrats agree: The Freedom to Vote Act is commonsense  legislation. It would enhance access to the ballot for all Americans--a  right enshrined in our Constitution. It would enact badly needed  election integrity reforms and eliminate emerging threats to our  democracy. The Freedom to Vote Act would put in place key voter  protections, such as automatic voter registration, making election day  a holiday, and uniform early voting. It includes provisions that are  broadly popular with the American people: ending partisan  gerrymandering and removing special interest money from our politics.   Every single Democrat voted for this bill. Democrats are united  behind voting rights. Yesterday, we came to the floor together, ready  to start the debate.   My Republican colleagues have said that Democrats are attempting to  frame voting restrictions as voter suppression, implying that voter  suppression is some figment of our imagination, a figment of the  imagination of those across the country who are suffering from these  practices. Well, to my Republican colleagues, look around. Nineteen  States have passed 33 new laws this year that make it harder to  vote. We know that these laws disproportionately disenfranchise Black  voters, Brown voters, immigrant voters; voters like a mother in  Georgia, who can't vote because she can't take time off from the job  she works to cover the bills in the midst of a pandemic; or the poll  worker in Arizona, who was arrested--arrested--for giving a bottle of  water to a woman waiting in extreme heat to vote; or the person in  Texas, who couldn't vote because he didn't have a ride to the polls.    Stories like these are not exaggerations. They are facts, and they  are unconscionable facts. If Congress does not step up to the plate on  voting rights, then we are signaling to every person in this country  that their voice does not matter. We are telling them that we are a  country that cares about representation for some but not for all in our  country.   Ensuring voting rights is how we show, no matter a person's  background or race or hometown or economic status, that their voice can  be heard and represented. Not just the wealthy, not just big  corporations, not just White Americans--everybody in our country is  fully protected so that they can vote, so they can express that central  right in our country.   Inaction on voting rights is not an option. Voting rights are the  people's power, and the people's power is how we unlock opportunity,  representation, and justice for everyone in our Nation. Ensuring the  right to vote is how we restore faith in our democracy and how we turn  popular opinion into legislative action here on the floor of the  Senate.   This is how we take action to save our planet from the existential  threat of the climate crisis that is impacting us right now. This is  how we take action to respond to the ongoing COVID-  [[Page S7139]]  19 pandemic. This is how we take action to address racial injustice  across our country. This is how we create the future for our children  that we want to see for them.   Republican obstruction does not mean this fight is over. Next week,  the Senate will prepare for a vote on the John Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act, and here is how we can get this done: abolish the  filibuster. Abolish the filibuster. We must abolish the filibuster so  that Democrats who were elected into the majority can begin to operate  like a majority.   The filibuster is yet another Jim Crow-era relic that silences the  voices of disenfranchised people in our country, and this antiquated,  parliamentary rule is halting progress in our country.   As legislators, our job is to both listen to the people of this  country and act on what we have heard from our country. Democrats have  listened, and we are working toward action.   So, to my Republican colleagues, for the sake of your constituents, I  urge you to join us in taking action.   If they do not, then, in the face of continued obstruction, we must  abolish the filibuster and pass voting rights legislation.   The Republicans can no longer be allowed to stand behind the  filibuster--a Jim Crow-era policy, a set of rules that is used on the  floor of the Senate to actually deny progress for every single part of  our society. The time has passed. These rules are antiquated. They are  used in a discriminatory way to deliberately minimize the political  power of those who are most vulnerable, and it must end. We must  abolish the filibuster.   The message we are receiving from the Republican leadership is that  they are going to stand fast as a party, and that their political  strategy is, in fact, disenfranchisement. It is, in fact, obstructing  our ability to hear every single voice in our country.   So this is the time. This is the body that must act. We have to  change these rules. These rules do not work for everyone. We know that  this is our constitutional time.   Back when the first Constitution was being drafted, they excluded  women, and they excluded the slave population, the Black population,  from being able to vote. It was a deliberate plan that had to be  rectified. It was rectified by the suffrage movement for women, and it  was rectified by the Civil War so that former slaves would be given the  right to vote.   Well, this is our time. We see this moment for us to act on the  filibuster. In the same way that the Civil War was the impediment, it  has to be removed because we can see who is harmed if it is not.   So I call upon everyone to begin this action to repeal the filibuster  to ensure that everyone's voice is heard in our country.   I thank the Presiding Officer for this opportunity.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 5 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.
