 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to welcome Minister Jeremiah  Tatum from Cookeville, Tennessee, to our Nation's Capital.   In Congress, we begin each day thanking the Lord for His provision  [[Page H1736]]  and asking for continued guidance, protection, and wisdom. It is a  great privilege to have a fellow Tennesseean lead us in this sacred  tradition today.   Minister Tatum was born in Los Angeles County, California, and comes  from seven consecutive generations of preachers. His call to ministry  began 27 years ago, and he is currently serving his eighth year as the  pulpit minister of Willow Avenue Church of Christ in Cookeville.   In addition to local work, Minister Tatum preaches abroad and serves  overseas with foreign missions. He encourages young men to become  preachers and believes he has the best job in the world. Our community  is so grateful for his service.   He is married to Amber, and they have three children: Luke, Daniel,  and LyssaBeth. I know his family and the Willow Avenue congregation are  very proud to have him with us today, and I thank him for opening our  day in prayer.                            ____________________
