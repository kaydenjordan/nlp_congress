 Mr. President, it is time for a national investment in  building a strong and resilient educator pipeline to ensure that all  schools have the diverse, profession-ready teachers, principals,  librarians, counselors, and other specialized instructional support  personnel they need to support student development and academic  achievement. Today, along with Senator Bob Casey and Representative  Alma Adams, I am introducing the Educators for America Act to provide  the blueprint for building this pipeline.   For years, we have seen declines in enrollment in educator  preparation programs. Now in the wake of the pandemic, schools are  facing pervasive staffing shortages. An Education Week survey found 40  percent of district leaders and principals describe the shortages as  ``severe'' or ``very severe.'' The National Association of Secondary  School Principals reported that nearly 4 out of 10 principals are  expecting to leave the profession in the next 3 years.   Moreover, the gap between the demographic makeup of the student body  and the education profession is widening. Even though over 50 percent  of students are people of color and that multiple studies have shown  that racial diversity can provide significant benefits to students, a  2016 Department of Education report showed that 82 percent of public  school teachers identified as White, a figure that had barely changed  since 2000.   Simply put, we can no longer afford to neglect the educator pipeline.   The Educators for America Act calls for a $1 billion annual  investment in the educator pipeline, divided evenly between State  capacity building and direct support for educator preparation programs  and partnerships with high need school districts. It addresses the full  pipeline from early outreach and career exploration to financial  assistance and wraparound supports for those pursuing education careers  to clinical preparation for teachers, principals, and other educators  to faculty development, all with a focus on ensuring equity and  diversity.   Just as importantly, the Educators for America Act will reduce  financial barriers to pursuing careers in education. The legislation  will double the value of the TEACH grant to $8,000 per year and provide  greater flexibility for meeting the service requirements. It  establishes a new monthly credit for teachers, principals, and other  educators towards repayment on their student loans so they earn loan  forgiveness as they serve rather than watching their loan balances  stagnate or grow for 5 to 10 years before receiving any benefit.   The Educators for America Act reflects the input from stakeholders  across the education field about what is needed to recruit, prepare,  and support educators. To date, 45 organizations have endorsed it.   The Nation's outlook for the future is tied to the strength of the  education profession. Our economic prosperity, the health of our  democracy and civic society, and our ability to meet the challenges of  climate change and the information age depend on our students having  access to well-prepared and supported educators who reflect the  diversity of the students they serve.   Today, the profession is in crisis. It is time to act. I urge my  colleagues to cosponsor the Educators for America Act and work with me  to get it passed into law.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN:   S. 3368. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  submit to Congress a report on the Veterans Integration to Academic  Leadership program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
