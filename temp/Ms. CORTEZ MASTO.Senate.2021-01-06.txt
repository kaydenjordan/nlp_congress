 Mr. Vice President, I know that this room is full  of leaders of both parties who love this country, and many believe that  for America to succeed, our politics must find common ground. That has  never been clearer than today, when armed rioters stormed the U.S.  Capitol, emboldened by President Trump's false and inflammatory  rhetoric about the 2020 elections.   I believe that we, in this Chamber, have a special duty as leaders to  work together to lower the temperature of our politics, and I hope that  my colleagues, who have questioned the legitimacy of this election in  Arizona and all of these other States, now see the dire and dangerous  consequences of sowing doubt and uncertainty.   I also know that, as U.S. Senators, we all take solemnly the oath we  swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States  against all enemies, foreign and domestic. At this moment in history, I  can think of nothing more patriotic than renewing our faith in the  Charters of Freedom that our Founding Fathers crafted for our Republic,  starting with the fundamental American principle in our Declaration of  Independence that governments derive their just powers from the consent  of the governed.   The people have spoken in this election, and our only job here today  is to do what they ask. It is not to argue election security. That is  not the place for what we are doing today.   Our Constitution specifically reserves to the people the right to  meet in their respective States and vote for the President and Vice  President. As a result, individual States oversee and implement the  election process, not the Federal Government.   To guard against fraud or irregularities in the voting process, the  States are required to have robust election security measures.  Likewise, State legislatures have the opportunity to examine evidence  of voter fraud before they certify their electoral college votes. And  our courts--from district courts to the United States Supreme Court-- adjudicate legal challenges and election disputes. All of those things  happened after the 2020 election.   Statehouses and courts across the country took allegations of voter  fraud seriously and followed the constitutional process to hear  challenges to this year's election. No State found evidence of any  widespread voter fraud and neither did any court ask to review the  State's findings.   In Arizona, Republican Governor Doug Ducey; the Democratic secretary  of state, Katie Hobbs; the Republican attorney general, Mark Brnovich;  and the State supreme court chief justice, Robert Brutinel all  certified the results of the election on November 30.   And we know--we have heard--Arizonans have been voting by mail for  almost 30 years, and Governor Ducey has expressed confidence in the  State's process numerous times. In November, he said:         We do elections well here in Arizona. The system is strong,       and that is why I have bragged on it so much.    He further stated:         We have some of the strongest election laws in the country,       laws that prioritize accountability and clearly lay out our       procedures for conducting, canvassing and even contesting the       results.    And they are right. Arizona has one of the most transparent election  processes in the country with built-in accountability, starting with  the internal auditing.   We have heard unfounded allegations that voting machines in Arizona  and elsewhere somehow changed vote tallies or somehow improperly  rejected ballots while claiming to accept them. These allegations all  ignore the fact that Arizona counties conducted ballot audits by hand  to double-check the machine counts, and these audits found no  widespread fraud or irregularities.   Maricopa County, the county where more than 60 percent of the State's  population resides, conducted a postelection hand count audit in the  week after the election, which showed perfect, 100 percent, accuracy in  the machine tabulations. So why would we need, my colleagues, to call  for a 10-day emergency audit to be conducted by a legislative  commission when it has already been done by the State of Arizona? What  happened to State's rights?   The audit involved checking ballots for the Presidential election but  also ballots for Federal and State legislative elections. The audit  report shows every precinct's machine and hand count totals for each of  the races audited, and for every single race in every precinct, the  difference between the hand count and the machine count was zero.  Maricopa's audit report stated: No discrepancies were found by the hand  count audit boards.   Seeking to find any reason to contest these results, some of the  State Republicans then tried to claim that Maricopa County failed to  follow State law in conducting this audit by selecting voting center  locations to audit instead of voting precincts. This was  [[Page S20]]  wrong. And this, too, went to a court. In rejecting this claim, the  State court in Arizona found that the county followed the properly  issued guidance on hand audit procedures from the Arizona Secretary of  State. And the court found that Maricopa County officials, therefore,  could not lawfully have performed the hand count audit the way the  plaintiffs wanted it done. If they had done so, they would have exposed  themselves to criminal punishment   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.    Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I would close by  just saying, please, my colleagues, do not disenfranchise the voters of  Arizona and certify their votes tonight.   Thank you.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.
