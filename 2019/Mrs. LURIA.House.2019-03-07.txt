 Mr. Speaker, I am a Jewish American woman who served for  20 years in uniform and continue to serve in the United States  Congress.   At the age of 17, when I entered the United States Naval Academy, I  first took the oath to support and defend the Constitution against all  enemies, foreign and domestic. I subsequently repeated that oath six  times at every promotion in rank and, most recently, when I had the  honor to become a Member of Congress.   Is that not enough to prove my loyalty to our Nation?   I deployed six times, serving in six ships in the Middle East and  Western Pacific, working under challenging conditions while operating  complex weapons systems, overseeing nuclear reactors, driving ships,  and, ultimately, commanding a combat-ready unit of 400 sailors.   Is that not enough to prove my loyalty to our Nation?   In the first 3 years my husband and I were married, we spent almost 2  years apart so that we could both serve at sea and deploy three times.   Is that not enough to prove my loyalty to our Nation?    Mr. Speaker, am I to look back on my military career and  the sacrifices it meant for my family and remain silent in the face of  people questioning my loyalty to my country?   I believe that I speak clearly for all fellow Jewish veterans that  this echoes of language that has been used to marginalize and persecute  the Jewish people for centuries.   The recent accusations of dual loyalty call into question the equal  footing of Jewish Members in elected office and, by extension, all Jews  living in America.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to vote on this resolution in condemnation of  this rhetoric.
