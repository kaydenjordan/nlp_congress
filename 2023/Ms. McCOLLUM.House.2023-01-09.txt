 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition of H.R. 23, the  Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act.   Hard-working families pay 99 percent of the taxes they owe, while the  uber wealthy, the 1 percent, has the ability to hide more than 20  percent of their income from the IRS each year. Tonight, the first bill  I will vote on is designed to help the 1 percent avoid paying their  fair share. House Republicans are protecting sophisticated tax cheats  and greedy corporations, and they do so under the guise of cutting the  budget of the Internal Revenue Service.   My office has been working with many families who have experienced  financial hardship while waiting months for the IRS to process their  tax refunds--which are often thousands of dollars. Why? Because the  agency has less auditors than in 1954 and tax returns are processed on  computer systems designed more than 40 years ago. This is a direct  result of years of attacks and budget cuts by Republicans in Congress  and the Trump administration.   Last year, Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act which  includes investments to replace retiring taxpayer service workers and  update aging technology to increase efficiencies so hardworking  taxpayers can receive prompt refunds and service.   Republicans should be helping the Americans waiting on hold for hours  to get their tax refunds instead of making it easier for tax cheats to  skip out on paying their fair share.
