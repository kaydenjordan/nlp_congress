 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  New Hanover County Commissioner Deb Hays.   All who knew Deb knew her steadfast devotion to her family, her  faith, and to her community. Born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky,  she later made Wilmington, North Carolina, home, where she was a pillar  in the community and her pride for New Hanover County was unmatched.   As a New Hanover County commissioner, Deb served with the utmost  integrity and honor. She loved nothing more than giving back to the  citizens of Wilmington and New Hanover County and was continually  improving the lives of those around her in every way. She was proud to  serve as the chair of the Wilmington Planning Commission and as a  member of the Wilmington Comprehensive Plan Steering Committee.   Beyond Deb's work and influence as a county commissioner, she was  involved in multiple charities and community organizations, including  the Airlie Gardens Foundation, the North Carolina Azalea Festival, the  Wilmington Airport Authority, the Community Leaders Task Force, Lump to  Laughter, Habitat for Humanity, and the Wilmington Area Rebuilding  Ministry.   Now, some of her greatest charitable accomplishments include building  more than 20 Habitat for Humanity homes, as well as 10 homes in  Guatemala while on a mission trip, participating in the rebuilding of  post-hurricane New Orleans, and helping to rebuild our own communities  in southeastern North Carolina after Hurricane Florence hit.   Deb also enjoyed a very rewarding and successful career as a Realtor  and will be forever loved and missed by her Intracoastal Realty family.   Now, I have no doubt Deb's spirit and love for our community will be  felt for many years to come. She was a fierce and gracious force for  good, always bringing so much enthusiasm and love for every facet of  life. The lives that have been and will continue to be impacted by her  legacy are countless. Hers truly was a great life lived.              Honoring the Life and Legacy of Donna Lee Giradot     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Donna Giradot. Donna was a fixture in the Wilmington community and will  be remembered as a talented business leader, dedicated public servant,  and a great friend and mentor to so many.   After moving to the Wilmington area in the late 1990s, Donna led a  successful career and served New Hanover County in many different  capacities. She began her career in southeastern North Carolina by  working for Cape Fear Realtors. She then went on to serve as executive  director of the Wilmington-Cape Fear Home Builders Association and  founded the Business Alliance for a Sound Economy, also known as BASE.   Beyond her successful business endeavors, Donna held numerous  leadership positions in our community, including four terms as chair of  the New Hanover County Planning Board and four consecutive years as  chair of the Wilmington International Airport Authority, making her the  first female to chair an airport authority in North Carolina.   Donna always stood firm in her faith and enjoyed serving her fellow  man through her church, as well. As a testament to her commitment to  serving others, in 2020 Donna was a recipient of the Order of the Long  Leaf Pine award, the State's highest civilian award for service.   Donna was a generous and great leader who will be sorely missed. Her  numerous contributions to the Wilmington community will never, ever be  forgotten. Hers is a tremendous legacy that will be felt for many years  to come.                            ____________________
