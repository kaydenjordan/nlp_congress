 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize those in  Bucks and Montgomery Counties who serve in emergency medical services.  Just recently, we celebrated National EMS Week, a time to honor the  contributions and service of emergency medical technicians.   All too often, the service of EMTs goes unnoticed, despite the risks  of their profession and the lifesaving actions they perform. Late last  month, the Penndel-Middletown Emergency Squad hosted an event with  local officials to celebrate National EMS Week and to discuss the  current issues faced in our community.   As an EMT myself, I can say, without a doubt, that this profession  truly embodies public service, and I thank all EMTs in Bucks and  Montgomery Counties for their dedicated service to saving lives. I  would especially like to extend my gratitude to Dr. Gerald Wydro, the  medical director of Penndel-Middletown Emergency Squad, and to the  Penndel-Middletown Emergency Squad Chief, Andrew Foley, for their  leadership.                       Ninth Annual Ride for the Heroes     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Central Bucks  Rotary Club, who will host its Ninth Annual Ride for the Heroes, where  motorcyclists from across Bucks County ride from Lower Makefield to  Bedminster Township to raise money for local veterans' organizations.   Organized by Rotary member Mark Glidden, this event has grown from  200 bikers in its initial year to anywhere from 500 to 700  participants, yearly. Originally intended to provide financial  assistance to nonprofits in the community, Ride for the Heroes became  focused on helping military families at the inspiration of the Travis  Manion Foundation in Doylestown.   Founded by retired Lieutenant Colonel Tom Manion and his late wife,  Janet, in honor of their son, the Travis Manion Foundation's mission is  to ``empower veterans and families of fallen heroes to develop  character in future generations.''   In doing this, the Travis Manion Foundation seeks engagement between  veterans and families of fallen soldiers with the local community. The  foundation brings young people together with veterans so that they  can learn our Nation's values from heroes who have put those values  into action in the United States military.    I applaud the vision of the Travis Manion Foundation and appreciate  the work of the Central Bucks Rotary Club and those who will ride for  those who served.          Recognizing Students of the Souderton Area School District     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a group of students  in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, who recently collected 2,150 pounds  of food, paper products, and personal care items for those in need.   The Souderton Area School District, comprised of nearly 6,500  students, recently held its annual food drive and quarter collection.  This event collects items for the Keystone Opportunity Center, also in  Souderton, which operates a homeless shelter and offers literary  education classes in Montgomery and Bucks Counties.   To diversify the goods donated, each school was assigned a certain  item to donate, from peanut butter and jelly at Indian Crest Middle  School to detergent and soap at Oak Ridge Elementary School.  Additionally, Salford Hills and Vernfield Elementary Schools  thoughtfully donated crops from their community gardens to the Keystone  food pantry.   I would like to commend these students, along with their teachers and  parents, for teaching them the virtues of charity and generosity. I  would also like to thank the staff and volunteers at Keystone  Opportunity Center for their service, especially President Arlene Daily  for her outstanding leadership.                            ____________________
