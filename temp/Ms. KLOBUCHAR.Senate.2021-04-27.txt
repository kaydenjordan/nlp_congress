 Madam President, I rise today to discuss the COVID-19  Hate Crimes Act. I was a cosponsor of this bill, which was introduced  by Senator Hirono and passed the Senate on April 22, 2021, by a vote of  94 to 1. I was in Minnesota to attend the memorial service for Daunte  Wright when the bill came up for a vote, but I would have voted in  favor of the bill had I been present.   I have been alarmed by the sharp increase in hate crimes against  members of the Asian-American Pacific Islander, AAPI, community during  the pandemic. According to Stop AAPI Hate, there have been  approximately 3,800 incidents of anti-Asian bias across the country in  the last year, and that number only includes what has been reported. As  we saw with the recent mass shooting in Georgia, in which six of the  eight victims were women of Asian descent, these crimes are horrifying  and heartbreaking.   I have also talked to constituents in my State who have experienced  verbal attacks, physical abuse, and threats to their businesses simply  because they are members of the AAPI community. What they have endured  is not right. These are hate crimes, and it is time for us to stand  together, to denounce hate, and take action.   When I first arrived at the Senate, I worked hard to pass the Matthew  Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. As a prosecutor,  I was at the White House when President Bill Clinton introduced the  bill, and 9 years later, I got to cast one of the deciding votes to  make the bill a reality. Since then I have worked with Senator  Murkowski to introduce the bipartisan Justice for Victims of Hate  Crimes Act, which will help to ensure that Federal prosecutors can  effectively enforce the Federal hate crimes law. After places of  worship were targets of violence in my State, I joined my colleagues in  cosponsoring legislation to strengthen protections for religious  institutions that was signed into law in September 2018.   The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act will ensure that the Department of  Justice invests the resources needed to fully investigate pandemic- related hate crimes against Asian Americans and will support local law  enforcement to report and respond to hate crimes. While there is more  we must do to root out hate and bias in our country, this bill is an  important step forward, and I am grateful to Senator Hirono for her  work in leading this legislation.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I rise to honor and pay  tribute to Dave Lee, a radio host and Minnesota legend who is retiring  after 32 years at WCCO radio on April 30, 2021.   Hailing from Hatton, ND, Dave did not always know he would be a radio  personality. He spent his summers in high school throwing hay bales,  picking potatoes, and hoeing beets. When a friend recommended he  audition for KRAD, a local radio station in East Grand Forks, Dave was  just hoping to earn a little extra money for college, but the station  saw a spark in him and offered him 9-hour country music shift. From  there, he volunteered to help out with sports coverage, and when he  graduated college, he stayed at the station. As he puts it, ``When you  are passionate about something, it never feels like you are going to  work.''   That is how Dave's voice was introduced to the airwaves, and after  years at KRAD in East Grand Forks and KFGO in Fargo, he became a  weekend host of News Talk 830 on WCCO. He didn't know at the time, but  WCCO would be his home for the next 32 years. Dave went on to join the  legendary Roger Erickson as cohost of the morning drive and then took  on solo duties when Roger retired in 1997.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S2222, April 27, 2021, the following appears: KFYO in  Fargo      The online Record has been corrected to read: KFGO in Fargo    ========================= END NOTE =========================      For many Minnesotans, Dave's voice was as much a part of their  morning as their cup of coffee. Commuters counted on him for traffic  updates, students looked to him for snow day announcements, and we all  knew we could rely on him for honest news reporting and engaging  interviews. Over the course of his career, he interviewed an impressive  roster of personalities, from Boston Celtics legend Bill Russell, to  baseball pitcher Nolan Ryan, to actress Julie Andrews. He also had  countless incredible interviews with elected officials Democrats and  Republicans alike.   Some conversations were serious, talking about the policy fight or  issue of the day, but sometimes his interviews were just plain fun. I  still have great memories of joining him at the WCCO booth at the  Minnesota State Fair and ``Minnesota Hospital'' soap opera spoof skit,  where I was given the role of Nurse Helen and Sid Hartman played the  infamous ``Dr. Kidney Hartman.''   For years, we have also been treated to Dave's sports coverage. He  did the play-by-play for the Minnesota Gophers for a decade and  occasionally filled in as announcer for the Minnesota Twins. He brought  his running commentary to the television broadcasts of the Minnesota  State High School Boys and Girls Basketball Tournaments and covered  University of St. Thomas football games on WCCO.   His joyful and informative commentary made him a six-time winner of  Minnesota's Sportscaster of the Year, and he earned three Emmy Awards  for his reporting on television. He is also a recipient of the Edward  R. Murrow Award, several awards from the Associated Press, and a  nomination for the National Association of Broadcasters' Marconi Radio  Award.   To so many Minnesotans, Dave was a titan of Minnesota radio,  providing information and entertainment with his signature warm  demeanor. And it was with that same kind spirit that Dave did so much  to give back, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the  University of Minnesota Children's Hospital. After all Dave has done  for our community, I have to admit, he deserves the chance to start  sleeping in.   Dave, even though I will miss having you on the airwaves, I know that  this is not goodbye, and I wish you all my best.                            ____________________
