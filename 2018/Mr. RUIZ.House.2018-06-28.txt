 Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 49th anniversary of the  Stonewall riots in New York City, where, on June 28, 1969, a group of  bar patrons led by transgender women of color began to fight for LGBTQ  equality.   Over nearly 50 years, the LGBTQ community has celebrated many  historic victories. In fact, just yesterday, we celebrated the third  anniversary of marriage equality becoming the law of the land  nationwide.   However, while we celebrate LGBTQ Pride Month, it is important to  remember we still have a long way to go. In most States, LGBTQ  individuals can still get kicked out of their housing, be refused  service from restaurants and other businesses, or lose their jobs  simply for being who they are.   The Equality Act would end this injustice by extending civil rights  protections to LGBTQ individuals nationwide. I am a proud sponsor of  the Equality Act and urge Speaker Ryan to bring this commonsense bill  to the House floor for a vote                            ____________________
