 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, my Democratic colleagues say wealthy  Americans should pay their fair share. Yet they want to expand the  electric vehicle tax credit for the rich once again.   In this bill, there are two separate EV tax credits: one for people  who want to buy new $80,000 vehicles and one for those who want to buy  used EVs.   Why two separate credits? The tax credit for new EVs is available to  the wealthy, while the credit for the new EVs is limited to the folks  with lower incomes. Why do my colleagues from the other side keep  giving bigger tax breaks to their rich donors?   My change would at least prevent taxpayer dollars from subsidizing  the wealthy.   I yield the floor.
