 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm  on an urgent situation that requires the Federal Government to deploy  an emergency response.   A retired U.S. Navy vessel at the Buffalo and Erie County Naval and  Military Park is sinking. Without help, the USS The Sullivans, which  was part of an elite class of World War II destroyers and is a national  historic landmark, will be lost forever.   The visual of a partially submerged ship in Buffalo's harbor provides  a vivid warning that irreplaceable military history is in jeopardy if  we don't act.   This isn't the only vessel in need of support. Maritime heritage  grants, national preservation programs, and the Department of Defense  are potential  [[Page H4519]]  sources of funding to help these vessels.   Dedicated sailors operated these vessels to defend our Nation. It is  our turn to protect their stories and the lessons they provide to  future generations. We, as a Nation, cannot abandon them or these  ships.                            ____________________
