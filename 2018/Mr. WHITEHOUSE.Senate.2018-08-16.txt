 Mr. President, because the time between now and 11:30  is to be shared between me and the ranking member on the Finance  Committee, Senator Wyden, I ask unanimous consent that when Senator  Wyden appears, I yield the floor to him; that at the conclusion of his  remarks, I be recognized to conclude my remarks; and that in the  Record, my remarks be consolidated after Senator Wyden's remarks.    Mr. President, it is terrific to be joined here today  by my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, to address some of the  devastating effects of a changing global climate from the shores of  Rhode Island and our beautiful Narragansett Bay to the forests of  southern Oregon.   Rhode Island is looking at losing significant territory to storms and  sea level rise. Oregon is seeing ancient forests go up in smoke. For  most of the country, this summer has been a scorcher. July was nearly 2  degrees Fahrenheit above average, and, before that, the contiguous  United States experienced its hottest May and third hottest June on  record.   It is oceans too. Just last week, the Rhode Island organization Save  the Bay recorded ocean surface temperatures in Little Narragansett Bay,  off the coast of Westerly, RI, at nearly 80 degrees Fahrenheit--the  highest in over a decade of data and, perhaps, the highest ever in  Rhode Island's history.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently released  its report ``State of the Climate in 2017.'' The 500 scientists from 65  countries who contributed to this peer-reviewed report, which was  published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society,  reported ominous records broken: the concentration of carbon dioxide in  our atmosphere, a new high; heat in the upper ocean, a new high; sea  level rise, a new high; sea ice coverage in the Arctic and in  Antarctica, both new all-time lows and all headed in the wrong  direction.   Out West, the NOAA report called out 2017 as an extreme western  wildfire season that burned over 4 million hectares. The total costs of  $18 billion tripled the previous U.S. annual wildfire cost record set  in 1991.   Right now, in the summer of 2018, blazing temperatures and drought  conditions have contributed to wildfire outbreaks worldwide in the  U.S., Canada, Australia, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The  raging Mendocino Complex fire recently became the largest wildfire in  the history of the State of California, the previous record being last  year's Thomas fire.   Mr. President, I again want to thank the distinguished ranking member  on the Finance Committee, and I salute his years of passion on  environmental issues and in the defense of his State, which is now  suffering so many fires.   We actually have an answer to the question that Senator Wyden  proposed rather rhetorically--why this is happening out in the  Mendocino fires, for instance. The assistant deputy director of Cal  Fire, Daniel Berlant, who is at the state department of forestry and  fire protection, has said this: ``Let's be clear: It's our changing  climate that is leading to more severe and destructive fires.''   Climate change has doubled the area consumed by forest fires since  1984. According to a report by Climate Central, ``[c]ompared to the  1970s, the annual average western U.S. wildfire season is now 105 days  longer, has three times as many large fires (larger than 1,000 acres)  and sees more than six times as many acres burned.''   Not only are these fires becoming larger, they are becoming more  dangerous. They burn hotter and more intensely. They spread more  rapidly and shift unpredictably, putting firefighters at risk.   A 2015 study in The Solutions Journal found that, as compared to  1990, fires are now larger, three times as many homes are burning, and  around twice as many brave firefighters are losing their lives.   The Federal Government's ``Climate Science Special Report,'' released  late last year, warned that years without large fires in the western  United States will become what they called ``extremely rare.'' Years  without these large fires will become ``extremely rare.''   The Environmental Protection Agency warns that unless we curb our  greenhouse gas emissions, ``climate change is projected to dramatically  increase the area burned by wildfires across most of the contiguous  U.S.'' The Agency estimates for the western United States a more than  40-percent increase in the area burned by wildfires by 2100, and the  amount of land in the Southwest burned each year by fires, including  Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, could go up by as much as 140 percent.   These more frequent and more ferocious wildfires are leaving  permanent scars on America's landscape. Ordinarily, wildfires are part  of the natural lifecycle of a healthy forest, but, as Senator Wyden  said, these are not our grandfather's wildfires. The intensity,  frequency, and scale of the infernos we are now seeing reflect nature  out of whack. Instead of clearing dead trees and groundcover to make  room for healthy trees and rebirth of plant life, these superstrong  wildfires are simply destroying these ecosystems.   The National Wildlife Federation's 2017 report, ominously titled  ``Megafires,'' says: ``If hot enough, extreme fires can even sterilize  the soil by killing subsurface seed banks that normally aid in post- fire recovery.'' Some native environments are permanently lost to  charred landscapes and invasive species.   A 2017 study reported in the journal Science found that ``thanks to  climate change, areas ravaged by wildfires may never recover, wiping  out entire ecological communities forever.'' This review of areas  ravaged by wildfires showed that ``the proportion of sites with no  regrowth almost doubled after 2000`` as compared to the 1980s or 1990s.   Of course, the consequences of these fires to human life are dire.  Fourteen people died in last year's wildfires in California,  Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah.   The risk doesn't end with the flames. After last year's devastating  fire in California, when rain finally returned to the area, but without  trees and other plants to hold the soil in place, the downpours  unleashed torrents of mud, rocks, and debris, killing more than 20  people. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 25 to 30 people  die each year in postfire floods and mudslides.   As Senator Wyden mentioned, air pollution is another consequence of  these wildfires, and it can spread far  [[Page S5679]]  beyond the burned-out site of the fire. Hundreds of miles downwind, air  can become unhealthy and even hazardous.   I remember visiting Saskatchewan with Senator Graham and seeing skies  there clouded from Oregon's fires. Last month, air in the northwest  took the title of ``worst in the nation''--not what they were looking  for--with officials recommending that residents wear masks when  venturing outdoors. Children, pregnant women, and people with breathing  difficulties were told to actually leave town, to leave the area.    Wildfires unleash an especially harmful air pollutant: tiny particles  less than 2.5 microns in diameter. For comparison, an average human  hair is around 70 microns wide. So we are talking about very small  particles circulating in the air. Because they are so small, they are  easily inhaled and can lodge deep in the lungs and even enter the human  bloodstream. Exposure to them has been associated with asthma, heart  attack, stroke, and some cancers. Emerging research even links this  nasty pollutant to premature births.   A researcher at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder,  CO, told Science magazine that wildfire smoke is ``one of the largest  problems facing air quality and climate issues going forward.''  According to a 2016 study in the journal Climatic Change, wildfires  were to blame for more than two-thirds of the bad-air days in the  western U.S., with unhealthy levels of particulate matter.   Smoke and pollution from western wildfires get picked up by the jet  stream and can be carried 3,000 miles across the United States, all the  way to our east coast, contaminating air throughout the country with  noxious particulate matter, methanol, benzene, ozone, and other toxins.   This image shows the plume of smoke from west coast fires over here  spilling across the country last September. NASA reports that when  airborne contaminants are drawn down to ground level, as happened in  Iowa last summer, wildfires can trigger air quality warnings hundreds,  even thousands, of miles away.   The scourge of these wildfires in Senator Wyden's home State and  throughout the West is one of the most dangerous symptoms of carbon  pollution and climate change. His Oregon constituents see this  devastation firsthand. Senator Wyden has helped to rush additional  resources to Federal firefighting agencies to step up the response to  these exploding wildfires. I thank him for joining me here today as we  implore our colleagues to recognize what is going on.   If you don't believe me, simply go to your own home State  universities and ask them. Whether it is Alaska's, Texas's, Oklahoma's,  Rhode Island's, or Oregon's universities, they will tell you. This is  stuff that is so clear that it is taught in your home State  universities. Yet here in the Senate, we continue to indulge the  pretense that we don't know what is going on. Well, it is climate  change, plain and simple, as we careen toward what could be an  irreversible shift in our climate, changing our Earth into what one  recent report called a ``hothouse.'' Yet here we are, the great  Congress of the United States, stuck in dirty fossil fuel politics,  fiddling under the Capitol dome while the western United States burns.   I thank my distinguished friend from the great State of Oregon for  joining me here today.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
