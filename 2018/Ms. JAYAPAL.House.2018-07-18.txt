 Mr. Speaker, this is what it takes to have a debate on  the floor about family separation.   It is outrageous that my Republican colleagues are playing pure  politics with a resolution that does absolutely nothing to address the  most pressing crisis before us, which is the separation of 3,000  children from their parents. It is about putting kids in cages and  parents in prison who are seeking asylum.   Mr. Speaker, in spite of court orders, this administration still has  yet to reunite these children with their families, and I will tell you  that these are parents who even have been denied the opportunity to  speak to their kids for more than 10 minutes twice a week.   Mr. Speaker, this bill does nothing to prevent President Trump from  again ordering enforcement agents to rip breastfeeding babies from  their mothers' arms. This isn't just rhetoric. This happened numerous  times under Trump's zero-tolerance, zero-humanity policy.    In one case, for instance, an asylum seeker from Honduras reported  that Federal agents took her daughter from her while she was  breastfeeding in a Texas detention center. When she resisted, as any  mother would--because I am a mother, I can say that, from the bottom of  my heart--this mother was handcuffed, handcuffed for wanting to feed  her baby.   Stripping babies from the arms of their mothers is cruel and  inhumane, and this body should be debating that policy, should be  fixing that policy, instead of putting forward a ridiculous, do- nothing, political resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to put their attention  on real issues, instead of continuing to play games with children's  lives.
