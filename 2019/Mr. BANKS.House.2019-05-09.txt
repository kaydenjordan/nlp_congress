 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of volunteer  firefighter Mitch Titus.   Over 15 years ago, Chief Titus took the helm as chief of the Winona  Lake Fire Department. While he worked a full-time job in excavation, he  was also a very dedicated public servant.   In the wake of his tragic passing on Sunday, Chief Titus has been  described by fellow colleagues and friends as ``very dedicated and  loyal,'' ``a fireman's firefighter,'' and ``a great guy, a great  leader, a great fire leader.'' It is people like Mitch Titus who embody  the very best that our Nation has to offer.   While all of Kosciusko County and the rest of Indiana mourn his loss,  his endless dedication to his county and to his fellow people will be  remembered for many years to come.   I offer my deepest condolences to his three children and his family  and friends as we mourn the loss of Chief Titus.                            ____________________
