 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each  month, I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor City Limits Brew Pub in Wallace as the  Idaho Small Business of the Month for October 2021.   Nestled in the beautiful north Idaho town of Wallace, City Limits is  a restaurant and brewery known for its extensive selection of beer,  food, and amenities. For years, founder and current brewmaster Mark  Burmeister brewed beer as a hobby while working in the oil industry.  After retiring, he continued working and set out to establish his own  beer brewing business. In 2008, he obtained a brewery license and  opened a microbrewery in his garage. Equipped with a 10-gallon brewing  system, he crafted an assortment of micro brews and distributed them to  local businesses and taps. People loved the microbrews, and demand  soared.   With growing sales and the need to expand, a group of partners joined  in and purchased a new building and an adjacent RV park in Wallace in  2010. Led by partner Don Hoffman, the group remodeled the building and  opened the business under its new name, City Limits Pub. They installed  a new 217-gallon brewing system along with a new bathroom facility and  log cabins to the RV site. The business formally changed its name to  City Limits Brew Pub in 2015 and has become a thriving restaurant, pub,  and attraction for thousands of locals and visitors every year.   City Limits Brew Pub is beloved in the Silver Valley. The business  provides tours of the brewery, provides local drinks, and serves  family-friendly food options for guests. City Limits is also heavily  involved in the Wallace community. The business hosts several community  events like its Oktoberfest celebration and its biennial Welcome Back  to Summer Town BBQ, where local businesses showcase their upcoming  summer events. City Limits also supports local community causes and has  contributed to several charities over the years. The small business  looks forward to continuing to serve guests and the community well into  the future.
