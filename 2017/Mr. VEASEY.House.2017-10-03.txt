 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Garamendi) for yielding. He has done a great job of really making  Congress aware and the American public aware of just how important the  Jones Act is to our country.   There have been a lot of misconceptions out there, a lot of reports  on the news that were just quick to pick up on a sound bite. But the  fact of the matter is, when you talk about trade, when you talk about  taxes, labor, and other things that you have added, national security,  it is the Jones Act that is keeping all of those things going strong in  America. I just really appreciate the gentleman doing that.   When we talk about middle class jobs in this country, there has been  a lot of talk in this country about how we have lost a lot of middle  class jobs over the last 20 years.                                time  1845    These jobs, because of the Jones Act, have been protected, and we  need to make sure that we keep those jobs here in America going strong.   I am so glad that the gentleman also cleared up the confusion about  what was really going on in relation to Puerto Rico, that American  ships were doing what they were supposed to be doing, and that there  were other issues on why people weren't getting supplies. The American  public needs to know that.   When the gentleman starts talking about minimum wage, middle class  wages, obviously, the Merchant Marines, the mariners out there who work  on these cargo and container ships, help keep that middle class strong  in America.   One of the reasons why they are able to do that is because many of  those jobs related to the Jones Act, as the gentleman knows, are union  jobs. The people who run those unions work very hard to make sure  people have good wages and that they have good benefits so they can  take care of their families and be able to send them to college.   As the gentleman knows, I have talked with the gentleman before, and  he heard Representative Boyle earlier, who is also the co-chair of the  Blue Collar Caucus, talk about how important these issues are to us,  and I know as well as Mr. Garamendi and everyone else within our  caucus.   I just want to point this out very briefly. According to the Center  for Economic and Policy Research, unionized workers are compared to  their nonunionized counterparts in showing that their wages are 14  percent higher on average. Again, if you have jobs that are paying 14  percent higher on average, we need to protect those jobs because we  want people to have more spending power to be able to make our economy  strong and great, not less spending power.   The union wage premium is even larger for some demographic groups  that, on average, receive lower pay, including workers of color and  those without a college education. According  [[Page H7734]]  to the Center for American Progress Action Fund, unions increase  workers' benefits really substantially. Ninety-four percent of union  workers have access to retirement benefits while only 65 percent of  nonunion workers do.   As the gentleman knows, we discuss Social Security in this Chamber  quite often, and how we are going into our retirement years and whether  or not we are going to be able to take care of ourselves when we are no  longer able to perform certain physical functions is obviously  something that is very important.   Union workers are 28 percent more likely to have health insurance and  pay a lower share of premiums for it. They are also 54 percent more  likely to have a retirement plan than nonunion workers at workplaces.  Union women in the United States are more likely to take parental  leave, which is also more likely to be paid.   Again, whether it is the Jones Act or Davis-Bacon, we need to make  sure that in this country we keep these jobs going strong and that we  keep the conversation going in that direction.   Again, I just want to thank the gentleman for the work that he has  done to raise awareness on this issue. We need to continue to talk  about this just so the American public understands just how important  this is to our economy and to our society as we continue to grow our  workforce into the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for yielding.
