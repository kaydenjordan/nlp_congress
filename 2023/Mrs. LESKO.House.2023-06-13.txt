 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 1640.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my bill, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act.  I never would have thought that I would need to introduce legislation  to protect Americans' kitchen appliances, but this only goes to show  how out of touch this administration's policies have become.   In February, the Department of Energy proposed an extreme regulation  that would effectively eliminate nearly all gas stoves and gas cooktops  on the market today.   The Department's proposed rule sets requirements for gas stoves at  the maximum technologically feasible, or max-tech level. Based on the  Department of Energy's own analysis and DOE's own technology support  report, 96 percent of the market share of gas stoves will not, I  repeat, not meet DOE's new proposed rule. That is a 96 percent ban.   Worse yet, no gas ranges passed DOE's new proposed rule tests. Gas  ranges represent nearly 90 percent of all gas stoves sold.   What did DOE do after the public heard about this and pushed back?  They adjusted their analysis, seemingly out of thin air. Now, they  claim that nearly 50 percent of gas stoves will pass their rule. Guess  what? That means more than 50 percent won't. Don't tell me they are not  trying to ban gas stoves.   The DOE is justifying this proposed requirement under the false guise  of saving Americans money. However, the estimated savings is just  $21.89 over the next 14\1/2\ years. That is only $1.50 per year or 12  cents per month.   Consumers don't want to give up the features of the stoves they like  for 12 cents per month. Consumers don't want to wait an extra 7 minutes  to watch a pot of water boil for 12 cents per month.   Instead of DOE bragging about how they are going to save consumers 12  cents per month, maybe they should tell the public that natural gas is  3\1/2\ times cheaper than electricity and that, according to studies,  households that use natural gas for heating, cooking, and drying  clothes save an average of $1,068 per year.   Consumers don't want the government taking away the features on gas  stoves that they like and use. That is not the role of the U.S.  Government. That is why I introduced the Save Our Gas Stoves Act to  protect Americans' consumer choice.   My legislation prohibits the Department of Energy from implementing  this extreme rule and prohibits the Department of Energy from imposing  standards that result in the unavailability of a product based on the  type of fuel the product consumes.   Mr. Chair, I thank the American Association of Homebuilders; the  American Restaurant Association; the American Gas Association; the  Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers; the Arizona Restaurant  Association; the American Public Gas Association; the National Propane  Gas Association; and several energy companies, including Southwest Gas,  which delivers natural gas to consumers in Arizona, for their support  of my bill and for their support for American consumer choice.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased that this is a bipartisan bill that has  received bipartisan support and that my Republican colleagues and 29 of  my Democratic colleagues already voted in favor of an amendment to H.R.  1 that did virtually the same thing as this bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my bill. I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of consumer  [[Page H2857]]  choice. I urge my colleagues to vote to save our gas stoves.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, respectfully, my Democratic colleague, Mr.  Pallone, said: We are not banning gas stoves.   Yet, the Department of Energy studied this for many years, and in  their own analysis, their own book, and their own standards called the  technical support document in table 1032, it says that only 4 percent  of the gas cooktops that they have tested will meet the qualifications.  That is 96 percent that will not. It says that is 4 percent of market  share, meaning 96 percent won't.   Even if it is true, which I don't think it is, where Mr. Pallone says  that now 50 percent already qualify, that means 50 percent don't. To  me, that is at least a 50 percent ban.   Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chair, I agree with my Democratic colleague, we  should be talking about the issues that are important to Americans  today, like securing our border, lowering our crime rates, lowering the  cost of living.   We have crisis after crisis in our country, and you know what the  Department of Energy does under the Biden administration? They go after  our gas stoves. That is why I had to bring this bill to the floor.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).    Mr. Chair, I agree, we need to focus on important issues,  so may I suggest to my Democratic colleagues that they talk to  President Biden and say stop going after our gas stoves, so we don't  have to talk about this?   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington State  (Mrs. Rodgers), the chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chair, my colleague said, oh, this is going to save  money. May I remind him that, according to the DOE, only $21.89 over  14\1/2\ years will be saved. That is 12 cents a month.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho  (Mr. Fulcher).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Hageman).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Wyoming.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining  on both sides?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, my colleagues keep saying we are not banning gas stoves,  but what would they call it when the Department of Energy's own  analysis says that of the gas stoves that they have tested, only 4  percent of the market share would qualify for their new proposed rule?  That means about 96 percent won't. Then they revised it to say, well,  almost 50 percent will qualify. Well, that means more than 50 percent  won't.   I call that a ban. We are mixing words here.   The other things that my Democratic colleagues keep asking is: Why  wouldn't we want to save money? It is only 12 cents a month. Who is  going to give up the choice of what type of stove they want for 12  cents a month? Nobody. That is not a good exchange.   I would also say that if the Biden administration is not doing  anything, why do all of these people support my bill? The National  Association of Homebuilders, the American Restaurant Association, the  American Gas Association, the American Home Appliance Manufacturers,  numerous other energy companies.   Mr. Chairman, I would read a little bit from the National Restaurant  Association, because it talks about why this bill is important. We  didn't bring it. The Republicans didn't bring this on; it was the Biden  administration. With all these crises going on in our country, he has  to pick on gas stoves. I don't understand why.   This is what the National Restaurant Association says:         Natural gas is a critical energy source for many sectors of       the economy but none more than the restaurant industry. In       fact, natural gas is the preferred cooking energy source for       76 percent of restaurants. Cooking with an open flame from       natural gas is critical for a variety of dishes to ensure a       responsive, consistent, and precise heat source that affects       the quality of food served.        Natural gas also allows restaurants to use certain cooking       techniques that cannot be replicated with an electric stove.                                time  1915    Finally, banning or overly restricting natural gas use could burden  restaurant owners with higher operating costs, particularly local and  independent restaurants. The cost to convert existing infrastructure to  handle the power capacity needed to operate a commercial kitchen alone  would be prohibitive for many locally owned restaurants.   I say the same is true for individual homeowners. They don't want to  change. They like the features on their gas stove. They don't want to  give them up.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support my bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  [[Page H2864]]     Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in opposition to this amendment, which is nothing more than an  attempt to delay implementation of the underlying bill.   Secretary Granholm could simply say that my bill affects energy  security, even though it doesn't.   The Biden administration's ban on gas stoves is the result of the  Democrats' war on natural gas. They want to force a transition away  from affordable and reliable energy by banning the products that  Americans use every day.   The Department of Energy's gas stove ban is actually an energy  security threat. Because it is not economically justified, it will not  result in a significant savings of energy, and it will reduce consumer  choice for natural gas kitchen ranges and ovens. Its goal is to  eliminate the use of natural gas, which is used to support America's  energy security.   Natural gas kitchen ranges and ovens are currently the preferred  choice of 40 percent of American households. Nearly 187 million  Americans use natural gas because it is affordable and reliable.   According to industry estimates, homes with natural gas appliances  save up to $1,068 per year, compared to all electric homes.   Natural gas stoves are affordable, reliable, and widely popular. I  urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support the underlying  bill, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.  Even my Democratic colleagues admit that the Department of Energy is  now saying that less than 50 percent of gas stoves would qualify for  the new proposed rule, so more than 50 percent of the existing models  of gas stoves would be banned.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment strikes the language preventing the Department of  Energy from implementing any substantially similar rule. Removing this  language would allow the Department of Energy to just reissue another  gas stove ban after my bill becomes law.   I rise in opposition to this amendment, which strikes important  language in the underlying bill. That language would prevent the  Department of Energy from reissuing a nearly identical rule to ban gas  stoves.   H.R. 1640 allows the Department of Energy to issue energy efficiency  standards that are cost effective and that have a significant amount of  energy for consumers.   This is the current standard under the Energy Policy and Conservation  Act, and H.R. 1640 does nothing to change that.   The Biden administration's politically motivated proposal to ban a  majority of gas stoves violates the statutory requirements of EPCA  because it fails to save consumers money or energy and because it  removes products from the market simply because they use natural gas.   The Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings on this and conducted  oversight. The facts are clear that the Department of Energy should  withdraw this misguided rule, and DOE should be prohibited from  reissuing a substantially similar rule.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and  support the underlying bill, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2865]]         Mr. Chairman, yes, indeed, the energy efficiency  standards deal with both gas and electric stoves.   The problem is that it disproportionately would ban the majority of  gas stoves, not electric stoves. That takes away consumer choice.   That is why I brought this bill to the floor, and that is why I  oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Rutherford) having assumed the chair, Mr. Moylan, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1640) to  prohibit the Secretary of Energy from finalizing, implementing, or  enforcing the proposed rule titled ``Energy Conservation Program:  Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer Conventional Cooking  Products'', and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
