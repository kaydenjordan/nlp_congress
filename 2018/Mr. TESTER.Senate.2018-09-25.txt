 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the memory of  a great Montanan who left his mark on countless lives.   Bruce MacIntyre devoted his life to the betterment of Billings, MT.  Bruce's service to his community started at his father's car  dealership. After returning from the University of Notre Dame, Bruce  took over the family business, successfully running it with integrity  and passion.   It didn't take long for Bruce to expand his horizons by serving in  community leadership positions. He eventually sold the dealership to  devote his time to others. Bruce quickly began consulting for  businesses around Billings, helping them evolve and grow, creating jobs  and opportunities along the way.   Bruce eventually joined the Billings Chamber of Commerce as director  of government affairs, fostering relationships between businesses and  local officials to expand the economy and establish lifelong  connections. Bruce was well-known in Billings and across the State as a  humble, generous mentor who always had time to give advice or lend a  hand or even simply to listen to someone who needed it.   His other passion was ensuring students got a quality education.  Bruce was instrumental in passing numerous levies to benefit students  and teachers, and in 2017, he was elected to serve as a trustee for  Billings SD2, where he lent his insight and expertise to creating a  better future for all students.   I rise to remember this great man, who selflessly dedicated his life  to his community. Montana is a better place because of Bruce.                            ____________________
