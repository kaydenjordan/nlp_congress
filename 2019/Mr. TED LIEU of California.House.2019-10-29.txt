 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Engel and  [[Page H8565]]  Congressman Smith for their leadership.   The United States of America should never be afraid to tell the  truth, and yet, for too long, we did not recognize the Armenian  genocide. That ends today. The House of Representatives is going to  formally recognize the Armenian genocide.   Over a century ago, the Ottoman Empire began a plan to systematically  exterminate Armenians from their land. 1.5 million Armenians were  killed across the Turkish countryside. No amount of revisionist history  or lobbying can change those facts.   Today is a historic today. Today, we tell the truth and we honor the  Armenian genocide.
