 Madam Speaker, I rise today as an  educator who spent 10 years as a college instructor and administrator  to support the President's student debt relief plan, which is now  currently under threat by the Supreme Court.   When I was in the classroom, I saw my students taking out loans to  pay for basic needs like rent or food. We tell young people to get an  education, to go to college, to work toward your chance at the American  Dream, but for so many, that means taking out tens of thousands of  dollars in student loans.   Student loan debt also disproportionately impacts low-income  students, and millions of students may not have access to financial  training or advice.   To this day, I am also paying off my student loans, and I have former  students who continue to struggle with student debt years after they  have graduated.   Yes, we need to do more to address college affordability and access,  but we must address student debt.   If the Supreme Court takes the dangerous, irresponsible step of  ending relief to student borrowers, then Congress has a duty to codify  the President's debt relief plan and protect these 40 million  Americans.                            ____________________
