 Mr. Speaker, today we honor Congressman  Louie Gohmert and his years of service to the First District of Texas.  I left the event I was at and rushed over here.   I appreciate you so much. Actually, Louie, you know you were the  first Congressperson I met who was so warm, encouraging, and friendly.  I appreciate how you initiated and were always there to be helpful.   Representative Gohmert, you have been a strong fighter for our  constitutional freedoms of religion and speech, States' rights, Second  Amendment rights, and more. You have been an inspiration to Members of  this body, including myself, and you will be missed.   Oh my, the best ribs I ever ate. I need that recipe. You said you  would give it to me.   Thank you, Congressman Gohmert, for your dedication to our Nation and  all your hard work in protecting the  [[Page H8791]]  American way of life for future generations. You and I have talked  about how much we care about future generations and what we are leaving  them.   May God bless you and your family. My prayers will be with you as you  transition to your next endeavor.
