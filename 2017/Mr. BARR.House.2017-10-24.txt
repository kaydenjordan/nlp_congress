 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3972) to clarify that family offices and family clients are  accredited investors, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3972         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Family Office Technical       Correction Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. ACCREDITED INVESTOR CLARIFICATION.         (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), any family       office or a family client of a family office, as defined in       section 275.202(a)(11)(G)-1 of title 17, Code of Federal       Regulations, shall be deemed to be an accredited investor, as       defined in Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange       Commission (or any successor thereto) under the Securities       Act of 1933.         (b) Limitation.--Subsection (a) only applies to a family       office with assets under management in excess of $5,000,000,       and a family office or a family client not formed for the       specific purpose of acquiring the securities offered, and       whose purchase is directed by a person who has such knowledge       and experience in financial and business matters that such       person is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the       prospective investment.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine  Waters) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Womack). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Womack). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3972, the Family Office  Technical Correction Act, which passed out of the House Financial  Services Committee earlier this month with the unanimous support of my  Republican and Democratic colleagues.   This timely legislation provides a technical clarification that makes  it very apparent that family offices are considered accredited  investors under regulation D.   Under Dodd-Frank, a family office or, in other words, a company that  only has family clients, is owned by the family, and is not a public  investment adviser can give financial advice to family members without  the office registering under the Investment Advisers Act.                                time  1400    The rationale behind this was that family members will look out for  one another. Thus, this legislation, for the same reason, allows family  offices to count as accredited investors, which would allow them to  make private placement investments.   The end result is that more capital will be available for investment  in  [[Page H8098]]  businesses, resulting in more jobs and greater economic opportunity for  Americans of all walks of life.   I want to thank Representative Carolyn Maloney and Chairman  Hensarling for their leadership on this important legislation, and I  urge my colleagues in the House to support the Family Office Technical  Correction Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3972 would expand the definition of ``accredited  investor'' to organizations known as family offices and their family  clients.   Family offices manage the financial interests of wealthy families.  Deeming family offices and family clients to be accredited investors  would allow them to more easily invest in private, unregistered  security offerings.   Today, each family client, family member, and associated employees  and entities must independently meet the accredited investor  definition. This would require, for example, that each individual in a  family independently meet certain income or net worth thresholds.   As I understand it, this process can be cumbersome for private funds  that may lose their private, unregistered status if they fail to  appropriately verify their investors as accredited or otherwise  qualified to invest in private offerings. If there is any doubt, a  private fund could deny a family office or family client the  opportunity to invest.   This bill seeks to remedy that problem by recognizing that family  offices and family clients are financially sophisticated in their own  right. Thanks to an amendment by Representative Maloney that was  unanimously accepted during the committee markup, the bill ensures that  these family offices and family clients have the financial wherewithal  and knowledge to invest as accredited investors in typically risky,  illiquid private security offerings.   Specifically, the bill would apply the same standards currently in  place for trusts so that, number one, the family office must have more  than $5 million in assets; two, the family office and family clients  must not be formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the securities  offered; and, three, the family office and family client must be  dedicated--or directed, rather, by a sophisticated person.   These restrictions limit the potential unintended consequences of the  bill so that, for example, someone who could not otherwise meet the  accredited investor test alone could not circumvent the rules by  investing with another family member as a ``family office.''   They would also prevent estranged family members, who could be up to  10 generations removed, from investing as an accredited investor  without receiving any services of or otherwise being affiliated with  the family office.   I support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Hensarling), the chairman of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.  [[Page H8099]]         Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests at this time, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 3972, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3898) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to place  conditions on certain accounts at United States financial institutions  with respect to North Korea, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3898         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Otto Warmbier North Korea       Nuclear Sanctions Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) On June 1, 2016, the Department of the Treasury's       Financial Crimes Enforcement Network announced a Notice of       Finding that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a       jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern due to its       use of state-controlled financial institutions and front       companies to support the proliferation and development of       weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missiles.        (2) The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has expressed       serious concerns with the threat posed by North Korea's       proliferation and financing of WMD, and has called on FATF       members to apply effective counter-measures to protect their       financial sectors from North Korean money laundering, WMD       proliferation financing, and the financing of terrorism.        (3) In its February 2017 report, the U.N. Panel of Experts       concluded that--        (A) North Korea continued to access the international       financial system in support of illicit activities despite       sanctions imposed by U.N. Security Council Resolutions 2270       (2016) and 2321 (2016);        (B) during the reporting period, no member state had       reported taking actions to freeze North Korean assets; and        (C) sanctions evasion by North Korea, combined with       inadequate compliance by member states, had significantly       negated the impact of U.N. Security Council resolutions.        (4) In its September 2017 report, the U.N. Panel of Experts       found that--        (A) North Korea continued to violate financial sanctions by       using agents acting abroad on the country's behalf;        (B) foreign financial institutions provided correspondent       banking services to North Korean persons and front companies       for illicit purposes;        (C) foreign companies violated sanctions by maintaining       links with North Korean financial institutions; and        (D) North Korea generated at least $270 million during the       reporting period through the violation of sectoral sanctions.        (5) North Korean entities engage in significant financial       transactions through foreign bank accounts that are       maintained by non-North Korean nationals, thereby masking       account users' identity in order to access financial       services.        (6) North Korea's sixth nuclear test on September 3, 2017,       demonstrated an estimated explosive power more than 100 times       greater than that generated by its first nuclear test in       2006.        (7) North Korea has successfully tested submarine-launched       and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and is rapidly       progressing in its development of a nuclear-armed missile       that is capable of reaching United States territory.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to sponsor H.R. 3898, the Otto Warmbier  North Korea Nuclear Sanctions Act, which imposes the most far-reaching  financial sanctions ever directed at North Korea.   Since 2006, North Korea has undertaken six nuclear tests and, earlier  this summer, test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles capable  of reaching United States territory. The most recent nuclear device  that the country detonated on September 3 had an estimated explosive  power 10 times greater than the bomb dropped at Hiroshima. We must not  allow the North to threaten a U.S. city with such weapons.   In short, Mr. Speaker, this bill would impose secondary sanctions on  foreign financial institutions that do business with virtually anyone  that trades with North Korea. In addition, H.R. 3898 would essentially  cut off Pyongyang's ability to earn hard currency through North Korean  laborers working abroad, and it would use our leverage at the IMF, the  World Bank, and other international financial institutions to  incentivize countries to crack down on North Korea's illicit  activities.  [[Page H8101]]    As many of my colleagues know, North Korea is already subject to both  U.S. and international sanctions, the latter deriving from a series of  U.N. Security Council resolutions. These sanctions have fallen short,  however, for two main reasons:   First, they have not given sufficient attention to North Korea's  enablers in third countries, especially foreign banks and middlemen in  China, Southeast Asia, and other parts of the world.   Second, even though U.N. Security Council resolutions are supposed to  bind U.N. members to enforce them, implementation has been weak. As the  U.N. Panel of Experts concluded earlier this year, member nations'  compliance with sanctions has been so lax that North Korea retains  access to the international financial system.   As the Trump administration has made clear, U.N. sanctions are a  floor, not a ceiling, for U.S. action. H.R. 3898 embodies this  principle through the use of secondary sanctions.   Here is how such sanctions would work, Mr. Speaker:   The front companies and middlemen that North Korea relies on in third  countries still need banks. Those banks, in turn, use correspondent or  payable-through accounts held at U.S. financial institutions to process  international transactions. It is counterproductive for U.S. policy to  permit foreign banks to do business in America as well as business that  ultimately helps North Korea. It is time for those banks to choose  between aiding and abetting the North Korean Government or standing for  peace with America and its allies.                                time  1415    H.R. 3898 forces foreign banks to make that choice. Foreign banks can  either do business benefiting North Korea or business with the United  States. They cannot do both.   Under an executive order issued in September, the President  authorized the Treasury Department to levy sanctions on foreign banks  that finance North Korean trade. While this was a crucial step forward,  H.R. 3898 would widen the net still further.   Under this legislation, Congress would be codifying mandatory  sanctions on foreign banks. If someone is dealing with North Korea,  there is nowhere to run or hide: a foreign financial institution is  subject to sanctions for doing business with you, even if that bank  claims that it is not directly financing the trade.   H.R. 3898 also covers more economic activity than any previous  sanctions on North Korea, including the current U.N. sanctions round.  That means this bill goes after banks involved with petroleum, labor,  and virtually any kind of investment or North Korean use of shipping  vessels.   In addition, H.R. 3898 targets the knowledge and technological  support that North Korea needs for its weapons program and hacking  activities. Pyongyang's threats against cybersecurity are critical for  the regime to get its hands on financing.   The goal, Mr. Speaker, is to show North Korea that the path they are  on has devastating costs and leads to nowhere regardless. H.R. 3898  provides an off-ramp for North Korea if the country wants sanctions  relief, but it is up to Pyongyang to take it. Until then, the sanctions  we will be passing today hold tremendous economic pain in store for the  Kim Jong-un regime and its foreign enablers.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, we are honored to dedicate this bill to the  memory of Otto Warmbier, a young man who traveled to North Korea to  understand the country with his own eyes, and whose life was cut short  by the regime's brutality. Otto was a student at the University of  Virginia, my alma mater, and a special community that continues to  mourn the loss of this special young man. Otto held out his hand in  friendship to the people of North Korea, as we do. It is Pyongyang's  nuclear ambitions, though, that threaten what Otto represented: a world  of openness, understanding, and a desire for peaceful relations between  our country and North Korea. It is fitting that this legislation bears  Otto's name, and that its goals embody his spirit.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   First, allow me to say that I am very pleased that, by naming this  legislation after Otto Warmbier, we are able to honor him and let his  family know that we will not forget him. Nor will we forget the brutal,  lethal treatment of this young, decent American student by the  Government of North Korea.   There is simply no justification for the fury with which the Kim  regime turned the massive power of the state on this young American  man, who is alleged to have done nothing more than take a poster from a  hotel. It is this kind of brutality--and the ongoing fundamental  depravity of the North Korean regime--that will keep it from being a  member of the global community of nations.   This is also why the rapid acceleration in the scale and range of  North Korea's nuclear and missile programs is so alarming, including  the launch of two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July, one of  which experts believe could have had the capacity to reach the  continental United States. Then, in September, the regime tested its  sixth nuclear explosive device, and, according to U.S. and  international estimates, this thermonuclear test was significantly  higher in magnitude and yield than any previous test.   This has led to a bipartisan consensus in the Financial Services  Committee that a new policy towards North Korea involving a maximum  pressure campaign of financial isolation is the best chance we have to  resolve this situation peacefully.   Such a strategy must entail a dramatically greater level of pressure  than North Korea has faced to date, one strong enough to change Kim  Jong-un's calculus about whether he is safer with or without his  nuclear program.   The legislation before us today, H.R. 3898, calls for just such a  U.S. strategy towards North Korea--and it is one that has the advantage  of presenting an option other than a military-first response. As many  experts have called for, this legislation takes a page from the Iran  sanctions playbook by mandating the use of secondary sanctions, which  were widely credited with forcing Iran to the negotiating table.   In the context of North Korea, an American program of secondary  sanctions wouldn't just ban U.S. companies from doing business with  North Korea, it would also force companies, individuals, banks, and  governments to make a choice: stop doing business with North Korea and  its enablers or be cut off from the global financial system.   Although we saw in the Iran context just how powerful this approach  can be when carefully fashioned as part of a broad coalition, we must  remember that sanctions alone are not a strategy. Sanctions are a tool,  and in order for them to work, they must be linked to a broader  strategic effort, with the high level of skill in their design and  implementation, and with a clear understanding of the policy goals we  are trying to achieve.   According to Adam Szubin, who formerly served as the Under Secretary  of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Crimes, when Congress  adopted a series of secondary sanction measures in 2010, aimed at  containing Iran's nuclear program, the administration was already  staffed, well-resourced, and ready to immediately deploy senior  officials around the world.   Specifically, senior Treasury, White House, and State Department  officials traveled around the world to explain the new U.S. sanctions  regime and pressure governments, bankers, traders, and companies to  enforce these sanctions in a tough and meaningful way.   Today, there is widespread recognition that a successful strategy to  isolate and pressure North Korea must not only entail the effective  implementation of sanctions, but also arguably an even more complex and  sophisticated degree of statecraft in order to coordinate with our  allies, and, in particular, to convince China that we have shared  objectives when it comes to addressing the increasing destabilizing  North Korean threat.    It is extremely concerning, therefore, that President Trump has shown  virtually no capacity or willingness for the hard work necessary to  secure concessions from North Korea, or enlist China and other key  players to do their part to isolate the Kim regime. In fact, President  Trump's reckless threats, his vow to destroy the Kim regime, his  [[Page H8102]]  name-calling, warmongering, and rejection of diplomacy contradict key  administration officials, and leading experts, who continue to stress  the importance of imposing pressure on the Kim regime. It also  demonstrates a Commander in Chief who lacks the discipline and quality  of leadership it takes to convince our allies to join us in dealing  with the North Korean threat.   Given the high-stakes objectives; the lack of a unified, coherent  policy from the executive branch; and concern about U.S. credibility on  the global stage, I am pleased that, on this critical issue, Members  from both sides of the aisle were able to come together behind a  concrete strategic objective to force Pyongyang into nuclear diplomacy  with the goal of permanently and verifiably limiting North Korea's WMD  and ballistic missile programs.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised to not engage in  personalities toward the President.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Hensarling), the chairman of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, appreciate the bipartisan work on this  piece of legislation, but I just do have to respond to my friend, the  gentlewoman from California, and her comments about the Trump  administration and the shift in policy.   It is hard to dispute that President Trump's public statements and  official actions on North Korea have gotten Beijing's attention in a  way that previous American Presidents have not. President Trump's tough  rhetoric and tough talk on North Korea matches a shift in policy away  from strategic patience to one that uses enhanced pressure through  sanctions and the credible threat of military force to give substance  and meaning to our diplomacy.   Even the Democrat witness in our hearing on this legislation admitted  that the President's strong language had made a difference in giving us  additional leverage in our negotiations with China.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Wenstrup).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of the Financial  Institutions Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a distinguished member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Budd), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Budd), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky has 3 minutes  remaining, and the gentlewoman from California has 7 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), another distinguished member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer), another distinguished member of  the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 3898, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
