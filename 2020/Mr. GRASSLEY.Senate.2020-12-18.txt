 Mr. President, there has been a lot of finger wagging  across the aisle by both Senate and House Democrats about accepting  election results. Most of that has been related to whether or not Trump  would concede the results of the election to Biden. But, obviously,  there is somewhat of a double standard because these same Democrats are  mum about a looming challenge to the certified results of the election  of Iowa's Second Congressional District.   Representative-Elect Miller-Meeks won by six votes, and that was  after careful recounts conducted and certified on a bipartisan basis  according to Iowa law. On election night, the Democratic candidate  lost. A few days later, two counties were recounted, and the Democratic  candidate still lost. Then the Democratic candidate asked for a recount  of all 24 counties, and after that recount, the Democratic candidate  lost. A day later, the secretary of state of Iowa certified the  election, just like the secretaries of state of our 50 States certified  their elections in the Presidential election.   Now the Democratic opponent chose not to make a case under Iowa law  to a judicial panel headed by the chief justice of Iowa, presumably  because there was no legal case.   Now what happens? The next step is that candidate, under a 1969  Federal law, can ask the House of Representatives to set aside Iowa's  election law and overturn Iowa's certified election results through a  purely political process, which could presumably have a Democratic  majority of 222 in the U.S. House overturn the votes of 400,000 Iowans.   Now, getting back to what seems to be a double standard, if  Democratic leaders do not nip this in the bud now, they have no room to  point fingers at any other Member of Congress.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
