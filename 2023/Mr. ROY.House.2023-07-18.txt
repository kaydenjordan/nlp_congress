 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I would note that my colleague on the other side of the  aisle from Pennsylvania referred to the crisis that we are experiencing  on the southern border as a ``fake'' crisis.   I just want everyone in America to understand: Our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle believe that what we are experiencing on the  southern border is a fake crisis.   She said: demonizing migrants. She is criticizing Governor Abbott for  having to deal with the crisis that they call fake.   Governor Abbott, yes, moved migrants from Texas to other parts of the  country, just like the mayor of El Paso and just like the mayor of New  York. The mayor of New York, by the way, exists in a sanctuary city and  then wants to come begging the Federal Government for money. That is  the truth.   We know precisely what is going on along the southern border, and my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not just in denial, they  are literally making up facts. They are saying things that are  completely untrue.   Did the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have to appropriate $10  billion--$10 billion?   That is what the State of Texas had to do to make up for the fact  that the Federal Government is not only refusing to enforce the law,  but it is actively participating--as this President is doing and as the  Secretary of Homeland Security is doing while he lies to me under oath  in the Judiciary Committee--actively participating in the trafficking  of human beings into the United States and the trafficking of little  girls into the sex trafficking trade.   Was it a fake crisis for the 53 migrants who were cooked in a  tractor-trailer last August in San Antonio, Texas? Is that fake?   Is it a fake crisis for the 856 migrants who died along the Rio  Grande in south Texas and in Arizona last year? Is that fake?   Is it fake for the little girl who is sitting in a stash house in  Houston, San Antonio, New York, or Philadelphia right now being raped  by her captors?   Or in Fort Worth, Texas, as a Federal judge articulated in a Federal  opinion just 2 months ago?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the time.   Mr. Speaker, of course, it is not fake.   We are having to impact the entire country, and that is why I support  the gentleman's bill, Schools Not Shelters. Yes, we passed other  legislation, like H.R. 2, which would address the problem but which my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle and this President refused to  do.   We are doing this, of course, jointly, while we are trying to move  the FAA reauthorization. I support that bill too, but we must include  slots--I just want to be very clear--for the people in San Antonio and  for cities outside of the perimeter that was created in 1966.   It is critically important for the American people to have access to  their Nation's Capitol--including San Antonio, with 1.6 million people,  the seventh largest city in the country--to have access to the Ronald  Reagan National Airport.   So I hope we will adopt that amendment so the FAA bill can move  strongly to the Senate and get passed.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle decrying the alleged lack of action by those on  my side of the aisle with respect to gun violence and with respect to  guns generally.                                time  1930    I think it is important to note the primary driver of the current  malaise and the current dangers upon citizens by those with guns comes  from criminals and those who have mental health problems.   A full one-third of Americans are currently putting themselves out as  depressed according to polls. We have mental health issues and drug  issues with our children. We have problems with people who feel  socially detached.   I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that when I was a child, about the  time I was born, fully one-half of American households had weapons and  they had guns. Fewer than one-third do today.   The fact is we have a problem and an epidemic of people with mental  health issues and we have a lack of resolve of leadership in this  country to deal with those or to deal with the criminals perpetrating  crimes. That is the truth.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle rush to say that they  want to get the guns. The fact is we need to stop the criminals. I was  a Federal prosecutor. I spent my time in the United States Attorneys'  Office targeting criminals with guns and putting bad guys behind bars.  There has been a movement of late to allow these criminals back out on  our streets. That is a mistake.   There has been a longstanding movement to not treat those with mental  health problems, and it is getting infinitely worse with these devices,  iPhones, and all of the focus that our young are directing towards  electronic devices rather than engaging with their fellow mankind.   We know it, we see it, and we do nothing about it.   We rage against TikTok because of its relationship to China.   Why don't we rage against the extent to which these are addictive  devices putting garbage in the minds of our children and creating  environments where children get detached from reality and detached from  society?   We see it unfold before our very eyes, and the response among leaders  of this country is to form a task force. You don't need a task force to  understand that our society is breaking down, and you don't need a task  force to understand that our communities are breaking down.   This is what the American people are feeling on a daily basis. When I  talk to my constituents, the people I run into, the people I run into  on airplanes, Americans I don't represent and Americans I do represent,  they know that something is very, very wrong with our country.   That is the truth. That is what the American people know.   Not just with politicians and not just with elective leaders, not  just with Congress, and not just with the economy, but that something  is just fundamentally wrong and fundamentally broken with our way of  life.   They are not wrong. Just a couple of weeks ago, we celebrated  Independence Day. One line from that document which was written  specifically about and to King George citing the death warrants for all  those who signed it, he said, Jefferson wrote, they wrote, they said  that he--the king--has abdicated government here by declaring us out of  his protection and waging war against us.   How different is that from our current situation?   The elites in this country are waging war against us. They are waging  war against our values, waging wars war against or prosperity, and  waging war against our natural rights as parents, as citizens, and as  individuals.   The average Americans right out there today listening just want to  play by the rules. They want to go to school, they want to get a job,  they want to buy a house, they want to support their family, and they  want to raise their kids. They want to raise their kids to be happy,  they want their kids to be free, and they want a society--more  importantly--they want a family that is flourishing and happy and that  can achieve. All of that is what we historically call the American  Dream.   What is the state of the American Dream today?   If I ask that question, half the people in the room would be staring  at their dadgum iPhones because we don't engage with people anymore.   If I said this in the middle of a meeting of my colleagues, or if I  said it in a restaurant, how many times do you see everybody just  staring at these things?   The question here is: What happened to the American Dream?   If my colleagues were in this room--of course, they are not--I would  ask: Do you believe the American Dream can be achieved by your children  and by your grandchildren today?   Do you believe it?   Do you believe it is attainable?   Do you believe that if they play by the rules that they will achieve  the dream?   Or do you think that the rich and the powerful--the large  corporations, the government, your own leaders--are rigging the system  to protect their own status and to protect their own wealth against  your freedom and your prosperity?   We have a system where too often today, crony policies help big, woke  corporations make windfall profits while families struggle with  inflation and small businesses struggle to stay afloat amid a mountain  of regulatory burdens and costs. That is the truth.   Everybody I talk to can't afford labor, they can't afford their  supplies, they can't afford a car, they can't buy a new vehicle because  it has been regulated to death, and they can barely afford their  electricity bills.   That is the truth of everyday Americans right now, and they are  wondering why? What happened to that American Dream?   The elites, on the other hand, bailed out Wall Street, and they  forced Main Street to pay for it.   Now they are doing it again. Wall Street got a $1 trillion bailout  after a heavy hand at tanking the economy, and they are making more  money than ever now.   This year the Federal Government gave a $22 billion bailout to  Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York.   The administration only cares about their own. Treasury Secretary  Yellen  [[Page H3693]]  said that small and regional banks wouldn't get the same treatment.    What exactly does ``too big to fail'' mean?   ``Too big to fail'' means I am going to protect the fat cats down the  street, but you at home are left holding the bag.   Since 2008, corporate profits have increased by 250 percent in the  last 15 years. Hourly wages have increased less than 50 percent.   Mr. Speaker, you say: Oh, Chip, you sound like a Democrat.   What I am trying to say is we have a situation where, as the Founders  predicted, the power structure in this town is too tilted to the power  structure of Wall Street, and too tilted to the power structure in  corporate boardrooms across this country.   Hardworking Americans are the ones who can't make it, and we should  be here fighting for them, but are we?   In 1989, the typical American could provide middle-class essentials  for a family of four by working 40 weeks a year leaving time for  vacation or holidays. It will take that same individual 62 weeks to  provide the same life for his or her family in 2022.   Think about that, Mr. Speaker. That is just 30 years.   What are we doing?   The political elites shipped jobs overseas while enriching themselves  off the Chinese Communist officials who are taking those jobs and  threatening our supply chain.   What do we do?   We respond with the CHIPS Act. Don't blame me. The CHIPS Act  basically just increases that flow to China. It is nuts. You can't even  make it up, Mr. Speaker, but that is what we do in the people's House.   U.S. manufacturing activity contracted in June for the eighth  straight month declining 0.9 percentage points for May. It was the  longest period of contraction in U.S. manufacturing since the Great  Recession.   During COVID, we shut down the greatest economy in the history of the  world. People got laid off, they lost jobs, and small businesses shut  down. I have read stats of 100,000 small businesses getting absolutely  whacked during the COVID hysteria driven by Dr. Fauci and the cronies  in this town, but the wealthiest Americans got 40 percent richer during  that same time.   Now, again, I am a believer in lifting all boats, but that is only  true if the free enterprise and the free market system in this country  is released unfettered to allow Americans to achieve the American  Dream, but right now it is stacked, and it is stacked in favor of a  small handful of elites against the hardworking average American.   In 2023, as I said before, we have seen three of the largest bank  failures in American history. First Republic, $212 billion; Silicon  Valley, $209 billion; and Signature Bank, $110 billion. There we were  racing to bail out. That is not capitalism, Mr. Speaker. That is not  free enterprise. Rushing in to bail people out is the elites protecting  their own against the hardworking American.   For decades we have wasted money that isn't ours on policies and  projects no one wants, and then we pass the credit card bill down to  the next generation.   In the months since this body extended the debt ceiling for another  18 months until January of 2025, in the infinite wisdom of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we have already amassed another  $1 trillion in debt since Memorial Day, and yet everyone in this body  except for a handful gleefully skipped away after saying: Sure, let's  raise the debt another $4 trillion.   It isn't going to be $4 trillion.   When are we going to get serious about what we are doing here?   What about wars?   We are now 21 years--22 years--into the authorization of the use of  military force post-9/11, and we have not updated it. The 2002  authorization of force in Iraq--Saddam Hussein has been dead 15 years-- still exists. We have an authorization of force from 1991 that still  exists and 1957 that still exists.   Why?   Because there is a cadre of people in this town who make a large sum  of money and get a whole lot of power when there are endless wars  continuing for this town to fund with borrowed money driving up  inflation, killing jobs, and killing the American Dream. All of us  people in this Chamber are running around talking about we have to do  it for the defense.   For fiscal year 2022, the United States Federal Government spent $8  trillion on the post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and  elsewhere--$8 trillion, and that is not talking about the thousands of  lives lost, the tens of thousands of lives permanently impacted through  injury and post-traumatic stress disorder.   When the bill comes due, what do we do?   We raise the ceiling on what we can borrow as I said a minute ago.  The $32 trillion we just increased to $36 trillion. CBO reported a $1.4  trillion deficit in the first 9 months of fiscal year 2023. That is  $875 billion higher than the year before.   We spent more on so-called COVID relief from 2000 to 2021, around $6  trillion, than we did in the 3\1/2\ years of World War II.   Think about that, Mr. Speaker, World War II in current dollars  amounted to $4.1 trillion. We are running around like a bunch of scared  ninnies with masks and spent $6 trillion.   Why?   We could because we just wrote a blank check.                                time  1945    Since the Biden administration took office, prices have increased  over 16 percent. The annual cost of inflation has been estimated to  harm American households upwards of $8,900.   Household debt has increased by $2.9 trillion since the end of 2019.  In the first quarter of 2023, aggregate household debt increased by  $148 billion. Think about this.   How about education? We just want the taxes that we pay to teach our  kids what they need to know to succeed in the real world, but teachers'  unions and bureaucrats want to teach them that merit and achievement  are bad, that skin color defines all of us, that there isn't man and  woman, and that America is evil.   Meanwhile, their same beliefs want to undermine the basic parental  right to raise their children in their own values and push harmful  gender ideology on them.   In Cupertino, California, third graders were required to deconstruct  their racial identities and then rank themselves according to their  power and privilege.   In Evanston, Illinois, students listened to ``Not My Idea,'' a book  about whiteness which states that whiteness is bad. An advisory board  in Virginia's Loudoun County Public Schools demanded that teachers be  dismissed if they criticized the district's equity training inspired by  critical race theory.   The President of the American Federation of Teachers vowed the union  will fight ``cultural warriors'' that want to deprive students of a  robust understanding of our common history.   In Lexington, Massachusetts, fourth graders were taught to articulate  what gender identity is and why it is important to use nonbinary  language.   They give our kids pornographic and sexualized books such as ``Gender  Queer: A Memoir,'' an explicit pornographic book; ``Flamer''--good  grief--a graphic book about young boys performing sexual acts at a  summer camp; ``This Book is Gay,'' a book containing instructions on  the ``ins and outs of gay sex.''   I am on the floor of the House of Representatives, and I am reading  this garbage. Our kids are being given this garbage, and you want to  know why parents are dismayed, why parents are frustrated, why the  American people are left scratching their head, saying something is  terribly wrong.   At Round Rock ISD in Texas, at Walsh Middle School a training  presentation instructed teachers not to tell parents if a student tells  them they identify as transgender or nonbinary.   When the children of the elites go to the right schools, they get the  right jobs. Everyone else gets to rack up debt to get a job in a  hamstrung economy with a useless degree that is based more on  indoctrination than on education.   Tuition is skyrocketing. We are not even able to afford the garbage  education that the elites are foisting on the American people.  [[Page H3694]]    Now, if you get through that maze, and you want to buy a house, you  can't. You can't afford it. In 1985, the average single family home was  $82,800. In 2019, they would have spent $313,000; in 2020, $391,900;  and in 2022, it reached $540,000. How can you afford that?   Mr. Speaker, 30-year mortgage rates have gone from 2 to 3 to percent  to 7 percent in under a year. In 2021 with sub-3 percent interest  rates, a $400,000 home cost $604,000 over 30 years. Today, with 7  percent interest rates, that same $400,000 home, which you can't even  get in most places in this country, costs more than a million dollars  over the 30-year span, interest accounting for 157 percent of the home  price. Think about that. Earlier this year, mortgage demand plunged to  the lowest level since 1995.   What about healthcare; a system where crony policies help big  corporations make windfall profits while families struggle with  inflation and small businesses struggle to stay afloat?   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, medical and health  service managers, which are described as managers that, ``plan, direct,  and coordinate the business activities of healthcare providers,'' i.e.,  bureaucrats--they might be private bureaucrats, but they are very  publicly funded bureaucrats through private corporations, so-called-- they are slated to see 32 percent growth in jobs from 2019 to 2029. Not  doctors; bureaucrats. This is compared to a 4 percent growth rate for  physicians and surgeons if we can even get them educated.   Health insurance companies rake in roughly $1 trillion per year.  Health and medical insurance companies placed second in biggest  industries by revenue in the United States only behind retirement and  pension plans.   I want to pause for a second. I was blessed to go to the National  Museum of Military Vehicles in Dubois, Wyoming, 2 weeks ago when I was  there around Independence Day. That museum is incredible, by the way. I  recommend it to all listening.   A large part of the museum is dedicated to what we achieved in World  War II. If you ask the average American what we achieved in World War  II, at least those who were educated and informed enough to even tell  you what World War II was, they will tell you that we beat Nazism, we  beat Hitler, we beat Imperial Japan. Again, that is if we are lucky.   The fact is, it was an unbelievable demonstration of American  industrial might. Absent our industrial strength, we lose. That is the  truth. If we had not been able to develop what we developed, to take  our manufacturing capacity and build thousands of planes, thousands of  Jeeps, thousands of boats, thousands of guns, there is no way we would  have been able to carry out what we were able to carry out in World War  II.   Now, come back. What I just said; what is our number one industry?  Retirement and pension plans. What is our second? Medical insurance  companies. We have major financial institutions. Where is our  industrial base?   You want to beat China? Good luck. Mind you, they drove us all the  way back in Korea in 1951, the Chinese did, or 1952, somewhere around  there. Here we are talking about beating China, and we don't have the  industrial capacity to sneeze at China right now.    That should worry everybody in this Chamber, but instead, we get  nothing but fits of angst over social engineering, over equity, over  LGBTQ, over all manners of apologizing for past sins. We have a world  to go engage in.   The deals they strike with the government, these healthcare  bureaucrats, most recently through ObamaCare, guarantees their growth.  Anthem had a 344 percent increase in government revenue from 2010 to  2020. United Healthcare, 198 percent increase in government revenue  during the same period. Cigna, Anthem, United Healthcare and Humana  have seen an average increase of 562 percent in their stock prices from  January 11 to January 2021.   In 2016, 60 percent of the Nation's top five health insurers' revenue  came from Medicare and Medicaid, up from $92 billion in 2010. In 2022,  big insurance revenues reached $1.25 trillion and profits of almost $70  billion, a 300 percent increase in revenue and a 287 percent increase  in profits.   The CBO estimates that Federal subsidies for health insurance for  Americans under 65 will reach $1 trillion in 2023.   Where is the talk about doctors? Where is the talk about getting  care? That is a corporate crony enrichment plan that is undermining  your ability to get healthcare. Be worried about your ability to afford  care and even have the care if you can afford it; to have a doctor if  you want to get one; to choose the doctor if you want to choose because  these bureaucrats are going to tell you who you can see. They are going  to tell you when you can get care.   They say it is private healthcare. It is not. We have single-payer  healthcare. It is just inefficient corporate cronyism running amuck and  a bunch of people in this town getting rich and lobbyists getting rich  and people in this body not doing a dang thing about it while you can't  get care. You can't figure out how to afford your bills.   Energy; a whole other thing. Wealthy people drive around in expensive  electric vehicles while climate czar John Kerry this week flies to  China, spewing a trail of CO2 so he can go preach about the  climate in China. You can't even make this up.   Orwell would just be down here somewhere between laughing and crying.  The average American is struggling just to put gas in their car and  keep the lights on. They can't afford a new car because of these anti- energy policies from the radical left, but unfortunately, too often  embraced by my own colleagues on this side of the aisle.   In 2021, American energy prices spiked 29 percent, according to BLS,  and a further 7 percent in 2022. Gas prices jumped nearly 50 percent in  2021, but here is the thing: I read somewhere online the other day the  average price of a new car is almost $70,000. I don't know if that is  accurate. I have to go do some research, but I can tell you from  personal experience, it is a lot.   Why? Why do you think Ford is shutting down certain lines? Why do you  think General Motors is shutting down certain lines? Because my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle and this White House want to  live in their climate utopia, and they are shutting down American  production and capacity to build the internal combustion engine, all so  they can push electronic vehicles that nobody can afford and nobody can  drive from Austin to Midland or Austin to Houston.   We are literally funding the destruction of reliable energy in this  country and thereby diminishing it around the world.   The Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act gave $1.2 trillion in crony  subsidies to unreliable forms of energy. This summer, for the first  time in history, the Texas grid will see more energy demand than it can  meet with reliable electricity generation. That is in Texas.   The EIA estimates these subsidies could make wind and solar account  for 60 percent of U.S. generation by 2050, at which point the entire  mind-numbed, indoctrinated youth of this country stand up and applaud  and say, isn't that awesome.   What they don't know is that it isn't awesome because it is  unreliable energy that increases the cost, has enormous environmental  impacts, and is doing nothing to significantly drop CO2  production because China and India are driving CO2  production.   These same climate doomsayers try to sell us unreliable, more  expensive energy policies, which empower our enemies, the Chinese  Communist Party. Chinese companies are eligible for these climate  credits that we just passed. Again, you can't make this up.   Can you imagine in 1939 saying, hey, guys, I have a good idea. Let's  create a way for the American taxpayer to subsidize Adolf Hitler. We  are doing that. We are going, oh, let's go subsidize the Chinese  Communist Party.   Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of the solar panels installed in the United  States come from Chinese firms. China controls 77 percent of EV battery  manufacturing.   Meanwhile, China's building two new coal-powered plants per week in  2022, as they did, on top of the 1,100 coal-fired plants they already  have. We have about 250.   We are running around whining like a bunch of losers, apologizing for  our ability to produce reliable energy and clean-burning natural gas.  [[Page H3695]]    We are not building any new nuclear power. We are just running around  saying subsidize, subsidize, subsidize wind and solar so we can weaken  our grid, empower the Chinese, all so people can feel good about  themselves while they drive their Tesla around.                                time  2000    What the average American notices all around them in every part of  their daily lives is that systematic, political, cultural rot. I use  that term ``rot'' intentionally. When something rots, it decays from  the inside. Even though it looks fine, it is falling apart.   As some have noticed, they have said America will not lose to a  foreign enemy; we will lose to ourselves. Even though they might not  see it, every American can tell that something is not right. They can  tell that something is amiss. There is something rotten in this country  right now because that is what we are seeing happen to our way of life.   My friends on the other side of the aisle love to lecture us all  about the importance of our democracy. The reality is that we are  currently living in a cultural oligarchy, a bureaucratic oligarchy,  where the rich and the powerful protect their status and prestige at  the cost of the American Dream while they preach to us.   These elite forces in the government, corporate America, and our  education system feel different, but they are all on the same team.  They are people who profit even as the rest of us suffer. They are the  ones who set the rules. They are the ones who destroy anyone who steps  out of line. They are the ones who rig the system from far away so that  we don't notice the rigging.   The rigging starts here in Washington, but it oozes into the school  board meetings. It oozes into the local council meetings. It oozes  throughout the corporate boardrooms, HR offices, television shows.   There is an expression in Texas: ``All hat, no cattle.'' The lesson  it imparts is that if you want to talk a big game, you need to back it  up with action.   The American people are fed up with words. They deserve action. We  can't promise a wall and not build a wall. We can't say we are going to  protect freedom and then cave to Dr. Fauci and let him retire scot- free. You can't tell Americans you are going to protect their money and  then get distracted in hiding behind Hunter Biden's drama and his  family's money. We can't say we are against a two-tiered system of  justice and not hold this President and this Cabinet--Mayorkas,  Garland, all of them--accountable for targeting Americans and  abandoning and endangering their country and making a mockery of the  Constitution.   America's systemic rot is too deep for empty promises and bumper  sticker slogans. America deserves leaders who are not ashamed of the  country they lead and do not make us ashamed of them. America deserves  leaders who not only see the dangers of preventable decline but ones  who will actually fight to defend it. We cannot back down. We cannot  shy away from the fight.   Right now, today, on the floor of the House of Representatives, this  week, next week, next month, through the appropriations process,  through the end of the year, all next year, heading into a Presidential  election, we are fighting for the soul of this country. That is what is  at stake.   To borrow from General Washington on July 2, 1776, ``The fate of  unborn millions will now depend, under God, on'' our courage and our  conduct. ``We have, therefore, to resolve to conquer or die.''   That is the kind of resolve America needs from us, from this country,  from Americans. That is what we owe the American people. As deep as the  rot currently is, we cannot let it continue to destroy and undermine  the American Dream. We are duty bound to save that American Dream for  our kids and our grandkids. That is the truth. It is time for Americans  to win again. That is our calling in this Chamber.   I am proud to have my friend from Pennsylvania here with me. I said  it would be 30 minutes; I went 35. I know of no greater patriot, a man  who wore the uniform of his country and served honorably and serves  honorably in the United States Congress. I am proud to call him my  friend.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry),  my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and I  want to pick up on what he has observed when he goes home to  Pennsylvania, when he is traveling around this country. He has observed  what I observe, having individuals pull me aside in an airport, on an  airplane, driving around, at a gas station in Texas, at a gas station  in Colorado, at a gas station in Virginia, all over this country, they  pull me aside and say: Thank you. Keep fighting.   Just like you said, they don't give details. They get it. They see  it. They want someone to stand up and fight for this country because  they see this country slipping through our fingers.   As has long been said, where else are we going to go? What else are  we going to do? As President Reagan said, there is nowhere else to go.  This is it.   We are the beacon of hope for the world, and we are still the  greatest country in the history of the world, but we are giving it  away. We are losing it through a cultural rot and decay where elites  are telling us that we have to apologize for being Americans.   In that museum that I walked through in Dubois, Wyoming, there is a  great graphic--I don't have it in front of me, although I might be able  to pull up a picture--that talks about the tens of millions of lives in  this world that have been liberated by Americans.   Yes, we are an imperfect country. Yes, we have committed sins because  all of us fall short of the glory of God. Yes, but we are a strong,  righteous country that has bled for good around this world. Even in the  center of sin, even in 1861 to 1865, we bled so that people around this  world could be free, so they can know what it means to prosper.   Here we sit in this Chamber, in the luxury of the protections bought  by the people before us, giving it away, shamefully dismissing it,  undermining the American Dream for our kids and grandkids. It defies  all logic to do that, but the Founders knew that it was likely.   Our job is to break that. When people ask me today: Why did you vote  yes on five bills on the floor of the House today to say that we need  to essentially end previously declared emergencies when you know, Chip,  that there are bad guys connected to those emergencies and that we are  using our resources to freeze their assets, take their money away,  clamp down on them? Do you just want to walk away from that?   No, I want to restore order in this town. I want to restore order in  this country, in this government, by saying you don't get to declare an  emergency in 2003 and keep operating 21 years later under an emergency.   Come back to Congress. Let's figure out what we need to do. Let's  figure out our authorizations of force. Let's figure out our use of our  ability to freeze financial assets. Come back to Congress. We have to  fight to restore order, or we are going to lose the Republic. The  Republic depends on it.   One last point on that, and I will yield back. The rule of law  matters. The Republic depends on it. It depends on us getting it right.  I heard my colleagues earlier today referring to the border crisis as a  fake crisis. I mean, I don't know what planet some of my colleagues  live on to refer to what I see happening to human beings in south  Texas--dying in the Texas heat; dying in tractor-trailers; getting  forced into the sex trafficking trade, as we are seeing unfold, as we  see depicted in the ``Sound of Freedom,'' the movie.                                time  2015    We are allowing that to happen on our watch in the supposedly most  powerful nation in the history of the world. My colleagues dismiss it  as a fake crisis. The Republic cannot sustain if that is how we are  going to treat the rule of law and what we do at our southern border.   I have to say this to all my Republican colleagues right now: If you  think I am going to vote for any of our appropriations bills without  forcing this President to his knees to secure the border of the United  States, you are out of your dang mind.   Enough. Use the power of the purse. Quit wilting in the corner. ``Oh,  we have to fund government shutdowns.'' Whatever. Do your job.   That is my call to my Republican colleagues. Don't walk away from the  fight. We blinked on Memorial Day. That is the truth. We blinked. $4  trillion, no policy changes, we blinked. We are not going to allow  Republicans to blink again in this appropriations season.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, in this 2 weeks following Independence Day, you  do a lot of thinking if you are, as I assume my friend was, part of an  Independence Day parade. There are a lot of patriotic Americans out  there, particularly in flyover country, who love their country and want  to defend their country, and they just want their life back. That is  it. They want that American Dream back.   By God, I am going to do everything I can do in this godforsaken town  to give them their freedom back, to give them the American Dream back.  I don't care who gets mad at me. I don't care who is worried about what  bill he or she didn't get across some finish line that nobody in  America generally cares about.   We are going to fight to change this town. ``Conquer or die,'' as  General Washington said.   The fact is you have to ask yourself the question: Are you free? Are  we free? Are we free if you pay taxes to a school that teaches your  children that your country is evil, or that there isn't a difference  between a man and a woman, if you can't even talk about God, much less  pray to God? Are you a free American if that is what you are dealing  with in the schools?    Are you free if you want to simply have a vehicle to move around, to  carry out your livelihood to provide for your family, and you can't  afford one because a bunch of elitists in Martha's Vineyard decide you  have to drive an $80,000 battery-powered car?   Are you free if you are worried that your streets are unsafe, your  border is wide open, and you are endangered, and fentanyl is pouring  into your communities because your government refuses to do its one  basic task? Are you actually free?   Are you free if you just want to go to the doctor of your choice and  are prohibited from doing so because the government regulatory state  and corporate cronies have combined to make a whole lot of money while  you can't go to the doctor of your choice? Are you free?   Are you free if one President is treated differently than another  President by the system of justice reporting to the President? Are you  free?   Are we living in a free country? Are you free if you simply wanted to  go about your way of life, but your government said you couldn't unless  you stuck a needle in your arm with a vaccine created with full  liability protection and then mandated by the very government saying  you have to take it, and if you don't take it, you are going to lose  your job? Are you free?   No, you are not free. It is about damn time that we live free again.  That is why we are here.   Again, to my colleagues on this side of the aisle, I don't care about  your checklist of stuff you want to campaign on. I don't care about  what you don't want to vote on. I care about one thing and one thing  only, and that is living free. It is our God-given right. It is what  people bled and died for--living free, imperfect, in a simple world,  but free.   That is our calling. That is our duty. Our duty isn't to get  reelected. Our duty is to fight for the people who sent us here, to  fight for them against a cultural elite who wants to rip away their  lives.   That is what my mission is every day when I wake up in this  godforsaken town.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his  comments. I think I have less than a minute left, and I will close  with, as I said before, as General George Washington said on July 2,  1776, 247 years ago, on the day we actually declared independence:  ``The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God,'' on our  courage and our conduct. ``We have, therefore, to resolve to conquer or  die.''   That is why we are here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 28 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, July 19, 2023, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
