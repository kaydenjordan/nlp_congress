 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate National School Choice  Week. Allowing parents to choose the best educational outcomes for  their children gives every child a better chance to succeed and  prepares students for their futures.   School choice has greatly benefited Arizona--from charter schools to  vocational schools, to private school scholarships, to education  savings accounts. I am grateful that my State is a national leader in  diverse school choice programs.   Arizona's scholarship tax credit program gives taxpayers a dollar- for-dollar tax credit to enable low-income and disabled children to  attend private schools. In Arizona, more children per capita attend  exemplary charter schools, and, indeed, they are some of the best  charter schools in the country. We have significantly expanded the  education savings account model so students can receive the best  education possible that meets their unique needs, including those of  tribal families who live in reservation communities.  [[Page H619]]    Arizona recognizes that all children are unique, that they learn  differently, and that each child should have the opportunity to attend  the school that will help him learn to love learning and succeed. I  hope other States will look at Arizona's example as they expand school  choice. I am pleased President Trump has made school choice a priority  by nominating Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I have a deep sense of gratitude that I  expressed to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for his effort  in promulgating the bill that we passed today, H.R. 7, and allowing me  to speak tonight.   On Sunday, we recognized the 44th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Sadly,  almost 60 million American babies have lost their lives because of this  ignominious Supreme Court decision. The tide is turning, though.   On Friday, I will have the pleasure of participating in the March for  Life rally to stand with the millions of people who are defending life  across this country.   I am immensely proud to live in Arizona, a State that prioritizes the  protection of the unborn. Since 2009, Arizona has passed 34 provisions  to restrict or regulate abortions, and Arizona's abortion rate has  concomitantly decreased 12 percent in those same 4 years. I appreciate  the efforts of pro-life advocates across my district who have worked  tirelessly to help countless women choose life for their unborn babies.   I look forward to working with President Trump and his administration  on advancing pro-life legislation like H.R. 7, which we passed out of  the House today, and ensuring pro-life candidates for all Supreme Court  vacancies and ultimately reversing that ignominious ruling, Roe v.  Wade.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Arizona for his leadership in the legislature before. As the gentleman  so aptly pointed out, the numbers of abortion come down when even  modest restrictions are passed. The law is a great teacher. We are so  happy to have the gentleman from Arizona here in  [[Page H670]]  the House, and I know I speak for many of us on the Pro-Life Caucus.   I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).
