 Mr. President, as the junior Senator from Oklahoma, I  can't tell you what an honor it has been to be able to serve with my  senior Senator.   Jim Inhofe has for decades served our State. He has been reelected  over and over and over again because the people of our State know he  loves them, know he cares about them. They trust him in some very hard  decisions that had to be made in this place, and they know Jim Inhofe  has been there for our State.   I jokingly say--and Senator Inhofe mentioned his passion for  infrastructure and for the U.S. military--that when I run into somebody  who is griping about the construction traffic that they are currently  sitting in, I will jokingly say to them: Well, blame that on Jim Inhofe  because that new road, that new place, that new infrastructure has been  his passion all along to be able to make sure our State and our Nation,  quite frankly, continue to be able to advance.   In the days ahead, Senator Inhofe will be dearly missed in our State.  There is not a town that I go to as I travel around our State that they  don't ask me: What are we going to do when Senator Inhofe retires? Not  one. They are all grateful, and they are all spoiled by Senator  Inhofe's service to them.   But I can't tell you how excited my wife Cindy and I are for him and  Kay getting time together because they have sacrificed much for our  Nation and for our State for decades, and I am excited for them to be  able to finally get some time to be able to wake up every day and to be  able to see each other and, quite frankly, for Jim to not have to be in  yet another vote-a-rama all night voting, that he can actually spend  his time with Kay.   So if I can say for the State of Oklahoma, we are grateful for Jim  Inhofe. We are grateful for the legacy he has left for our State. We  are grateful for his firm conservative stand that he has taken year  after year after year. We wish him very well in retirement and are very  excited to still continue to be able to walk with him in the days  ahead.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 29 years ago today--29 years ago today-- President Bill Clinton signed into law a bill sponsored by then- Representative Chuck Schumer that has aided in the defense of  protection of one of the most fundamental freedoms that we have in our  Nation; that freedom, religious freedom. The bill was called the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act.   The Religious Freedom Restoration Act passed by Congress today, 29  years ago, found that government should not substantially burden  religious exercise without a compelling justification. It was truly a  landmark piece of legislation to be able to add further protections to  individuals who have religious liberty differences. And we have wide  variations of religious expressions in the United States. It is part of  what makes us such a unique nation. It is that we guard the rights of  every individual to not have to believe the same as the government  believes or not even have to believe the same as your next-door  neighbor believes but to have the right to freely have a faith of your  choosing, to change your faith at any point, if you choose to, or to  have no faith at all and be respected as an American; quite frankly, to  be protected as an American.   This landmark piece of legislation, the Religious Freedom Restoration  Act, has not been altered in the 29 years since it has been passed. The  purpose of the act was to restore a compelling interest test to be able  to make sure that if government acted in any way to affect anyone's  religious liberty, there had to be a compelling reason for that from  the government to guarantee its application in all cases where free  exercise of religion is substantially burdened and provide a claim or  defense for those whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by  government.   The Religious Freedom Restoration Act doesn't pick winners and  losers. It provides a balancing test. The government may burden  someone's religious exercise only if the burden is in furtherance of a  compelling government interest and is the least restrictive means of  furthering that compelling government interest. Twenty-nine years ago  today.   Then, today, my colleagues moved forward on a bill that, instead of  promoting equality for all people of all opinions, it specifically  highlights areas of religious faith differences and says their opinions  won't count this time.   It deals with this issue of marriage, which has been a controversial  issue in America but was, quite frankly--since 2015 in the Obergefell  decision in the Supreme Court, there have been no cases moved in the  country to deny same-sex marriage to any individual in any State across  the Nation.   Today, my colleagues moved forward on a bill to open up debate-- without amendment, may I add--on a bill that would certainly affect the  religious liberty of countless people across the country. That is not  just my opinion. Religious liberty organizations from all faiths and  from all backgrounds have already been speaking out on this issue. Just  in the last 24 hours, the Alliance Defending Freedom, the American  Association of Christian Schools, CatholicVote, the Center for Urban  Renewal and Education, the Centennial Institute, the Christian  Employers Alliance, Concerned Women for America, Eagle Forum, Ethics &  Religious Liberty Commission, the Faith and Freedom Coalition, the  Family Research Council, the Family Policy Alliance,  [[Page S6735]]  The Heritage Foundation, the Liberty Counsel, Lifeline Children's  Services, the National Religious Broadcasters, Religious Freedom  Institute, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, and the  Ethics and Public Policy Center have all spoken out and said this bill  that is currently on the floor of the Senate will damage religious  liberty.   Religious institutions are rising up, reading the text of this bill,  rather than just listening to the debate of this bill, and saying:  There is a problem here.   Practically, what would this mean? Practically, what could this mean?   I would say, first and foremost, we don't want anyone to be  discriminated against in America--anyone to be discriminated against in  America. All individuals should be honored. All individuals should be  able to live their lives in freedom in America. But, practically, this  bill puts faith-based child welfare organizations who are operating in  accordance with their sincerely held religious beliefs, namely, to  place children in loving families--it puts them in jeopardy.   While some of my colleagues may say, Well, that is farfetched, may I  remind you, the Supreme Court has already handed down a decision in  Fulton and would remind us this is continuing to happen. Catholic  Charities has been shut out of the child welfare system in Illinois, in  DC, in California, and in Massachusetts already, and then this bill is  coming.   Let me tell you some of the problems with the bill because I have had  individuals tell me about what they say is in the bill, and then I  actually pull the text of the bill out and show it to them and say:  Show me where that is in the bill. And their response to me typically  is: Well, that is the intent of the bill.   Well, we don't deal with intent here in Congress; we deal with  legislation and text. The words matter in this, and the words in this  do not provide the level of religious liberty protections, as many on  this floor who have come to debate this say that is actually in this  bill.   Let me give you just some simple examples of this. This bill gives a  private right of action for both--well, I should say gives protections  from the Attorney General to be able to file charges against an  individual that shows discrimination or a private right of action for  an individual to be able to sue another individual or entity in this,  unless the discrimination is for religious liberty. They are peculiarly  left out.   If there is discrimination against someone's religious liberty issues  and their personal beliefs or their entity's beliefs, they don't get  this same private right of action. So the private right of action only  goes against people that have religious objections. Those religious  individuals, if they are discriminated against, are on their own. They  get no protections in this bill.   The bill itself, I have heard individuals say: Well, it has a section  in it that is literally titled ``No Impact on Religious Liberty and  Conscience.'' So that is the big, nice title of that section, section 6  of the bill. So let me read section 6 of this bill to you.   The first part of it, section (a), says:         Nothing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act,       shall be construed to diminish or abrogate a religious       liberty or conscience protection otherwise available to an       individual or organization under the Constitution of the       United States or Federal law.    Now, that has got to be the biggest ``no duh'' statement out there.  This piece of legislation doesn't overturn the Constitution is what it  says. That is an unnecessary statement on it. Of course the  Constitution stands above it.   The second part of this, in part (b), says, basically, a rabbi, an  imam, or a pastor is not compelled to perform a marriage ceremony that  they are religiously opposed to. That is the whole religious liberty  section of it--the whole section. First, it says it doesn't overturn  the Constitution, and, second, it says pastors, imams, rabbis don't  have to perform religious weddings that they are personally religiously  opposed to.   That doesn't help. In fact, there is a qualifying feature in the  middle of all this in that section, section 6, which limits the  individuals that would even get any kind of protections on this by  saying ``whose principal purpose is the study, practice, or advancement  of religion,'' meaning an individual would first have to prove that  your principal purpose is to study, practice, or advance religion  before you even got those exceptions.   Why is that important? Well, I asked some of the sponsors of this  bill why that particular piece of text is in there, and their  explanation was, well, because we didn't want to include, for  protections on religious liberty, private individuals and their  personal religious expression or private businesses; that maybe the  owners of that business have a personal religious belief in how they  carry out their business, but they would not have religious protections  because they are not principally a religious organization. So they do  not get a defense. They don't get a private right of action to defend  themselves. They just have to cave to the religious beliefs of this  law.    Twenty-nine years ago, this Congress said we were not going to impose  beliefs onto people. Today, this Congress said: If you are a faith- based individual and you have a difference of conscience about  marriage, too bad. You have to prove you are a principally religious  organization to have an exception; an individual doesn't count. A  private business is specifically excluded.   In section 7 of this bill--I have had several of the sponsors who  have told me: Section 7 covers everything else. It makes sure it  protects nonprofits. It makes sure it protects all of your tax-exempt  status, your grants--it is all in there. Until you read the text. No,  those words are in there, but there are two big qualifiers that are  also in that section.   The first of the qualifiers begins with ``Nothing in this Act . . .  shall be construed to deny or alter'' the benefits, meaning if it is in  something else, that is not protected. It has to be something  specifically in this act.   The second thing is the very end of this. It gives a long section on  this.         Nothing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act,       shall be construed to deny or alter any benefit, status . . .    It goes on to explain some of these things, and then it ends with  this:         Provided such benefit, status, or right does not arise from       a marriage.    That is the qualifier:         Provided such benefit, status, or right does not arise from       a marriage.    Now, I have handed this around and asked legal counsel: Explain to me  what that means. And the first response that I get is: Well, that is a  clear protection for individuals that are married that if there is any  right given to any other married couple, they get the same right.   And I was like, that makes total sense. What about for entities,  because the word ``entity'' is in this list?   And that is where it gets fuzzy because it has this qualifier:         Provided such benefit, status, or right does not arise from       a marriage.    We don't know how that is going to be interpreted for entities. So it  is left for the courts to decide in the days ahead how that is going to  be interpreted.   So what has been done with this? All these things have been brought  up. We have had this text now for about 36 hours. It literally just got  dropped on us. So for about 36 hours we have been going through it--and  it is not long; it is three pages--asking questions: How does it work?  What happens with it?   Several individuals have said: Hey, this is a real problem for  religious liberty. We should fix this.   And others have said: Yeah, that is a good idea. Let's make sure that  it is actually clear--except, now that the debate has started,  amendments have been shut out. There are no amendments. All of these  gaps that I talk about for individuals, for small businesses, for  individuals of conscience, for the right to be able to protect yourself  if you are facing religious discrimination on this, for the limiting  portions in this act or from explaining ``not arising from a  marriage,'' what that may mean, the issue of principal purpose and not  having to prove your principal purpose, in a court of law, is a  religious issue--everyone seems to nod their head and say: Oh, yeah,  those are problems.   Multiple Members have brought amendments and said: Let's fix it. Yet  they are being told over and over again: No amendments. We are not  going to fix it.  [[Page S6736]]    You know what that tells me? These are not mistakes in the drafting.  This was purposeful. That is what that tells me.   Listen, I believe the rights of every individual should be honored,  but this is not choosing to be able to protect the rights of every  individual. This is saying some people are more equal than others. That  is a problem.   After the Obergefell decision was made, President Obama spoke to the  Nation. He supported the Obergefell decision from the Supreme Court,  but then he said this:         I know that Americans of goodwill continue to hold a wide       range of views on this issue. Opposition in some cases has       been based on sincere and deeply held beliefs. All of us who       welcome today's news should be mindful of that fact;       recognize different viewpoints; revere our deep commitment to       religious freedom.    Great words that seem to be on the cutting room floor today. It  hasn't taken long for President Obama's statement after the Obergefell  decision to say: Never mind.   This is fixable, but when people see the problem and the issue with  it and choose to ignore it, I have to ask why.   Twenty-nine years ago today, President Clinton signed into law the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and 29 years later, Congress is  saying: Never mind.   I find that a problem.   I yield the floor.
