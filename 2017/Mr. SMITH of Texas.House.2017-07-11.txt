 Mr. Speaker, a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist  poll found that a combined 68 percent of Americans said that they do  not trust the media very much or not at all. The same poll also found  that Americans trust President Trump more than the media.   It is no surprise that Americans do not trust the media. The media  have stopped reporting and have started attacking. As The Federalist's  David Harsanyi noted in a recent article, ``News organizations have  become obsessed with fighting the President rather than covering him.''   A Harvard study recently found that 80 percent of the news coverage  of President Trump in his first 100 days in office was negative, a new  unfortunate record.   The media is so fixated on attacking the President that they rush to  print unfounded stories using a single anonymous source.   Last month, three CNN employees resigned for their role in a botched  Trump-Russia story. This debacle revealed the media's insatiable  appetite to print any story--no matter how groundless--that is critical  of the President.   The liberal media should stop fighting the President and start  covering his Presidency in a fair and unbiased manner. Then they will  regain the trust of the American people.                            ____________________
