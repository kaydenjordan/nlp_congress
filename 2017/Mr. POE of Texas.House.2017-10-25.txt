 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, Iran continues to be one of the two greatest threats to  the United States' national security and to global security. The other,  of course, is North Korea.   It has become very clear that the Iranian deal has not moderated the  regime. Regardless of where people are on whether we should have signed  it or not signed it, it hasn't stopped the aggressive activity and  belief of the regime.   I believe that they are still developing or trying to develop nuclear  weapons. No one denies that Iran is actively working toward developing  a delivery capability for a nuclear payload. Iran's ballistic missile  program is going to be and already is a menace not only to the United  States, but to Europe and other parts of the world.   Iran is working with North Korea to develop intercontinental  ballistic missiles capable of reaching our shores. These two nations  engage in their activity and belief in hate--hate--of freedom to  destroy the United States and our some of our allies. We should  understand that this is a reality and the threat is now. We should deal  with both of those countries accordingly, not in 10 years.   This legislation, Mr. Royce's Iran Ballistic Missiles and  International Sanctions Enforcement Act, is very crucial.   We must hold the Ayatollah accountable for threatening the global  security and our security.   We must hold the Ayatollah and the IRGC and Hezbollah accountable for  the people that have been murdered throughout the world because of  their response to hate, their hating of all peoples who don't agree  with them.   We must target the entire global supply chain of Iran's ballistic  missile program. I believe the Ayatollah, Mr. Speaker, when he tells  us, on a periodic basis, ``Death to America.'' I believe him when he  says that. That is their foreign policy to the United States: ``Death  to America.'' Americans should believe this.   Mr. Speaker, we must make sure that he does not have the capability  to achieve a delivery system of his nuclear weapons, and I urge voting  in favor of H.R. 1698.   Mr. Speaker, I also do want to mention another bill that I think is  important that we pass today, Mr. Deutch's H.R. 359.   In 2013, the European Union finally came around to designating  Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, but for reasons that make  absolutely no sense to me, the Europeans only designated Hezbollah's  military wing, not the political wing. By distinguishing between a  terrorist group's so-called military and political wings, it seems like  we have legitimized this group's deadly behavior.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, Hezbollah is a terrorist organization,  and wherever you look in the Middle East and you find trouble, you will  find the IRGC and Hezbollah working together. These two agencies from  Iran are the gestapo actors for the Iranian Ayatollah, and it is time  that we hold them accountable for what they are doing. We must pass  these pieces of legislation, and this will go a long way in doing that.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, the saber-rattling rogue regime of  North Korea should be back on the state sponsors of terrorism list, and  here is why:   This year, the North Korean regime kidnapped, tortured, and killed  American citizen Otto Warmbier.   In 2014, North Korea launched a cyber terrorist attack against Sony  Pictures. A U.S. court also found, in 2014, that North Korea materially  supported terrorist attacks by Hezbollah in Israel.   In 2010, another court found that North Korea provided support for  the terrorist organization the Japanese Red Army for their 1972 attack  at an Israeli airport.   In 2009 alone, there were three weapons shipments from North Korea to  terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas.   U.S. officials have said North Korea aided Assad the Butcher by  setting up a nuclear reactor that was destroyed by Israel in 2007.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear, North Korea is a state sponsor of  terrorism, so let's let them officially wear the title along with their  buddy, Iran.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
