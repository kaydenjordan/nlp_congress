 Mr. President, for months, the President has been clear  that he will not allow the full faith and credit of the United States  to be taken hostage. He has rejected brinksmanship, hostage-taking, and  asked for what is the only way to solve this problem given where we are  at right now, which is clean, clean, avoiding default--clean to avoid  default.   To avoid default, Democrats have asked Speaker McCarthy and  Republicans to present a credible plan, but last week Republicans  instead released an extremist, hard-right agenda, written in a  backroom, in secret, to win support from the Freedom Caucus. The GOP's  ``Default on America Act,'' as we call it, does not bring us any closer  to avoiding a first-ever default. In fact, it only brings us  dangerously closer to defaulting.   The ``Default on America Act'' would mean fewer jobs, higher costs  for the American people, and would leave policemen, first responders,  Border Patrol, and our brave veterans all hanging out to dry.   For those who worry about gun violence and crime and keeping our  communities safe, the ``Default on America Act'' will wipe out nearly  30,000 law enforcement while also gutting critical resources to secure  the border. Donald Trump told House Republicans to defund law  enforcement, and so the ``Default on America Act,'' on cue, does just  that.   That is what the ``Default on America Act'' does. And not just that;  it would eliminate over 142,000 new jobs, including 18,000  manufacturing jobs that have been created since the Inflation Reduction  Act was passed.   If you are a parent struggling to pay for childcare, the ``Default on  America Act'' will eliminate more than 105,000 childcare slots across  the country, making it harder for parents to find work, finish their  education, or even provide for their families.   If you know someone who struggled with addiction, this bill would  also worsen the opioid epidemic by cutting critical HHS programs by  over $10 billion in the next decade. That is the definition of cruelty.   If you want to go to college, the Republican package will slash Pell  grants for all students by $1,000 and even eliminate Pell grants  entirely for tens of thousands of Americans.   And for those who worry about gun violence and keeping our  communities  [[Page S1354]]  safe, the ``Default on America Act'' will wipe out nearly 30,000 law  enforcement positions while gutting critical resources to secure the  border. Again, Donald Trump told House Republicans to defund law  enforcement, and the ``Default on America Act,'' on cue, does just  that.   Put plainly, the House Republicans are hell-bent on default one way  or another--either a default on the debt or a default on everything  else: on our future, our children, our promise to care for our kids and  veterans and law enforcement and first responders. No matter what  happens, Republicans are promising real pain for American families.   And what happened just a few hours ago in the wee hours of the  morning? Plainly, Speaker McCarthy capitulated even further to the hard  right. Again, if anything, this revised bill is even more extreme, more  radical--a more radical version of the ``Default on America Act.'' It  brings us no closer to avoiding a default on the national debt.   Let me be clear. Democrats cannot and will not allow the  Republicans's ``DOA Act'' to ever become law. It is DOA, plain and  simple. And if Republicans refuse to level with the public about the  terrible things their ``Default on America Act'' will do to them,  Democrats will do the work ourselves. We will let America know how bad  this is because Republicans are intent on hiding it. They know how  unpopular it would be.   In the meantime, Speaker McCarthy needs to recognize that all the  energy he is putting into passing the ``Default on America Act'' will  be wasted effort. The Speaker should drop the brinksmanship, drop the  hostage-taking, come to the table with Democrats, and pass a clean bill  to avoid default. Given where the Republican proposal is, that is the  only way to go. Time is running out.    Mr. President, first, to just inform folks, in our  arcane processes in the Senate, I have to switch my vote from yes to  no--even though I am a strong yes--in order to be able to reconsider  this vote.   So I enter a motion to reconsider.    Mr. President, it is regrettable that this bill, which  so much helps our veterans, went down. Our veterans need it. It was  supported by all of our veterans groups. It had bipartisan, unanimous  support in committee, and I hope that some of our Members on the other  side of the aisle who didn't vote for it will reconsider.                              Order of Procedure     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session; that the Committee on Environment and  Public Works be discharged from further consideration of S.J. Res. 11;  that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that at 4:20  p.m., the joint resolution be considered read the third time and the  Senate vote on passage without any further intervening action or  debate; and that, upon disposition of S.J. Res. 11, the Senate resume  the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 4, the Equal Rights Amendment.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 121.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 122.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 123.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for cloture motions filed today, April 26, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate  proceed to S. Res. 175, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, tomorrow, it will be a great honor of the  House and Senate to welcome President Yoon of the Republic of Korea to  the U.S. Capitol.   Ahead of President Yoon's visit, Leader McConnell, Chair Menendez,  Ranking Member Risch, and I wish to welcome him through a bipartisan  resolution reaffirming the strong support that exists for the U.S.- Korean relationship. Seventy years of this partnership have made both  our nations safer, more prosperous, and more intertwined than ever.  Today, millions of Americans know and love Korean music, Korean cinema,  Korean food, and Korean goods and products. K-pop now goes viral in our  country, and for many Americans their favorite movies are not in  English but in Korean.    The Korean-American community embodies what the American dream has  always been about: coming to our country and building something of  yourself, building strong families who enrich our communities and make  our Nation more prosperous. New York is proud to have one of the  largest and most dynamic Korean communities anywhere in the country,  and I have been proud to fight for them here in the Senate. They are a  wonderful addition to New York, and the more Koreans there are in New  York the better we are going to be.   And make no mistake, the United States and the Republic of Korea need  each other more than ever. As we continue to compete with China, the  Republic of Korea is one of our closest partners. And as we confront a  belligerent North Korea, we must work with the Republic of Korea for  our mutual safety.   I also want to applaud President Yoon for beginning the process to  revitalize his nation's relationship with Japan. When we work together,  we can make real strides to ensure security and prosperity in the Indo- Pacific. Again, I thank my colleagues for working with me on this  resolution. We thank President Yoon for coming to the Capitol.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, in two criminal cases pending in  Federal district court in the District of Columbia and arising out of  the events of January 6, 2021, the prosecution has requested testimony  from a Senate witness.   In these cases, brought against Leo Christopher Kelly and Rachel  Powell, respectively, trials are expected to commence in early May, and  the prosecution has requested testimony from Daniel Schwager, formerly  counsel to the Secretary of the Senate, concerning his knowledge and  observations of the process and constitutional and legal bases for  Congress' counting of the Electoral College votes. The prosecution in  the Kelly case has additionally requested Mr. Schwager's testimony  regarding certain property destruction that occurred on January 6,  2021. Senate Secretary Berry would like to cooperate with these  requests by providing relevant testimony in these trials from Mr.  Schwager.   In keeping with the rules and practices of the Senate, these  resolutions would authorize the production of relevant testimony from  Mr. Schwager, with representation by the Senate legal Counsel.
