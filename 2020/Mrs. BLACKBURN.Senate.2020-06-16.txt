 Madam President, as I do every week, this past  weekend, I went back to Tennessee. I will tell you, it really did my  heart a lot of good to see people who are out and about and enjoying  beautiful weather and enjoying our beautiful State. Nashville is  beginning to open the doors of our music venues. Our church bells are  ringing, people are attending services, and our hikers are back  exploring our beautiful State parks and the Smokies.   Here on Capitol Hill, though, things really do look a lot different.  When we come back into town, we still return to empty offices and  emptier hallways. I will tell you, I have had a lot of people ask me:  What in the world is happening in Washington these days? Well, even  though the Chamber will look empty to those who are watching on TV, I  want everybody who is watching to know that the Senate is here, and the  Senate is at work.   Before the pandemic sent everyone home, we had made great progress  repairing our Nation's judiciary and filling empty seats at important  Federal agencies. The Senate has placed 198 well-qualified,  constitutionalist judges on the Federal bench. This week, we are going  to hit that 200 number. We will be considering more of our district  court nominations in coming weeks.   We are also preparing to consider the nomination of a former member  of our House Republican Study Committee team. Russ Vought has been  serving as OMB's Acting Director since January of 2019, and soon we  will decide whether to make that position permanent. I will tell you, I  think Russ is more than worthy of that honor, and I encourage my  colleagues to support his confirmation when the time comes for that  vote.                                    China    At this point, we know for a fact that the Chinese Government  withheld information about the novel coronavirus that could have spared  the American people a lot of heartache and even prevented the COVID-19  outbreak from escalating into a global pandemic. Their lies have  already had catastrophic effects on the American economy, on loss of  life, on people's livelihoods, and on their well-being. But I think it  is important to reiterate that this kind of behavior from China is not  new. It is not new. It is just newly realized.   For a long time now, corporations, educational institutions, and even  Members of this body have been happy to ignore the problem because of  profits. I have spoken at length about the many ways that Big Tech's  entanglement with Beijing has jeopardized our privacy, intellectual  property, and our Nation's security.   Everyone here is familiar with the Chinese Communist Party's  shameless use of political violence against the Uighurs, the Tibetans,  and the Hong Kong freedom fighters, but what many don't know is that  the Chinese Communist Party has been using their Confucius Institute  program to fly under the radar at American colleges and universities  and to suppress information about the true nature of the Chinese  Government's role.   These so-called institutes are pitched as opportunities to promote  cultural studies, but in reality they are propaganda mills directly  funded by the Chinese Communist Party. By design, they threaten  academic liberty and free speech. But somehow Beijing has managed to  place 72 Confucius Institutes on American college campuses. It is hard  to believe, but 72 of our Nation's colleges and universities are hosts  to these Chinese Communist Party-funded Confucius Institutes. They even  say that this is part of their soft power and their propaganda.   American students deserve to know who is really talking to them at  these institutes. Last week, we took the first step toward protecting  the integrity of our universities by passing the bipartisan CONFUCIUS  Act by unanimous consent. The bill would grant full managerial  authority to the universities that host Confucius Institutes and  prohibit the application of any foreign law on any campus of a host  institution. This is one piece of a larger effort to expose the Chinese  Communist Party's efforts to pollute the minds of our young people. We  thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership in passing this legislation  last week.   Earlier this year, I introduced the Transparency for Confucius  Institutes Act, which would require ``program participation  agreements'' between these institutes and their American hosts to  address the way Chinese officials influence what can and cannot be  taught in these programs.   I also led a group of colleagues in urging Education Secretary Betsy  DeVos to increase agency oversight of these programs so that we--the  American people, the American taxpayer, students, and their families-- know what is being taught and the programs that are being offered in  these institutes and, also, know who is paying for this.   Since March, life in America has changed dramatically, but the  challenges and threats this country faces have not gone away. Because  of that, it is important that, yes, we keep our attention on these  issues that are still out there. Even though our attention has been  placed on the crisis and the matter at hand, we still have a duty to  govern and to protect the country and her institutions from destructive  influences at home and those that come from far away.   I encourage my colleagues to remember this and to stay focused as we  begin another week of negotiations and votes.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
