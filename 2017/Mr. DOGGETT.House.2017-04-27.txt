 Mr. Speaker, this is undoubtedly the greatest 100 days  of any President in human history. Give President Trump a grade of A- plus for the greatest broken campaign promises in history; the greatest  meaningless executive orders, offering showy ceremonies when a mere  phone call would have done the job; certainly, the very greatest number  of insulting tweets--no President in history has ever come close; the  greatest conflicts of interest; the greatest embrace of authoritarian  leaders; the greatest gap between reality and fantasy, unquestionably.  He talks as a populist and he governs as a plutocrat.   The greatest thing about Trump's 100 days is that America still  exists without a major war or an economic free fall. Every day we  survive without a Trump-inspired catastrophe is a great day for our  country.   Sustain the resistance and remain hopeful for a Trump-free America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Representative  Joe Wilson be removed as the cosponsor of H.R. 2015. He was incorrectly  listed when it should have been Representative Frederica Wilson.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of New York). Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
