 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 11 a.m. on Monday  next.    Mr. Speaker, American families are hurting  from high inflation resulting in higher prices of everyday goods from  groceries to gasoline. Nearly two out of every three Americans is  living paycheck to paycheck.   Unfortunately, in California, everything is more expensive. That is  why I am working to bring some common sense to Congress and make life  affordable by combating reckless spending and lowering taxes.  [[Page H1897]]    Earlier this year, I joined my friend from California, Representative   Mike Garcia, to introduce the Inflation Prevention Act to ensure that  Congress doesn't pass bills that add to inflationary spending until the  year-after-year rate drops below 4.5 percent.   Last week, I introduced the SALT Deductibility Act to repeal the  current cap on State and local tax deductions that is unfairly making  my constituents pay more taxes.   I will keep fighting to make sure that life is easier for folks in  California's 40th District and across the Nation.                            ____________________
