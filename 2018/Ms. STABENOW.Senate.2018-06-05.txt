 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to someone  who has been fighting for working men and women his entire career.   Just for a moment, let's think back to 1977. The top movie that year  was ``Star Wars''--the original one--and the average movie ticket cost  $2.23. The Apple II computer went on sale. It cost $1,298, not  including the television you needed to use for a monitor. The space  shuttle Enterprise took its first test flight, perched on top of a  Boeing 747. And a young Marine Corps veteran and salvage welder at J.I.  Case first joined UAW Local 806 in Rock Island, IL. He began fighting  at that point for workers' rights.   A few things have changed since then. ``Star Wars'' and Apple have  evolved, and the space shuttle has retired. Yet one thing hasn't  changed: Dennis Williams is just as dedicated to the working men and  women of the UAW today as he was four decades ago. Over the years, he  has served them in a number of ways, including negotiating the first  contract at Mitsubishi Motors North America in Bloomington, IL;  organizing Indiana State employees; helping Local 844 in Vermont, IL,  obtain their first contract; and serving locals throughout the nine  States of Region 4.   In 2010, he was elected UAW's secretary-treasurer. In 2014, he was  elected United Auto Workers' president, a position he has held with  distinction since then. It hasn't been an easy time to lead the UAW.  The great recession hit the American automobile industry very hard.  Some folks thought we should just let the auto industry go bankrupt.  Instead, the United Auto Workers made sacrifices, stood strong, stood  together, and weathered the storm. Under Dennis Williams' leadership,  the UAW ended 2017 with a fiscal surplus for the third straight year  and with more than 430,000 members--up 60,000 members since 2011. It is  no surprise. Anyone who has worked with Dennis knows just how dedicated  he is to his members and to the communities where they live and where  they work.   Just ask the people of Flint. During the water crisis--which, by the  way, continues on--UAW members from all over the country were some of  the first ones there to help. They collected bottled water and  distributed it in their own vehicles, going door to door to help, even  traveling to Washington, DC, to demand action from Congress. We are so  pleased that they helped us get action to help the families in Flint.   That tells us a little something about the character of the members  of the UAW. Yet, it also tells us a little bit about their leader--a  man who long ago signed up to serve his country and has simply never  stopped. I think that Dennis would say it is about solidarity. He wrote  in an editorial in the Detroit News last month:         We believe that no matter where you come from, who you are,       what language you speak, or what religion you practice--being       in a union is about working men and women standing up for       each other. That's how it was in 1935 when the UAW was       formed, and that's how it is now.    To Dennis Williams, thank you for your service, your hard work, and  your dedication to making life better for working men and women so that  we can actually have and sustain and grow an American middle class. I  know that the members of the UAW join me in wishing you the very best  in your well-earned retirement.   I know that my partner and colleague from Michigan will be coming to  the floor in just a bit.   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
