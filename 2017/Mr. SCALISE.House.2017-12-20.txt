 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank somebody  who has been a key part of my team since I got elected into House  leadership. He is the floor director right now for the whip's office,  Mr. Matt Bravo.   Matt Bravo has been with my team and has helped us through some  critical key legislative victories, not the least of which is the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act today, helping pass the bills through the floor and  helping us get our work done as we whip the bills to make sure we can  move the majority's agenda.   Matt has worked for years, Mr. Speaker, not just in the whip's office  for me, he has also worked for former whip and majority leader Eric  Cantor. He has worked for the Energy and Commerce Committee.   Matt Bravo has dedicated more than 10 years of his life to public  service in this institution with honor and integrity.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Matt Bravo is somebody who has the full respect of  not only our Members on the House Republican side, he is respected by  the Democratic leadership as well and is a key part of our staff and,  again, has helped us pass critical legislation. I would call him the  best floor director ever.   We are going to miss him here. Jennifer and I wish him and his wife,  Summer, and their soon-to-be growing family all the best in their  future life.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank him for the time and the public service  he has given to this House of Representatives.  [[Page H10332]]    Again, thank you, Mr. Matt Bravo, for the service you have given to  all of us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, we can maybe disagree on that like we  disagree on who has the best crabs, but we will enjoy that  disagreement.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Democratic whip for his  kind words and for the way that our offices do work together on those  occasions. Frankly, it is most occasions where we are working together  on things. Obviously, there are times when we are not; but even in  those times, our staffs have a great working relationship and a trust  level that is really important to the House getting its business done.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I would be honored to yield to the chief  deputy whip, Mr. McHenry.    Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't recognize  that Matt's lovely wife, Summer, is in the balcony, too, and I thank  her for the time that she lent him to us and to this great institution.  The best of luck to her family and her future with Matt.                            ____________________
