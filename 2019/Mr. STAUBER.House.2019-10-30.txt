 Madam Speaker, Veterans Day is right around the corner.  In anticipation of this important holiday, I rise to recognize a  veteran from my district whose service and patriotism has our whole  community rallying around him.   Stan Cvar is a World War II Navy veteran who always flies the  American flag outside his home in Hibbing, Minnesota. Unfortunately,  back in September, someone stole Stan's American flag from his  property. Stan was devastated, as the flag was not just a symbol of the  Nation he risked his life to serve but a treasured gift from his son.   The fact that someone stole a cherished American flag from a member  of the Greatest Generation was deeply upsetting to many in the  northland, myself included.   Next week, I will have the chance to personally deliver a flag that  was flown over the United States Capitol to Stan and his family. It  will be an honor to meet this American hero and offer him a token of  our gratitude.   Madam Speaker, as Veterans Day approaches, let us all remember that  after everything our veterans have done for us, we must always ensure  that we are standing up for them.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise today with my colleagues in  opposition to this harmful legislation.   Today, the other side of the aisle is kowtowing to the wealthy and  elite environmental lobby by ignoring science and facts and legislating  over the needs of rural communities. This heavy-handed Federal approach  ignores potential revenues generated from State trust lands that would  flow to schools and our local communities.   I feel like we are living in the movie ``Groundhog Day'' sometimes.  Time and time again, locals who live on these lands, who work in the  area, who raise their families there, who represent these districts  are supportive of these projects. Those who often know nothing about  the local projects, the economy, or the environment are the ones who  are inserting themselves in opposition.    This illustrates the vast divide between the realities for local  communities and the visions of environmentalists. What these visions  tend to ignore is that the choice is a binary one. We either get these  minerals needed for our everyday life, renewable energy, and national  security from right here in the United States, or we import them from  places like Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Chinese-owned mines in  Africa.   Do these countries have the same standards in place as we do to  protect the environment? Madam Chair, the answer is no.   Do these foreign mines hire workers with high-wage salaries? Madam  Chair, the answer is no.   Are these mines required to comply with a regulatory agency like the  Mine Safety and Health Administration? Madam Chair, the answer is no.   Do Russia and China have our best national security interests in  mind? Madam Chair, the answer is no.   Therefore, this legislation is baffling. Our enemies abroad could not  have written a better bill to benefit their economies and national  security goals while simultaneously damaging ours.   Instead of arbitrarily deciding that mining is wrong, Madam Chair,  let's look at the facts. One, it is unsustainable and irresponsible to  continue our reliance on foreign adversaries for our minerals. Two,  mining and a pristine environment are not mutually exclusive.   Madam Chair, I encourage anybody in this body to come to northern  Minnesota and view our reclaimed mines, which are home to the cleanest  drinking water in the State of Minnesota.                                time  1300    Or, how about visiting the Hermit Mine in Arizona. This was a  functional uranium mine in the 1980s. It is now fully reclaimed with a  pristine landscape.   We need these minerals. Let's stand up against antiscience scare  tactics and vote against this bill and in support of good jobs,  renewable energy, and national security for our country.
