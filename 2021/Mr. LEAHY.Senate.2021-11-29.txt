 Madam President, in June of this year, Egyptian  prosecutors opened a criminal investigation concerning human rights  defender Hossam Bahgat, in relation to a December 2020 tweet  criticizing Egypt's flawed parliamentary elections. The acts he has  been accused of would not be considered crimes in the United States,  nor in any other country that respects freedom of expression.   Hossam Bahgat is the executive director and founder of one of the  most respected Egyptian human rights organizations, the Egyptian  Initiative for Personal Rights, EIPR. His work has been recognized  around the world, and in April 2021, Mr. Bahgat met with Secretary of  State Blinken as part of a group of leading human rights activists.  Other EIPR employees have also been targeted, along with many others as  part of the government's crackdown on independent civil society  organizations. In February of 2020, EIPR researcher Patrick George Zaki  was forcibly disappeared and reportedly tortured. A year ago, three of  EIPR's senior employees, Gasser Abdel-Razek, Karim Ennarah, and Mohamed  Basheer, were also arbitrarily detained, effectively silencing them.   Mr. Bahgat faces up to 3 years in prison and almost $20,000 in fines  for reportedly doing nothing more than expressing views the Egyptian  authorities consider to be ``insulting'' or ``false news''. This is not  the first time Mr. Bahgat has been targeted for his courageous and  important reporting. In 2015, he was detained for 3 days after  reporting on officers convicted of planning a coup and was only  released when the case received international attention from human  rights groups and the United Nations.   I have consistently spoken out about human rights in Egypt and in  other countries, especially when governments crack down on human rights  activists. The State Department publicly expressed concern in July of  this year. Today, I am adding my voice to others who have raised  concerns about Mr. Bahgat's wrongful detention. A verdict in his case  may be imminent. I hope the Egyptian Government will abandon its  persecution of Hossam Bahgat and his fellow human rights defenders.  Like the Department of State, I have been urging the Egyptian  authorities to make progress on human rights so our two countries can  expand cooperation in other important areas. Further attempts to  silence Mr. Bahgat and the other EIPR employees will needlessly impede  those efforts.                            ____________________
