 Madam Speaker, I rise today to extend my sincere  condolences to the families who lost loved ones in the Boeing 737 MAX  tragedies. One life lost in any accident is one too many, and Congress  has a duty to take steps to ensure that future tragedies do not occur.   Last week Mr. Paul Njoroge and Mr. Michael Stumo, who lost loved ones  in this tragedy testified before the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure on how they believe aviation safety can be improved. I  commend them for having the courage to testify before the committee  under such difficult circumstances.   I personally met with Mr. Stumo and his wife, Nadia, who lost their  daughter, Samya, in the Ethiopian Airlines tragedy. I cannot begin to  imagine the grief that they are experiencing. As a father of three, it  terrifies me to think of harm coming to my children, and I would do  anything to prevent it.   Madam Speaker, I am committed to a thorough investigation of the 737  MAX airplane to ensure it is safe before airlines resume commercial  flights.                            ____________________
