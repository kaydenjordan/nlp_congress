 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the American Rescue Plan.  We cannot grow numb to the pain and devastation the COVID pandemic  brought this past year.   Mr. Speaker, 500,000 Americans are dead. Millions have lost their  jobs and can't find meaningful employment. Children, including my own,  have had to adapt to online learning. Millions of small businesses are  struggling to keep the lights on.   Folks in Colorado want to get this done. In fact, over 70 percent of  Americans want to get this done, and there  [[Page H737]]  are very few things more bipartisan than that. They want it fixed, and  they want it fixed now.   This bill is the first step to building back better. It will support  vaccine distribution and research and provide relief to small  businesses, schools, and Coloradans who are out of work. So let's get  this done.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the American  Rescue Plan.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Protecting  America's Wilderness Act.   I would first like to thank my friends and colleagues in the Colorado  delegation, Congressman   Joe Neguse, Congresswoman Diana DeGette, and  Senator Michael Bennet for their leadership on this package.    Colorado's identity is closely tied to nature. Colorado is home to  four national parks, 42 State parks, and a wide variety of outdoor  activities ranging from hiking, to camping, and skiing. Our public  lands are central to the Colorado way of life, and I want to ensure  [[Page H746]]  that future generations can enjoy these treasures just as my children  do now.   The conservation package we are considering today will grow the  outdoor recreation economy, help create jobs, and protect hundreds of  thousands of acres of Colorado land for future generations.   The Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act will establish the  first-ever national historic landscape at Camp Hale. Now, Camp Hale was  the training ground of the storied 10th Mountain Division, an elite  unit trained in mountain climbing and skiing. They fought valiantly in  World War II, and many of them later returned to Colorado, where they  helped establish the U.S. ski industry.   This is particularly important to my family as my wife's grandfather  served in the initial 10th Mountain during World War II and was  actually wounded in fighting in Italy. As a veteran, and a Coloradan, I  believe it is important to honor their service and their legacy, and to  preserve this historic landscape so that we can tell the story to  future generations.   I commend my Colorado colleagues for their work on this effort and  their commitment to our public lands, and I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.
