 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, the world saw powerful images coming  out of Tehran. Iranian protestors, many of them students, braved gas  and gunfire to gather in the streets and speak out against their  oppressive government for lying to its people. We saw video footage of  people putting their personal safety at risk so their fellow citizens  and the countries of the world could know the truth about what was  going on inside Iran.   The Iranian protesters are showing incredible courage, standing up to  a government that kills and brutally silences its own people. To get a  sense of how brave their actions are, think about this: When Iranians  took to the streets to protest late last year, many of them were shot  and killed by their own country's security forces. Death tolls show  Iran's Government killed 1,500 people during the 2-month demonstration.   According to experts, this is the bloodiest crackdown on protestors  since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. It came after the Supreme Leader  of Iran gave a chilling order to ``do whatever it takes to end it.''    Sadly, attacks on innocent civilians have been all too common in  Iran. This is just another horrifying chapter in their long history of  harming their own citizens.   What is happening in Iran is a reminder that here in the United  States there should never be any hesitation to stand with people in  their calls for freedom. From the beginning, America has been a shining  beacon of hope for those seeking a free society. Our task is to embrace  that identity and the responsibility that comes with it.   Especially now, we cannot shrink from the sources of our national  greatness. That is why I stand here today: to ask you to lend freedom  your voice and unconditional support.   The resolution I introduced yesterday accomplishes three things:   It condemns the Government of Iran for shooting down Ukraine  International Airlines flight 752, which killed 172 innocent civilians;   It expresses unequivocal support for the Iranian protesters; and   It calls on the Iranian regime to not use force against its own  people, as it has done so many times before.   This resolution sends a strong message that the United States stands  with the Iranian people and we are with them in their demands for free  and honest government.   But the resolution also intends to amplify the voice of the Iranian  protestors. It does not call for anything Iranians have not already  demanded themselves.   This is an issue on which Congress should and must speak with one  voice. We already passed similar measures supporting Hong Kong  protesters by substantial bipartisan margins. It should not be  difficult for us to pass this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I have been thinking a lot about what the Iranian  protests mean today and in the future, and two things come to mind: a  story and a quote.                                time  1245    The story is a small one. It happened a couple days ago at a  university in Tehran. It is about a group of students and two big  flags.   The Iranian Government had painted large American and Israeli flags  in the middle of the street, as a sign of disrespect expecting people  to walk over them. But a group of Iranian students courageously defied  the regime's wishes. They would not walk on the flag and booed those  who did. Some reported that the students were chanting ``our enemy is  in Iran, not America.''  [[Page H219]]  There are moments in time of history that the craving for freedom gets  displayed, be it a young, lone man standing in front of tanks in  Tiananmen Square, or be it some students in Tehran with fear just a few  months before of being murdered, but not willing to walk on the  American flag. A small moment with big meaning, for the students, for  Iran and for us. It reminds me of the Hong Kong protestors who waved  American flags and sang our national anthem.   The quote I have been thinking of comes from an anthology of speeches  that Frederick Douglass read as a young man. The quote is this, ``Let  it be remembered, there is no luxury so exquisite as the exercise of  humanity, and no post so honorable as his, who defends the rights of  man.''   Mr. Speaker, America is more than a country. We are an idea, an  inspiration for those who yearn to be free and have the ability and  dignity to determine their own destiny.   So many times in this body as these moments rose around the world, be  it the shipyard workers of Poland, be it the craving of the Berlin Wall  collapsing and becoming one, be it those in Hong Kong that want just  freedom of speech.   Let us not be the Congress that misses the opportunity. Let us not be  the Congress that takes 1 week earlier and sends a message to the Iran  Government that is much different, that we are divided, that we would  not stand up if they murdered their own people again, or we would not  stand up if those who are young students who rose and would not walk  across an American flag and booed those who would, those who would  stand up in Iran and say ``the enemy is in Iran, not in America.'' Let  us not be that Congress.   Let us take this moment in time where history has shown that we are  right when we stand with anyone who craves freedom. This resolution is  the right way to amplify the call for freedom in Iran.   It is not just those on C-SPAN who are watching, it is the world who  is watching. The world is much smaller today than at those other times.  We will not have to wait for days or hours for the news to come across.  It will be in a tweet, it will be in a text, or it will be in an  Instagram.   There are important issues in this Nation, but there are none more  important than whether we stand for freedom. I do not want this  Congress to walk in shame that they missed this window. I do not want  historians to look back in a few decades and see civilians were killed  because they stood for freedom and America stood quiet. That is why I  am asking that we vote ``no'' on this PQ. This resolution deserves to  be heard, but more importantly, the world deserves to hear this  Congress act.   Do you agree that America is more than a country; that America is an  idea, that it could be so great of an inspiration, it would move the  students to crave what we fought for? Let's take this moment in time to  tell them we hear them, we stand with them, and this America will  always defend freedom here and around the world.
