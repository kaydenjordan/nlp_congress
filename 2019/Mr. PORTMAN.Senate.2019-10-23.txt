 Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my  colleague from Tennessee about the importance of this agreement in her  State, and I can tell you it is also important to a State a little  further north called Ohio. Our No. 1 trading partner, by far, is Canada  and No. 2 is Mexico, and we want this agreement.   I hear about it all the time I am out talking to our farmers. They  are concerned about the weather. They are concerned about what is going  on with the China market. They are concerned about low prices. They see  this as an opportunity. They see this as kind of the light at the end  of the tunnel.   If we can get the USMCA done, that expands markets for us and,  therefore, increases our prices and gives us a chance. It is the same  situation with a lot of manufacturers. It is amazing how many of them  depend on Mexico and Canada to be able to sell their products. This is  a big deal in Ohio and a big deal for our country. So I am here today  to try to urge the House of Representatives to go ahead and move on  this and then to urge the Senate to take it up right away. The Trump  administration negotiated a good agreement. It deserves a vote.   I am a former trade lawyer--a recovering one--and I am also a former  member of the Ways and Means Committee and a former U.S. Trade  Representative, and now I am on the Finance Committee, where we deal  with trade. The bottom line is that, in all of those years working with  trade, it is a complicated area. It is a politically difficult area.  But the bottom line is that we are about 5 percent of the world's  population in America, and yet we have 25 percent of the economy. The  way we do well is to sell more of our stuff to the 95 percent of the  people who are outside of our borders.   It should be fair. We should have a level playing field. That is the  kind of context in which I look at the USMCA. Does it meet these  criteria, where we can sell more of our stuff and we have a more level  playing field? Yes, it does. That is exactly what this agreement does.  It is a good agreement, and it deserves to have a vote. If it has a  vote, it will pass because logic, I think, will prevail.   As crazy as this town is these days and as partisan as things are,  the logic of this is inescapable, which is that you have the USMCA, a  good agreement, and then you have the status quo, which is NAFTA, which  is not as good in any respect. If you vote no on USMCA, you are  effectively voting yes for the status quo. I don't think that will  happen. I think it will pass if we can get it to the floor for a vote.   Taken together, our neighbors, Canada and Mexico, make up the most  important foreign markets for U.S. products, and not just for Ohio. In  fact, according to the recent data we have, one-third of all American  exports in 2019 this year have already gone to Mexico or Canada, well  ahead of any other foreign markets. So trade with Mexico and Canada is  now responsible for 12 million jobs nationally. Every single State  represented here has jobs related to this.   In Ohio, again, our No. 1 and No. 2 trade partners are Canada and  Mexico, with 39 percent of our exports going to Canada alone. That is  twice the national average, by the way. So we are particularly focused  on Canada and Mexico, which represent $28 billion in trade total.   What I am hearing from farmers, manufacturers, and service providers  is that this is really important for us. So we have to be sure that,  because this relationship is so important, it is built on a solid  foundation. The NAFTA agreement which it is built on is now 25 years  old. It is outdated. It has not kept up with the times, and it has to  be improved upon. That is what USMCA does. It basically says that we  are in the 21st century, and we have to make changes to this agreement.   NAFTA doesn't have things in it that one would expect in a 21st  century agreement.   Start with the digital economy. So much of our economy now operates  over the internet. Yet there is nothing in the current agreement,  NAFTA, that protects this trade like our modern agreements do.   Another aspect is labor and environmental standards, which are weak  and not enforceable in the NAFTA agreement but are in the USMCA. That  is a big change in and of itself.   This is not just a name change. This is a fundamental change in the  way in which we relate to our neighbors to the south and north.   This handy-dandy chart I put together shows us some of the  differences between the two agreements. The first one has to do with  economic impact. The independent International Trade Commission has  done a study on this. They are required by law to do it. They say that  the new USMCA is going to create 176,000 new jobs. That is the green  check under USMCA. That is a big difference right there. If we want to  create more jobs, by the way, here are 176,000 new jobs, and 20,000 of  those jobs are in the auto industry. That is very important to our  country and particularly important to States like mine.   Second, businesses in Ohio and around the country rely on internet  sales that we talked about earlier. Internet sales and rules for the  internet are unchanged in NAFTA. Frankly, there is no chapter in NAFTA  that deals with commerce over the internet. It is unbelievable. It  turns out that the USMCA does, and that is important because small  businesses that rely on access to Canada and Mexico through internet  sales are going to have an easing of their customs burdens for small- value products. They will have data localization protections. They will  have a prohibition on Mexico and Canada requiring that there be  localization of the data in those countries. Finally, this prohibits  tariffs on data, which we don't have now. These are all important key  elements in the agreement to keep our internet economy moving. So under  the rules for the internet economy, there is a green check for the  USMCA, and NAFTA doesn't have it.   Let's talk about the next subject, which is enforceable labor and  environmental standards. In the agreement we have now, the NAFTA  agreement, there are no labor or environmental standards that are  enforceable--none. Whereas, in the new USMCA, standards are actually  enforceable. There are consequences if they don't abide by them. This  is part of the leveling of the playing field. Think about it. In  Mexico, one of their great advantages has been lower labor costs and  labor conditions--the inability to organize and so on. This changes  that now that we have labor standards. By the way, Mexico has already  made changes to their labor laws because of the agreement we have with  them under the USMCA, which, by the way, was negotiated with these two  countries and submitted back on September 30 of last year. It has been  over a year. So it is about time to move it. Again, the USMCA has  enforceable environmental and labor standards, and NAFTA does not.   There are some other provisions that are interesting that lead to why  this is  [[Page S6074]]  good for the economy. The International Trade Commission, or the ITC,  also says that this agreement will increase the GDP of our country,  which is the economic growth of our country, and, significantly, in  fact, more than the Trans-Pacific Partnership did. Remember that the  TPP is an agreement that a lot of Democrats have spoken very favorably  of because of its impact on the economy. The USMCA actually increases  our economy more than the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have.   Another issue that is unusual but is in this agreement and is helpful  to our manufacturing in Ohio and around the country is that 70 percent  of the steel used in manufacturing vehicles has to be made in the  United States, Canada, or Mexico. So this is a new standard that does  not exist in NAFTA at all. This means more steel jobs in America and  more heavy manufacturing jobs in this country. So we have a check on  USMCA, yes, with 70 percent of the steel. In NAFTA, there is nothing  with regard to how much steel has to be coming from North America.    It also states that, with regard to the wages in Canada, Mexico, and  the United States, there would be a minimum wage of $16 per hour for  about 40 to 45 percent of this manufacturing we are talking about. So  any vehicle made in Mexico or anywhere else in America has to be  produced by workers making 16 bucks an hour or more. This is again  about leveling the playing field, and, frankly, this is the kind of  provision that we would see in a provision negotiated by a Democratic  administration, not a Republican administration. My Democrat friends  have been calling for this for years. It is in the USMCA agreement, and  it is good for us because it will result in more jobs coming to the  United States of America, where we have not just higher labor standards  but higher wages. So 40 to 45 percent of the vehicles must be made by  workers earning $16 an hour. Check the box for yes in USMCA and no in  NAFTA.   It is another example of how this agreement is one that addresses a  lot of the concerns the Democrats have raised over the years. When I  was U.S. Trade Representative, we talked a lot about these issues. We  talked a lot about them in the Finance Committee. They are in this  agreement.   My hope would be that Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats in the House  would take this into account and at least allow this agreement to be  voted on by the full House. If that happens, I can't believe that logic  wouldn't prevail, that NAFTA versus USMCA wouldn't result in our  passing USMCA. All of these things are going to help.   The one element that I think has gotten the most attention in farm  country is the fact that the dairy protections in Canada have been  changed so we have a chance to send our dairy products to Canada from  Ohio and other dairy States. It is more than that. It also affects  commodities--wheat, soybeans, and corn--and our proteins: beef,  poultry, and pork. This is really going to help our farmers. That is  why 1,000 farm groups around the country have supported this agreement.   Again, with what is going on with China, with the smaller markets,  with the difficult weather we have had, and the fact of low prices for  commodity crops--all are real problems--this is a godsend. It is really  needed for our farmers.   A lot of Democrats are telling me: Rob, this is just like the NAFTA  agreement in so many respects.   It is really not. It is a different agreement. The truth of the  matter is that this agreement is going to catch us up to the 21st  century with regard to our important trade relationship with our two  neighbors to the north and south. It is about improved market access  for manufacturing and a level playing field for workers and farmers. It  is about being sure that we have the ability in the modern digital  economy to get a fair shake. Put these two agreements side-by-side, and  this is a much-needed upgrade. It has to get a vote, and, if it does, I  think it will pass.   With all the improvements we talked about today, this is not just an  exercise in rebranding NAFTA. This is about a new agreement that is  really a big difference, and it is a binary choice. Are you for this  new agreement, which is better in every respect, or are you for the  status quo, which is NAFTA?   My hope is that the House will take this to the floor, and, if they  do, I think it will pass. It will then come to the Senate, and I am  confident that in the Senate we will have the support to pass this on a  bipartisan basis.   What I am most confident in is the fact that American workers,  farmers, and service providers are going to have the chance to improve  their economic opportunities because this agreement is going to be good  for all of them.   There is a lot of politics going on right now, and I get that. But,  folks, this is not even an election year. Let's finish it up this year  before we get into the 2020 election year. Let's be sure that before  Thanksgiving, we have the agreement passed in the House and sent to the  Senate to take a look at it.   It is too important. We need to keep the American people first and  put politics second and get this done.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Area  Progress Council of Warren, County, Ohio, in honor of their 50th  anniversary.   The Area Progress Council, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, was  formally incorporated 50 years ago on September 30, 1969. The mission  was and continues to be to plan and promote positive growth and  development of Warren County, OH. It works with local, State, and  Federal governments to promote representation of community interests,  facilitates programs to promote current and future leaders, and  supports initiatives to promote a positive and proactive climate for  economic growth.   For example, Project Excellence Endowment, established in 1987, seeks  to annually identify, recognize, and reward excellent public educators  in Warren County. In addition, Leadership Warren County was developed  in 2000 to create a dynamic network of informed decision-makers whose  increased awareness and commitment to serve will energize its citizens  to shape the county's future.   APC has supported and collaborated with many organizations,  including: Little Miami Conservatory (1967); Warren County Park  District (1970); United Way of Warren County (1970); County Planner  (1972); Warren County Career Center (1976); Ralph J. Stolle Countryside  YMCA (1976); Warren County Big Brothers Big Sisters (1978); Well-head  and Aquifer Protection (1992-1994); Widening (1994-1999); Warren County  College Task Force (2001-2003); establishment of Sinclair Mason Campus  (2007); and Rachel A Hutzel Observatory project located at Camp Joy  (2011).   Ongoing efforts include organizing the Annual Warren County Economic  Outlook Breakfast, since 1983; hosting the State of the County, since  1990; and organizing the Columbus Excursion, since 2000, where a group  of educators and business men and women travel to Columbus to meet with  the directors of the Ohio Department of Education in the morning and  State legislators in the afternoon.   I congratulate the Area Progress Council of Warren County on their  50th anniversary and thank them for the work they do for  Ohioans.                            ____________________
