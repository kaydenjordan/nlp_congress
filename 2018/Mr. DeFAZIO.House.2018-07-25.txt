 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if you look at how transportation funds are administered  to the Tribes, first off, it is a pathetic and inadequate amount of  money, given the infrastructure problems that the Tribes have. But  then, that is true of infrastructure, writ large, across the United  States of America.   Secondly, we think it was 1860 or 1870, the Tribes do not directly  receive these funds. There are various Federal agencies involved, and  sometimes State agencies involved, in the disbursal of those funds and  the approval of the projects under those funds.                                time  1430    This legislation was part of the FAST Act, which would give Tribal  self-governance. They would be able to administer their own funds  without anybody taking off administrative costs, without bureaucratic  delay, and set their own priorities on their own lands. I sponsored  this into the FAST Act. It was unanimously accepted at the time.   Now, we thought, when we passed the FAST Act that 3 years would be  long enough for the Department of Transportation to consult with the  Tribes. We set up a committee to come to consensus on the rules for  self-governance. Well, unfortunately, it was slowed down because of the  Presidential election. After the Presidential election, this committee  did not meet for the entire year of 2017. And then, this year,  essentially, DOT had some meetings, but then presented sort of a take- it-or-leave-it to the Tribes, which the Tribes find unacceptable.   Now, unfortunately, the Tribes can't prolong the negotiations unless  we change the law, because the law set a deadline of December 2018. And  because of the way that bureaucratic rulemaking process works, DOT  would have to put out their rule in August while we are out of town and  without having reached any consensus or having had any meaningful  conversation with the Tribes under the rules for which they should be  able to administer their own funds for their own projects.   So this bill is quite simple. It extends the deadline so that DOT  won't rush out a rule that is opposed by the Tribes, which, obviously,  destroys the entire intent of this legislation. This  [[Page H7640]]  would provide an additional year. And, hopefully, with some prodding,  and maybe a different Congress next year, we can get DOT's attention  and get them to meaningfully consult with the sovereign nations, with  the Tribes, to come up with a bill that is agreed to both by the  Department of Transportation and the Tribes.   Mr. Speaker, this is quite simple. It has broad bipartisan support. I  am not aware of any opposition. I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, both for his  leadership on these issues, and for the time. And I also would  congratulate Chairman Young and others, particularly Suzanne Bonamici,  from my State, who has taken a real leadership role on the issue of  marine debris.   We are choking the oceans to death. The lifeblood of our planet, the  lungs of our planet, it is becoming a giant garbage dump. The Pacific  Gyre can be seen from space. It is a massive gyre in the middle of the  Pacific Ocean and we have to begin to deal seriously with these issues.   It was just this week in the New York Times, photographs of the  Dominican Republic, known for its pristine beaches, which had giant  bulldozers on the beach trying to eat through about an 8-foot tall pile  of plastic debris on the beaches. So this threatens the marine  environment and all that which is dependent upon it, the creatures that  live there, and those of us who harvest from that. And it is  threatening tourism and recreation. Obviously, this has to be dealt  with.   I will say, this is good legislation, but it is a pathetic amount of  money. The amount of money that Congress is putting out to deal with  something that is threatening the very oceans that surround us probably  isn't adequate to clean up the little--I live on a boat down there  inside Hains Point--probably that little section of water inside Hains  Point down by Fort McNair. I don't even think $10 million could clean  that up, let alone the oceans. So we need to get a little more serious  about this and really put up additional funds.   So that is very important legislation. Title II is something about  which I am very passionate. The worst maritime disaster since 1983, and  obviously, there is a lot of blame to go around on that disaster. But  one of the factors was that ship was not fit. It had been certified by  an independent party which is called, under the law, a recognized  organization, as fit to go to sea.   Now, why would that happen? Well, because the recognized  organizations get paid by the shipping companies. Now, I am not going  to hire you if you tell me my ship isn't fit to go to sea, which is  what they should have been telling TOTE. They didn't tell them because,  hey, we want more of your business. We will go out and certify some  more of your unfit ships and kill more people. This has got to end.   The Coast Guard is also at fault. They were not providing enough  oversight to these recognized organizations, and had let their own  marine safety division, under this privatization scheme, deteriorate to  the point where they couldn't even keep up with the paperwork.   So this bill is going to begin to rectify those issues and revitalize  the Coast Guard maritime safety organization, and also, bring new  scrutiny on these recognized organizations so they don't kill any more  people and send unfit ships to sea.   Finally, the legislation, the third part of this is, I think, a  tremendous accomplishment by the Ranking Member,  John Garamendi, which  is his Blue Tech center and Blue Oceans. The Coast Guard has,  unfortunately--again, we have underfunded the Coast Guard, so Congress  is at fault for many of these things; maritime safety and the lack of  initiative of the Coast Guard in terms of adopting new 21st century  technologies to better perform their mission and make the sea-lane  safer and better understand what is going on in the oceans around us.   So, maybe we will get, someday, to name the Blue Tech Center after  Mr. Garamendi, but not until he is long gone, so he is not in a hurry  for that.   So anyway, I want to congratulate him, and congratulate others who  have been involved, and thank Chairman Shuster for moving this  legislation.
