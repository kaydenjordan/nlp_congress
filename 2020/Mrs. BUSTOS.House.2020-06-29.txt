 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today to support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Enhancement Act.   So many in our Nation are facing extreme financial insecurity and  extreme worry surrounding this global pandemic. And the Trump  administration is trying to eliminate protections for people and  families with preexisting conditions and leave millions of Americans  without care. This includes more than 730,000 Illinoisans.   A man from the congressional district I serve named Robert wrote to  me about his family's rising healthcare costs. Robert and his wife have  both worked hard almost their entire lives. Robert's first job went  back to the age of 17. His wife started working when she was 16.   Today, they are in their early sixties and they are facing  skyrocketing premiums and astronomical deductibles. Robert currently  pays more than $2,500 each and every month for just his premiums. That,  along with his deductibles, cost his family about a quarter of all they  earn every month. He has even been told that because of his age and his  wife's age they are lucky to get coverage at all.   Working your whole life and having to struggle so much just to afford  a necessity like healthcare, that is not what the American Dream is all  about.   Robert said to me, ``I am hoping more than lip service will happen in  Washington, D.C.'' For Robert and his wife and so many other Americans,  we must pass this bill to lower the cost of healthcare and the cost of  prescription drugs, and also to protect people with preexisting  conditions.
