 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today the Senate will wrap up  consideration of a broad bipartisan effort to update our approach to  competition with China. This bill has accelerated an important  conversation on a topic we all know deserves our full attention. From  critical supply chains to intellectual property, to counterespionage,  it touches on key issues that will help determine our strategic footing  for decades.   That is why an overwhelming majority of us, myself included, voted to  proceed to the measure here on the floor, not because the bill was  already perfect. In fact, as the ranking member of the Commerce  Committee noted when it was reported out, the legislation was ``not  ready for prime time.''   Rather, we took it up precisely because it deserved robust debate and  amendment. So I was glad that several of our colleagues were allowed to  offer substantial revisions here on the floor. In particular, I am glad  the Democratic leader thought better of blocking Chairman Wyden and  Ranking Member Crapo from including their bipartisan provision on  combating illicit trade practices.   But I was disappointed that he proceeded with an effort to end this  important debate without allowing the Senate to consider a number of  other outstanding Republican amendments.   There is no practical reason our consideration of this important  issue should have to compete for sufficient space on the Democrats'  dance card.   We are talking about making America more competitive with its biggest  and fastest growing rival. If any issue demands thorough, exhaustive  debate, it is this one.   Unfortunately, the final bill we will be voting on today will remain  incomplete. It includes several smart, targeted measures but leaves  many more on the table. And so it will advance as an imperfect approach  to an extremely consequential challenge.   One thing this legislation did demonstrate extremely well, however,  was that the rules of the Senate don't stand in the way of bipartisan  legislating.   Needless to say, final passage of this legislation cannot be the  Senate's final word--final word on our competition with China. It  certainly won't be mine. As I have warned repeatedly, soft power is  only as strong as the hard power underpinning it.   The Chinese Communist Party doesn't hesitate in investing the  proceeds of its predatory trade practices and influence campaigns  directly into modernizing its hard power arsenal.   Over the past two decades, defense spending in Beijing has increased  astronomically. Meanwhile, the Biden administration's proposal for  defense spending puts forward such a meager--meager--year-on-year  increase, it fails to keep pace with inflation, let alone with our  rivals.   The White House request would degrade our ability to project power  [[Page S3969]]  quickly out in the Western Pacific. It would cannibalize Pacific  Deterrence Initiative funds intended to build infrastructure and  enhance interoperability with our partners in the region just to cover  shortfalls elsewhere in the budget. And it would cut procurement of  critical munitions that are already in short supply.   The administration is playing a dangerous shell game, and the  political consequences aren't lost on either side of the Pacific.   The perception that the United States might be any less than fully  committed to prevailing in great power competition has left China  emboldened and our friends in the region quite worried.   Here at home, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs sounded the alarm,  warning that great power peace was ``fraying at the edge.''   Preserving that peace will require more than the action we will take  today. It will require this administration to get serious about funding  our national defense. It will require major investment in the sorts of  cutting-edge capabilities that deter those who intend harm on America  and our allies.   So in the coming weeks, we will see whether Democrats' talk about  rebuilding alliances has any substance to it. In the annual Defense  authorization and the appropriations process, the Senate will embrace  this essential debate about restoring America's hard power head-on.  This is a pivotal moment, not a time for half measures on America's  national security.                                  January 6    Mr. President, now on another matter, today, the Homeland Security  and Rules Committees released the conclusions of their monthslong  investigation into the circumstances of the unprecedented breach of  security here at the Capitol on January 6.   I am grateful to our colleagues on both committees whose hard work  made this invaluable report possible.   My assessment of the terrible events of the 6th has been consistent  from the beginning. I have condemned the perpetrators, as well as those  who enabled and encouraged them, and I have given full-throated support  to our colleagues' bipartisan inquiry, along with the work of Federal  investigators and prosecutors, to ensure that every criminal  participant faces justice.   The Rules and Homeland Security report identifies a number of serious  shortcomings in Capitol security that were exposed and exploited on the  6th. It directs our attention to the most glaring gaps that could leave  the complex vulnerable to future incidents.   Through the efforts of the Capitol Police, the Senate Sergeant At  Arms, and other institutional partners, the Senate's work to close  these gaps is already well underway. The committee's inquiry into  January 6 is ongoing, and the nationwide search for a new Chief of the  Capitol Police is making progress. Our colleagues' latest findings  should guide the entire institution's ongoing security reviews.   Today's report is one of the many reasons I am confident in the  ability of existing investigations to uncover all actionable facts  about the events of January 6. I will continue to support these efforts  over any that seek to politicize the process, and I would urge my  colleagues to do the same.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, Southeastern Kentucky lost Eula Hall  this May, a humanitarian titan who blessed her community with  generosity, tenacity, and dedication. Eula was a self-described  ``hillbilly activist'' whose efforts to improve healthcare in Kentucky  enhanced the lives of her neighbors and friends. As the founder of the  Mud Creek Clinic, now known as the Eula Hall Health Center, Eula was  driven by her selfless spirit to deliver quality care to thousands of  Kentuckians. Today, I recognize Eula Hall as a lifelong champion of  Floyd County and the entire Southeastern Kentucky region.   Eula founded the Mud Creek Clinic in 1973 with a $1,400 donation and  a calling to improve healthcare in her disadvantaged community. She  served everyone, regardless of their ability to pay, through a primary  care clinic, mental health counselor, pharmacy, and food and clothing  pantry. Even after her clinic burned down in 1982, Eula did not miss a  day of service, delivering help directly from her own home. She  redefined healthcare in Southeastern Kentucky from the ground up,  leaving an indelible impact on the region.   Eula was born into extreme poverty, growing up without plumbing or  electricity and only receiving an eighth-grade education. In spite of  these obstacles, she was driven by a higher calling to serve her  community. When Eula founded the Mud Creek Clinic, she did so based on  a conviction that all Kentuckians, regardless of income, deserved to be  cared for by their neighbors. Her work quickly caught the attention of  local leaders and physicians, bringing much needed resources to her  distressed region.   She was a local activist from a young age, driven by the struggles  and suffering she saw during her childhood. Motivated by a desire to  assist the vulnerable, Eula gave help to the needy and a voice to the  voiceless through an ever-expanding series of projects. With an  unflappable work ethic, Eula would go on to run the Mud Creek Water  District, piping drinking water to 800 homes, and served as the  president of the Kentucky Black Lung Association. Her tireless,  grassroots efforts have left an enduring legacy of community-based  activism in Southeastern Kentucky.   Eula's industriousness permeated every aspect of her life, even as  she entered old age. Just last year, she was working on a proposal to  found a nursing home in her area as a response to the COVID-19  pandemic. In recognition of her determination and tenacity, Eula  received a number of awards, including honorary doctorates from Berea,  Midway, and Pikeville colleges in Kentucky and Trinity College in  Connecticut. She was also the subject of a landmark book on healthcare  in Eastern Kentucky, ``Mud Creek Medicine,'' by Kiran Bhatraju. She led  a vibrant family, and is survived by 4 children, 8 grandchildren, 14  great-grandchildren, and 5 great-great-grandchildren.   I had the opportunity to speak with Eula just a few weeks before she  passed and expressed my deep appreciation for her decades of hard work.  During our numerous conversations and visits, I was always struck by  her ceaseless devotion to Southeastern Kentuckians. Eula was honored  with tributes from around the country, including from the U.S. Senate,  but she never sought the spotlight. She preferred to dedicate her  entire focus to the needy in her community.   After her passing, Eula was recognized by both the Wall Street  Journal and the New York Times, demonstrating the nationwide impact of  her work. She was one of the toughest women I ever met, and it was an  absolute pleasure to work with her over the years to deliver much  needed help to Kentucky communities. I would like to express my  personal gratitude for Eula Hall's decades of service to the  Commonwealth and encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in sharing  condolences with her family, colleagues, and neighbors, whose lives  were uplifted by this one-of-a-kind Kentuckian.                            ____________________     Madam President, during a year of unprecedented  challenges, students, staff, and faculty at the University of Kentucky  have been fortunate to have Eric King as their tireless advocate and  supporter. As UK's executive director of federal relations, Eric has  made lasting contributions to Kentucky's students, professors, and  administrators. In recognition of that hard work, Eric was honored last  month by the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities with the  Jennifer Poulakidas Outstanding Achievement Award. Today, I, too, would  like to recognize Eric for his strong advocacy on behalf of the  University of Kentucky community and our State as a whole.   Eric has been making contributions to Kentucky higher education since  he was an undergrad, serving as the student body president of Murray  State University. Since then, he has dedicated his career to helping  Kentuckians. Fresh out of college, Eric served as a legislative  correspondent in my office and was later promoted to a legislative  assistant focused on energy, agriculture, and environmental policy. He  contributed to the passage of the Agricultural Act of 2014, which  delivered major wins for Kentucky farmers and their families.   Eric also served as the director of government and community affairs  at the Kentucky Association of Electric Cooperatives, KAEC. There, he  advocated for a statewide association of 24 consumer-owned electric  distribution utilities that collectively serve nearly 2 million  Kentuckians. I know that Eric's work at that organization had a real  and lasting impact on Kentucky families.   Now, Eric has taken his advocacy skills to the University of  Kentucky, working closely with President Eli Capilouto to promote the  well-being of more than 30,000 students, 12,000 staff, and 2,000  faculty. When the coronavirus pandemic threatened to shut down colleges  and universities across the country, Eric stepped up and fought to  include vital funding for higher education in the Coronavirus Aid,  Relief, and Economic Security, CARES, Act. Because of advocacy like  Eric's, the CARES Act included the Higher Education Emergency Relief  Fund, providing millions of dollars to colleges and universities to  overcome the challenges imposed by the pandemic. Thousands of Kentucky  students and graduates benefited from Eric's leadership.   Eric has been described by his colleagues as a man with ``unmatched  integrity'' and a ``can-do attitude'' who has made ``incredible  contributions'' to our Nation's system of public and land-grant  universities. As Eric's former boss, I can confirm that these  superlatives are correct. His hard work during the coronavirus pandemic  provided vital protection to our colleges and universities, both in  Kentucky and nationwide.   Kentuckians--and especially Wildcats--are grateful for Eric's  tireless dedication to our State's public university system. On behalf  of the Senate, I would like to express my congratulations to Eric for  receiving this award and my thanks for his service and leadership amid  a time of incredible hardship.
