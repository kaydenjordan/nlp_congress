 Mr. President, I join with my colleagues today. I  appreciate the Senator from Oregon and his remarks. I join with him and  the others who have spoken to express my grave concerns about the  nomination of Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency.   It is really unacceptable to me that someone who denies climate  change science could be put in charge of an agency that is really  tasked with advancing our national strategy to address climate change  and the ills resulting. Mr. Pruitt has said--the overwhelming evidence  to the contrary--that the debate is far from settled. He denies what is  happening in regards to the evidence and the science and the  conclusions of the near consensus of scientists.   Time and again, this attorney general from Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt, has  filed suits actually to block the EPA's clean air and clean water  regulations protocols, which have allowed the United States to lead the  efforts to reduce carbon emissions and address the climate crisis we  face.   There are few issues, in my opinion, that are as urgent as this, and  across the globe that we must meaningfully do something collectively  about. America must lead and not have a leader on this issue that is  now so far out of step with global consensus. Everyone, from scientists  and climate experts to business leaders and even our own military  officials, understands that climate change is a real threat, not just  to our environment but also to our economy, to the health of our people  and our national security.   It is disturbing that, in a way--and it also defies common sense--if  you hear the way some people talk about climate change, including our  President-elect and Mr. Pruitt, you might think that not only is  climate change not a problem but that it is not our problem. This could  not be further from the truth. We are already, here in America, dealing  with and seeing the very real impact of climate change.   Ask anyone living in my home State along the shore or a family in  Louisiana whose home has been destroyed by severe flooding or a farmer  whose land has become barren from the droughts in California whether or  not these consequences are real for their families. Yet, the President- elect and Mr. Pruitt not only refuse to acknowledge the consequences  that we are facing but the dangerous and destructive path ahead. They  are failing to face that if we fail to act.   Now, the facts of climate change are worth repeating. Air  temperatures are rising. Ocean temperatures are increasing. The ocean  is becoming far more acidic. Sea levels are rising, both because of  expansion of warming oceans and because of the melting of land-based  snow and ice that is now entering our oceans. Many mountain glaciers  are melting away and the Arctic sea ice is decreasing.   Climate change is an American issue and it is a global issue.  Addressing climate change should be a cause where we find agreement  across political and geographic divides. In many ways, it already is.  We have seen 36 Noble prize winners come together in 2015 in a historic  declaration on the threats of climate change. Brad Schmidt, winner of  the 2011 Noble Prize in Physics stated: ``I see this issue as the  single greatest threat to human prosperity.''   That is why, in late December 2015, 195 countries signed the Paris  Agreement, a historic global agreement to meaningfully address climate  change. That is why the Climate and Security Advisory Group, a  nonpartisan group of 43 military and national security experts,  including former military officials, spoke out to urge the next  administration to ``comprehensively address the security risks of  climate change at all levels of national security planning.''   That is why more than 300 American businesses--significant economic  engines of our economy--sent a letter to the President-elect urging him  to address climate change and to continue America's participation in  the Paris Agreement, saying: ``Implementing the Paris Agreement will  enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of  dollars in existing law-carbon investments into trillions of dollars  the world needs to bring clean energy and prosperity to all.''   You see, that is the false narrative--that somehow people's working  on the climate change issue is done at the expense of businesses. But  business leaders understand that there is a tremendous opportunity in  the new economy--in a green-energy economy. There is tremendous  agreement that America should be leading on this innovation and these  ideas, not following that of others around the globe.   They are health care folks who understand the challenges to American  health. That is why the American Lung Association warned that ``climate  change threatens the health of millions of people. While everyone is at  risk for the harms of climate change and air pollution, those most at  risk include infants, children, older adults, and those with lung  disease (such as asthma and COPD), cardiovascular disease or diabetes.  They are the ones who must rush to the emergency room when they cannot  breathe because of worsened ozone pollution during a heat wave, or when  smoke blows into their yard from wildfires that may be burning hundreds  of miles away.''   When we talk about climate change, we aren't talking about ideology  or opinion. We are talking about science and evidence. We are talking  about national security. We are talking about creating greater economic  prosperity, and obviously we are talking about public health.   America cannot sit idly by. We cannot be sidelined in this effort,  not just because we produce such a significant amount of the climate- changing chemicals and byproducts but also because we don't want to  shirk the opportunities of being a leader in this space. And the  American people really understand this. They understand that this isn't  a lose-lose, that this could be a win-win for America and the globe.  And that is why, according to a Gallop poll from March of last year--it  said clearly that the majority of Americans are worried about global  warming, and the majority of Americans believe global warming is a  result of manmade pollution.   I understand that for many people climate change is not an immediate  urgency and reality, but, again, we should understand that right now,  many of our more vulnerable Americans are suffering as a result. I see  this when I go home from here in Washington to Newark. Newark has  almost an epidemic level of asthma, with kids missing school because of  this health and lung risk. The facts are clear: The pollutants kids  breathe are real. For families living in communities on the shore in my  State who are still rebuilding after Superstorm Sandy, the facts are  clear: Their homes are being destroyed by unpredictable weather events.  In New Jersey, we have seen the damage up and down our coast, with  rising sea levels, flooding, and extreme weather.   We know that those who can least afford it--low-income, hard-working  families--are severely impacted around the country. Communities that  are poor, often minority populations, disproportionately endure pain  and suffering related to changes in the weather due to climate change.   We know that when evacuation orders are given, those who can afford  to leave their homes face a far different reality than those who have  financial constraints.   Not only is it more difficult for working families to deal with  climate-related issues, but the neighborhoods and communities in which  they live are often the ones that are more affected by the rising  temperatures and the pollution caused by climate change. One researcher  who conducted a 2014 study  [[Page S339]]  on the effects of climate change reported that ``generally, higher  poverty neighborhoods are warmer, and wealthier neighborhoods are  cooler.'' We see that in cities in New Jersey.   Multiple studies continue to show that poorer communities are more  likely to be exposed to harmful pollutants than higher income  communities. One study from the University of Minnesota found that  Americans of color are exposed on average to 38 percent higher levels  of outdoor nitrogen dioxide and that disparities in exposure amount to  about 7,000 deaths a year from the health problems caused by these  realities.   Climate change is already posing real dangers. The most recent  National Climate Assessment released in 2014 noted that communities in  rural America, as well as urban communities, have already experienced  consequences of climate change, including ``crop and livestock loss  from severe drought and flooding, damage to levees and roads from  extreme storms, shifts in planting and harvesting times, and large- scale losses from fires and other weather-related disasters.'' The  report concludes that ``these impacts have profound effects, often  significantly affecting the health and well-being of rural residents  and communities.''   In States like Oklahoma, for example, where the State legislature  mandated a study on the potential impacts of climate change, the group  commissioned to do that study, the Oklahoma Climatological Survey,  definitively concluded the following:         The Earth's climate has warmed during the last 100 years.       The Earth's climate will continue to warm for the foreseeable       future. Much of the global average temperature increases over       the last 50 years can be attributed to human activities,       particularly increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.       Oklahoma will be impacted.    Undoubtedly, New Jersey, Oklahoma--where Mr. Pruitt is from--and the  rest of our country and the world will continue to be impacted by this  problem, especially if America does not lead and falls behind.   We have made great strides, though, in addressing climate change  under President Obama, including critical tax credits for wind and  solar energy that not only help deal with climate change but also help  American businesses thrive and lead, with now more people being  employed by solar than coal. We have the historic Paris agreement and  EPA regulations to reduce emissions from the electric power and  transportation sectors. We are making strides of which we all should be  proud, and actually our economy is benefiting as a result.   The United States has now emerged as a global leader in meaningfully  addressing climate change. We cannot afford to slow down this progress,  but I am afraid that under the leadership of President-Elect Donald  Trump, that is exactly where we are headed. Despite scientific  evidence, popular concern, and the real-life impacts of climate change  being evidenced in communities all across the country, all different  backgrounds, from urban to rural, our President-elect and his nominee  for the EPA, Attorney General Scott Pruitt, plan to advance special  interests ahead of the common interest, of the global interest, of  America's interests.   The United States has a long legacy of leading, being a global leader  in times of crisis, and at a time when we see the realities of climate  change, at a time when we and many scientists are concluding that there  is a global crisis and military leaders are concluding that we have a  global crisis, at a time when we are seeing the effect of that crisis  being made real in regions across our Nation and our planet Earth,  America must not waiver in its commitment.   I believe the Environmental Protection Agency deserves a leader who  is prepared to lead--not deny, not retreat, not equivocate, not  surrender ground that we have gained. We deserve to have an EPA leader  who is just that--someone who stands up to lead, who makes the  difficult choices and finds ways to unify our country, to pull from the  wisdom of the military, the wisdom of businesses, the wisdom of  communities like the one in which I live, and chart a course for this  country that helps to lead the globe, lead planet Earth out of this  crisis and into the strength we can find through American leadership. I  believe that is the task: that we can save our environment and create  incredible prosperity in the future.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
