 Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time  I have risen on this House floor to congratulate the Rochester Rockets  football team on a State championship that they just won, just this  past week, at Huskie Stadium in DeKalb, Illinois.   Rochester played the Chicago St. Rita Mustangs for the title, winning  it by a score of 42 to 28. The Rockets came out strong with three  touchdowns early, giving them a 21 to nothing lead at the end of the  first quarter.   With four touchdown passes between quarterback Clay Bruno and  receiver Hank Beatty, the Rockets proved that they meant business. The  dynamic duo put on an offensive showcase with Bruno completing 18 of  his 25 passes for 313 yards, and Beatty hauling in 12 catches for 212  yards. Rochester's offense was as dominant as ever, making it nearly  impossible for St. Rita to create any sort of momentum.   In addition to a powerhouse offense, the Rockets' defensive line  showed up to work. Senior, Logan Peters, had 11 tackles, and sophomore,  Johnny Neal, had 7. Neal was playing JV halfway through the season and  got a 14-yard sack on the quarterback and a fumble recovery.   This is the Rockets' eighth State championship in 10 years, and this  is the first one that they achieved in the higher 5A classification.  Leave it to Coach Derek Leonard and the entire Rochester Rockets team  and the community to get bumped up, by maybe a student or two, into a  higher class and just go ahead and win a State championship there, too.   Congratulations to Coach Leonard. Congratulations to all of Coach  Leonard's assistant coaches and to the entire Rockets community on  another well-deserved State championship.                      Congratulating Coach Brent Weakly     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Coach Brent Weakly and the Central A&M High School  football team on their Class 1A State runner-up title. Last week they  played a great game with the Lena-Winslow Panthers, but lost in the 1A  State championship.   This year was the team's first year since 2001 that the Raiders have  made an appearance at the IHSA State championship game, and while they  didn't bring home a win, they held their heads high following last  Friday's game.   A&M's quarterback, Connor Heaton, threw for 192 yards and two  touchdowns. Connor has come a long way since I used to drop my kids off  with him at the same babysitter in Taylorville a few short years ago.                                time  1030    Receiver Jacob Paradee had 11 receptions, a tie for most all-time in  a Class 1A championship game. His 157 receiving yards broke a 1A record  that was set back in 2006.   All said and done, A&M had its best season in 18 years. Coach Weakly  said it best of his team: ``Hats off to our kids. They kept competing.  . . . I'm really happy and proud of them.''   I am happy and proud of them, too. We are proud of the coach, his  entire coaching staff, and the entire Central A&M community.   Congrats on a great season.            Marking One Year of Recovery for Taylorville, Illinois     Mr. Speaker, it has been 1 year since  an EF-3 tornado ripped through my hometown of Taylorville, Illinois.   More than 700 structures were damaged and 33 were destroyed that  night, but not a single life was lost.   I thank God for looking over Taylorville that night, and I am  thankful for the critical decisions made by our former fire chief, Mike  Crews, and our current mayor, Bruce Barry. Their actions likely saved  countless lives.   It is a night I will never forget, not only because of the  destruction I saw when arriving back into my community minutes after  the tornado ravaged it, but it is also the damage I saw the next day in  daylight.   I am also amazed by the generosity that we saw from so many people  outside our community. Hundreds of volunteers came out to assist with  the cleanup, and donations poured in from across the State and the  Nation to help those in need.   Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank Ed Legg and those others who  make up Missions for Taylorville for coordinating getting these  donations out to those families in need.   We gathered this past weekend at the Taylorville VFW Post as a  community to remember that night, to thank our first responders and  volunteers for their work, and also to remind everybody that many  families are still in need of help.   Mr. Speaker, 1 year after this devastating tornado, I again thank all  those who continue to help my hometown recover and to pray for the  families still in need.   We are all Taylorville Strong.                            ____________________
