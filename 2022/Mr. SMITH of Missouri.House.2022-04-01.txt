 Mr. Speaker, Democrat policies have created  multiple crises: the highest spike in prices in 40 years, gas prices  over $4 a gallon, a violent crime crisis, school closures that have  drastically harmed our children, and so many other items.   President Biden's budget, which was released this week, deliberately  makes every crisis American families are facing that much worse.   With $73 trillion in spending, Biden doubles down on his delusion  that spending more will cause inflation to go down when Americans are  facing a $5,200 inflation tax this year.   Biden's budget charges Americans another $2.5 trillion in taxes,  upward of $4 trillion if you count the build back broke agenda, which  he tries to put in the budget as being free.   American families can't afford what this budget is costing.                            ____________________
