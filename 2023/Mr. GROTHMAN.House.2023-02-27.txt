 Mr. Speaker, I would address the same article that one  of my Democrat colleagues mentioned earlier today about an article that  was published in The New York Times over the weekend addressing what is  going on with a segment of some of the people who have come across the  border inappropriately over the last few years.   Now, things have changed with the parole policy. We don't know how  that is going to shake out. We have multiplied by 11 or 12 times the  number of people coming to this country illegally since President Biden  took office. We have gone from about 20,000 people a month to just  short of 240,000 people a month.   Mr. Speaker, I will address a subset of that population, and that is  the young children. Approximately 9,000 to 10,000 unaccompanied minors  are coming across our border every month without either parent.   What becomes of these 10,000 children every month who don't have  either parent with them?   Well, The New York Times found out what happens to some of them. They  wind up working in very dangerous working conditions. That is what  happens when you let people cross the border without their parents  being able to look out for them.   Mr. Speaker, 10,000 children left to cross the border unaccompanied.   Others, like the little girl referenced in the article in The New  York Times, came here with a relative she didn't even know before  this--if he really was a relative. This is something that bothers the  Border Patrol.   Mr. Speaker, I really wish some of the Democrats would come down to  the border and find out what is really going on down there. The Border  Patrol and Republicans have been complaining repeatedly about all these  unaccompanied minors. In the past when we had to separate parents from  their kids for 2 weeks, for a month--and I believe there was only a  total of about 4,000 kids there--the Democrats were screaming bloody  murder.   How dare you separate these people from their parents for even a  couple weeks.                                time  1245    Now we have children, over 120,000 last year, separated from their  parents, perhaps permanently, and that is at least 120,000.   The Border Patrol feels that sometimes when people are bringing  children across the border, they are only pretending to be their  parents.   Sometimes the Border Patrol does DNA checks, and they find still more  children who are being separated from their parents.   We wish they had the time and the money to do DNA tests on all the  parents because I am sure The New York Times number is actually greater  than that.   Then they are spread around the country. We would not allow that for  our children, right? If somebody from this country--and what they do,  so you understand, is the children show up at the southern border with  an address--maybe it is written on their shirt or something--I want to  go to 123 Elm Street, Portland, Oregon. Our U.S. Government will  deliver them to 123 Elm Street, Portland, Oregon, even though neither  parent is there, even though we haven't done thorough checks on the  people who are there.   We have no idea--we do, we have some idea, but not enough of an idea,  who these young kids are being told they have to live with.   Interestingly, The New York Times and my colleague on the other side  of the aisle, they are concerned about the working conditions, but they  mention nothing at all about the fact that these children are separated  from their parents--neither parent. Isn't that something that should be  a concern?   I realize you are the party of Black Lives Matter, Black Lives  Matter, we condemn the nuclear family, da, da, da, da, da.   I assure you: A child is better off with its parents, better off with  both its parents, and this idea that apparently it is okay to let  children cross the southern border if only they have a nice job when  they are 16 years old is ridiculous. The United States ought not to be  part of breaking up these families.   Now, the other thing I would like to point out that The New York  Times doesn't mention at all: A lot of times kids show up at the  southern border with a single parent.   In this country, if there is a divorce, we do what we can to try to  make sure the child has some experience or contact with both parents.   I am sure the Central American countries would like it. I am told by  the Border Patrol the Central American countries do not like the Biden  policy of having young people come here, because they feel they are  losing their future. They don't want to have all their young people  come to this country.   I realize that Biden is all about, you know, changing America,  getting apparently as many people here as quickly as possible, from far  away as possible. We don't care if the parents are separated.   Believe me--and just a little bit of racism here, maybe--in this  country, we would not want one parent taking a child without the other  parent signing off and moving to another country or moving to a  different part of this country.   Apparently, when it comes to children from Latin America, the Biden  administration and The New York Times is okay with that.   I intend to hold hearings in my subcommittee. Please look out for the  children at the southern border.                            ____________________
