 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6363, the Further Continuing  Appropriations Act. I applaud Speaker Johnson for his leadership in  avoiding a harmful government shutdown, especially near the holidays. I  also thank Chairwoman Granger for her work in putting together this  clean continuing resolution.   No one dislikes CRs more than the Appropriations Committee. As  chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, I know  the importance of enacting full-year bills to address issues like the  nuclear weapons modernization programs at the Department of Energy and  the navigation, flood and storm-damage reduction projects of the Army  Corps of Engineers.   House Republicans all agree we need to get the Federal Government on  a more fiscally responsible path, but lengthy government shutdowns  don't save money. They actually cost more money. The CR will give us  time to reach an agreement on a top-line spending level and to  negotiate final bills with the United States Senate.   The two-step deadlines will also prevent a massive omnibus right  before the holidays. A vote in favor of this continuing resolution is  the only fiscally responsible vote.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
