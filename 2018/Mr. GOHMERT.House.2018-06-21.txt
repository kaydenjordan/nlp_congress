 Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting week.   We were told when we were starting the week that we were going to be  taking up a couple of immigration bills. Before we could even get that  started, we were met with a firestorm of absolute outrage about  children being separated from their parents.   Well, anybody who is a parent doesn't want that to happen, even  though, as a felony judge in Texas, I know. I watched it happened  constantly. It happens every day in our country. It is heartbreaking,  but it happens every day all over the country when any person in the  United States commits a crime and is taken to jail.   I watched it happen over and over in my courtroom. Your heart breaks  for their children. You can't let the children go to jail with the  parent. Sometimes there is somebody else to take care of them.  Sometimes it is Child Protective Services. But it is still  heartbreaking. That is what we have seen on the border.   We have a President and Attorney General trying to follow their oath  and enforce the law. But it is heartbreaking when you see some of these  pictures like the first one here. When I saw that, my heart broke for  this beautiful little boy in a blue shirt--actually, I think this is a  separate picture, and these are two others--initially, just seeing  this, where it looks like he is in a cage.   You feel bad that Jeff Sessions as Attorney General and President  Trump are the ones in office when this is going on. But then we find  out actually he is a child of one of the protesters that is protesting  the Trump administration. He is not really incarcerated. This was  completely trumped up, so to speak, by the media and by the groups that  are trying to do everything they can since  [[Page H5504]]  the stories about Russia collusion turned out to have more to do with  the Clinton campaign colluding with the Russians than Trump.   Well, this has to be another source of attack. Again, it is just  heart-wrenching to see a child like that, until you find out he is not  really in a cage. He is not somebody that the Trump administration was  restraining. In fact, here is the same little boy skipping around over  here on the other side of the fence with the protesters. So it turns  out he is not.   But then we look at some of these other pictures here. We will do  this in rapid order, because we are running out of time.   Here you have all of these people, many of them children, in this  facility and a chain link fence everywhere. It is treating them like  animals, basically. They are all under these shiny blankets. It is  tragic. But then we found out, actually, that was while President Obama  was in office and then conditions improved dramatically.   This is another tragic picture. Tragic. It does look like they are  caged animals. Again, they were appearing to be caged animals during  the Obama administration. President Obama was responsible for that.   You see this tragic sign ``Juvenile Holding Cell,'' where the Trump  administration is treating these little juveniles this way. They are  locked up in this little room. It is strictly for juveniles being held  away from others. Then we find out, no, that was the Obama  administration, too. But all of these pictures were originally touted  as being part of Trump's war on children.   Here is a female juvenile holding cell. That is proof positive that  President Trump was isolating these female juveniles away. Then we find  out, no, that is part of the Obama administration. It is proof positive  the Obama administration was separating children from their parents,  even though there are some lamebrain newspapers in Texas that try to  tell me I didn't see what I personally saw.    I have been there. I have seen what they did. I have been there all  hours of the day and night.   All these lumps are precious little children, and it is heartbreaking  to think that any parent could send these children--90 percent of  them--unaccompanied through deserts and put them in the custody of  gangs. The former gangs are the ones the drug cartels use normally as  coyotes to bring these precious people across.   Tragic circumstances. Horrendous circumstances. Yet that was all  going on, all of this tragic stuff was happening, without one single  word from Hollywood about the tragedy that President Obama was causing.   A couple of more quick pictures here. Again, these were portrayed  initially as being proof of the horrors of the Trump administration. It  turns out these were all under the Obama administration.   All these little silver lumps, it turns out that most of them are  children. All of them are people under there. Tragic circumstances, but  it is what President Obama was doing, his administration was doing, not  the Trump administration.   So all these people who were throwing dirt balls at the Trump  administration, where they actually stuck was on the Obama  administration.   It always helps if you don't just fly off like so many have. It is  not really mainstream media; it is the alt-left media. Once they were  the mainstream media, now they are the alt-left media.   But they are covering for the Obama administration, trying to make  the Trump administration look horrendous, when what the Trump  administration has done has been far more caring and supportive of the  children than the facilities that I saw during the Obama  administration. They have a lot better facilities they are using now.   The ones I am particularly familiar with are down in south Texas.  That is where I spent so much time during the Obama administration.  Since President Trump has been in office, I am telling you the  facilities are a lot better, and they are doing a better job of caring  for people.   I heard somebody this morning say: Wow, there are so many people who  are just getting outraged about children being ripped from their  mothers' arms. I believe Mr. King had mentioned that nothing does that  like abortion.   Then somebody reminded me this morning that when children were being  ripped from their mothers in a process called abortion, it appears that  the Democrats felt like it was okay. At least they didn't say anything  about it, not that I heard, when those little children's body parts  were being sold off after being ripped from their moms in abortions.   So politics makes for strange situations, to have people who are not  outraged by a precious little child being ripped from the mother's womb  and killed and have the parts sold off--not bothered by that. But then  when 90 percent of the children coming into this country are said to be  coming unaccompanied and many of those that come--we have 12,000 who  are being held right now. Some of them tenderly held; some of them not  so tenderly.   But when you have nearly 40 percent who are male, teenaged, and  potentially part of gangs or subject to being recruited into gangs, it  is not the precious little child that is often being portrayed by the  alt left media.   We need to have commonsense. I know in Washington, it is just sense.  Back in east Texas it is commonsense. Here, it is sense.   In the few minutes I have left, we have been taking up bills on  border issues. I thought it was extremely unfortunate that our  leadership would not allow us to have an amendment to the Goodlatte  bill. It has so many good things in it. It has an amnesty for DACA. At  the end, that was my problem.   So many good things--I really think if our Republican leadership had  wanted it to pass, they could have put on there a fix where children  were not separated from their parents, and that would have helped get  enough votes to go from 193 to get votes to pass it.   But it just felt like our own leadership didn't want it to pass. They  weren't going to allow something like that that would add votes,  because many of them were out there saying: No, no. The compromise bill  will get a lot more votes than the Goodlatte bill.   It simply wasn't true. They were misreading our conference.   I recall our Speaker, right after President Trump was elected, saying  that he was hearing voices none of the rest of us heard. Well, some of  us were saying those same things that President Trump was saying before  the election, and we need them to be heard. But, apparently, they are  still not being heard.   But a good comparison was done by NumbersUSA on the issue of amnesty.  Under the Goodlatte bill, it says 690,000 existing DACA recipients with  Federal ID cards can apply for contingent nonimmigrant status, which  may be renewed every 3 years indefinitely. It makes ineligible those  aliens with two or more misdemeanors or a felony. It makes ineligible  those aliens charged with a misdemeanor or felony while the charge or  charges are still pending. But there is amnesty at the end of the  Goodlatte bill.   Under the compromise bill, as the Speaker was calling it, 1.8 million  to 2.4 million illegal aliens who may have been eligible for DACA may  apply for contingent nonimmigrant status, which may be renewed every 6  years indefinitely.   It goes on to describe that the applications could actually reach 5  million or more. It is the largest amnesty ever provided. It is bigger  than any amnesty that was ever given during President Obama's two  terms.   With regard to a special path to citizenship, the Goodlatte bill did  not offer any, but there was one under the so-called compromise bill.  It created a merit-based green card category for a path to citizenship  and then had tens of thousands of green cards that would be available  under the compromise bill that we are supposed to vote on early next  week.    With regard to the visa lottery, both of them reallocate those. With  regard to chain migration--this was a good thing under the Goodlatte- McCaul bill--it ends chain migration completely. However, under the so- called compromise bill, it doesn't end chain migration. That is why  some say it put us on the road to ending chain migration, because it  doesn't. It doesn't. Parents who acted illegally to bring their  children into this country illegally would be rewarded by being allowed  to get legal.  [[Page H5505]]    As far as enforcement, NumbersUSA has a good comparison there.   It would be tragic if our leadership brings up the so-called  compromise bill. The Goodlatte bill was a good one. It cut out amnesty.  It ought to pass. We can secure the border. We can save this Republic  and God will bless us and enable us to help these countries that are in  trouble.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
