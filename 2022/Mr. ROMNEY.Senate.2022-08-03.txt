 Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Paul amendment to the  resolution of advice and consent to ratification for the extension of  the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to NATO.   Like virtually all of my colleagues, I support the admission of  Sweden and Finland into NATO. Their commitment to democracy, their  military capabilities, and their resolve in the face of Russian  aggression is welcome.   With Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine, NATO has been united in  providing support for the Ukrainians to defend themselves. NATO is also  united in its adherence to the revisions of the NATO treaty. The world  is watching to see if there are any cracks in that commitment,  particularly with respect to its provisions for mutual defense.   We must not in any way appear to be going wobbly on article 5. I fear  that the Paul amendment would do just that. Further, Senator Paul's  amendment is unnecessary. The NATO treaty specifically states this:         This Treaty shall be ratified and its provisions carried       out by the Parties in accordance with their respective       constitutional processes.    That is in the NATO treaty itself.   So adding the language of the Paul amendment would only add confusion  and potentially communicate to the world that this body seeks something  in addition to the adherence to the constitutional process that the  treaty already requires.   Now, it is well and good for Congress to consider war powers and our  role in military conflicts. But doing so as part of the accession of  Sweden and Finland to NATO while Ukraine is under attack and while  Russia may potentially be eyeing violence against NATO nations is  surely not the time.   Our commitment to NATO and article 5 must be clear and unambiguous.  Throughout our Nation's history, the United States has not once  ratified NATO protocols with a reservation.   I am going to say that again to make sure I got it right.   Throughout our Nation's history, the United States has not once  ratified NATO protocols with a reservation. Now should be no different.  Doing so could send the wrong message to the people of Ukraine, to our  other friends and allies. It could even be propagandized as a nod to  Putin.   I urge my colleagues to vote down Senator Paul's amendment. Our  message must be clear: We stand with NATO, with article 5, and with the  admission of Finland and Sweden into our alliance.   I yield the floor.
