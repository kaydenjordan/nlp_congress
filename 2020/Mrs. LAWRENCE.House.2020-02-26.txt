 Madam Speaker, unfortunately, on February 26, 2020, I  was not able to cast my votes during the vote series due to an illness.  Had I been in attendance, I would have voted: YES on H.R. 35--Emmett  Till Antilynching Act, as amended (Rep. Rush--Judiciary); YES on H.R.  4852--GIVE Act (Rep. Torres--Veterans' Affairs); and YES on H.R. 2490-- To amend the National Trails System Act to direct the Secretary of the  Interior to conduct a study on the feasibility of designating the Chief  Standing Bear National Historic Trail, and for other purposes (Rep.  Fortenberry--Natural Resources).                             personal explanation
