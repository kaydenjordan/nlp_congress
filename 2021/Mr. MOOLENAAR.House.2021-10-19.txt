 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the nearly $5  trillion spending package the Democrats have tied together.   This package would massively expand the role of the Federal  Government into the lives of every American, and it would significantly  raise taxes on people and businesses in Michigan.   There is no doubt we need to invest in roads, bridges, runways,  harbors, and rural broadband, but tax increases in this package will  make America less competitive.   We need a tax structure that attracts businesses so that there are  more jobs in America, more products are made here, and our supply  chains are more secure.   This $5 trillion spending package will do just the opposite. It will  raise taxes, make our country less competitive, and increase the  overall cost of living and doing business in America.   These costs will be passed on to all of us, increasing inflation and  hurting families and seniors across the country. I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no.''                            ____________________
