 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Working Americans and their families are being  hammered by the worst inflation in 40 years, and Washington Democrats  own it. Sometimes it can be difficult to directly connect Washington  policies to the downstream effects on our families. Sometimes it can be  tricky to identify cause and effect. But not this time--not in this  case.   The pain that families are feeling today was not just foreseeable, it  was  [[Page S423]]  actually foreseen by experts all across the political spectrum.   Economists said this inflation is exactly--exactly--what would happen  if Democrats pushed ahead with their reckless spending sprees that the  economy simply did not need.   Larry Summers, who was Treasury Secretary for President Clinton and  ran the National Economic Council for President Obama, warned Democrats  a year ago this week that Democrats far-left plans could trigger  ``inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation.''   Jason Furman, who chaired President Obama's Council of Economic  Advisers, said the very same thing. He said the Democrat's spending  binge was ``definitely too big for the moment. I don't know any  economist that was recommending something the size of what was done.''  That is Jason Furman, President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.   But our Democratic colleagues did not let families' actual needs  restrain their radical daydreaming. They had already made up their  minds. This temporary pandemic was to serve as a Trojan horse for  permanent socialism.   Remember, right from the start, in March of 2020, with Americans  dying from this new, mysterious virus, a top House Democrat called it  ``a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.''   So the new Democratic Party government's first major act was to start  printing, borrowing, and spending money like there was no tomorrow.  They managed to blow through roughly $2 trillion on a so-called COVID  bill that utterly failed to crush the virus. Less than 9 percent of the  money went to the healthcare fight at all. Even the liberal expert,  Steve Rattner, a former Obama official, said the spending spree was  Democrats' ``original sin'' when it comes to inflation.   And working Americans are paying dearly for it every single day. Just  look at the headlines:         2021 went down as the worst year for inflation since 1982.        Higher prices seeped into just about everything households       and businesses buy.        There's no telling when prices will fall to more       sustainable levels.    Further quotes:         [R]ising costs for food . . . rent and other necessities       are heightening the financial pressures on America's       households.        Rising prices have wiped out the healthy pay increases that       many Americans have been receiving, making it harder for       households, especially lower-income families, to afford basic       expenses.    Yes, it is true that inflation is up all around the world. This is  partially a global phenomenon. But the United States has it worse-- worse--than almost everyone else.   Data from Pew show that America's inflationary spike has been the  third worst among all countries they measure. We have it worse than any  other country in the G12--much worse inflation than the UK or France or  Australia or Japan. That is what this agenda has bought us.   And Americans are afraid this may still just be the beginning.  Seventy-nine percent of Americans now expect inflation will get even  worse over the next 6 months. Now the Democratic-caused inflation has  the Federal Reserve signaling they may need to raise interest rates  higher and faster than they had expected.   This brings its own set of risks upon the American people, and,  again, it is exactly--exactly--what experts predicted.   A full year ago this week, the economist, Michael Strain, testified  that Democrats' spending could corner the Fed and force them to clamp  down on the recovery sooner than necessary. Democrats had mainstream  economic experts warning against their reckless spending plans and  still decided to drive right over the cliff.   Working families are paying the price every day--at the checkout  counter, at the gas pump, at the used car lot, when they pay their  bills, when they look for housing. And now Washington Democrats are  trying again to revive talk of yet another--another--reckless bout of  spending this year.   American families are already hurting enough. They need that bad idea  to stay buried.
