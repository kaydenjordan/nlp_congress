 Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark a historic moment in our  institution as Don Young, the dean of the House, becomes the longest- serving Republican in the House's history.   Is that a blushing Don Young that we see behind the beard there?   On behalf of the entire House, Mr. Speaker, I congratulate  Congressman Young on this honor and on your 46 years of proud service  on behalf of the people of Alaska.   Don Young has served alongside, from Alaska, six Senators and 11  governors of his proud State. Photographs of eight Presidents signing  his bills into law proudly cover the walls of his Rayburn office.   Despite the length of time, every single day he serves here, it is  clear that Don is passionate about his patriotism and about working in  this institution to make a difference for America.   As he said upon becoming dean--remember we celebrated his becoming  dean not that long ago--he said:         I love this body, I believe in this body, my heart is in       the House.    Just over 2 months ago, Don honored one of the special traditions of  our institution when he, as dean, administered the oath of office to  me, a woman Speaker of the House. That oath began: ``. . . I will  support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all  enemies foreign and domestic . . .''   As Don's name becomes further etched in the history of this House,  his caucus and this Congress will look to him for leadership to protect  our Constitution, to defend our institution, and to drive progress for  the American people.   Just so you know, my colleagues, in becoming the longest-serving  Republican of the House, Don surpasses the  [[Page H2389]]  record held by the legendary former Speaker of the House, Joseph  Cannon.   Mr. Cannon once observed that, and this is a quote:         The House is the most peculiar assemblage in the world, and       only a man who has had long experience there can fully know       its idiosyncrasies. It is true we engage in fierce combat, we       are often intense partisans, sometimes we aren't fair, yet I       venture to say that nowhere else will you find such a ready       appreciation of merit and character.    Joseph Cannon, now surpassed by Don Young as the longest-serving  Republican in the Congress.   Don, thank you for being a leader of merit and character.  Congratulations to you and your entire family on this milestone.   Congratulations, Don.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from California  (Mr. McCarthy), the Republican leader of the House.    Mr. Speaker, as usual, the distinguished dean is eager to  take to the microphone, but not yet. There is more to come.   When the distinguished Republican leader of the House referenced the  animals in your office, the menagerie there, I was reminded of one of  your ties, and I shared this story with Members on the day that you  became the dean of the House, now the longest-serving Republican today.  But I saw you one day with a tie that really gave me hope, because it  had an owl and an eagle and a baby seal on it, and I said, ``Oh, Mr.  Chairman, I am so happy to see you paying tribute to these endangered  species,'' to which you said, ``I call this tie lunch.''   I knew you were only kidding, right?   So, in any event, we have all had our stories with the chairman. We  all respect and admire him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the  distinguished Democratic majority leader of the House for purposes of  commenting on the distinguished dean, the longest-serving Republican in  the House.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the distinguished Republican whip of the  House.    Mr. Speaker, it is clear from listening to the comments  of the bipartisan leadership of the House of Representatives that, as  Speaker, I can say, on behalf of the entire House of Representatives:  Thank you, Don Young, and congratulations.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), the  distinguished longest serving Republican in history in the Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  commend her and congratulate her on her success in bringing this  important legislation to the floor of the House.   I want to salute our colleague from Maryland, Congressman   John  Sarbanes, for being a relentless and persistent advocate, for honoring  the Constitution of the United States and giving people confidence that  their voice and their vote count as much as anyone's in this country.   That is what H.R. 1 is about: giving people confidence that we can do  what we say without the influence of big,  [[Page H2407]]  dark, special interest money weighing in on the process.   Our Constitution, Mr. Chairman, as you know, begins, ``We the  people,'' a beautiful statement of purpose for our Nation. ``We the  people.''   Our Founders envisioned a government that would work for the people,  serving the people's interests, fighting for their aspirations, hopes,  and dreams.   We have a responsibility to honor that vision of our Founders,  honoring our oath of office to uphold the Constitution of the United  States, honoring the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform for the  sacrifices that they make for our freedom and freedom throughout the  world, and worthy of the aspirations of our children. We can only do  this if we have a government that is committed to transparency, to as  much bipartisanship as possible, and to being unifying for our country.   In the election, the American people voted for just that. They voted  for a Congress that would restore transparency, bipartisanship, and  unity and be unifying in Washington, D.C., so that the government would  again--I can't say it enough--work for the people.    On day one, reflecting the priorities of our outstanding freshman  class, our new Democratic majority honored the people's trust by  introducing H.R. 1, the For the People Act.   Again, let me salute Congressman   John Sarbanes, the chair of our  Democracy Reform Task Force, who was the godfather of this bill.   Today, we are proud to be bringing this transformative legislation to  the floor of the House. H.R. 1--and it is H.R. 1 because it is of  primary importance--restores the people's faith that government will  work for the people and not the special interests.   We are ending the dominance of big, dark, special interest money in  politics.   We are ensuring clean, fair elections with Congressman   John Lewis,  our hero, with his Voter Empowerment Act, to increase access to the  ballot box.   Democrats or Republicans or people who are Independent, who do not  register with a party, should want everyone to be able to vote without  obstacles. This legislation will remove obstacles to participation.  Whether obstacles of closing polling places in certain neighborhoods,  obstacles of reducing hours that those polling places are open,  reducing the number of days for early voting, and the rest, it will  reduce those obstacles.                                time  1645    We also are protecting the sacred right to vote through Congresswoman  Terri Sewell's H.R. 4, which is an offspring of this legislation, the  Voting Rights Advancement Act, to secure, again, and restore the Voting  Rights Act. It is part of H.R. 1, but it will be taken up separately  because of the need to establish the constitutional basis in an  ironclad way as we go forward.   I am so pleased, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the chairwoman of the  House Administration Committee for reinstating the House Administration  Subcommittee on Elections led by Congresswoman Marcia Fudge which began  its out-of-Washington hearings in Brownsville, Texas. I was just in  Texas, and people were delighted that Chairwoman Fudge's subcommittee  came there to hear the stories of voter suppression that exists  throughout the country, especially among people who may have a last  name that may sound foreign to some and questionable therefore to them,  but who are American citizens eligible to vote.   We are cleaning up corruption and ensuring that public officials  again work for the people's interests. You can't say it enough, Mr.  Chairman.   We must pass this legislation so we can break the grip of special  interests. We talk about obstacles to participation and suppression of  the vote, and we talk about what we talked about earlier, whether it is  voting, number of polling places, number of hours, number of days,  degree of identification that is required in some areas more so than in  others and different surnames and the rest, but one of the biggest  suppressors of the vote is the suffocation of the airwaves by big, dark  special interest money. There are some people in our country--I hope  none of them in this body--who think that the only way to win an  election is to suppress the vote one way or another, and bombarding and  suffocating the airwaves with information that is not factual, by  disrupting elections and by putting out messages in the social media  that are misleading, the resources that make all of this possible are  as much a voter suppressor as anything you can name.   So that is why when we put forth our For the People agenda; one, to  lower healthcare costs by reducing the cost of prescription drugs;  secondly, to increase paychecks, lower healthcare costs, bigger  paychecks by building the infrastructure of America in a green way,  people had confidence that we could do that because H.R. 1, which was  essential to our For the People agenda, would, again, diminish the role  of big, special interest money and increase the voice of every person  in our country, including increase the impact of small donor  participation in elections.   When we put power back in the hands of the American people, as this  legislation does, we can make much more progress on hard issues facing  our Nation, and the American people know that. It removes a great deal  of skepticism that they have in politics and government. It instills  confidence that their voice will be heard, that their cause will be  addressed, and that their interests will be served.   Again, lowering healthcare costs by reducing the cost of prescription  drugs, people's voices will be heard, a big issue in re-election;  increasing paychecks by rebuilding the infrastructure of America in a  bold, green and modern way; safeguarding consumer protections, workers'  rights and the rights of the LGBTQ community; and addressing the  concerns of our beautiful Dreamers in legislation that we will take up  and launch next week; protecting clean air and clean water, confronting  the climate crisis, and so much more will be taken up.   Let me add that a bill that we passed last week--which was historic  in the House--finally passing a bill for commonsense background checks  for gun violence prevention, again, defies the big money in that arena.   There should be nothing partisan or political about empowering the  American people and making sure that government works for them. Our  Founders provided a vision for our country. They wrote a constitution  making us the freest people in the world, a model for the rest of the  world that enabled people--oh, thank God they made it amendable so that  we could ever expand power, voting rights, and the rest.   What is exciting about this Congress, which has over 100 women in it  for the first time, is that in the course of this Congress, we will be  celebrating the 100th anniversary of women having the right to vote.  But the right to vote must be accompanied by removing obstacles to that  participation, and that is what we are doing today.   How do we answer our Founders if one day we are meeting them in the  next life?   How do we say to them: I did everything in my power to suppress the  vote?   Or do we say: Honoring your vision, we removed every obstacle for  those who are legitimately eligible to vote to do so and to have their  vote counted as cast?   To honor the oath we take and to honor the people's trust, I strongly  urge a bipartisan vote for this bill, for the people.
