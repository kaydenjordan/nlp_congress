Madam President, we are somehow continuing to consider the  Democrats' grab bag of bad ideas, otherwise known--I would say,  misleadingly--as the Inflation Reduction Act.   Let's start with the bill's title. It gets you feeling somewhat  hopeful, doesn't it? The Inflation Reduction Act sounds like a bill  that is going to address perhaps the No. 1 problem facing our Nation-- inflation. Then you actually look at the bill's contents and discover  that the bill will do nothing to reduce inflation--nothing.   And you don't have to take my word for it. Here is what the  nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model had to say about the bill's  impact on inflation: ``The impact on inflation is statistically  indistinguishable from zero''--``statistically indistinguishable from  zero.''   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also found that the bill  would do nothing to address our current inflation crisis. So did the  Tax Foundation.   So much for inflation reduction.   So what about the deficit reduction the Democrats are touting? Well,  unfortunately, there is a good chance there won't be much of that  either. Democrats rely on some very shady accounting to reach their  supposed deficit reduction number--most notably from the repeal of a  rule that has never been implemented and, at this point, was never  expected to be.   No matter what this rule was predicted to cost, if it was never going  to be implemented, its cost was effectively zero. So repealing this  rule leaves you with exactly zero--zero dollars to spend, not $120  billion.   Then there is the question of the bill's expanded ObamaCare  subsidies. The Democrats' bill extends the expanded ObamaCare subsidies  by 3 years. But it is common knowledge that the Democrats want to  extend them permanently, as the President explicitly said in his State  of the Union Address. And when you figure in the cost of extending them  permanently, most of the purported cost savings in the bill, which the  Democrats claim will go toward deficit reduction, dwindle away.   So no deficit reduction, an extremely doubtful amount of deficit  reduction--what else? Well, there are the hundreds of billions of  dollars in tax hikes. Yes, hundreds of billions of dollars in tax  hikes. Our economy has posted two consecutive quarters of negative  growth. In fact, by any common definition, we are now in a recession.  And Democrats think now is a good time to hike taxes on businesses-- businesses that are already struggling with 40-year high inflation?   The Democrats' book minimum tax, as proposed last week, would be a  $313 billion tax hike, with roughly half of the increase falling on  American manufacturers.   I don't think I need to tell anyone what happens when you raise taxes  on businesses, particularly when the economy is shrinking. You get less  growth, lower wages, and fewer jobs.   According to an analysis from the National Association of  Manufacturers, in 2023 alone, the version of the bill Democrats  introduced last week would reduce real gross domestic product by more  than $68 billion and result in more than 218,000 fewer workers in the  overall economy.   The Tax Foundation also found that the bill would, unsurprisingly,  reduce economic growth, reduce wages, and reduce jobs. In short, a big  part of the burden of the Democrats' tax hike on businesses would fall  on American families and American workers.   And the book minimum tax on American businesses is not the only tax  hike Democrats are proposing on this bill. They just purportedly  replaced a $14 billion tax hike on investment with a new $74 billion  stock buyback tax designed to punish investors who choose to keep their  own money invested in a business--a tax hike that will likely  discourage new investment and have a negative impact on Americans'  retirement savings.   And, of course, they have included a number of taxes and fees on oil  and gas production. I guess Democrats would like our current sky-high  energy prices to continue long-term, because I am at a loss for any  other reason why Democrats would choose to hike taxes on oil and gas  production at a time when Americans are already struggling with high  gas prices and high utility bills.   The Democrats didn't always think raising taxes during a recession  was a good idea. In fact, President Obama once said:        [T]he last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in the       middle of a recession.   That was from President Obama.   As the current Democratic leader once said:        You don't want to take money out of the economy when the       economy is shrinking.   Well, unfortunately, now that their Green New Deal fantasies are on  the line, the Democrats have changed their tune. That is right.  Democrats are hiking taxes during a recession not to address our border  crisis or inflation or rising crime but so that they can implement  their Green New Deal agenda.   Their so-called Inflation Reduction Act is chock-full of Green New  Deal spending, things like $1.5 billion--billion dollars--for a grant  program to plant trees; $1 billion for electric, heavy-duty vehicles  like garbage trucks, which is something that communities used to  normally provide for; $3 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to  purchase zero-emissions delivery vehicles; and $1.9 billion for things  like road equity and identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage.   Yes, the Democrats are apparently willing to send us into a longer  term recession--or stagflation--in order to provide billions of dollars  for things like road equity and identifying gaps in tree canopy  coverage.   All told, the Democrats provide more than $60 billion in this bill  for ``environmental justice''--$60 billion. Now, to put that number in  perspective, that is more than the Federal Government spent on highways  in 2019.   The bill also contains at least $30 billion in climate slush funds,  part of which is allocated for, among other things, climate-related  political activity--yes, climate-related political activity--because,  for sure, there is nothing more that families who are struggling with  ballooning grocery bills and the high price of gas are eager to see  their tax dollars going toward than Green New Deal activism.  Apparently, it is a very high priority for Democrats, but I would say,  in all likelihood, not for the American people and American families.  [[Page S4063]]    I haven't even talked about the tax credits and rebates the  Democrats' bill will provide for wealthy Americans who purchase new  electric vehicles or who remodel their kitchens with Democrat-approved  green appliances.   Well, I could go on for a while here. It is difficult, really,  honestly, to squeeze all of the bad ideas in the Democrats' bill into  just one floor speech, and I haven't mentioned the socialist-style  price controls that the Democrats' bill would pose on prescription  drugs--price controls that would result in fewer new drugs and  treatments--or the additional $80 billion--yes, $80 billion--that the  Democrats' bill would give to the IRS, with the majority of it being  used to boost IRS audits.   Now, of that $80 billion, $45 billion of it would go to IRS  enforcement--$45 billion, or 57 percent. Do you want to know how much  of that $80 billion would go to taxpayer services? Four percent. Four  percent--that for an Agency that only succeeded in answering about 1  out of every 50 taxpayers' phone calls during the 2021 tax season.   There is $80 billion to the IRS for an additional 87,000 employees-- 87,000 new employees at an Agency that, I am told, only has about 53  percent of its workforce actually going back to the office--87,000  employees. You are going to have tax agents moving in with families  around this country.   The Democrats aren't focused on improving taxpayer services but on  boosting the number of IRS audits. No one should be deceived into  thinking these increased audits will fall solely on millionaires and  billionaires. No matter what the Democrats and some officials at the  IRS conveniently claim, the fact of the matter is that it is  exceedingly unlikely the Democrats will be able to collect the revenue  they want to collect from increased IRS enforcement without auditing  small businesses and ordinary taxpayers. In fact, based on data from  the Joint Committee on Taxation, somewhere between 78 to 90 percent of  the revenue that is projected to be raised from underreported income  would likely come from those making under $200,000 a year.   So 87,000 new IRS agents are sent out with the purpose of collecting  more revenue, allegedly, according to the Democrats, from high-income  taxpayers and businesses that are escaping taxation; yet the Joint  Committee on Taxation finds that 78 to 90 percent of the revenue  projected to be raised from underreported income would likely come from  those making under $200,000 a year.   Almost 18 months ago now, the Democrats passed a massive, partisan  $1.9 trillion spending spree, which fueled inflation--record  inflation--that Americans are still struggling with in this country. By  the way, that $1.9 trillion spending spree was all on the debt--all on  the debt. They didn't attempt to pay for it; they just put it on the  debt.   So now, to talk about possibly reducing the deficit by what I think,  when it is all said and done, in this bill will be under $100 billion,  that will assume all kinds of things like actually they are going to  raise revenue from these 87,000 new agents whom they are going to hire  at the IRS to audit American taxpayers. It also assumes things like the  ObamaCare premium subsidies are only going to be limited to a 3-year  extension rather than a full 10 years, which we all know is ultimately  going to happen.   In the end, I believe there will be zero deficit reduction, but the  fact of the matter is that that piece of legislation, in addition to  fueling inflation and adding to the debt--and having learned from that  experience, I would hope you would think that the Democrats here would  not double down with yet another terrible economic idea, which is  another tax-and-spending spree. Like the so-called American Rescue Plan  before it, it will leave our economy and the American people worse off.   For their sake, I hope the Democrats will think better of this bill  before it is too late. We are going to have an opportunity to debate it  here, probably in a few hours, and will have an opportunity to vote on  lots of amendments, and we will see what that process yields.   I can tell you one thing: The American people are tired of 40-year  high inflation; they are tired of higher energy prices; they are tired  of higher food prices; and they are concerned about an economy that is  in recession. They are looking at a Democrat leadership in Washington,  DC, that has as its No. 1 goal--out of all of the things you could do  to attack inflation, attack high energy costs, to deal with a broken  border, crime in our cities, and to deal with a wobbly economy, their  prescription, as always, is the same thing no matter what the problem  is; that is, to raise taxes, increase spending, and grow government-- all at the expense of the American people.

Mr. President, Democrats say that the book minimum tax  will apply only to very large corporations with a 3-year average  financial statement income in excess of $1 billion, but as their bill  is currently proposed--and this change occurred basically in the last  24 hours--the bill  [[Page S4200]]  would now require unrelated companies of any size held by funds or  partnerships to combine their otherwise unrelated income to determine  if they meet an aggregate $1 billion income threshold, subjecting each  respective company to the book minimum tax even if its own income is  far too low. This significant expansion of the tax has the potential to  subject thousands of American businesses to the book minimum tax's  administrative and financial burdens.   The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said this change would  raise $35 billion in taxes on potentially thousands of small- and  medium-size businesses, not merely a hundred or so large companies as  our Democratic friends would have you believe.   My amendment is fully offset by extending for 1 year the cap on the  State and local tax deduction enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment and help ensure  our Nation's small- and medium-size businesses aren't hit with a  misguided and entirely inappropriate $35 billion tax hike.    Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment. The amendment we just voted on and passed has an offset in  there, and it is a provision that works very, very well and covers  getting rid of this tax on private equity on small businesses and  larger businesses in this country.   And what the Senator from Virginia is proposing is an offset loss  limitation. And he is right, we have voted for it. We voted for it  because we put it in the tax bill in 2017 as an offset, and what it  offset and paid for was the 199A deduction that benefits all our  passthrough businesses, small businesses, across this country, which  expires in 2026.   That very offset is how we are going to pay for extending the 199A  deduction for passthrough businesses in this country. So if you want to  rob it and use it here, it is not going to be available when it comes  time to help out those small businesses, all of whom you represent,  passthrough businesses across this country. The offset, the pay-for in  my amendment is the right way to do this.   I urge you to oppose the amendment.
