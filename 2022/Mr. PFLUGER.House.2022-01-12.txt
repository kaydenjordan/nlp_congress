 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with an incredible and  inspirational story to congratulate San Angelo's Donald Huisenga on  receiving his high school diploma after nearly 80 years of waiting.   Although originally in the class of 1943, he was drafted into World  War II just 3 months before graduation was scheduled.   His service with the U.S. Army Special Forces took Mr. Huisenga  behind enemy lines and to the front of the D-day charge.   Recently, after Ms. Tess Gooding of San Angelo's VA clinic met with  Mr. Huisenga and heard him mention always wanting to receive his  diploma and graduate from high school, she got the ball rolling, and  she went above and beyond the call of duty. And so did Mr. Huisenga's  original high school district, East Sac County.   Last Wednesday, alongside friends and family, Mr. Huisenga was  awarded his high school diploma at the ripe age of 98 years old.   It is touching to hear this story of service. I want to honor not  only Mrs. Gooding for her work in the community, for her compassion,  and for going above and beyond, but I would also like to honor Mr.  Huisenga for his sacrifice to our country in World War II and for his  continued desire to learn, teaching us an important lesson that it is  never too late in life to learn.   I thank everyone who helped Mr. Huisenga earn his diploma. They have  all made us very proud. Congratulations on this incredible achievement.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I am glad that it was brought up tonight, those who  have served and been willing to give their lives for this country.   If we are going to talk about numbers, let's talk about the numbers  in 2020. More people voted in 2020 than ever in the history of this  country before, yet we are talking about suppression.   Well, under Democratic leadership, our country is breaking records:  record-high inflation, record-high illegal border crossings, historic  levels of drug and human trafficking across the border, skyrocketing  energy prices, surging crime rates, and countless empty shelves in  grocery stores across the country.   Americans are watching the dollar of their paycheck literally shrink  before their eyes in real time as inflation spikes to the highest  levels that we have seen in 40 years.   The border is an absolute disaster. I was there last week. Illegal  border crossings are, again, the highest ever, with close to 2 million  illegal apprehensions under President Biden's watch. Fentanyl has  crossed our southern border at levels that we have never seen before,  and it is the leading killer of young adults in this country--100,000- plus lives in 2021.    Instead of bolstering American energy security, the White House is  spending their time lobbying for a Russian pipeline that will most  certainly be used as a weapon against our allies in Eastern Europe.   The policies of this administration and the Democratic Congress have  led us into a record-breaking season of crises. But instead of working  to fix these issues, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  attempting to distract the American people.   Do we really think that Americans aren't paying attention?    Tonight, Democrats are twisting the rules to pass a bill  to nationalize our election system, allowing for hard-earned taxpayer  dollars to finance political campaigns and handing control of  congressional district boundaries to the powers that be in Washington,  requiring States to allow felons to vote, and overriding wildly popular  voter ID laws.   To reference the President's disappointing speech yesterday,  supporting voter ID or opposing this Washington power grab does not  make you George Wallace or Jefferson Davis. That is nonsense. Americans  deserve a President and a government that will lead us out of crises,  not create them.
