 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring much-needed attention  to the Houthis' latest act of aggression.   Back in February, President Biden naively removed the Houthis, the  Iranian-backed proxy force in Yemen, from designation as a foreign  terrorist organization and from the specially designated global  terrorist lists.   Taking full advantage of President Biden's foolish decision and  complete lack of leadership, the Houthis stormed the U.S. Embassy in  Yemen last Wednesday, using the raid to take hostages and equipment.  After years of brutal tactics, this latest act of hostility confirms  again that the ruthless Houthis must be designated as a foreign  terrorist organization.   In June, I proudly introduced legislation to do just that. H.R. 3965,  the Standing Against Houthi Aggression Act, would reinstate the  sanctions that the Trump administration placed on the Houthis, and  redesignate the group as a foreign terrorist organization.   I am deeply concerned for the safety of the Yemeni locals who were  kidnapped while protecting our embassy. And again, I call on the Biden  administration to provide an immediate briefing to Congress regarding  that dangerous situation.   I also implore all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3965, and I urge  Speaker Pelosi to bring this legislation to the floor for immediate  consideration.   We have already witnessed devastating impacts of the administration's  botched Afghanistan withdrawal. We cannot allow President Biden's void  in leadership to develop additional disasters in the Middle East.   In fact, at this very moment, our adversaries are defiantly gearing  up to cause destruction. From China aggressively preparing for a  potential invasion of Taiwan, to Russia successfully testing an anti- satellite weapon in space, numerous emerging international crises  present additional leadership tests for President Biden. So far, the  silence has been deafening.   For the sake of the American people and our allies, Mr. President,  lead from the front.                         America's Soaring Inflation     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the soaring  inflation that continues to burden Americans across this great Nation.  There are plenty of reasons to be thankful this holiday season, but  Biden's Thanksgiving tax is not one of them.   Prices of common grocery items are skyrocketing, just in time for  folks to gather around the table with loved ones. The price of a 15- pound turkey is up 27 percent. Apples are up 6.7 percent. Potatoes are  up 13 percent. Cranberries are up 5.2 percent. And the list goes on and  on. In fact, this year's Thanksgiving is expected to be the most  expensive holiday meal in history.   But it doesn't just stop at the grocery store checkout line.  Consistent with months of increasing gas prices, holiday travelers will  face sticker  [[Page H6275]]  shock at the gas pump, where the cost of a gallon of gas is up 61  percent from this time last year. Gas is up 61 percent.   Purposely moving forward with another massive multitrillion-dollar  spending package, Democrats continue to ignore these very troubling  inflation concerns. American workers, families, and small businesses  deserve better.   In the face of a volatile economy, we should prioritize fiscal  responsibility and offer solutions to the inflation crisis, not make it  worse and fan the flames of inflation by injecting trillions of dollars  of borrowed Federal money into the economy.       Celebrating Mars Wrigley Flowery Branch Plant's 50th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the Mars Wrigley plant in the city of Flowery Branch, in  the Ninth District of Georgia.   The plant opened back in 1971, becoming one of the very first  confection factories in northern Georgia. Now, it is the manufacturing  hub for the company's iconic gum brands, producing 75 percent of the  chewing gum volume for the North American market.   Currently, the plant employs over 920 associates, of which 250 have  been with Mars Wrigley for over 20 years. Due to their hard work, this  factory is one of the fastest growing manufacturing plants in the State  of Georgia, and has been recognized as such by the chamber of commerce  for its impact on the Hall County community.   In fact, Mars Wrigley continues to go the extra mile by giving back  to the local community, regularly volunteering in clean-ups, Christmas  gift donations, and food banks.   Congratulations, Mars Wrigley, on 50 productive years in northern  Georgia, and best wishes for another prolific half century.
