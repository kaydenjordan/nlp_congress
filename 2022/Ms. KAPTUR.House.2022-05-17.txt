 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for his astounding  leadership on this critical jobs training bill and for yielding me  time. I thank Ranking Member Foxx so very much for her support of this  effort.   Today, I urge my colleagues to support a bipartisan amendment to the  Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act that I have proposed alongside  Representatives Kelly, Dingell, and Ryan.   As we set about this new era of automotive and vehicular innovation,  it is crucial that we invest in the workers who are the backbone of  this uniquely American industry.   This amendment will create a pathway for the Federal Department of  Labor and other Federal agencies to conduct a study on the automotive  service technician and vehicle mechanic workforce and help promote  apprenticeships to meet the increasing need of this advanced sector.  Already, America is short 1 million trained workers across our Nation,  and we haven't gotten started. We are not off the starting line.   Electric-, hydrogen-, and biofuel-powered vehicle technology brings  new opportunities and new challenges. To be ready, we must proactively  stand up for training and apprenticeship programs that prepare  America's vehicular workforce for the next generation.   The motor vehicle industry has long served as a gateway to the middle  class, and this amendment allows the Federal Government to take  deliberate steps to ensure our workers are top of mind, not left  behind.   It is vital that we invest in the workers who make, build, and grow  America and, frankly, power her. I ask that my colleagues join me in  passing this important amendment.
