 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the American Rescue  Plan.   Nearly 1 year ago, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the  district that I serve. Now, the virus has infected more than 100,000  people in my district. No family in our region, in our State,  throughout our Nation has been left untouched. Our sense of urgency  could not be stronger.   The American Rescue Plan is an opportunity to deliver help. My corner  of Illinois has thousands of small businesses struggling to keep their  doors open, 113,000 kids who have yet to return to the classroom, and  150 towns in the congressional district I serve that need help to keep  essential services running.   Mr. Speaker, the bill would provide an estimated $27 million to Rock  Island County, $55 million to Winnebago County, $35 million to Peoria  County, and more than $85 million to the other 11 counties in between  in the congressional district that I serve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support and vote for the  American Rescue Plan.                            ____________________
