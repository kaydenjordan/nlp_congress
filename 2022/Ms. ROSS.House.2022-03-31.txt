 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great admiration for the  strength and grace that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has demonstrated  throughout her nomination process for the United States Supreme Court.   Last week, people from all over the world watched as she embarked on  a journey that only five other women in history have taken. For too  long, our judicial system and our government have not reflected the  great talent and diversity of our Nation.   Like so many young women, especially our mothers and grandmothers, I  had very few female examples to emulate at the beginning of my legal  career. When I was at a pivotal age in high school, trying to decide  exactly what path to take and what was even possible to achieve, I got  to watch the nomination process for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.   She was the first woman ever nominated to our Nation's highest Court,  and I was deeply moved by her poise and intelligence under questioning  from the much older male Senators. Her confirmation solidified in me a  passion for the law and a belief that I could accomplish anything I set  my mind to.   I then went on to become a student of the Constitution myself,  attending law school, practicing constitutional law, arguing in court,  and fighting for justice as an attorney, a State legislator, and now as  a proud member of the Judiciary Committee in the United States House of  Representatives.   The world has completely transformed since I watched that  confirmation hearing in 1981, yet, since that time, only four other  women have joined our Nation's highest Court. Each of these Justices  brought a unique perspective and inspired young women across the  country.   Because of the small number of women who have been appointed, every  time a woman is up for the bench, it is necessarily historic. I am  ready for it to be less historic.   Although 51 percent of our population is female, of the 115 Justices  in American history, 110 of them have been men. And none of them, not  one, has been an African-American woman. Mr. Speaker, that needs to  change at a faster rate.   Justice Ginsburg was once asked when there will be enough women on  the Court. She responded, ``When there are nine.''   If confirmed, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the next, and the  first African-American woman. I would like to say ``when confirmed.''  Her nomination marks a momentous step forward in the long struggle for  a judicial system that truly represents every American and delivers  justice, fairness, and equality for all.   I can relate to all the young women out there watching this  nomination process, feeling inspired to follow in her footsteps. Don't  be deterred or dismayed by the disrespect that she was shown by a  handful of Senators. My message to the young women is: You can do this.  No matter the challenges or the obstacles, you can achieve your dreams.   Judge Brown Jackson said last week that her nomination is truly a  testament to the hope and the promise of this country. She continues to  give us new hope, especially to young women lawyers, and her rise to  the highest Court of the land holds out the promise of a brighter  future for our country.   Mr. Speaker, Judge Brown Jackson is an exceptional, extremely  qualified nominee, and I look forward to calling her Justice Brown  Jackson.                            ____________________
