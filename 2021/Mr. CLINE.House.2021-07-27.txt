 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding the  time and the chair for her leadership as well. I am honored to be a new  member of the Appropriations Committee, but I must oppose this  appropriations bill.   I was disappointed by the party-line votes many of my colleagues took  during committee markup against amendments that should have garnered  bipartisan support.  [[Page H4054]]    I am most disheartened that the majority failed to keep decades-long,  bipartisan provisions in this bill. Chief among those were the Hyde and  the Weldon amendments.   Since Hyde was first included in 1976, it has saved nearly 2.5  million lives. Nearly 60 percent of Americans agree that taxpayer  dollars should not be used to pay for abortions.   The Weldon amendment ensures that healthcare providers cannot be  forced to provide abortion services, a protection that has been in  place since 2005.   We should never force our healthcare workers to participate in  abortion when they have taken an oath to heal and to do no harm.   While there was much in this bill I would like to support, the  inclusion of these provisions is non-negotiable.   I will always stand to preserve the sanctity of life and to protect  our healthcare providers from being forced to perform actions they find  unconscionable.   The government has a duty to protect the inalienable right to life.  Therefore, I cannot support this bill.
