 Mr. President, I would have joined Senator Sullivan in a  round of applause. I thank him for sharing that inspiring story.                            Funding the Government    Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon just to talk very  briefly about the real-world impacts of the decisions we are going to  make in the next week or so regarding the future of the budget and to  really implore my Republican colleagues here, most especially the  Republican leadership, to get this job done and not put us on another  continuing resolution. This is not a theoretical or a rhetorical  exercise; this is about people's lives and our failure to do our job-- our failure to pass a budget and to extend lifesaving programs, like  the Children's Health Insurance Program. It is not about politics, and  it is not about headlines. It is not about point scoring. It is about  making people's lives better.   I really just want to share three stories from Connecticut to talk  about the impact of the decisions that we are going to make with  respect to the Federal budget. Let me first talk about this often  esoteric-sounding concept of parity. One of the most important things  that we are discussing is how many additional dollars are going to be  in the budget for 2017 and 2018 versus in the prior fiscal year.   There seems to be fairly widespread agreement that we are  underresourced when it comes to the Department of Defense. We have a  multitude of kinetic challenges that are presented to the United  States. A group of us just got briefed, once again today, by our  military leadership on the scope and extent of the North Korean threat.  I agree with many of my Republican colleagues that we need to increase  funding for national security, but national security is not just housed  in the Department of Defense. National security is also about making  sure that our families are secure and that our communities are secure.   We believe that we should increase funds for the Department of  Defense, and we should also make sure that our schools have teachers.  We should also make sure that we have cops on the streets. We should  also make sure that our bridges aren't falling down. That is national  security as well. It is not too much to ask to make sure that our  security is taken care of internationally and domestically as well.   Let me give you a perfect example of how you can't just plus-up  defense spending and leave the rest of the budget unattended to. We  love defense spending in Connecticut. Why? Because we make a lot of big  ticket items for the Department of Defense. We make the helicopters at  Sikorsky. We make the jet engines at Pratt & Whitney. We make the  submarines at Electric Boat.   We are proud of all of them, but let me tell you what happens at  Electric Boat if you plus-up the Defense Department at the expense of  all of the other discretionary accounts. We are going to be building a  lot more submarines over the next 10 years. We are now building two  fast attack submarines a year. We are going to start building the new  ballistic submarines, the Columbia class, and Electric Boat needs to  hire 14,000 employees over the next 10 years. Much of that is because  their workforce is older, and so they are going to have a lot of  retirements. They have to find 14,000 new employees over the next 10  years. If they can't, we cannot make the submarines in the United  States, or we cannot make the parts that go into  [[Page S164]]  the submarines in the United States. Either the job will not get done,  or the work will happen somewhere else in another country. You can't  assemble the submarines anywhere other than at Electric Boat, but those  parts will go to foreign companies rather than American companies.   The way in which we are going to fill the 14,000 jobs is through the  Department of Labor. The Department of Labor has a partnership with an  organization called the Eastern Connecticut Manufacturing Pipeline.  That is a public-private partnership that seeks to train hundreds of  individuals in the skills necessary to build the submarines. They  received 4,500 applications over the past year. They can't place all  those people because they only get a certain amount of funding from the  Department of Labor, but they were able to train 500 new workers for  Electric Boat, putting them right into those jobs that are necessary to  build these submarines. The problem is the money for that program is  running out, and with another CR, they can't get renewed funding for  that program. So if you plus-up the Defense Department without  increasing funding for the Department of Labor, you can't get the stuff  that you want to build for the Department of Defense because you can't  get the workers in order to fill the contracts.   If you don't renew this contract, if you don't renew this funding  agreement with the Eastern Connecticut Manufacturing Pipeline, the work  will not get done, and the jobs will go overseas. I just want my  colleagues to understand that this isn't some philosophical belief that  we need the same amount of money in the Department of Defense as we  need in the rest of the budget. It is practical. It is practical  because we need domestic economic security, but you also can't execute  the Department of Defense contracts without funding in the rest of the  budget.   Second, let me talk to you about the real-world implications of not  funding the Children's Health Insurance Program. You know that  healthcare more than any other issue has become a political football.  Democrats toss it to the Republicans, and Republicans toss it back to  Democrats. Yet there is no other issue that is more personal than this.  If someone doesn't have healthcare for their family, nothing else in  their life can happen.   I want to share one story. These letters and emails are flooding into  our offices with respect to the real-world impact of not funding the  Children's Health Insurance Program.   In Connecticut, letters have gone out to families whose children are  insured through CHIP, telling them that by the end of this month--that  is 20 days away--they lose their insurance. So here is what Tara from  Washington, CT, writes. She said:         Despite our full time employment--    She works as a small business manager, and her husband is a full-time  electrical apprentice--       my husband and I do not make enough money to buy health       insurance for our children in addition to our other mandatory       expenses.    She explains that her children go to daycare, which costs $1,800 a  month, which she says is more than their mortgage plus taxes and  insurance.   To go back to her letter, she says:         This is where the [Children's Health Insurance Program]       comes into play in our lives. I cannot even begin to tell you       the anxiety I faced when I was pregnant with my daughter,       crying every day because I didn't know how we were going to       make ends meet. Thank God for a family friend who happened to       be an insurance agent. She told us about [CHIP] and suddenly       some of that anxiety was quelled.        We have been blessed to have [CHIP] in our lives.    I say CHIP. She says in the letter HUSKY. HUSKY is the name of the  CHIP program in Connecticut.         We have been blessed to have [CHIP] in our lives. Last       month my daughter got RSV and was prescribed a nebulizer. Two       weeks ago, my son caught it from her and that developed into       a double ear infection and pink eye, requiring two expensive       medications. The co-pays and premiums are manageable though       and they got the care they needed.        I read in the [local paper] this weekend that letters were       going out to parents of children . . . telling them that       their coverage will end on January 31, 2018.    She is writing this in December.         We are a week away from Christmas, and what should be a       happy time of year has now turned into stress and depression.       How am I going to get insurance for my kids? My daughter       turns two on February 10th, how am I going to pay for her       well visit? I can't just skip it, they won't allow her back       into daycare.        I cannot believe the dysfunction going on in this country.       I cannot believe tax cuts for the wealthy have taken       precedent over the health of my kids. . . . What is Congress       doing to ensure their continued healthcare?    This story is repeated literally millions of times over all across  this country. People went through the holiday anxious and depressed  because they were convinced that we weren't taking seriously the  healthcare of their kids. When we debate the budget, it has to have  attached to it a long-term, if not permanent, extension of the  Children's Health Insurance Program because there are families just  like Tara out there who are doing everything we ask them to. She is  full-time employed, her husband is full-time employed, and they can't  afford health insurance for their kids without CHIP.   Let me talk to you about the importance of making sure that we get  the right amount of disaster funding to Texas, Florida, and in  particular Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico matters to us in Connecticut  because we have the largest percentage of our population with Puerto  Rican roots than any State in the country. We are so proud of that. The  Puerto Rican community in Connecticut is vibrant, economically and  culturally, powerful politically, involved in our cities and towns and  in State government.   The Governor of Puerto Rico has requested $94 billion for Maria  recovery and rebuilding, and I am just back from Puerto Rico. I can  report to you that the island is still in crisis. One hundred days  after the hurricane hit, more than half of the country--half of the  households--still don't have electricity.   If that were happening in Connecticut, Alaska, or Louisiana, there  would be riots in the streets, but for some reason it is acceptable in  Puerto Rico. We are 100 days after the hurricane, and we still haven't  approved a disaster recovery package, and the Trump administration is  nickel-and-diming the island.   I walked through the poorest, most densely populated neighborhood in  San Juan, the capital of the Commonwealth. They have no power. Mold is  growing in these homes because they can't dry out the moisture without  electricity. Kids are enduring more frequent and more intense bouts of  asthma. People are dying because they can't refrigerate their  medication or keep their ventilation equipment running. This is what is  happening in the United States of America. We need to authorize  significant, robust funding for Puerto Rico and for Texas and Florida.  We need to do it now.   We need to do it now because the day that I arrived on the island--I  think it was January 2--it was reported to us that there was the  highest volume of people leaving Puerto Rico since the hurricane--on  that day, January 2. The exodus is getting more intense. More people  are leaving, not less. Why? Because they don't think we are committed  to rebuilding the island. Puerto Ricans don't think that Congress is  serious about putting back on the electricity. They waited 1 month.  They waited 2 months. They waited 3 months, and then they said: Enough,  we can't put our kids in these conditions.   They started leaving in record numbers. They were leaving right off  the bat, but they are now leaving in record numbers. While most of them  are coming to places like Florida, many of them are coming to  Connecticut. Why? Because when they make that move, they often go first  to stay with friends. Because we have such a compassionate, large  Puerto Rican community in Connecticut, many of these families are  coming to Connecticut.   So let me just give you a couple of the numbers here. We asked our  school systems to try to keep a rough track of how many new Puerto  Rican students are showing up. Our cities are small in Connecticut. We  don't have a city that is much bigger than 100,000. In Hartford, they  have 388 new Puerto Rican students--``new'' meaning having come since  the hurricane from the island. Waterbury, CT, has 268. New Britain, a  very small city, has 213. Bridgeport has 179. These are kids who are  glad to have shelter and schooling in Connecticut, but they don't want  to be in Connecticut. They came under duress. They came to Connecticut  as refugees. They want to be back in Puerto Rico.  [[Page S165]]    The stress that this is putting on the schools is serious. We are in  a budget crisis in Connecticut. Schools have already had their funding  cut from Hartford. Yet these schools are now having to staff up to deal  with this influx of students from Puerto Rico. We are glad to do it. We  see it as our obligation, and we know that these kids will be a part of  Connecticut's strength. But it is not easy to do when we haven't  authorized any money to help States like Connecticut to deal with this  influx of students. At McDonough Middle School in Hartford, these kids  are thriving, but they have had to set up a new immersion lab to handle  all these kids coming in. They have had to hire new staff to teach  English as a second language. These are schools that were already  seeing their funding hemorrhage from the State government.   The impact is real on McDonough Middle School. The impact is real on  Tara and her family from Washington. The impact is real for an  important supplier in our industrial base, Electric Boat. If we just  continue to push CR after CR, these families, schools, and companies  will not succeed. This isn't about political headlines. This isn't  about numbers on a page. This is about real-world impact for  businesses, families, and schools.   So let's get the job done. Let's write a budget. Let's at least agree  to the overall budget numbers. Let's fund the Children's Health  Insurance Program. Let's get Puerto Rico, Florida, and Texas everything  they need. News flash: That is our job.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.                            ____________________
