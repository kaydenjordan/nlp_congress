 Madam President, I come to the Senate floor again today  to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. This is the eighth  week in a row that I have come to the floor to talk about the illegal,  totally unprovoked, and brutal Russian invasion of a sovereign  country--their neighbor Ukraine--that only wants to live in peace.   Over the weekend, all of us saw the brutality of what Russia is  doing. We saw it up close through shocking videos and photographs of  more than 100 civilians--not soldiers but civilians--lying in mass  graves in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv.   Yesterday, Human Rights Watch released a report documenting specific  atrocities, including rapes and executions.   President Zelenskyy painted a vivid, heartbreaking picture this  weekend when he spoke of ``civilians left on the streets with their  hands tied behind their backs--killed execution style.''   Here is one photograph of the shocking scenes that we saw over the  weekend of civilians left in the streets as the Russians pulled out of  Bucha, but it is happening all over Ukraine, these kinds of human  rights abuses and war crimes.   The administration, on Sunday, called for an investigation into the  war crimes. That is good. Of course, these are war crimes. The United  States must press other countries and must be persistent to ensure that  a tribunal is established; that these war crimes are prosecuted; and  that people are held accountable.   Last week, Senator Dick Durbin and I, as cochairs of the Senate  Ukraine Caucus, organized a meeting with four members of the Rada,  which is the Parliament in Ukraine. We were also joined by the  Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. These  women told us of the human toll in this fight, which they described as  a fight between good and evil, between tyranny and democracy. They  talked about the fact that Ukraine can be a symbol for victory of the  West if we support them more and if we help them win.   One of the members of Parliament described for us the scenes from  Mariupol--of the massive shelling and of the bodies lying in the  streets there, too, because it is too dangerous to go out to recover  them.   One parliamentarian told us of being separated and of often being out  of touch with her husband, who is in harm's way with the Ukrainian  military, while she is here telling us these stories to encourage us to  do more.   One said that there are 30 Russian soldiers living in her  grandmother's house. They forced her out into the bitter cold.   They all told us, with anguish and urgency, of what needs to happen:  more sanctions, more military assistance, more equipment.   One of them said--and I thought this was well put--freedom has to be  armed. Freedom has to be armed.   I agree. I believe Ukraine can be victorious if the United States and  our allies, especially the Europeans, help them to be victorious, and  that means helping them more.   They are fighting with heart, and although badly outnumbered, are  making progress in key parts of the country. We have seen this in the  region around Kyiv, where they are pushing the Russians out. This is  the time to redouble our efforts to help ensure victory. It has now  been 38 days since Russia's assault began.   Russia is also now trying to redefine their objectives, saying that  it was never their intention to seize Kyiv and the other major urban  centers. Of course, we know that that is a lie. They tried very hard to  seize Kyiv. They just weren't successful because the Ukrainians fought  back so valiantly.   So we need to watch the Russians' actions, not their words. Their  actions in the south and in the eastern part of the country are that  they continue to bomb, bomb, and bomb civilian targets.    The most important reason Ukraine is winning these battles is, of  course, the fighting spirit of the men and women of Ukraine--the  patriots who are taking the fight to the Russians on the battlefield.  They are well trained, and we in the West are part of that.  [[Page S1941]]  For the last 4 years, this body, the U.S. Senate, has provided funding  to help train Ukrainians, and it has been very helpful. They are also  motivated to defend freedom, to defend their homeland, to protect their  families. There is no substitute for that kind of fighting spirit, and  that is what the Russians are finding.   We can also see the complete disregard for the rules of war by the  Russian forces, including, most recently, through their actions in  Mariupol. The words ``children,'' in Russian, were clearly emblazoned  on a theater where young people took shelter. The letters were large  enough to be seen from the sky to deter bombs. You probably saw that.  They had the theater and then, on the outside, these huge words, saying  ``children'' in Russian. Yet the Russians bombed this theater. We have  now learned, sadly, that there were more than 300 people killed, mostly  women and children. They were trapped in that rubble and killed when  the theater was hit by a Russian bomb.   They continue to violate the terms of a negotiated humanitarian  corridor to help civilians flee Mariupol by shelling these corridors  with artillery as people attempt to flee. For the fourth straight day,  Russia continues to block the Red Cross from reaching Mariupol to  deliver much needed humanitarian aid to the city. We know the innocent  people who are trapped there are dying of starvation and dehydration.   As Russia escalates, civilian targets are being hit, in various  cities, with cluster bombs, with vacuum bombs, even with the first-ever  use of a supersonic weapon.   Thousands of civilians have needlessly died in this senseless war.  More than 10 million people have been displaced from their homes, and  over 4 million refugees--almost all women and children and the  elderly--have fled the country they love while their men have stayed  behind to fight the invaders.   Meeting with refugees a few weeks ago as they crossed the Polish- Ukrainian border and hearing their stories was heartbreaking. They told  stories of their trauma through their tears. Although it was  heartbreaking for us to hear it, they didn't want our sympathy; they  wanted our protection. They wanted us to help stop the bombing.   The United States must stand with our allies against these  atrocities. The President's recent speech in Poland underscored the  stakes of this conflict if Russia wins. Frankly, it will mean the  international order has failed, and more conflict, death, and  destruction will follow. So this is a war in Ukraine, but the  implications go well beyond the borders of Ukraine.   Tonight, I, once again, offer some ideas about where we can go from  here. Last week, I talked a lot about our top priority on the sanctions  front needed to be cutting off Russia's No. 1 source of revenue that  fuels the war machine, and that is the revenue that comes from Russia's  energy sales.   Energy is, by far, Russia's biggest export. It accounts for almost  half of Russia's entire Federal budget. The revenues from oil account  for between 40 and 50 percent of Russia's budget. Over the past year,  the average oil revenues going back to Russia from their exports to the  United States alone, just to the United States--and we imported  relatively little compared to other countries in Europe, for instance,  but it was $50 million a day we were sending to Russia.   Under pressure from Congress, the administration reversed course and  supported blocking Russian oil, natural gas, and even coal imports into  the United States, thank goodness. It made no sense for us to be  helping fund the Russian war effort, especially when we have our own  resources here that are actually cleaner resources that we need to  provide access to.   I welcome the President's announcement in Poland last week of the  creation of a joint U.S.-European Union task force to reduce Europe's  dependency on Russian energy and strengthen Europe's energy security.  That agreement is a good step forward. I am glad that we agreed to do  that and got the Europeans to sign on to this agreement, but to make it  work, to make it actually happen, we have got to support domestic  energy producers here as a means of supporting our national security.   Especially with this Russian invasion, the importance of the United  States having an ``all of the above,'' robust approach to power our  Nation, which includes fossil fuels, carbon capture technologies,  hydrogen renewables, and nuclear power, cannot be overstated. As a  practical matter, if we want to stop the revenues going from Europe-- the billions of dollars--to Russia to fund this war machine, we are  going to have to change our policies here in America to provide more  American liquefied natural gas to go to Europe. That is what the  agreement calls for. But we are going to have to change policies to  make that happen so that American energy can substitute for Russian  energy. Unfortunately, we aren't off to a really good start of late.   The President just sent his fiscal year 2023 budget request to  Congress, and among the proposals are the elimination of important tax  provisions used by our domestic producers, including oil and gas, like  the deduction for intangible drilling costs, or IDCs, which allow  natural gas and oil producers to deduct costs that are necessary for  the drilling and preparation of wells. Taxpayers deduct their costs of  doing business. IDCs are one such cost for energy companies.  Shortsighted proposals like these will serve to discourage domestic  energy production at a time when we need to encourage it to help in  this war effort.   Unfortunately, the administration has consistently sent a message to  American energy producers that one of their goals is to phase out the  use of fossil fuels and make it more difficult even now by stifling  production. This rhetoric, combined with actions like canceling the  Keystone XL Pipeline--billions of dollars have been invested in it;  suspending new leases on Federal lands and waters; and redefining  things like the waters of the United States, or WOTUS, to make energy  permitting harder--these things have led to uncertainty and less  investment in the oil and gas industry. We need to reverse that, again,  along with renewables. There is room for all.   An important initiative to build our domestic energy infrastructure  is also part of the answer. We need more pipelines and we need more LNG  export facilities, and that requires streamlining the Federal  permitting process. Historically, it can take a decade or more for the  Federal Government to issue permits to build pipelines. We have a law  called FAST-41, which improves the permitting process for big projects  by requiring Agencies in the Federal Government to work together to set  out a plan and a timeline for permitting projects. It also creates what  is called the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, which  can resolve disputes over the permitting process and get a green light  on a project much more quickly, whether it is oil and gas or whether it  is renewables, solar, or wind. Let's use that process to provide this  alternative to Russian energy. This doesn't mean not following the  environmental rules. You follow them, but you get the permit far more  quickly and with much less expense.   We have to step forward and lead our European allies in doing all  they can to provide substitutes to Russia's energy sector.   Yesterday, the country of Lithuania became the first EU country to  completely cut itself off from Russian natural gas. I applaud them for  taking this strong action and hope other countries will quickly follow  suit. Lithuania gets it. They know that as a country that is part of  the Baltics in the region, they could be next.   If we don't do this, we are not going to be able to tighten the  sanctions on Russia because we will continue to send, again, billions  of dollars to support the war machine.   The ruble has recovered its value in part because Russia is bringing  in revenue from its sale of energy. Shares on Russia's stock market are  trading again. And Russia's VTB Bank remains open for business in  Europe, where it has gathered billions of euros in deposits, mainly  from German savers.   Our sanctions have left Russia's biggest economic lifeline largely  untouched, and that is energy sales to Europe. I know it is harder for  them. They are much more dependent. That is why we need to help more.  Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it is estimated that billions have  gone back to  [[Page S1942]]  the Kremlin in energy resources and revenues from Europe.    In addition to cutting off the natural gas and the revenue that fuels  the Russian war machine, we need to tighten up bank sanctions as they  relate to energy. Sanctions for energy transactions don't go into  effect against Russia's biggest banks, including VTB Bank, until June  24. That is simply too late. President Biden must lead the alliance to  do what it takes to help Ukraine win, and the administration needs to  make clear their objective is for Ukraine to win. Things like a June 24  date for energy transactions are not acceptable.   We need to close the loopholes in the sanctions and, of course,  provide more lethal aid to Ukraine. We need blocking sanctions on all  of Russia's finance and defense industry. We should expand full  blocking sanctions on all the banks. I continue to call for revoking  international tax and trade agreements that give Russia privileges not  appropriate for a pariah country. Let's pass the end of PNTR--most  favored nation treatment--for Russia here on the floor of the Senate  this week. Let's get it done. Most Russian banks still have access to  SWIFT when it comes to international energy transactions. That is not  acceptable. This is a massive loophole that is sending blood money to  kill innocent Ukrainians.   This week, I will introduce legislation with Senator Ron Wyden of  Oregon to disallow foreign tax credits for companies that pay taxes to  the Russian Government. We have bipartisan agreement on policies to  ensure American taxpayers are not subsidizing the Russian war machine.   I believe we should seize, not just freeze, assets of Kremlin  supporters. Last week, I introduced, with Senator Bennet of Colorado,  the Repurposing Elite Luxuries Into Emergency Funds--RELIEF--for  Ukraine Act to require the Department of Justice to direct any funds  resulting from the disposal of seized Russian assets to support  Ukrainian refugees and reconstruction. So let's seize these assets,  like the yachts owned by the Kremlin supporters or by President Putin  himself, and then take those funds and use them immediately to help  with the humanitarian effort.   Regarding military assistance, the Ukrainians have made it clear they  desperately need more equipment, more munitions, and they need it now.  In our meeting last week, the members of Parliament from Ukraine  detailed what they need from us, and their list is not new. They said  they need fighter jets. They need these MiGs. They appreciate the  Stinger missiles that have been effective for lower altitude planes and  helicopters, but they don't understand why NATO and the United States  are blocking other Soviet-era military equipment to be able to help  them.   They want these surface-to-air missiles to be able to strike long- range Russian artillery rockets and high-altitude rockets that are  raining down on their cities and killing civilians with impunity. This  is not too much to ask. We have to find ways to send them these long- range air defense systems.   Our Eastern European neighbors have S-300s and other systems the  Ukrainians know how to operate. We may have some ourselves. Let's  reposition our Patriot missiles in those countries in Eastern Europe so  that they can then send their old Soviet-style systems to Ukraine that  the Ukrainians know how to operate.   It has now been weeks since our Secretary of Defense stood with our  NATO ally Slovakia and the Slovakian Defense Minister said Slovakia was  ready to transfer S-300 missile defense systems, which the Ukrainians  can operate, ``immediately.'' Let's do it. Compared to what the  Ukrainian forces have now, more S-300s could cover more ground and  intercept incoming aircraft and missiles. The bureaucratic redtape  delaying the S-300 transfer is costing innocent lives every day.    We must also find ways to quickly provide Ukraine with more armed  drones, such as the Turkish TB2 and one-use loitering munitions, which  the Ukrainians know how to use and have been effective on this  battlefield.   Three weeks ago, it was announced that we were sending 100 so-called  Switchblade loitering munitions. These are so-called suicide drones,  one-use drones, but they can be used to destroy an armored vehicle or  another target. One hundred will go very quickly. We should send more,  and we should send bigger drones, which we have in our inventory. They  could be effective against tanks and effective against ships.   They have been asking for help across the board that is not yet  delivered. They have been asking for tanks, more anti-ship systems to  fend off missiles from the Black Sea, and more equipment to clear  Russian mines.   On tanks, they know how to operate the Soviet-era T-72 tanks that are  in the inventory of many Eastern European countries. Let's facilitate  those transfers.   We can do more, and we should do more--not weeks from now but now.  They are not asking for us to fight for them, but they are asking for  us to provide them the tools to be able to defend themselves. There  should be no gap in our weapons transfers, and we should continue to  lead. We need not just organize our NATO allies, which we have done a  good job at, in my view, but now help to lead our NATO allies in  providing more support and coordinating the support from those  countries.   I also believe that both Ukraine and Georgia should be given what is  called a membership action plan, which is the next step toward NATO  membership. It doesn't make them parts of NATO, but, based on the  actions of the Russians and the fighting spirit of the Ukrainians, I  believe more strongly than ever that it would put Russia on notice that  these countries are on the road to faster membership because of what  Russia has done.   Some may ask why a Senator from Ohio would care about what is going  on in Ukraine. Well, we should all care. This is about the fight for  freedom. This is where it is being engaged in our generation, in our  time.   I also happen to have tens of thousands of Ukrainians who call Ohio  their home. These Ukrainian Americans are friends of mine. They are  constituents of mine. They have been keeping me informed over the  years. They have helped me to get more engaged in this issue. I have  been to Ukraine six or seven times since 2014, when Ukraine made a  decision to turn to us, to turn to democracy and freedom and free  enterprise. But even if I had no constituents who were of Ukrainian  descent, I would be standing here because this is the fight for  freedom. This is our test. Are we going to stand against tyranny and  for freedom at a time when these terrible atrocities are being  committed?   When I was on the Polish-Ukrainian border, I talked to a lot of these  refugees, as I said, and through their tears, they talked about what  was going on. They talked about their homes being destroyed, their  apartments being destroyed, their friends or family members being hurt,  some killed, the pain of being separated from their husbands and  fathers, not knowing their fate back home. By the way, they all want to  go home. They all want to go home desperately. They pleaded for us to  do more to stop the missiles, and they all said: Please, protect the  skies.   They told us of this atrocity up close. In the midst of this  atrocity, there are so many heroes in Ukraine who are stepping forward:  the soldiers--professionals and civilians who have taken up arms--the  doctors and the nurses, the firefighters, the volunteers who are  providing food and water and blankets just to keep people alive. We  pray for all of them. We pray for their families. Godspeed to them in  their very simple quest: a battle for a free and independent country.  They just want to live in peace.   I will close with this thought. The Ukrainians can be victorious but  only if we help organize other freedom-loving countries all around the  world to support them. We must lead.   One of the members of Parliament said it best, I think, when she said  she hears all the time ``We are all Ukrainians. We are all  Ukrainians.''   I think that is a good sentiment. But she said: If that is so, then  we must be like Ukrainians, meaning we must be brave, creative, and  fast. Her point was: We need help; we need it now. Be creative. Figure  out a way to get those tanks there, to get those more powerful drones  there, to get the planes there that they need, to get the humanitarian  assistance that they need desperately in Ukraine into these cities. Be  brave. Be creative. Be fast.  [[Page S1943]]    So I urge my colleagues and the administration and the world: Let's  help Ukraine actually win this war. That is now possible. This is the  time for us to redouble our efforts and to be brave, creative, and  fast.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
