 Mr. President, I would like to add on to what the  other Senators have said. We want to give our blessings and prayers to  the people in the southern part of the country after all the tornadoes.   I grew up in Arkansas and now live in Alabama, and there hasn't been  a year gone by that we didn't have devastated communities, towns,  cities across the South. It seems like it is an every-year occurrence.  There has been many people lost, many people injured.   The TV trucks and newspeople will leave in the next couple of days,  leaving the destruction behind for the people of these cities and towns  to rebuild, and it is a tough time. It is going to be a tough time all  around, not just for a few days but for years. And our prayers go out  to them and all the families that have to go through one of the  toughest times of their life.
