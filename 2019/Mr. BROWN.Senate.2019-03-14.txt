 Mr. President, I concur with the comments of my friend  from Montana. I know what this President wants to potentially do to the  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and to the air bases in Springfield, in  my hometown of Mansfield, in Youngstown, and in Toledo in my State and  so much more.   Last week, we got yet another clear illustration of whose side  President Trump is on. All week, we got news of favor after favor from  the Trump administration in what it is doing for Wall Street. The White  House looks  [[Page S1873]]  like a retreat for Wall Street executives except on the days it looks  like a retreat for drug company executives.   Wall Street banks have complained to the President about the Volcker  rule. That is the rule that stops the big banks from taking big risks  with American families' money. Wall Street didn't like it, but it had  passed this Congress a decade ago. The rules were being written far too  slowly because of Wall Street's influence even during the Obama years,  but because Wall Street didn't like it, the Trump administration agreed  to rewrite them. The Wall Street banks complained that even the rewrite  was not weak enough, so the administration reportedly is going to water  it down even further.   Secretary Mnuchin, the Secretary of the Treasury--another Wall Street  guy who was appointed by this President--announced he is going to go  easier on shadow banks, and the Fed announced it would make it easier  for big banks to pass the annual stress test. It is like this body and  Senator McConnell, who is down the hall, have forgotten what happened  10 years ago. It is this collective amnesia that has worked its virus  through this body and through the administration so that people forget  what happened 10 years ago with regard to our economy.   My wife and I live in Cleveland, OH--ZIP Code 44105. In the first  half of 2007, that ZIP Code had more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in  the United States. I see what happens when people lose their homes. I  think about what happens to families who have to explain it to their  children, who have to give away their pets, who have to move to new  school districts--all the things that happen to families when their  homes are foreclosed on or when they are evicted from their apartments.  Yet none of these executives seem to mind. None of these executives  have to have those conversations. Nobody in the Trump administration  has to have those conversations with one's kids.   The Trump administration is weakening the stress test. It is  weakening some of the capital. It is simply doing Wall Street's bidding  over and over--and that was just last week. Of course, we know that  comes after 2 years of this President's and this Congress's doing Wall  Street's bidding.   To me, the one what was even more personal was how this  administration decided to weaken the overtime rule. Here is how it  works. If somebody is making $40,000 a year and is working as a night  manager at a restaurant, say, or at any kind of job in which one may  manage a few people and is making $35,000 or $40,000 or $45,000 a year,  if the top people of the company give this gentleman or gentlewoman who  is doing this job the title of management, then they don't have to pay  him or her overtime.   They can work them 45, they can work them 50, they can work them 60  hours a week and pay them not a dime of overtime--nothing. They get a  salary for 40 hours.   So you take a worker, you pay that worker $45,000 a year, $40,000 a  year, the owners of the company classify them as management, and they  can refuse to pay them for the extra 10 or 15 hours. That is 10 or 15  hours without pay or it is 10 or 15 hours away from family, away from  raising your kids, and the administration, of course, sided with the  companies. Of course, they sided with Wall Street. Of course, they  betrayed workers. They never ever side with workers.   Look at Youngstown, OH, right now. This President stood by while  General Motors closed the Chevy Cruze plant. It had been there 53  years--Lordstown, OH, a valley of about 400,000 people. This is 5,000  jobs. There are probably another 4,000 to 5,000 jobs for people who  worked in the supply chain and made components that go into the Chevy  Cruze. I asked the President personally--first, he didn't even know  about the plant closing when I talked to him, even though by that time  they had laid off about half of the workers. Then I asked him face-to- face, and I asked him on the phone to actually call the CEO of GM to  make an appeal to say: Instead of using your huge tax cut that you got  from the White House to build more jobs overseas and to do stock  buybacks so the executives are getting richer, how about investing in  this General Motors plant, how about retooling, which this company has  done many times in the past?   I remember one of the best days, other than the birth of six of my  grandchildren during my last term in the Senate, during that several  years--I remember the best day of that last term was when President  Obama, Secretary of Labor Perez, and I stood together in Columbus, OH,  at Jeni's ice cream, and we announced that the Obama administration was  going to update that salary threshold on the overtime rule. If you work  extra hours, you get extra pay, you get time and a half under the law-- under the law the way that President Obama did it.   The Obama rule would have meant that more than 4 million Americans-- 130,000 people just in my State, 130,000 people, if they work 10 hours,  they get hundreds of dollars in overtime pay. If they are working 50  hours instead of 40, they literally would get--depending on their wage,  of course--at least another $100 in their pay.   Now, because of Trump and the Secretary of Labor in this  administration--first because of some judges and now the President-- those workers never got that raise.   Attorneys general around the country, Republican, far-right attorneys  general, including one in the Presiding Officer's State, are always  glad to do the bidding of their corporate sponsors. They are always  glad to do the bidding of billionaires. They are always glad to do the  bidding of the richest 1 percent in this country. They blocked it.   Now President Trump has come up with a new rule that leaves most of  those workers behind.   Again, these aren't rich executives who are working. I am sure the  Presiding Officer, the Senator from Texas, most of us work well over 40  hours in these jobs. We get paid a salary; it is a good salary. We  shouldn't get paid overtime; neither should a corporate lawyer who is  working more than 40 hours overtime, and neither should an executive  nor should a doctor who works more than 40 hours get overtime. But  these are workers who are making $30,000 and $35,000 and $40,000 a  year, and you classify them as management, so you refuse to pay them  overtime. That is what this rule is about. It means that millions of  ordinary workers are not getting the pay they have earned.   As if the richest 1 percent aren't doing well enough without this  rule, President Trump again--President Trump again--betrayed workers.  Again he stood with the billionaires. Again he stood with the largest  corporations that ship jobs overseas.   It comes down to whose side you are on. Are you on Wall Street's  side? Are you on the side of Senator McConnell, who responds to every  special interest in this country that wants something from this Senate?  Are you on their side or are you going to be on the side of the  American workers?   This President came to Youngstown. He promised to fight for American  workers. He breaks that promise damn near every single day. He breaks  it over and over and over.   If you love this country, you fight for the people who make it work.  I wish President Trump would understand that.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor a great  Ohioan, Courtney Noble, for her heroic actions this past December.   Ms. Noble works as a direct support professional for New Avenues To  Independence, Inc.--NATI--in Mentor, OH. NATI is a social service  organization that provides support and aid for people with disabilities  and special needs in the greater Cleveland area.   On the morning of December 20, 2018, Ms. Noble was the only one on  duty while tending to three male residents in the Heisley group home.  As she was helping the residents get ready for their day, she heard  popping and crackling and sounds coming from the garage. When she  opened the garage door, she discovered that a fire had started and was  rapidly growing out of control. Without hesitation, Ms. Noble sprang  into action. She immediately evacuated all three residents from the  house, one of whom was in a wheelchair.   Throughout the whole situation, Ms. Noble's biggest concern was the  safety and well-being of her residents. Even as her car was engulfed in  flames, she calmly escorted the three men to safety at a nearby child  daycare center and called 911.   Thank you, Courtney Noble, for your courageous actions and for all  the work you do as a caregiver. It is because of your quick thinking  and fearlessness that three Ohioans are alive today. I am sure that my  Senate colleagues will join me in honoring Ms. Courtney Noble for her  exemplary acts.                            ____________________
