 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine  Caucus, I rise with great concern regarding Europe's energy security  with the imminent completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.   Nord Stream 2 is a Russian malign influence energy project designed  to ensnare Europe and weaken the sovereignty of Ukraine. Tragically,  Russia's illegal war in and on Ukraine has claimed the lives of over  14,000 Ukrainians and displaced millions more.   Russia has a deeply troubling history of using energy coercion to  undermine democratic institutions. Thankfully, Congress has now passed  legislation twice on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis to put  mandatory sanctions on Nord Stream 2.   I am so thankful for President Biden's commitment to liberty in  Ukraine and his opposition to Nord Stream 2. I am also encouraged by  Secretary Blinken's recent statement reaffirming the administration's  commitment to comply with the sanctions legislation.   Our caucus, on a bipartisan basis, stands ready to work with the  administration to apply further sanctions to halt the pipeline. The  State Department must make clear that Congress will not support a side  deal that puts the security of Ukraine and the region at risk.                            ____________________
