 Mr. Speaker, to quote Ronald Reagan: ``Preservation of  our environment is not a liberal or conservative challenge; it's common  sense.'' Yet, this week, my Republican colleagues continued the trend  of pushing through bills that deeply undermine critical environmental  protections.   H.R. 806, the ``Smoggy Skies Act,'' is an attack on the Clean Air Act  that will lift protections against harmful pollutants that put the  health of our communities at risk. Republicans also made it clear that  they are prioritizing dangerous pipelines while shirking environmental  review processes.   But despite their efforts, we are looking ahead and putting forward a  bold vision for protecting our environment and our economic future. I  am proud to introduce, with Congressmen Polis, Grijalva, and Huffman,  the 100 by `50 Act, which aims to bring the United States to 100  percent renewable energy by 2050.   Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet, our economy, our  children, and our communities, and our bill lays out a bold roadmap for  ensuring that we transition to a clean and renewable energy economy  while prioritizing good jobs for workers and investments in our  communities.   This is the time to be bold.                            ____________________
