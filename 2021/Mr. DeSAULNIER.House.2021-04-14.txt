Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield  [[Page H1776]]  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday the Committee on Rules met  and reported a rule, House Resolution 303, providing for consideration  of H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, under a structured rule. It  provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and Labor. It  self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Scott and makes in  order six amendments to H.R. 7. It also provides for one motion to  recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 1195, the Workplace  Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act,  under a structured rule. It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Education and Labor and makes in order six amendments to  H.R. 1195. It also provides for one motion to recommit. Finally, the  rule provides for an en bloc authority to Chairman Scott or his  designee for both bills.   Madam Speaker, before I begin, I just wanted to take a moment--this  is the first time I have been on the floor since we lost Congressman  Hastings--to say for myself, personally, how much gratitude I have for  having known him and been able to serve with him. I regret that I won't  see his smiling face, at least in this body, again.   Madam Speaker, the two bills we are talking about today have the  potential to drastically improve the working lives of millions of  Americans.   In 2019, nearly 1 in 9 women in the United States lived in poverty,  with even higher rates for women of color. More than 1 in 3 families,  headed by unmarried mothers, lived in poverty. And 60 percent of all  poor children lived in families headed by unmarried mothers.   The coronavirus pandemic has only deepened the divides that already  existed in this country. Women are especially likely to be on the front  lines of the pandemic. At the same time, they are also being paid less  than their male counterparts.   Madam Speaker, 93 percent of childcare workers, 66 percent of grocery  store cashiers, 70 percent of food servers, and 77 percent of clothing,  shoe stores, and retail salespeople are women. Women-- disproportionately Black women and Latinas--make up more than 8 in 10  of those working as home health aides, personal care aides, and nursing  assistants. They are also at great risk for contracting COVID-19.   Madam Speaker, 6 months ago, deep into the pandemic, 1 in 6 Latinas  and 1 in 5 Black women reported not having enough food in the previous  week, and many reported being behind on rent or mortgage payments. Even  before the pandemic, women typically lost more than $10,000 every year  to the gender wage gap, with even higher losses for women of color.   More than five decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act of  1963, a woman in America still makes only 82 cents on average for every  dollar earned by her male counterpart. Compared to White men, Black  women are paid 63 cents. Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women are  paid 63 cents, American Indian or Alaska Native women are paid 60 cents  and Hispanic women are paid 55 cents.   Based on today's wage gap, a woman who works full time year-round  stands to lose over $400,000 over a 40-year career because of this  disparity. This is not the United States that Frances Perkins, the  first woman Secretary, envisioned, and we have an opportunity today to  make a real change.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to have joined with my very dear friend,  Chairwoman DeLauro, to introduce the Paycheck Fairness Act, which is an  important step towards ending gender-based wage discrimination and  ensuring that all women receive equal pay for equal work. It is time to  make equal pay for equal work more than just a slogan and turn it into  a reality.   Madam Speaker, we are also here to talk about the epidemic of  violence against healthcare and social service workers. Last year,  Department of Labor statistics show that they were nearly five times as  likely to suffer a serious workplace violence injury than workers in  other industries.   The General Accounting Office found that rates of violence against  healthcare workers in hospitals, nursing homes, and residential care  facilities is 5 to 12 times higher than the estimated rates for workers  overall. Between 2011 and 2016, 58 hospital workers died as a result of  workplace violence.   Madam Speaker, for me, this matter strikes close to home. In 2010,  Napa State Hospital technician Donna K. Gross was killed outside of  Napa State Hospital by a patient under psychiatric care. Donna was a  constituent. She entered the profession to honor her mother, who  battled mental illness and was a patient at this very same hospital.  She was the mother of three grown children and was raising her  granddaughter. Her colleagues described her by saying: ``First and  foremost, Donna was a human service-type person and loved being with  people and working with people.''   Donna's life was cut short when a patient brutally murdered her to  steal jewelry and cash. This story is just one of thousands, and  incidents are on the rise. Sadly, violence has become so commonplace  for healthcare workers that they think it is part of their job,  resulting in only 30 percent of violent incidents actually being  reported.   Some States have stepped up to enact laws to require employers to  establish a plan to protect against workplace violence. Donna's story,  for example, inspired action in California that I was proud to be part  of. That action in California served as the basis for the bill before  us tomorrow.   These workers deserve national action, and they deserve it now. At  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, these workers are  not receiving the urgent attention they need.   OSHA takes at least 7 years to put out a standard. But in some  instances, it can take more than 20 years. People like Donna Kay Gross  cannot wait any longer.   To protect the people who dedicate their lives to caring for us, we  need to move now. In truth, we needed to move years ago. The longer we  wait, the more people are suffering. The longer we wait, the more  people like Donna will die.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chair of the Rules  Committee and representative of the beautiful city of Worcester,  Massachusetts.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I have no other speakers, so I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I include in the Record a March 25 New York Times article  entitled `` In 25 Years, the Pay Gap Has Shrunk by Just 8 Cents.''                  [From the New York Times, Mar. 25, 2021]            In 25 Years, the Pay Gap Has Shrunk by Just 8 Cents                   (By Francesca Donner and Emma Goldberg         Megan Rapinoe is a two-time World Cup champion who has       played to sold-out stadiums around the globe; what she has in       common with nearly every American woman is that she's       underpaid.        On Wednesday, Ms. Rapinoe testified during a hearing held       by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney to examine economic harm       caused by gender inequalities, particularly for women of       color.        Today is All Women's Equal Pay Day, Ms. Maloney said. But       it's not Equal Pay Day for all women.        Black women would have to work until Aug. 3, 2021, to earn       what men made in 2020. For Latina women, the date doesn't       come until Oct. 21.        ``This is a disgrace,'' Ms. Maloney said. ``And it has       long-term consequences for women and families.''        Wage discrimination isn't limited to any one sector or       income level.        Take Ms. Rapinoe, whose fight for equal pay has become       something of a calling card for the U.S. women's team, and       who played a central role in the team's lawsuit on unequal       pay filed in 2019.        ``One cannot simply outperform inequality,'' she said. ``Or       be excellent enough to escape discrimination.''        If it can happen to me, she said, ``it can--and it does--      happen to every person marginalized by gender.''        In Her Words looked at the history of Equal Pay Day, the       reasons for the wage gap and what can be done to close it.        It's a symbolic day that illustrates how far into the       current year American women would need to work to earn what       their male counterparts earned last year. Put another way,       because there is a disparity in what women and men are paid,       women would need to work around 448 days to earn what men       earn in just 365 days.        Race plays a part, too: For Black and Hispanic women, the       numbers are worse. For Asian women, the numbers skew a bit       better.        Estimates vary on how much the wage gap will cost an       American woman over the course of her career. The National       Women's Law Center puts it at $406,280 in lost income on       average, but that number can top $1 million for Hispanic       women and is just shy of $1 million for Black and Native       American women.        How did it become a thing?        Equal Pay Day was established in 1996 by the National       Committee on Pay Equity. Today marks the 25th. But debates       around pay equity date back much further than that.        Carolyn York, secretary-treasurer of the National Committee       on Pay Equity, pointed out in an email that in 1942, as huge       numbers of women began replacing men in the work force, the       National War Labor Board urged employers to make       ``adjustments which equalize wage or salary rates paid to       females with the rates paid to males for comparable quality       and quantity of work on the same or similar operations.'' But       two decades on, in the 1960s, women were still earning only       around 59 cents for every dollar a man made.        Do other countries have a gender wage gap?        Of course they do. According to this O.E.C.D. study, the       United States falls behind Canada and ahead of Mexico. In       addition to Canada, other countries that have a smaller pay       gap than the United States are Romania, Colombia, Belgium,       Costa Rica, Denmark, Norway . . . the list goes on. And on.        Has the pay gap narrowed over time?        Yes, but not by much. We're talking pennies. This year,       it's estimated that American women will earn around 82 cents       for every dollar that a man earns. A decade ago in 2011, it       was 77 cents. In 1996, the first ``official'' Equal Pay Day,       it was around 74 cents. And this top-line number doesn't       account for differences in earnings among different racial       groups.        How is the wage gap number calculated?        The pay gap refers to the ratio of female to male median       annual earnings for full-time workers. Think of it as a       fraction: The numerator is the difference between male and       female median earnings, and the denominator is male median       earnings. The actual number might look different depending on       the source it's coming from, because some sources factor in       characteristics like age, family size, education level and       industry.        ``We treat this issue as if you could summarize it in one       number,'' said Claudia Goldin, an economics professor at       Harvard University. ``It's the headline,'' not really the       full picture.        Are there jobs where women are better paid than men?        Not according to C. Nicole Mason, president of the       Institute for Women's Policy Research. When men enter female-      dominated sectors like nursing or education, the job begins       paying more, she explained. But the inverse is not true:       ``When women enter male-dominated spaces, they don't get paid       more than men.''        How long will it take to close the pay gap if we do nothing       about it?        Mark your calendars for 2059; if current trends continue,       the gender wage gap is expected to close in a mere 38 years.       For Black and Hispanic women, the deadline is a whole century       away. If we do nothing, ``my daughter, and daughter's       daughter, will not see pay equity in their lives,'' Dr. Mason       said.        So what exactly explains the gap?        There are many factors at play, according to the American       Association of University Women. One of them is that the       fields in which women dominate tend to pay less than fields       dominated by men. This is irrespective of education or skill       required.        The ``motherhood penalty'' also complicates the wage gap.       Moms are less likely  [[Page H1781]]       to be hired, they receive lower salaries when they are, and       are less likely to be tapped on the shoulder for promotion.       (Ironic given research suggests moms are some of the most       productive employees.)        And women work around two-thirds of the low-paying jobs in       the United States; jobs that not only put workers at an       economic disadvantage, but also tend to be more unstable.        There is also ``invisible labor''--things like caregiving       responsibilities and household chores--that women do in       addition to their full-time work. ``Women perform up to 30       percent more unpaid labor,'' Dr. Mason said. Not to put too       fine a point upon it, but ``unpaid labor is unpaid.'' And       it's very hard--if not impossible--to do both your job and       take care of the household at the same time.        There's also good old-fashioned sexism at play: Even when       men and women are performing the exact same jobs, women tend       to receive less compensation thanks to overt or unconscious       biases, as well as stereotypes that make it more difficult       for women to negotiate.        The pay gap is caused by a ``layering effect'' of all of       these things, said Kimberly Churches, the CEO of the American       Association of University Women. Ultimately, ``this really is       how we value women and how we value women of color in our       society,'' she said.        Did Covid make it worse?        In a year of devastating job loss, especially for women--      hence the talk of a ``she-cession''--the Institute for       Women's Policy Research released a piece of research that       seemed, on its face, like good news. In 2020, it found the       weekly gender wage gap for full-time workers shrunk to 17.7       percent from 18.5 percent. Seems positive, right? Not so       fast.        As Ms. Goldin of Harvard explained, if the female labor       force is reduced, but most of those reductions are from the       bottom part of distribution (restaurant servers and retail       workers, for instance), then women's wages relative to men's       will rise.        This manifests as an overall rise in women's wages. And       that's what happened here.        But underneath the top-line number, Dr. Mason pointed out,       many, many lower-paid female workers are struggling.        What should companies do about it?        Closing the wage gap demands an investment of time and       resources.        First, companies can audit workers' pay and collect data to       determine the levels of disparity between their male and       female workers, said Serena Fong, a vice president at       Catalyst. Salesforce, for example, committed to reviewing all       its workers' salaries in 2015, and over the following years       spent more than $9 million on adjustments to give women equal       pay.        Salary bands, which give the range of pay for a given role,       can also help level the playing field between male and female       workers in salary negotiations. (Though broadly speaking, a       wide salary band can provide ``too much range to pay people       unequally,'' Dr. Mason said.)        And governments?        The Equal Pay Act, passed nearly 60 years ago, made it       illegal to discriminate by sex in setting wages. But in       practice, it can be hard for women to know whether they're       actually being paid equally. It's not common to ask your       colleagues what they make while you're chatting by the water       cooler.        In the last decade, more than a dozen states and the       District of Columbia have adopted legislation prohibiting pay       secrecy in the workplace. Still, a 2017-18 survey found that       nearly half of fulltime workers were discouraged or       prohibited from talking about their pay, meaning more       legislation and enforcement is needed.        Ms. Churches also supports passing the Paycheck Fairness       Act at a federal level, ``so we can ban the use of salary       history questions in the hiring process.'' Such questions       ``just compound women's lack of earnings going forward as       they negotiate their salaries.''        And individuals?        Ask your colleagues how much they make, as awkward as that       may sound.        Negotiation is also key. Research shows that women who       consistently negotiate their salaries make more than $1       million more over the course of their lifetimes, compared       with those who don't. But of course, Covid hasn't helped: A       new survey from Ann Elizabeth Konkel of Indeed suggests women       feel even more uncomfortable asking for a raise or promotion       than they did prepandemic.     Mr. Speaker, on the anniversary of Women's Equal Pay  Day, U.S. women's soccer player Megan Rapinoe, in a congressional  hearing said: ``One cannot simply outperform inequality.''   Wage discrimination isn't limited to any one sector or income level,  and Congress must act to stop it.   Mr. Speaker, the importance of this issue is really about the proper  enforcement of a bill that was first enacted in 1963. We generally  agree on the importance of that legislation.   Where we disagree is enforcement. And we have had years to see what  the proper disincentives are and incentives for proper behavior when it  comes to protecting women in the workforce, and on the second bill-- predominantly women--but people who work in vulnerable positions where  they are subject to greater violence.   On pay equity, we look at States like California where I am from, and  we can see that our laws, our aggressive laws have worked, at least to  help with the pay equity situation. Who can deny, in our lifetimes, the  benefit to the U.S. economy, to all of us, for having women in the  workforce? We should be able to compensate that benefit that we have  all gotten.   As a survivor of cancer, I have been taken by how many young women  went into the medical profession, and they helped to develop the  medicine that has saved my life, a disease that, 15 years ago, at stage  IV, when I was diagnosed, there was little that could be done to extend  people's lives. That research came from brilliant people, many of them  women. Why would I want to inhibit or disincentivize any young person,  any woman, any young woman from going into that field?   I know that my friend from Texas knows this, we want the best and the  brightest to help with our medical challenges, irrespective of what  their background is or what their sex is.   Mr. Speaker, every day we wait to pass these bills, healthcare  workers are being harmed and families are going deeper and deeper into  poverty. Our inequality issues get worse, not better. We should not  waste another moment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 303         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 2430) to amend the Temporary Reauthorization and       Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act       to extend for one year the temporary order for fentanyl-      related substances. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Energy & Commerce; and       (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2430.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
