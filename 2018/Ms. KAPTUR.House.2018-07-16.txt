 Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn President Trump's  unpatriotic performance and feckless  [[Page H6246]]  groveling to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin at today's summit in  Helsinki.   President Trump, no, no, no. Putin's Russia is not a competitor of  the United States. His Russia is a fierce enemy of liberty in the  United States and globally. Putin seeks every chance to undermine  democratic institutions. He illegally invaded Ukraine and gunned down  and poisoned freedom fighters like Boris Nemtsov.   Our European allies are not our foes, Mr. President. They are our  trusted friends.   How can President Trump ignore the piercing sacrifice of bloodshed  for liberty by thousands, hundreds of thousands of our countrymen and  millions of our allies?   As one of America's rich sons, he chose to dodge the draft when his  number came up, and I haven't been able to find any veteran from his  family.   So I remind my colleagues of Patrick Henry's admonition: Give me  liberty or give me death.    With our Constitution as our anchor, this legislative branch, Article  I, must rise to meet its constitutional obligations to preserve liberty  at all costs, placing country over party.
