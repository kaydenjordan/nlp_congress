 Mr. President, I rise today on another subject, but I  want to touch on the conversation that has been going on here on the  floor.   I agree with my colleague, my friend, the Senator from Illinois. Our  country is better than this.   I had an opportunity to visit one of the facilities in Virginia where  some of the children who had been separated were placed. It was a good  facility, and they were well cared for, but it still begged the  question of unaccompanied minors being separated from their families.   I saw on a news report today that some of the children have been  reunited, but for close to 1,400 of these kids, the determination has  been made that they should not be reunited with their parents. What  does it mean to those kids? What does it mean to those families? What  does it also mean, then, to our country's obligation to take care of  these kids since we are now saying that we are not going to reunite  them with their families? Not only from a moral sense, but does that  mean that we pick up a long-term obligation on these children? If there  had been a really thought-through policy, I think we would have had  some of these answers on the front end.    So I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who want to get to  a bipartisan solution set here. I think the images that have been  etched on so many Americans' minds when they saw the images of children  being separated from their moms and dads at such an early age actually  led to a moral gag reflex. Regardless of what party Americans support,  or even if they support the President, I think there was an  overwhelming sense that this is not who we are as a people.   I am willing to meet anyone halfway to make sure that these kids who  have been separated are reunited, but, more importantly, that our  country is never again put in this circumstance where we are, in a  sense, put on stage, not only for the American people but for the rest  of the world. This is not who we are as Americans.                         Supporting Federal Employees    Mr. President, the reason I came to the floor today is on another  subject that I think is of extreme importance. I rise today with great  gratitude for the men and women all across our country who serve our  Federal Government.   Virginia is home to 178,000 of these public servants. Also in  Virginia we have over 90,000 Active-Duty members of our military. While  many of our Federal employees in Virginia live in the DMV, or in the  greater Capital region, the truth is that even in a State like ours,  the Commonwealth of Virginia, 79 percent of our Federal workers live  outside the beltway.   As someone who has spent longer in business and in management than I  have as a Senator, I know one of the things that any good business  leader does--or, for that matter, what I tried to do when I was  Governor of the State--is how you treat your workforce, and that  reflects in the quality of service that the workforce provides to its  customers. In this case, the customers of the Federal Government are  the American people.   The work of our Federal Government and the way our Federal Government  invests in its workforce--the way we manage and invest in human  capital--is not by any means a partisan matter. For that matter, coming  from the Commonwealth of Virginia, a State with so many Federal  workers, it is not by any means a parochial issue. This is an issue  that impacts all Americans--all Americans who pay taxes, who follow our  laws, and who expect the Federal Government to work for them and to  work well and in an efficient manner.   That is why I also rise today with great concern about recent efforts  by this administration to scapegoat and undermine the work of our  Federal employees.   It started with hiring freezes that threw a wrench into the day-to- day operations of nearly every Federal agency. Frankly, this wrench was  thrown in with no apparent benefit to the taxpayers at large. It  continued with Executive orders undermining workforce protections for  Federal workers and their ability to organize as part of a union and to  have that collective voice heard in terms of representations with  management. It culminated last month with the Trump administration's  plan to freeze Federal employee pay and cut retirement benefits for 2.6  million Federal retirees and survivors--2.6 million Federal retirees  and survivors having their retirement benefits cut. This is the thanks  our Federal employees get for their service.   President Trump campaigned on a promise to drain the swamp, but the  great irony is that the most glaring instances of failure and  corruption at the Federal level in recent months have  [[Page S5333]]  not come from career Federal employees. They have come from appointees  installed by this administration.   Look no further than the EPA, where the American people saw some of  the most blatant examples of swamp-like behavior in the waste and abuse  from former EPA administrator Mr. Pruitt.   We also saw that, with few exceptions, those at the EPA with the  courage to stand up and say ``this is not OK'' were not appointees but  were career Federal employees. For some, that meant they were either  demoted or reassigned in retaliation, all because they had the courage  to speak up and do what was right. This is the thanks that our Federal  employees got for their service, for trying to protect taxpayer funds,  for their service of trying to prevent waste and fraud, and for their  service of trying to point out the swamp-like behavior of Mr. Trump and  his appointee Scott Pruitt.   Unfortunately, these issues don't appear to be confined to the walls  of one agency or one rogue administrator. We have seen disturbing  reports of Trump political appointees purging career employees at the  State Department and at the Veterans' Administration. These reports  should concern all of us--Republicans and Democrats alike--who believe  in good and honest government by and for the people.   Now, my hope is that we can stop this ongoing onslaught on our  Federal workforce. We will have differences, but as somebody who has  spent longer in business than I have in government, if you want your  workforce to do well, you need to reward those who do well and  challenge and penalize those who don't perform, but not take these  broad brushstrokes that unfortunately have come out of this  administration, frankly, undermining both the performance and the  morale of Federal employees who serve day in and day out without a lot  of recognition.   Before I close, I want to make another comment on this subject,  because there is one part of our Federal Government, in particular,  where naked partisanship threatens not only the functioning of the  government but really the rule of law itself. I am speaking, of course,  about the attacks--ad hominem, in most cases--against our Federal law  enforcement agencies and our intelligence community.   The intelligence community, as we know, was founded 71 years ago  tomorrow, when President Truman signed the National Security Act. That  date, July 26, also marks the 110th birthday of the FBI, as well as  Intelligence Professionals Day, a time to show our gratitude to those  brave men and women who keep us safe every day--if only this gratitude,  which I know is shared by people on both sides of the aisle, were  shared by our current Commander in Chief.   Unfortunately, in the months since Russia attacked the very  institutions of our democracy, we have seen some of the most bizarre  reactions from the President and his allies. Instead of uniting our  country behind the cause of defending democracy and bringing our  adversaries to justice, this President has led an all-out attack on the  credibility of the FBI, the Justice Department, and our intelligence  community, demeaning career FBI officials who have saved countless  American lives over their careers and impugning the motives of Special  Counsel Mueller, perhaps the most respected Federal lawman of this  generation.   Worst of all, we saw the President of the United States stand on  stage with Vladimir Putin last week and publicly side with Putin over  the career men and women of our intelligence community, many of whom  risk their lives on a daily basis in order to keep our country safe.  This is the thanks they get for their years of service, oftentimes-- particularly folks in the intelligence community--without any  recognition.   The men and women of the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the  intelligence community deserve better. All of our public servants  deserve better than what we have seen from this administration.   My advice for this President, if he is really serious about draining  the swamp, is to leave our Federal employees alone and to take a good  look at some of the folks he has appointed within his own  administration.   I yield the floor.
