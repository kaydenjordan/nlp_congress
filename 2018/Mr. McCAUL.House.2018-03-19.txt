 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5074) to authorize cyber incident response teams at the  Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5074         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Cyber Incident Response       Teams Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY CYBER INCIDENT                     RESPONSE TEAMS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the DHS Cyber Incident  Response Teams Act.   Before I discuss the bill, however, I would like to say a few words  about the recent bombings in my hometown of Austin. In the past month,  there have been a total of four bombings that have killed two people  and injured four others. These are heinous, hateful acts on innocent  Americans, and they will not be tolerated.   I know the people of Austin very well, and they will not be  intimidated. I urge everyone back home to take caution and heed the  warnings of local law enforcement. We will find whoever is responsible  for these bombings and bring them to justice.  [[Page H1662]]    Mr. Speaker, I would like to now address the bill I have introduced  and the threats confronting our cybersecurity.   As technology advances, more and more people are relying on their  computers, iPads, and smartphones for both personal and professional  use. In short, Mr. Speaker, everyone is a target.   But our enemies do not just attack individuals and their devices.  They also put America's critical infrastructure sectors in their  crosshairs, endangering all aspects of civilian life. These sectors  include our financial services, healthcare systems, dams, and our  energy production, among others. All of them play a vital role in  making America work, and each one is vulnerable to an attack.   Last week, the FBI and DHS reported that Russian hackers had  engineered a series of cyber attacks against American and European  nuclear power plants and electric systems. Crippling or shutting down  our power plants would have catastrophic effects.   We also know that Russia tried to undermine the credibility of our  democratic system in the 2016 elections and are likely to try again in  2018. Strengthening our cyber election security needs to be a  bipartisan priority.   Russia is not the only perpetrator of these kinds of attacks. Between  2011 and 2013, Iranian hackers attacked dozens of U.S. banks and even  tried to shut down a dam in New York.   In 2015, we learned that Chinese hackers gained access to the private  information of 80 million members and employees of Anthem healthcare.  The Chinese also stole 22 million security clearances, including my  own, from OPM. This attack allowed them to obtain highly sensitive  personal data, including fingerprints and Social Security numbers.  These continual onslaughts are part of a greater cyber war being  carried out against the United States, even as I stand here and speak.   Unfortunately, it doesn't stop there. Our adversaries have weaponized  technology and are using it to engage in espionage and to steal our  intellectual property. This costs our economy hundreds of billions of  dollars each year. In fact, former NSA Director, General Keith  Alexander, described this theft as the ``greatest transfer of wealth in  history.''   We must do more to stop these attacks. That is why I have prioritized  the cybersecurity mission of DHS as chairman of the Homeland Security  Committee. Through CISA, the previous bill which passed the House in  December, we are elevating and making operational the Department's  cybersecurity and infrastructure protection missions.   As part of the landmark DHS reauthorization, which passed the House  in July, the Department will be required to provide volunteer  assistance to State and local election officials upon request. These  were important bipartisan steps, but we need to do more.   The legislation before us today codifies and enhances the cyber  incident response times at DHS. These teams shall provide, upon  request, assistance to asset owners and operators following cyber  incidents, including with election infrastructure.   These teams may also include cybersecurity specialists from the  private sector to provide outside expertise, which is a new, innovative  breakthrough. By fostering this new collaboration between government  and private sector, we can harness our talent and maximize our efforts  to stay one step ahead of our enemies.   This innovative approach serves as a force multiplier to enhance our  cybersecurity workforce. Being able to utilize a great number of  experts will strengthen our efforts to protect our cyber networks. My  bill provides DHS with that necessary capability.   The American people deserve to know that we are making every effort  to strengthen our cybersecurity. This bill helps us achieve that goal,  and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a hugely important issue. I think cyber often  gets overlooked when we look at kinetic threats of nuclear missiles  coming out of North Korea, which is obviously a huge threat to the  United States and its allies. But in cyberspace, we are at war, as  well, with countries like Russia and China and Iran and North Korea,  the Russian meddling in the elections. We can't sit idly by and let  that happen again in 2018.   I think this is, as Mr. Thompson stated, a very bipartisan issue that  we need to work together on against our foreign adversaries that every  day are trying to undermine us, stealing intellectual property,  espionage, or bringing down things in a cyber warfare attack. It is not  the future of warfare; it is warfare here and now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
