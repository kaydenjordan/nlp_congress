 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. I am  very proud that the next three bills are bills that have come out of  the subcommittee that I chair on Consumer Protection and Commerce. I  absolutely want to thank all of the authors of the legislation,  Representatives Blunt Rochester and Walberg; and the authors of the  legislation that was incorporated into this bill, Representatives  Deutch and Lujan, for their work on the Seniors Fraud Prevention Act;  Representatives Kelly and Marshall for the Protecting Seniors from  Emergency Scams Act; and Representatives Lujan and Gianforte for the  Protecting Indian Tribes from Scams Act; and Representatives O'Halleran  and Hudson for the FTC Collaboration Act.   Some of our most vulnerable fellow Americans have been the targets  and the victims of fraud and scams during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Scammers especially target seniors. They exploit fear or confusion  during crises and emergencies and prey on seniors' trust and assumption  that they will be too embarrassed to finally report scams to the  relevant authorities. In 2018 alone, seniors lost almost $400 million  to fraud.   Another often overlooked target of fraud and scams are the Indian  Tribes and Tribal members. We urgently need a better understanding of  fraud targeting these communities.   This legislation tackles these problems. It establishes a new office  that focuses on the prevention of fraud that targets seniors, including  fraudulent marketing materials, and it does address the problem of the  Tribes and Tribal members that need to be protected also from the  scams.   So I am very proud of this legislation and grateful to the many  sponsors.  [[Page H5831]]         Mr. Speaker, here we have another great bipartisan  bill that has come out of the committee I am so proud to chair, the  Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee of the Energy and  Commerce Committee. I thank the authors of the legislation:  Representatives Carter, Hudson, Kuster, and Blunt Rochester.   The COVID-19 pandemic has been a time of confusion and fear for many  Americans, and scammers have noticed. Fraudsters have tried to steal  stimulus checks and trick consumers with fake medical treatments and  even vaccines. Seniors and those with disabilities are especially  vulnerable.   This legislation will protect American consumers, especially our most  vulnerable, by increasing public awareness of COVID-19 scams. It  directs the Federal Trade Commission to develop and disseminate  information to the public about scams related to COVID-19.   The FTC will also create a comprehensive national database that  tracks the COVID-19 scams in consultation with the Attorney General and  the HHS Secretary. This database will protect American consumers from  malicious scams. Consumers will be armed with information about the  pandemic scams and how to avoid those scams. So we must act now to  prevent further harm to American consumers.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the authors of this legislation,  Representatives Cardenas and Davis.   As the COVID-19 pandemic worsens this winter, we must protect  Americans who are spending more time in their homes. The pandemic has  magnified risks associated with household consumer products. Children  are particularly vulnerable, especially as parents are juggling their  children while working from home.   Unsupervised children face greater risks from bikes, scooters,  trampolines, and pools. Calls to the poison control centers for  children ingesting hand sanitizer have increased this year as well.   This legislation will direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission  to study and report on injuries and deaths that are associated with  consumer products during the pandemic. It will ensure Americans have  up-to-date information about risks to safety as the pandemic continues.  We will learn  [[Page H5835]]  about emergency safety threats more quickly so that action can actually  be taken to protect consumers.   This legislation also deals with the issues that are being faced  right now by the travel industry. This legislation directs the  Department of Commerce to study and report to Congress on the impact of  the pandemic on travel and tourism.    As Americans stay in their homes to protect themselves, travel and  tourism have plummeted. The industry is an important part of our  national economy, and over 15.7 million Americans work in the travel  and tourism industries. These jobs are vital to many local communities.   The decline of travel and tourism has devastated many other parts of  the economy. Live events, the arts, hotels, and restaurants have all  felt the effect. We must understand the full impact of the pandemic on  the travel and tourism industry so that we can help the industry  recover and come back strong.
