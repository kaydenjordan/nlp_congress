 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance  of a free press and its role since the founding of our Nation in  protecting the civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans.   I was on the Senate floor on July 12 talking about a recent tragedy-- a mass shooting at the Annapolis-based Capital Gazette. A man who had a  longstanding grudge against the newspaper for accurately reporting news  about him shot his way into the newsroom and killed five good people.  These five men and women died doing their jobs--reporting the news and  supporting a publication that is an important part of their community.   One victim in particular, Wendi Winters, fought back and worked to  distract the gunman in such a way that those who bore witness to her  bravery described her actions in this way:         Wendi died protecting her friends, but also in defense of       her newsroom from a murderous assault. Wendi died protecting       the freedom of the press.    Wendi died protecting the freedom of the press.   We think of violence against reporters as something that happens in  other countries, in war zones and the like, but not here in the United  States of America. All around the world, reporters work to gather  facts, ask questions, and report the news in the spirit of the free,  open, and transparent societies and governments that all people  deserve. Too often, reporters are harassed, jailed, and even killed  simply because of the nature of their work, which often exposes  cronyism and corruption.   From this floor, I have stood in solidarity with the Reuter's  reporters who were detained in Burma for shining a light on the  horrific abuses that occurred in the Rakhine State.   I have stood in solidarity with the Ethiopian journalists and  bloggers who are routinely arrested for criticizing the Ethiopian  Government and exposing human rights abuses in that country.   I have talked frequently about China--a country that engages in  routine censorship and online blocking, harassment, reprisals,  detention of journalists, and visa delays or denials for journalists.   According to the Committee to Protect Journalists--an independent,  nonprofit organization that promotes press freedom worldwide--more than  600 journalists and media workers have been killed in the last 10 years  while doing their jobs.   Of the member states of the Organization for Security and Cooperation  in Europe, Russia remains the deadliest country for journalists.  Investigative journalist Maksim Borodin, who died in April, was the  latest Russian reporter to be silenced by death.   Turkey is the largest jailer of journalists in the world, and scores  of media outlets have been closed since the attempted coup there. The  heavyhanded measures used against media freedom in Turkey both before  and during recent elections illustrate the lengths to which the  government went to control the information available to voters. They  also serve as a reminder of the essential role of a pluralistic media  for free and fair elections.   In May, a Helsinki Commission briefing on the murder of investigative  journalists examined the unsolved murders of Daphne Caruana Galizia and  Jan Kuciak.  [[Page S5413]]    Daphne Caruana Galizia was a Maltese journalist known for her  investigations into international organized crime and its connection to  the Government of Malta. She relentlessly probed Maltese citizenship  sales, revealed money laundering, and exposed sanctions evasion. At the  Commission's briefing, her son, Matthew, described the years of  harassment, intimidation, and threats she faced by those who sought to  silence her. ``Growing up,'' he said, ``I thought these things were  normal.'' She was murdered on March 16, 2017, by a bomb planted under  the seat of her rental car.   Jan Kuciak investigated financial crimes, organized crime, and high- level corruption in Slovakia. He was executed by gunshot in his home on  February 25, 2018, along with his fiancee. On May 6, some 3,000 people  attended a holy mass in the small village where the two 27-year-olds  would have wed.   I am troubled that at a time when media freedom in Slovakia is  already under a spotlight, a Slovak judge is suing journalist Peter  Getting for writing about Communist-era judges who handed down  sentences against people for attempting to emigrate. The crimes of  communism should be reported, taught, and remembered. Somewhat  ironically, a law reminiscent of the Communist past is being used to  thwart scrutiny of the crimes of that very era.   Unfortunately, Slovakia is not the only country where defamation or  insult laws are used to limit free speech. In addition to laws that  criminalize libel and make insulting the President or other officials  an offense, Belarus criminalizes providing media services without  accreditation and has recently moved to limit access to the media on  the internet.   Here at home, Donald Trump, as a candidate and as President, has  mused about taking ``a strong look'' at our Nation's libel laws,  calling them ``a sham and a disgrace.''   Jason Rezaian, a reporter for the Washington Post who was falsely  imprisoned in Iran for doing his job as a journalist, had this to say  recently. He was talking about the attack I referenced earlier in  Annapolis.         Mostly I've covered attacks on the media taking place on       the other side of the world, usually in countries where the       flow of information is restricted, or conditions are such       that a sense of desperation or political or tribal       affiliation can compel individuals to take heinous action. .       . . Writing about a deadly attack that happened less than 30       miles away, in an idyllic town that I recently visited with       relatives from overseas, is a new experience for me. And I       have to say I don't relish the task.    We Americans have certain rights and responsibilities granted to us  through the Constitution, which established the rule of law in this  country. Freedom of the press is one of those most basic rights, and it  is central to the First Amendment of the Constitution.   ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of  speech, or of the press.'' This precious freedom has often been under  attack, figuratively speaking, since our Nation's founding.   Today, attacks on the American media have become more frequent and  more literal, spurred on by dangerous rhetoric that has created an open  season on harassing the media for doing its job--asking questions that  need to be asked, investigating the stories that need to be uncovered,  and bringing needed transparency to the halls of power, whether they  are in Annapolis, Washington, DC, or elsewhere.   Then-candidate and now-President Donald Trump's rhetoric--calling the  media ``a stain on America'' and ``the enemy of the people''--certainly  has caused damage.   On July 13, while Donald Trump was in the United Kingdom, he  continued his assault on the media, brushing off a reporter from CNN by  saying ``CNN is fake news.''   This was underscored yesterday by a question being asked by a White  House press corps pool reporter at his meeting with the European  Commission President. That reporter asked a question the President  didn't like. Because the President didn't like the question being asked  by CNN's Kaitlin Collins in her role as a reporter, she was told that  she will be banned from the next event that is open to the press or  otherwise open to all credentialed media.   Then, Tuesday, at the Veterans of Foreign Affairs, the President said  to the audience there to not believe what they see and hear. The  President of the United States told a crowd of veterans: Stick with us.  Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. What  you are seeing and what you are reading is not happening.   That is the President of the United States saying those comments-- again, demeaning the press and the importance of our free press. Why is  the President doing this? Earlier this year, CBS ``60 Minutes''  correspondent Lesley Stahl, an icon in the news business, shared  comments from Donald Trump from an interview she did with him soon  after his 2016 election win. Stahl recalled that she said to Trump  about his attacks on the media: ``Why are you doing this? You are doing  it over and over. It's boring and it's time to end that.''   The candidate's response was straightforward and shocking. He said:  ``You know why I do it? I do it to discredit you all and demean you all  so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you.''   Let that sink in for a moment. A man who was about to assume the  position of President of the United States explicitly acknowledged that  he was purposely working to diminish the integrity of the free press.   After the Capital Gazette shooting, Donald Trump said that  ``journalists, like all Americans, should be free from the fear of  being violently attacked while doing their job.'' But how do we  interpret his sincerity when more frequently he is calling the media  ``fake news'' or ``totally unhinged'' and telling the American people  and the world that reporters are ``truly bad people''?    Donald Trump's constant, dismal refrain needs to end. He needs to  accept that one of the press's most important roles is to speak truth  to power--especially his.   There is a reason why the leading newspaper in Helsinki bought 300  ads that said: ``Mr. President, Welcome to the land of free press.''  The message is clear. They put that ad up to let Mr. Trump and Mr.  Putin understand that one of the basic tenets of a democratic society  is to embrace and respect the freedom of the press.   In Russia, Putin routinely jails political opponents and journalists.  Here at home, we are left to wonder whether Donald Trump is more  inclined to agree with Mr. Putin's view of the press than that of  Thomas Jefferson, who famously said: ``Were it left to me to decide  whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers  without government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the  latter.''   Jason Rezaian wrote in the Washington Post that Donald Trump ``didn't  create the problem of hostility to journalists, but he exploits it and  exacerbates it. That's true, too, of the leaders in other countries who  routinely call reporters enemies of the state, terrorists and national  security threats. And we must be vigilant in standing up to these empty  accusations.''   After the tragedy at the Capital Gazette, Annapolis and most of the  country rallied in support of the survivors of the mass shooting. They  received tremendous outpourings of support, including by this body, and  I know it was heartfelt. Yet the paper has reported that it has  received new death threats and emails celebrating the attack. This is  sick, and it is dangerous. It shouldn't happen in Annapolis, it  shouldn't happen in America, and it shouldn't happen anywhere else in  the world.   Journalists, like all Americans, should be free from the fear of  being violently attacked while doing their jobs, both figuratively and  literally. The right of journalists to report the news is nothing less  than the right of all of us to know. Media freedom and media pluralism  are essential for the expression of or ensuring respect for other  fundamental freedoms and safeguarding democracy, the rule of law, and a  system of checks and balances.   Every one of us in this body, Democrats and Republicans, has sworn an  oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of  America. As leaders of this great Nation, we have a responsibility to  defend the rights of our citizens, including the freedom of the press.  It is enshrined in our Constitution: ``Congress shall make no law  respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the  [[Page S5414]]  free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the  press.''   Just before the July 4 recess, I had the opportunity to discuss the  state of media pluralism and the safety of journalists with the OSCE  Representative on Freedom of the Media, Harlem Desir. The  Representative plays a key role in calling out threats to and attacks  on journalists, including murders and violent attacks. He also assists  OSCE participating states in fulfilling their commitments by providing  them with expert opinions on media regulation and legislation.  Unfortunately, Mr. Desir has his work cut out for him.   In the aftermath of the tragic murders at the Capital Gazette  headquarters in Annapolis, Mr. Desir sent his condolences and words of  support.   That mass shooting and the other incidents I have just mentioned are  all stark reminders of the incredible work journalists do every day in  big cities and small towns around the world, reporting on all of the  things that are important in our lives--and the dangers they face doing  it.   I appreciated the sentiment from the OSCE Representative on Freedom  of the Media. I am grateful to the other journalists at the Capital  Gazette for carrying on their important mission even in the face of  this tragic adversity. And I am grateful for journalists everywhere for  their dogged pursuit of the truth.   I yield the floor.
