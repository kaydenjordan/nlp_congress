 Mr. President, Oregonians have a strong interest in using  biomass as a source of renewable fuels. This desire, coupled with how  well we grow biomass in Oregon, creates the opportunity to use  carefully selected wood waste as a source for cleaner transportation  fuel. If we do it right, this effort will lead to healthier forests,  more carbon sequestration, cleaner transportation fuels as compared to  traditional gasolines, and protected old growth forests.   Current law excludes the use of federal biomass in the making of  renewable fuels as defined by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The  bill being introduced today eliminates that exclusion.   In addition to being an energy matter, this is an important forest  management issue. Over many decades there has been an unnatural buildup  of woody material on the forest floor. It becomes fuel for catastrophic  wildfires. For months, each summer, Oregonians in every corner of the  state, from Astoria to Adel and from Medford to Madras, suffer from  smokey skies, hazardous air quality, and the almost constant threat  that a wildfire may burn down their homes. In the eastern portion of  the state, invasive species like juniper trees pose challenges, on both  private and public lands--lowering water tables, posing fire risks, and  encroaching on sage grouse habitat. It is time we stopped putting our  heads in the sand, hoping the environmental ship will right itself.   Instead, this excess woody biomass should be contributing to U.S.  energy independence by being converted to transportation or electricity  fuels. This bill makes that economically feasible. It would make it  more cost efficient for private landowners to remove low-value brush,  like juniper. The bill also helps pay for programs to reduce dead and  dying trees that fuel catastrophic wildfires and helps thin out  unhealthy second-growth forests. The bill ensures that all residuals  from the milling process and certain biomass from national forests and  BLM forests qualify for the RFS standards.   Importantly, under this new definition biomass materials harvested  from federal lands must be done so in accordance with all federal laws,  regulations, and land-use plans and designations. In addition, the bill  pays specific attention to biomass removal from insect and disease  ridden forests and wildfire prone areas. And, to ensure environmental  problems are being solved, not created, the bill restricts the types of  biomass materials that can be harvested from federal lands so that old  growth trees and stands will continue to be protected.   At the end of the day, the small diameter trees, the limbs, the  debris, even sawdust at the mill presents real opportunities to  generate green energy, generate green jobs, lower wildfire risks in  rural areas across the country, and better position the United States  to meet the RFS.   There is a lot of bipartisan support for the biomass definition in  this bill. It balances sound energy policy with sound environmental  policy.   I want to thank my colleagues Senators Risch, King, Crapo, and  Merkley for joining me on this important bill.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Smith, Mr.          Gardner, Mr. Coons, Ms. McSally, and Mr. King):   S. 1602. A bill to amend the United States Energy Storage  Competitiveness Act of 2007 to establish a research, development, and  demonstration program for grid-scale energy storage systems, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
