 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the educators of  central Arkansas who have been named finalists for Arkansas Teacher of  the Year for 2023.   This year, Amber Leaton of Bryant High School and Capri Salaam of  North Little Rock Middle School were recognized for extraordinary  commitment to their students and enhancing the quality of education  across central Arkansas.   These educators have demonstrated their dedication to the success and  well-being of their students by teaching with innovation while  promoting character education and civic engagement in the classroom.   Our educators are vital to the preparation of our future generation.  I thank these teachers for their exemplary example and profound impact  in the lives of hundreds of students.   Later this fall, after classroom visits, the selection committee will  name the next Teacher of the Year. I wish Amber and Capri well and look  forward to the long-lasting impressions that they make on their  students.                            ____________________
