 Mr. Speaker, I would just ask my colleagues, how many more  times do we need to see it, the abuse of power by the Department of  Justice?  [[Page H8258]]    I am sure, just like I do, you travel your district, you talk to  people. Some agree with you; some don't agree with you. You know what  not one person has said to me? Agree or disagree, not one person has  said to me: You know what we need, Perry, we need more money for the  Department of Justice. Not one. I don't know why that is, but maybe it  is because of the abuse of power.   I appreciate my colleagues that want to do something with Big Tech. I  sure want to do something, too.   In about 3 months, the folks who are destroying this country are not  going to be in charge around here, and then we can do something  meaningful. We don't have to take the bad to get a couple good things.  We can just do the good things and leave the bad things out in 3 more  months.   We do a lot of things in good faith around here, Mr. Speaker. We do a  lot of things in good faith. I am tired of having those things abused.   People will say: Well, what are you talking about, Perry?   I will give you an example. President Biden used the HEROES Act--the  HEROES Act made after 9/11 to support people that were called to duty  to go and get their education, but they were called to duty. He used  that to forgive the loans of all these people that incurred student  debt. It is an abuse.   First of all, it is not forgiveness. It is Marxism, right?   Because you are not forgiven, you are paying for it. It is not  forgiveness.   How many more times do we need to see it? In good faith. In good  faith.   In 3 months, Mr. Speaker, under new management here, we can get a  great bill instead of some mediocre thing where we have got to accept  something terrible, $280 million a year, $1\1/2\ billion more for the  abuse of power.   Two dozen agents raid a guy's home, a pastor, 7:00 in the morning in  Bucks County.   Oh, yeah, DOJ needs more money for that, right?   You know what they could have done?   They could have saved a lot of money. They could have picked up the  phone, called the magistrate. The magistrate could have called the  pastor and said, You know what, the Federal Government is going to  charge you. Show up down here at the office, we need to charge you. And  I bet he would have shown up. The guy is not a criminal.   More money for that? No way, Mr. President.   I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy).   He is spot on. It is tyranny.   We use euphemisms around this town. We call it loan forgiveness. You  took out the loan, and we are going to forgive you paying it back using  someone else's money. That is not loan forgiveness. That is socialism.   Socialism is tyranny. Taking it, like you said, from some hardworking  individual--maybe they wanted to go to college and didn't have the  opportunity. Maybe they didn't have the opportunity because they didn't  have the money, maybe because of their family situation. It doesn't  matter. Maybe they chose not to go to college. They chose not to buy  something they didn't want to pay for.   Now, the President says we are going to use the Heroes Act. This is a  fascinating example. I told my colleagues around here who want to keep  on helping, we have to establish comity here--comity, not comedy. It is  a comedy, unfortunately. But we have to work together.   What will it take for them to understand that every step in good  faith that we take is abused by the folks who hate this country and  hate us? I hate to use that terminology, but that is where it is.   They use the Heroes Act, enacted after 9/11, for those who were sent,  who went to fight, who had to give up some of their time to pay for  their student loans, pay for their education, use that to forgive these  loans for other people who made the decision but apparently didn't  intend to pay. That is the definition of tyranny.   The good gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy), my friend, mentioned the  arrest in Bucks County. I just remind everybody that, today, this place  voted on sending hundreds of millions of dollars to the Department of  Justice, like they don't have enough, right?   The Department of Justice raided this pastor's house--not just a  father of seven but a pastor--at 7 o'clock in the morning, beating on  the door. When you don't answer fast enough because maybe you are  upstairs in bed and it takes you awhile to figure out what is going on  and get your clothes on and get down the stairs because you don't want  to be standing out on the front lawn in your skivvies in front of the  neighborhood--that is what the FBI does. If you don't get there fast  enough, they are going to break down your door.   These agents all rush in, arms drawn, pointed at this poor  individual. Kids are up on the stairs crying. I don't know how many.  Mr. Roy says 25, 24, something. Maybe it was that.   Whatever it was, here is what I know it wasn't. It wasn't a phone  call to the magistrate. Understand that the court, the State court,  already threw this thing out. This gentleman, this individual, was  exercising his First Amendment rights. Somebody made a claim. The State  court and the police said there is nothing here. The Federal Government  said: Look, you people are all domestic terrorists who disagree. You  disagree with us, so now you are domestic terrorists.   Instead of calling the guy up and saying: Look, the Federal  Government wants to arrest you for this. You have never had a record.  You are nonviolent. You are going to have to show up at the  magistrate's office to be arrested, or we can do it the other way.  Which way would you like?   Offer the opportunity. The guy is not a convicted drug felon, not a  murderer.  [[Page H8308]]  He has nothing violent in his record. But they break into the house as  a show of force, as a show to make sure everybody else in the country  knows if you have a differing opinion, don't you dare say it. Don't you  dare.   That is the definition of tyranny. That is exactly the definition of  tyranny. What else can it be?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I can't tell my colleague that it is not  tyranny. It certainly is.   This is the same OSHA that at some point required reporting of  adverse reactions to the so-called vaccine, the jab. In the dark of  night, in the middle of the week, when no one was paying attention,  that requirement went away. They still tried to make private employers  force their employees to take this jab, but they didn't want to know.   They have to report everything else, right? They have to report every  single slip and fall, every industrial accident. We want people to be  safe. But we never gave them a license to tell us what to do with our  own bodies and make those decisions.   For goodness' sake, if they had the temerity to force us to do it,  the least they can do is keep records on the adverse effects.   Mr. Speaker, they didn't want to know, did they? They didn't want to  know. They don't want you to know their tyranny.   They are not for medical freedom. They are not for education freedom.  They are not for economic freedom. They are not for any of our  freedoms. That is where we are today.   That is why Chip, the good gentleman from Texas, and I are here this  evening, to talk about the tyranny that this place, this room, the body  that we serve in, the body that we fought to serve in, the institution  that we revered growing up, we are so upset with because this  institution, this body, is aiding and abetting this tyranny.   This is the body that is supposed to be ending the tyranny, that is  supposed to be fighting the tyranny. Yet, here we are.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Texas for  being here and making this plain to all of us.   We are going to talk about the CR some more. It continues the highly  inflated funding levels.   We just saw the Fed--I have issues with the Fed; that is a whole  separate issue--raise interest rates to try to cool down, like pouring  water on the fire, this economy because prices are out of control.   People can't afford their daily lives. They can't afford their  electricity, their food, their rent, or their mortgage. They can't  afford to send their kids to school.   So, the Fed does its part. What do we do over here? Well, the Fed is  trying to pour water on the fire. They want to cool it off. Let's throw  some gas on it. $1.5 trillion for this fiscal year continues to fund  the things that we have been talking about, another $12.3 billion in  Ukraine funding.   We all want to help. What Russia did is bullying, right? A country  can bully just like an individual can bully. They are bullying their  neighbors. Nobody agrees with that. We all want to help. But this is  American taxpayers' money.   While Russia is invading the border of Ukraine, we have an invasion  on our southern border. How much are we spending on that?   Look, we are spending a pile of money. But do you know what we are  not doing? We are not stopping the invasion. Here, let's spend a bunch  of money down where Chip lives, and we put a welcome mat out.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for making the  contrast.   Here is what else it is more than: It is actually almost more than  Russia's annual military spending. The United States alone, the United  States taxpayer alone, is spending more in Ukraine to fight the  Russians than Russia's total military budget--not just in Ukraine,  their entire military budget.   Yet, the budget that we are spending money on, on our border isn't  meant to keep our country safe, our national security interest--it is  not just national security. My good friend, the gentleman from Texas,  lives right down there. He can tell you horror story after horror story  about the unsafe conditions that his constituents, his bosses, have to  live under every day because this little book, the Constitution of the  United States, says that immigration and the border is the job of the  Federal Government.   But what do you do? What do you do when they don't do the job? What  do  [[Page H8309]]  you do when 53 humans are cooked in a truck in your town? I will tell  you. I had lunch at a little diner on my way to Washington, D.C., this  week. Good people, hardworking people--you can see the same people  probably every day in that diner. I sat down. They are talking about  the world's problems, talking about their own problems. They looked at  me, complaining, and said: What does it matter? We can't do anything  about it.   I said: What do you mean you can't do anything about it? What are you  asking me for?   They said: You are in Congress, and you can't do anything about it.   We stand here in this body today knowing all of these problems exist,  every single one of them. We can all outline the problems. We all know  the challenges our country faces.   Yet, in this body, and in the body across the other side of the  building, we just want to keep the clocks wound. We just want the  trains to run on time. We don't care about all of this other stuff that  is happening out there, as long as everything works here in Washington,  D.C.   Some of the richest counties in the country are right here.  Everything is fine in Washington, D.C., but go 100 miles or 3,000 miles  away and see how it feels.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    The gentleman is absolutely right. I am looking at what  else is in the CR: $3 billion for Operation Allies Welcome.   You know what that is? That is Afghan settlement.   For 20 years, for 20 years this country has bled its treasure of  humanity, sending our best and brightest to the front, and, of course,  your tax dollars.   What did we do at the end?   We just walked away and gave all that away. We dishonored those who  lost their lives, those who came home irreparably damaged, and gave  that country $85 billion of premier military hardware, we gave it to  hardened terrorists and we gave them a country to operate out of.   You know what you get for that? You know what thanks you get?   Here is what you get: You get $3 billion for Operation Allies Welcome  because we still have to bring people from Afghanistan because the  people that we brought initially weren't vetted. We don't know who they  were. They just got on the airplane, and now they are living in your  community.   We pray to God that you are going to be safe. We pray to God that not  one of them is a terrorist.   But we already know the answer to that, right?   We are living on borrowed time. We already know because we have seen  it.   This is what my friend is talking about with Article I. The Founders  gave us the power.   You know what they didn't give us in the body?   It comes from within. A little bit of courage. A little bit of  courage.   Right now, we all go out and say we should stop spending money on  this and this and this: 87,000 IRS agents, a Department of Justice that  is reigning tyranny over our citizens.   You know what we did today?   We just continued to fund them, hundreds of millions of dollars.   To my good friend from Texas, and we are here joined by the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), another great friend, when I walk around  my district, I see people that agree with me, that support me, and I  see people that don't like me and would never support me. I have  conversations with each one of them.   You know what?   Not one of them has said, I can't afford my groceries. My electric  bill is sitting on the table because I don't have the money to pay for  it yet this month.   Here is what we need, here is how you fix that, Mr. Perry. Hire  87,000 more IRS agents. Give $250 million to the Department of Justice.  That is going to fix my problems. Not one of my constituents has said  that to me.   How about you, Mr. Roy?    That is exactly right.   I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), my good  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana.   One of the other things that is in this continuing resolution: $1  billion for increased home heating and cooling cost subsidies. Think  about that, for subsidies.   At the very same moment, the administration, through its policies, is  driving your energy costs--electricity, gasoline, diesel--through the  roof. They are making you pay more and then they are taking more of  your tax dollars to give it out to people who can't afford to pay for  it.   And people in this body support this? Somehow with a straight face.   You think that this is right?   I will give you a statistic: The U.S. imports about 20\1/2\ million  barrels a day. A tanker ship takes about 190,000 barrels. That is about  50 ships a day. The trip from Saudi to New York is about 6,500 miles.   Looking at the burn rate, we are burning about 1 million gallons one  way--1 million gallons one way. And this administration would rather do  that, tankers from Saudi Arabia, tankers from Venezuela, my goodness,  probably tankers from Iran. But heaven forbid, heaven forbid we open  the pipeline, any pipeline. They will close as many as they can because  somehow they feel good about that.    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Roy is absolutely right. Before I turn it  over to the gentleman from Texas, I want to prime the pump here a  little bit.   The Department of Energy was created for one sole purpose, one  purpose and one purpose only: To make the United States energy  independent.   My good friend from the State of Texas just went through the list. We  were energy independent about 1\3/4\ years ago. It took that long to  not only make us energy dependent, but your bills are going through the  roof.    Look, I know that people will say, well, gas prices are actually  coming down now.   Ladies and gentlemen, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the President  has been unloading that. It was created, set aside for natural  disasters.   What is happening right now today?   What has been happening over the last 48 hours in our country with  our friends from Florida, right?   They might be able to use some of that, but, of course, it is at the  lowest level it has been in the history of the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve.   It wasn't meant for political disasters. It was meant for national  security and natural disasters. But yet, this is what is happening.   If you don't like the look of your electricity bill now--now, when  the weather is pretty temperate in the United States--just give it  about 3 months and see how you are going to like it. You can blame it  on one thing, one thing and one thing alone: The left, the Democratic  left, the Democratic Party, and those in it that are forcing and  imposing this on you.   I yield to the good gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), my other  friend.    They absolutely are. And like I said, if you are worried  about the climate, if you are worried about fossil fuel use, the most  important thing to do, the most responsible thing to do is to do it  efficiently.   America does it more cleanly and more efficiently than everybody  else. And we have pipelines, but we can't use them.   Like I said: One trip. One way, from one tanker. Fifty a day come  into the United States. One million gallons burned one way for each  tanker. So that is 50 million a day.   Everybody is worried about their cars. Nobody gives a hoot about  this; and none of it is necessary. Absolutely zero of it is necessary.   Mr. Speaker, in this CR, in this continuing resolution that we are  going to vote on in this House tomorrow--I think--even though we say we  want to save our country and our citizens, our bosses from this  tyranny, people are going to vote for it anyhow: $2 billion for  unaccompanied minors flooding the border while doing nothing to solve  the border crisis.   As the good gentleman from Texas said, how much did we spend from the  Department of Homeland Security to secure our border annually?    Close to 60; but yet we need another 2 for unaccompanied  minors. We don't need the extra 2. You just stop the unaccompanied  minors, and you don't need the extra 2.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy).    Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding, I think that in the  last year and three-quarters, the Biden administration has racked up  more debt than the entire 8 years of the Obama administration.   We found that unacceptable, but yet here we are. And yet, in this  body, on this week, at this time, we are going to vote to just continue  like nothing is happening, like that is not happening, like we don't  care. We are going to go home and say, if you elect us, all this stuff  is going to end. Yet, we have an opportunity in this body to stop it.   All the things that the gentleman from Texas outlined, the things  that I outlined:   The Ukraine funding.   The $3 billion for operation allies welcome.   The COVID funding.   Oh, by the way, the President of the United States said the pandemic  is over, but we are going to add more COVID funding in here, right?  Can't do without that crisis.   Mr. Speaker, all that included, but hardly a whimper out of this  town, because it is more important that this town keeps going than the  American people get what they asked for, what they elected us for.    Mr. Speaker, this is completely unacceptable. I would agree with my  colleague from Texas, if Republicans aren't going to fight now-- understand, not one of us is a Democrat. We don't have any authority or  majority in this House of Representatives; no majority by Republicans  in the Senate. That is the complete legislature. There is no majority  of Republicans in the executive branch. That is President Biden. Those  are Democrats.   How, for the love of the Lord, can Republicans be blamed for voting  ``no'' on this tyranny?   If Democrats want to continue tyranny, God bless them. They can go  explain that to their constituents, to their bosses. But why would  Republicans help them? And more importantly, why would Republicans help  them when reinforcements are coming right over the horizon. We have an  election in 40 days.   As Mr. Higgins said, to pass a continuing resolution, to pass a bill  that continues this tyranny into December after there is no  accountability, people have lost their elections. There is no  accountability to offer them yet another opportunity to continue the  tyranny.    Mr. Speaker, how do you explain that to your constituents?  How do you explain, Well, I voted for that because it is important that  Washington, D.C., and all these programs needed your money, needed the  money that you wake up every day and go to work for. They needed it,  and you didn't.   Mr. Roy, people in my district pack their lunch at night. They get up  early while it is still dark. They kiss their little children that are  in their beds asleep while it is still dark, and they leave for work.   They count on us here to make sure that we are faithfully,  adequately, appropriately, responsibly spending their hard-earned  dollars.   Mr. Higgins, you talked about this the other day in conference. Your  paycheck. People work hard for it, and they depend on us. And what do  we do with it?   Mr. Roy, give us an example. You got like a thousand of them there.  How do we blow it?    Go ahead.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy),  the other gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), and my good friend, the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
