 Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Congressman  Loudermilk for working together on the Comprehensive Regulatory Review  Act. Congressman Loudermilk has been a true partner who has been  tireless in pursuing smart regulatory reform policies and in finding  solutions for the people he serves. We both want to get something done  for the people we represent.   I also want to thank Congresswoman Sinema for her help and support in  leading this legislation.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the  bipartisan Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act.   America's economic engine has been under pressure for some time now  from unnecessarily burdensome and outdated regulations building up on  the books of our regulators. It costs us in economic growth. And while  there are clear times where smart guardrails are necessary, there are  others when it actually holds back smart growth for our country and for  our families.   We need a smarter, more efficient government. It is time to relieve  these unnecessary burdens and spur business job growth and access to  credit in New Jersey's Fifth District and across the country while  protecting consumers and our economy. This bipartisan regulatory relief  bill does just that. It updates and expands regulators' mandatory  review of financial institutions while protecting consumers. It also  requires the review be performed every 7 years rather than every 10.
