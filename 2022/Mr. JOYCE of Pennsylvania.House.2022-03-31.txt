 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  previous question so that we can immediately consider H.R. 6858, the  American Energy Independence from Russia Act.   As Congress debates legalizing marijuana, Americans in the real world  are facing an energy crisis that we in Congress cannot afford to  continue to ignore.   In my hometown of Altoona, Pennsylvania, the cost of gasoline is now  $4.28 a gallon; over 50 percent higher than it was just one year ago.   In rural communities, these skyrocketing prices are forcing families  to make hard choices about what they can afford and what they cannot  afford. Instead of working to support the needs of these Pennsylvanian  families, President Biden and his administration have continued to work  against American energy producers.   On day one of his Presidency, President Biden made good on a longtime  liberal wish list item. He canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. Now, in  his budget, President Biden has chosen to put solar panels ahead of  natural gas. He has chosen to put windmills ahead of coal. He has  chosen the Green New Deal ahead of Pennsylvanians.   Now, the President has decided to recklessly release oil from our  strategic reserves without a concrete plan to refill them. This stopgap  measure does not support our national security and it will do little to  help lower the cost of fuel for American families.   It is time to invest in American energy. It is time to return to  American energy dominance.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question.
