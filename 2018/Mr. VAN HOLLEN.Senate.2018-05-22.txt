 Madam President, today I would like to  recognize a selfless young man of great character and tremendous  determination, Keith Nolan of Frederick, MD.   Keith's passion for service and for this country has driven him to  doggedly seek an opportunity to join the less than 1 percent of  Americans with a disability who have served in our military. In his  commitment to defend our Nation, as well as our values, he has pursued  this issue with many levels of the Defense Department. Moreover, he has  reached out to the Armed Services Committees in both Chambers of  Congress and even approached the White House to seek opportunities for  disabled Americans to serve in the ranks of the military. Keith is deaf  and recognizes that he is quickly reaching the age limit to enlist.  However, he is still committed to seeking change that could enable  others, with similar disabilities, to contribute to the defense of our  nation.   Keith Nolan is an inspiration to me and to those he has touched. I  thank him for the example he sets and am hopeful that someday emerging  military occupations might present opportunities for disabled Americans  to serve their country proudly and with honor.                            ____________________
