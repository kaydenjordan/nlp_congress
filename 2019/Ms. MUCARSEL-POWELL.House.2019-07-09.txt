 Mr. Speaker, 9 years ago, the House passed the  Affordable Care Act to ensure that tens of millions of Americans had  health insurance.   Thanks to the ACA, over a million Floridians were able to get  healthcare coverage.   In these past 9 years, Republicans have consistently tried to repeal  and sabotage the Affordable Care Act. As a result, families in Florida  are often unable to afford their healthcare.   Today, the President tried once again to repeal the Affordable Care  Act. If the President gets his way, more than 1.6 million Floridians  would lose their coverage, and insurance companies could charge even  more, resulting in higher costs for American families. Women could be  charged more than men for the same services, and people living with  preexisting conditions could lose coverage.   Floridians cannot afford these attacks on their healthcare. I implore  the Senate to pass the bills that we have already sent them to protect  healthcare for all Americans.                            ____________________
