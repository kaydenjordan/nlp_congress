 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect New York DREAMers like Lisette, who  graduated from Harvard with honors thanks to DACA. We are here to  stay--aqui estamos y nos quedamos.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman  from Oklahoma has not yielded for that purpose; therefore, the  unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Carbajal) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.
