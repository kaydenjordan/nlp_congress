 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a young  woman in my district who is making strides in the field of medical  science.   Mr. Speaker, 17-year-old Dasia Taylor of Iowa City is currently in  the research phase for her groundbreaking invention: surgical sutures  that change color when a wound becomes infected.   These sutures will be an asset to both doctors and patients to catch  post-surgical infections early on when they can be treated more easily  with antibiotics. This, in turn, will save lives.   For her intellect, research, and ingenuity, Dasia was recently  recognized among the top 40 finalists in the 80th Regeneron Science  Talent Search, one of the most prestigious science and mathematics  competitions in the United States for high school scholars.   I could not be prouder of Dasia and excited for the next generation  of women scientists who are working towards building a better future  for generations to come.                            ____________________
