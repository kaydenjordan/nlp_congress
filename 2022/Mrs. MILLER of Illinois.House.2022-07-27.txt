 Madam Speaker, Americans are suffering  through the Biden recession, struggling to afford gas and groceries,  with inflation at historic highs.   The working families that Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer promised to  represent have been hurt the worst by their leftist economic policies.  Americans have been gaslighted while the media serves as propagandists  for Biden and the left.   People remember the energy independence, low gas prices, and booming  economy we had during the Trump administration. The media portrayed the  prosperous Trump economy as doom and gloom, and they cover the Biden  recession with rose-colored glasses.   The left may be woke, but the American people are now awake, which is  why 60 percent of the country disapproves of the job Biden is doing,  and only 16 percent trust the media.   The American people want economic policies that put the American  people  [[Page H7239]]  first. The good news is, help is on the way.                            ____________________
