 Mr. President, the Nation watched the President's  outstanding Supreme Court nominee last week, Judge Brett Kavanaugh,  testify before the Judiciary Committee.   They saw Chairman Grassley guide the committee with gracious, strong  leadership and an incredible amount of patience. The chairman deserves  our gratitude, as do all of the committee staff, whose hard work and  dedication made it possible for Senators to thoroughly examine Judge  Kavanaugh and review more pages of documents pertaining to his career  than were produced for the last five Supreme Court nominees combined.   The American people also saw an extensive extremely impressive  nominee. Judge Kavanaugh was candid and forthcoming, within the ethical  constraints that exist for judicial nominees. He demonstrated the  intellectual brilliance and thoughtful temperament for which he is so  widely known. He showed exactly why he is universally acknowledged as a  leading legal mind and exactly why he will make a phenomenal Associate  Justice of the Supreme Court.   Unfortunately, not everyone performed as admirably or as  professionally last week. Some of our Democratic colleagues repeatedly  interrupted Chairman Grassley, behaved rudely toward the nominee, and  hauled out one dishonest partisan attack after another to try to  distort his record and smear Judge Kavanaugh.   Now, this is a nominee who Lisa Blatt, a prominent litigator and  self-described liberal Democrat, testified as ``unquestionably  qualified by his extraordinary intellect, experience, and  temperament.''   This is a nominee who prominent liberal law professor Akhil Amar  praised as ``studious and open-minded.'' This left-leaning academic  described Judge Kavanaugh's nomination as ``President Trump's finest  hour.''   This is a nominee whose record and reputation have revealed  Democrats' partisan attacks to be futile and silly and dishonest. At  this point, dishonest attacks and half-truths are all that is left for  our colleagues who made up their minds long ago that they were going to  oppose Judge Kavanaugh no matter what--no matter what.   You don't need to take my word for this. The Washington Post's Fact  Checker called out one of our Democratic colleagues and assigned her  shameless misrepresentation of Judge Kavanaugh's testimony four  Pinocchios--the strongest condemnation. This particular Senator cherry- picked from a sentence where Judge Kavanaugh was paraphrasing one  side's argument in a case that came before him, stripped his  description of its content, and held up the party's position in that  case as though it was Judge Kavanaugh's own personal opinion.   But by trying to slime Judge Kavanaugh, the Democrats are only  underscoring one of his most impressive skills--his widely acclaimed  talent for thinking through all parties' perspectives and engaging  fairly with the full range of views, regardless of his personal  beliefs.   This and all other specious attacks that were trotted out said  absolutely nothing about Judge Kavanaugh's actual record. They said a  great deal about the Senators who were willing to resort to them in  order to appease the far-left special interests, but I suspect that  everyone who listened fairly to Judge Kavanaugh and the other witnesses  came away seriously impressed with his qualifications for the Court,  and I look forward to voting to confirm him here on the Senate floor in  the coming weeks.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, later this  afternoon, the Senate will vote to advance the nomination of Charles  Rettig to serve as Commissioner of the IRS. Mr.  [[Page S6116]]  Rettig's nomination comes at a crucial time, as the Federal Government  continues to implement once-in-a-generation tax reform.   Recent memory reminds us just how important it is that all Americans  get a fair shake from the agency that oversees the Tax Code. This  historic new law makes it all the more important that the IRS continue  to modernize and improve its technological infrastructure.   So I look forward to this nominee's getting to work on behalf of the  American taxpayers.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we will then turn back to  appropriations. This week we will vote to approve the conference report  that will fund energy and water, military construction and the VA, and  the legislative branch.   This week's bills contain $147 billion for projects ranging from  waterways infrastructure to military family housing, to nuclear  security and much more. This legislation equips the Army Corps of  Engineers to carry out harbor maintenance, inland waterways  restoration, and critical flood damage reduction efforts. It enables  the Department of Energy to support groundbreaking research in  computing systems and energy efficiency and to step up the security of  our Nation's nuclear arsenal.   The Military Construction and VA title funds overdue maintenance to  operational facilities, as well as nearly $2 billion in support for  military family and personnel housing, and it expands resources for in- house VA medical services and broadens community options for veterans  seeking vital treatment through funding of the VA MISSION Act.   These are national priorities with local impacts that will be felt in  every one of our States.   In my home State of Kentucky, hundreds of millions of dollars will go  toward training facilities at Fort Campbell and Fort Knox,  infrastructure improvements in Appalachia, and environmental cleanup  efforts in Paducah.   I know all Senators can tell similar stories for their own States. So  we are looking forward to taking another step forward on regular  appropriations and passing this conference report this week.   I want to thank Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy for all they have  done to keep this process going forward.   Thanks also to the subcommittee chairmen, Senator Boozman and Senator  Daines; Senator Alexander, who chaired the conference; and all of my  colleagues on the Appropriations Committee.   So let's pass this legislation and keep making progress together.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, the pain that  opioid addiction and drug abuse has inflicted on families across  America is almost unfathomable. Every day, 115 more American lives are  lost to overdose. Synthetic opioid deaths nationwide skyrocketed six- fold from 2014 to last year alone.   Sadly, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is all too familiar with these  statistics. More than 1,500 Kentuckians died from a drug overdose in  2017, and Kentucky has ranked among the top 10 States for opioid  fatalities for several years.   The tragic medical trends are only one of the ways this crisis is  crippling communities all across our country. These drugs eat away at  economic opportunities, they erode our labor market, and they make it  even harder for distressed communities to get back on their feet.   So this is nothing short of a national emergency, and that is why  Congress has already passed major legislation to address it, and very  soon we will take significant new action by passing the legislation  that has been shepherded by Senator Alexander and his committee  colleagues. This landmark package combines work from 5 different  committees and 70 different Senators.   I am proud that two of my bills are included--the CAREER Act, to help  individuals in recovery transition back into the workforce and access  housing services, and a second provision that will step up  accountability on Federal efforts to combat addiction among pregnant  mothers.   These are just two pieces of this comprehensive package.   It will cut the supply of illegal drugs that pour over our borders,  make it easier for communities to invest in recovery efforts, extend a  helping hand to families and caregivers, and provide for the longer  term medical innovation we need to put this crisis in the rearview  mirror.   I am pleased to have played a part in developing this landmark  response.   I am grateful to Chairman Alexander and his colleagues, and I will be  proud to vote for this legislation very soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, it has been a  rough week for our Democratic colleagues who claim that the Republican  policy agenda wouldn't lay a good foundation for a strong economy, but  it has been a great week for America's workers and middle-class  families.   The evidence keeps piling up. Tax reform and regulatory reform have  helped create the conditions for one of the best economic moments the  American people have seen in recent memory, and some measures are at  their best levels in decades.   Here is just a small sample:   ``U.S. job growth accelerated in August and wages notched their  largest annual increase in more than nine years.''   Another headline reads: ``Job openings hit record high.''   Another: ``Small business optimism surges to highest level ever.''   This economy is literally flying through all-time records faster than  I can come to the floor and discuss them. Many of these numbers are  unprecedented. They are exactly the opposite of what some gloom-and- doom Democrats insisted would happen if this unified Republican  government put our opportunity agenda into effect.   Fortunately, my Republican colleagues and I know that getting  Washington, DC, out of the way helps make good things happen for the  American people, and that is exactly what we will continue to do.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the conference report to accompany H.R. 5895.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the conference report.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Mr. President, I thank my friend from Mississippi. I  will be brief.    For the information of our colleagues, these will be  the only rollcall votes during this week's session.    Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  celebrate one of the great public educational resources in my home  State of Kentucky. This month, we mark the 50th anniversary of Kentucky  Educational Television, KET, which has provided a vital service to the  Commonwealth. It is my privilege to take a look back at the  distinguished history of this organization and its impact on Kentucky  families.   When KET officially signed on the air in 1968 under the leadership of  its founding director, University of Kentucky professor O. Leonard  Press, it did so during school hours on the second largest land-based  network in the world. Its first instructional program was ``Kentucky is  My Land,'' which directly addressed KET's mission to deliver quality  educational programming for all levels and to explore the beauty and  heritage of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. That original goal has  animated the remarkable educational and public affairs programming of  this network for half a century.   During its first decade on the air, KET continued to expand and  provide important services to its viewers, which included the debut of  consequential Kentucky journalists such as Al Smith and KET's first  nationally distributed instructional series, ``Universe & I.'' In  addition, the network began its televised coverage of the proceedings  of the Kentucky General Assembly, providing unprecedented access and  public transparency to our State's legislature and a valuable civic  education to our citizens.   As an affiliate of the Public Broadcasting Service, PBS, KET also  brings nationally treasured programs into the homes of thousands of  Kentuckians. Programs such as Julia Child's ``The French Chef,''  ``Masterpiece Theatre,'' and many of Ken Burns's historical documentary  series have made an indelible impact on our country. As KET has grown,  it has expanded its programming around the clock to provide educational  opportunities to Kentuckians 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   Throughout the years, KET has also grown its public affairs content,  delivering news of the day and critical information to viewers. Staffed  with top-notch journalists and featuring interviews with well-known  Kentuckians, these programs are an important part of the network's  overall mission. Throughout my career, I have enjoyed both viewing and  periodically joining these programs to discuss vital issues to the  future of Kentucky.   Keeping faith with its educational goals, the network has developed  important partnerships with educational institutions and universities  in Kentucky. In fact, Morehead State University began offering KET  distance learning courses for dual credit, and the KET Fast Forward  program has excelled as a learning system for GED test preparation.   I commend KET's 50 years of award-winning service to my home State.  It is my privilege to congratulate the network on its success, and I  look forward to many more years of quality programming in our  Commonwealth. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in celebrating  KET's exemplary work.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution on documentary production by the Select Committee on  Intelligence, and ask for its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, the Select Committee on Intelligence  has received a request from the Department of Justice in a pending  criminal case against Paul J. Manafort, Jr., for a copy of a transcript  of an interview that the Committee staff conducted of a witness named  W. Samuel Patten in January 2018.   In response to this request, this resolution would authorize the  Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence,  acting jointly, to provide a copy of the interview transcript, under  appropriate security procedures, to the prosecution, which intends to  share it with the defense under a protective order entered in the case.                            ____________________
