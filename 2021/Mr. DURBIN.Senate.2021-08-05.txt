 Mr. President, this week the Senate will vote on Eunice  Lee's nomination to serve on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. If  confirmed, Ms. Lee would be the only--the only Black woman--and the  only former public defender to serve on the Second Circuit. With her  nomination, the Biden administration and Senate Democrats are  continuing our efforts  [[Page S5895]]  to build a Federal judiciary that looks like America.   I would like to take a moment or two to discuss Ms. Lee's  qualifications and what she will bring to the bench--a perspective that  is sorely needed.   Ms. Lee has dedicated her entire legal career to public defense work,  most recently as an assistant Federal public defender with the Federal  Defenders of New York.   Graduating from Ohio State University and Yale Law School, Ms. Lee  began her legal career clerking with the Southern District of Ohio and  then with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.   She then joined New York's Office of the Appellate Defender, where  she spent more than 20 years advocating for indigent criminal  defendants at all levels of the New York State court system. During  that time, Ms. Lee taught and mentored a new generation of lawyers when  she served as an adjunct assistant professor of clinical law at New  York University.   She then joined the Federal Defenders of New York, where she has  briefed and argued criminal appeals in the Second Circuit, the court to  which she is now nominated.   In short, Ms. Lee has dedicated her entire life to upholding the  Sixth Amendment right to counsel, representing defendants who cannot  afford to hire a lawyer.   Now, some of my Republican colleagues have claimed, without any  evidence, that, as a former Federal public defender, Ms. Lee would be  biased as a judge in favor of defendants. It is curious to me that  these concerns of her bias didn't seem to crop up over the decades when  former prosecutors were nominated to the Federal bench, and for good  reason. It is as flimsy an argument as it is offensive to the lawyers  who represent defendants--a representation mandated under the  Constitution.   Let's be clear: Both prosecutors and public defenders play essential  roles in our justice system, and their jobs give them extensive  courtroom experience, which is something we demand of all judges.   Additionally, Ms. Lee has made it clear she understands the  difference between being a lawyer and a judge. As a lawyer, she is an  advocate; as a judge, an arbiter. At her hearing before the Judiciary  Committee, Ms. Lee explained that she ``critically recognize[s] the  importance of [being] a fair decision-maker.''   What is more, 70 former prosecutors--those are the women and men  sitting at the other table in the courtroom--in the Southern and  Eastern Districts of New York, the very prosecutors that she squared  off with in the courtrooms, have stressed the importance of having her  perspective as a public defender represented on the Second Circuit.    In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, these prosecutors wrote:  ``[W]e enthusiastically support Ms. Lee not just because of her  sterling credentials. We believe that after a career as a public  defender serving indigent clients in criminal cases, Ms. Lee would  bring a unique and under-represented perspective to the job of hearing  and deciding federal appeals.''   Then they added that Ms. Lee was ``an incredibly talented lawyer and  public servant, whose career representing the most vulnerable among us  will bring a critical, unique perspective to the bench.''   Finally, I want to share a passage from a recent op-ed written by  Clark Neily, a scholar at the Cato Institute, and Devi Rao, a counsel  at the MacArthur Justice Center.   They wrote: ``Judges with a greater diversity of professional  experience would improve judicial decision-making overall. A judiciary  with members whose formative professional experiences span the legal  profession will be best equipped to handle the diverse range of cases  and issues presented to them.''   Legal experts across the ideological spectrum agree. Professional  diversity on the Federal bench is beneficial to our system of justice.   With Eunice Lee's confirmation, this Senate can continue bringing  balance to our Nation's courts and elevate a professional perspective  severely underrepresented today. I will vote for Ms. Lee's nomination,  and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Let me just add in closing, I want to thank the Members of the  Senate, both political parties, for proposing nominees to the Biden  White House for consideration for lifetime appointments to the Federal  judiciary. They have brought those nominations to the Senate Judiciary  Committee, where I chair the proceedings, and it is remarkable. The  women and men who have come to us, prepared to serve, make a lifetime  commitment to serve our Federal judiciary.   The diversity in that group is amazing, remarkable, and the quality  is without exception. Nearly all of them have been found at least  ``well qualified'' unanimously by the American Bar Association--in many  cases, and certainly in others, very positive reports as well.   I want to continue bringing these women and men to the floor of the  Senate. I pleaded even this morning with the majority leader, Senator  Schumer, who has the toughest job in the world of trying to move all  the things we want to do onto this calendar and off again. I thank him  for his cooperation.   I would like to say a few words on a separate topic.                             Eviction Moratorium    Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senate Republican leader  this morning, Senator McConnell. I struggle to understand one aspect of  his speech. He referred to the notion of helping those who are facing  eviction as some form of socialism.   What we are doing, of course, is trying to make certain that all of  these people have a roof over their heads, and some of them are going  through extraordinarily difficult economic challenges and  extraordinarily difficult public health challenges.   The money that we are sending their way is not just for them,  obviously, but also to benefit the landlords, the people who own the  property that they occupy.   Now, that is not unusual for this Congress in the midst of this  pandemic to step up and help small businesses like landlords who are  trying to pay their mortgages during this difficult time when they have  tenants who are going through economic distress. I don't think that is  socialism.   It wasn't socialism when we created the PPP program in 2020 on a  bipartisan basis, with recordbreaking sums of money, to give to small  businesses to help them through the treacherous times of this pandemic.  It was just common sense. Our economy was taking a hit, and they were  too.   We wanted the day to come when we could deal with this pandemic  effectively and also that they could return to their businesses. Was  that socialism, that we would have that kind of an effort? I don't  think so.   As a matter of fact, when it came to passing that legislation, it was  bipartisan and virtually unanimous--President Trump supporting it as  well as Speaker Pelosi when it all came to pass. I mean, that is an  indication of bridging the vast political differences in this country  when an emergency demanded it. I don't think that is socialism.   When it comes to those tenants who are struggling to get by in these  difficult times, helping them and the landlords whose property they  occupy is not socialism; it is what America is all about. It is, of  course, an involvement of the government, and we all voted for that,  but it is in a specific context of helping people.   What the President has now proposed beyond this infrastructure bill  that we are facing is that we look to other aspects of family life  where we can help families cut the cost of the basics that they face,  whether it is childcare or sending a child to college.   I don't think it is socialistic to say we want 2 additional years of  education for the graduates of high school in America so they are  prepared to compete in the 21st century. That is just common sense.  Socialism? I don't believe it is even close to socialism. It is really  preparing them for a competitive, entrepreneurial economy and for  success in life. That, to me, is a noble goal, whatever party is behind  it.   When it comes to the debt ceiling of this country, I just hope we can  find a way to deal with this responsibly. It has always been a  political football, depending on which party was in power, but to risk  the possibility of a default on America's debt at this moment in  [[Page S5896]]  our economic history is a dangerous, dangerous undertaking. We need to  do the right thing. We have to concede the obvious.   Certainly the previous President, Trump, didn't win any accolades for  fiscal conservatism. And we have to come together to recognize, whoever  the President may be, the important thing is that this Nation move  forward--move forward to our cures for the illnesses that we face but  also to an economy that is expanded.   I yield the floor    The Ohio State----    Madam President, let me say a word of support for the  Senator from Connecticut as well as the Senator from New Jersey. I  couldn't agree with them more. There is no reason why this  information--full disclosure of this information--has not been made  known first to the families but certainly to the people of this country  at this moment in history, 20 years after that terrible tragedy. It is  time for the truth to be known.   I support your efforts completely, Senator Blumenthal, and I will  help you in any way that I can.                          remembering richard trumka    Madam President, when I grew up in East St. Louis, IL, I knew I was  from a railroad family because, well, both Mom and Dad worked for the  railroads. I knew we had a pretty comfortable life. I have come to  learn that we weren't by any means rich, but we did well enough--two  older brothers and myself. I knew that my mom and dad worked for a  railroad, and eventually all of us in the family did in some capacity.   I also knew that we were a union family, and I didn't realize until  much later in life a couple facts: No. 1, there were a lot of families  around us who weren't that lucky. We were fortunate to be a union  family. Secondly, what the union did for my family in East St. Louis,  IL, it did for millions of families across America throughout our  history. Those labor unions could stand up and fight for people who  couldn't fight alone and have a chance to win.   I have a healthy respect for unions. I believe that, more than any  other force in American history, the American labor movement, the union  movement, created the middle class in America. I am living proof of  that. My mom and dad had eighth grade educations. My mother was an  immigrant to this country. But hard work, a good work ethic, and a  strong support of a labor union gave them a chance to earn a decent  living on a safe job and to raise a good family.   I reflect on that at this moment because we have lost one of the  pillars of the union movement in the United States of America, Richard  Trumka.   What an amazing biography. I used to think back. I had heard he was  the son of immigrants, and I knew that he worked in the coal mines, but  then I knew he also went to law school, and he became head of the AFL- CIO, the largest gathering of unions in our country.   If you ever met him, with his little brush mustache and the gruff way  about him, you knew he was no pushover. How could you be a pushover and  head of the United Mine Workers union which he was at a very early age?  How could you be a pushover and be head of a national labor  organization like the AFL-CIO? He did that, and he was an amazing  advocate for the women and men whom he represented in the labor  movement.   I can't even start to count the number of meetings that I attended  with Richard Trumka. When we wanted labor's voice, we called Richard  Trumka, and we knew that when that door was closed, he was going to be  brutally honest with us. He would spend a few minutes thanking us, and  then he would spend the rest of the meeting telling how we needed to do  better: The working families of America were expecting us to stand up  and fight for them. And he took no prisoners when he went through the  roster and the rollcall of how people had voted and where they stood on  union issues. It was an amazing performance by a man who had the  credentials to deliver it, a man who was part of the labor movement  from working in those coal mines, and a man who had developed the  skills and talents at law school and beyond to be able to fight for  those men and women.   It is stunning to think that we lost him today at age 72. That is way  too young. He did such an amazing job as the son of a coal miner  himself. You never had to ask ever which side Rich Trumka was on--ever.   I have got to be honest with you. There are some people who are  fighting for causes in Washington, DC, because there is a paycheck at  the end of the day, but there are some people who are fighting for  causes who couldn't give a damn about a paycheck. They are there  because they believe it. Trumka was one of those people. He was  fighting for working people across the United States night and day,  endlessly, 24/7. He was on the side of workers who built America's  roads and bridges and of the men and women who were not in the labor  movement but trying to become part of it. He fought for the men and  women who kept our powerplants running and our schools, homes, offices  running.   He always asked for one basic thing: respect and fairness for working  men and women.   He was with me on the Dream Act. He understood, as the son of  immigrants, that immigrants are a vital part of this country, and they  should be for years to come.   Trumka was on the side of growing this American economy the right  way, not from the top-down, not trickle-down, but from the bottom-up.  He believed, growing up in Pennsylvania and the life that he led, that  it was critical that we be there for families when they made the basic  decisions about whether or not they were going to buy a new home, buy a  new car, be able to pay for their kids to go to college. He believed,  as my old friend Paul Wellstone would say, ``We all do better when we  all do better.''   He was a giant who led the labor movement in America through one of  the most challenging periods in our history, when his leadership was  needed the most.   It is on us now--isn't it?--those of us who think about Rich and what  he said to us so many times privately, publicly. The responsibility  that we have is to stand up for the men and women who work in this  country who don't have a voice otherwise. Our responsibility is to give  those in the labor movement the respect they deserve for fighting for  the right cause.   My wife Loretta and I send our condolences to Rich's wife Barb and  their son and family.   I understand that he was with his grandson when he was stricken this  morning. As a grandfather, I will tell you it is a happy moment when  you are with your grandkids, and that is the way it should have been  for Rich.   President Trumka's friends, his sisters and brothers in the labor  movement, and to all the families to whom Rich Trumka devoted his life,  they and we have lost a true champion.   America is better for Rich Trumka having lived and been part of  fighting for those who worked to make America a great nation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in early 2011, I had one of the more  unusual experiences of my Senate career. I traveled back in time, from  a free and democratic Lithuania to a closed and totalitarian Belarus.  The trip was less than 3 hours, but it took me back to a dark past.   You see, Belarus is the last dictatorship in Europe. But like many  dictatorships, it claims to be a democracy. In December 2010, it held  what was billed as a Presidential election. The victor in that rigged  contest was a heavy by the name of Alexander Lukashenko. His first act,  after seizing the Presidency, was to jail all of those who were bold  enough to run against him.   Months later, I drove from Vilnius to Minsk to meet with the family  members of those jailed candidates, who had been arrested by Belarus  security services still called the KGB. Mind you, the original KGB was  dissolved more than three decades ago. That tells you all you need to  know about how much the Belarusian Government has evolved since the  fall of the Soviet Union. My meeting with those family members was  sobering, and it is an encounter I will never forget.   Fortunately, over time, we were able to see the release of all these  brave Belarusians, but not because Alexander Lukashenko had a sudden  change of heart. He is still the same authoritarian thug he has always  been. The world was reminded of that a year ago, when another sham  election was held in Belarus. True to form, Lukashenko was reelected in  that rigged contest. And once again, he began jailing those who had  opposed him.   When one leading candidate, social media personality Sergei  Tikhanovsky, was arbitrarily jailed, his wife Svetlana Tikhanovskaya  stepped in to run in his place. She likely won the ensuing election,  although we will never know for certain. The stolen electoral process  that unfolded scared her into fleeing for safety in neighboring  Lithuania.   Last month, Ms. Tikhanovskaya traveled to Washington, DC, to seek  support for the Belarussian peoples' fight for freedom from tyranny. I  was proud to meet with her, along with Senators Shaheen and Sullivan.  And I was glad to see President Biden met with her as well. Svetlana  Tikhanovskaya is a brave patriot carrying the torch of democracy for  all the people of Belarus.   I thought of her, and other Belarussian patriots, as I watched the  Olympics this week. In Tokyo, another brave Belarussian woman, sprinter  Krystsina Tisimansouskaya, dared to publicly criticize Belarussian  Olympic officials, a group from Lukashenko's ruling party. For her  audacity, Lukashenko ordered the 24-year-old sprinter to return to  Belarus immediately, right before she was scheduled to run in the  women's 200-meter race on Monday.   If she had obliged, there is a very good chance she would be locked  up in a Belarusian jail at this very moment, along with so many other  political prisoners. But Krystsina Tisimansouskaya said no. At the  Tokyo airport, before she could be forced onto a plane home, she sought  protection from Japanese police. She also appealed to the International  Olympic Committee for help. Her appeals worked. The Polish Government  granted her a humanitarian visa. And Slovenia and the Czech Republic  said she was welcome in their countries, too.   Ten years since my trip to Belarus, I am still moved by the courage  of so many Belarusians like Ms. Tisimansouskaya, Ms. Tikhanovskaya, and  the thousands upon thousands who have peacefully protested for a better  future. These heroic leaders are still trapped in a dark past thanks to  the same ruthless dictator who continues to cling onto power.   They are willing to risk so much for a chance at freedom. They are  unafraid to stand up to despots and defend democracy. And they are an  inspiration to a world that needs it. I want them to know we see them,  and America stands with them in their efforts to create a better and  truly democratic Belarus.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a related note, Alexander Lukashenko  may be the last dictator in Europe. But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor  Orban is working hard to become the next dictator in Europe.   In his 15 years as Prime Minister, Orban has undermined Hungary's  democratic institutions and the civil society groups that support them.  He has dusted off the autocrat's handbook and used many of its familiar  tricks, including using public funds to reward his cronies, spying on  and jailing dissidents and independent journalists, and turning media  organizations into his personal mouthpieces.   He spews ultranationalist bigotry dressed up as traditional values  and rails against what he calls an immigrant invasion. Critics on both  sides of the Atlantic cite him as a cautionary example of how  democracies can die. Some European leaders have called for Hungary's  expulsion from the E.U. because of Hungary's growing hostility to the  bedrock values of democracy under Orban.   Despite this, every night this week, Tucker Carlson has broadcast his  prime-time FOX show from Budapest, Hungary. He is not there to  interview the brave supporters of Hungarian democracy who are trying to  save their country from Orban and autocracy.   No, Tucker Carlson is in Hungary to praise Orban and hold up his  strongman stunts as an example for America to follow. It is reported  that he will also address a conference linked to Mr. Orban's anti- democratic nationalist movement.   Tucker Carlson has gone from spouting his dangerous anti-vax quackery  and spreading the Big Lie at home, to travelling abroad to fawn over an  autocrat and herald him as a leader worth emulating in this country.   Ronald Reagan would be horrified. We all should be.                            ____________________
