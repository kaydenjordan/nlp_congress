 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman, Chairman Grijalva,  for yielding, and for his leadership as the chairman of the Natural  Resources Committee, and as the senior member of our Arizona  delegation.   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 1373, the Grand Canyon Centennial  Protection Act.   When people think of Arizona, they most often conjure up images of  the Grand Canyon. It is our State's greatest treasure and one of the  most iconic natural wonders on Earth.   It took nearly 2 billion years for the Colorado River and its  tributaries to cut through layer after layer of rock to form the  canyon. The spectacular scene is something best experienced in person,  which is why it is one of the most visited national parks in our  country.   The park is a key economic driver for northern Arizona's economy.  Last year, the Grand Canyon welcomed 6.3 million visitors, bringing  almost $1 billion of value to our local economies.   President Teddy Roosevelt, who designated the Grand Canyon a national  monument in 1908, said: ``Leave it as it is. You cannot improve upon  it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it.''   We could not agree more.   As we celebrate the park's centennial this year, we must take the  necessary action to preserve this natural landscape for future  generations to experience.   The bill before us today, which makes permanent a ban on new uranium  mining permits on nearly 1 million acres around the canyon, is that  necessary action. It is a vital step to protect this delicate  ecosystem, the significant number of species that call it home, as well  as the Colorado River watershed on which millions of people rely for  water.   This legislation has strong support from leaders and industries  across our State, from our Tribal nations to cities and counties, to  recreation and environmental organizations.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to join us in preserving the Grand  Canyon and supporting this important bill.
