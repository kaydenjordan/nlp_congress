 Mr. Speaker, school is out, but the schoolhouse is full.  I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3941, the Schools  Not Shelters Act.   We have seen Democrat-run States, such as New York, that announce  plans to house illegal immigrants in public schools and college dorms.  Our educational institutions should be focused on helping students  recover from the COVID lockdowns, which contributed to significant  learning loss, not housing immigrants.   H.R. 3941 prohibits public schools that receive Federal funds from  sheltering illegal aliens, which compromises schools' safety.   Let's pass this bill and put the safety and success of our children  first.                            ____________________
