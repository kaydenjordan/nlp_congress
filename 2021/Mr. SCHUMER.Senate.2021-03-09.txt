 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Senate returns this week to the  business of nominations. Today, the Senate will confirm Congresswoman  Marcia Fudge to be the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,  followed by confirmation votes later this week for Merrick Garland to  serve as Attorney General and Michael Regan to serve as the  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.   Finally, the Senate will begin the confirmation process for  Congresswoman Deb Haaland before the week is out. She would be the  first Native American Cabinet member of any Agency and the first  indigenous Secretary of the Interior--a profoundly important moment  given the historically troubled relationship between the Federal  Government and Tribal nations. Despite Republican obstruction,  Representative Haaland will be confirmed by the Senate to be Secretary  Haaland. I will file cloture on her nomination immediately after my  remarks.    Madam President, I want them all to know how much I  appreciate their work and how much the country does and what a great  difference it has made in the trajectory of our wonderful Nation.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 31.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.
