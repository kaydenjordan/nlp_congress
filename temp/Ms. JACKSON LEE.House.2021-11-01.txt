 Mr. Speaker, I wish a good evening to all of my  colleagues and certainly members of the Congressional Black Caucus. It  is my privilege to be part of the Special Order series of the  Congressional Black Caucus as a coanchor with Congressman Torres from  New York, and we thank him for his leadership. We thank, in particular,  the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Joyce Beatty, who has been  an enormous leader on any number of issues that are crucial to the  American people and to African Americans.   The one thing I say about the Congressional Black Caucus representing  millions and millions of Americans is that we represent a diverse  population of Americans. I am very proud to, as well, represent those  African-American descendants of freed slaves.   In fact, we rise today to emphasize the cruciality of the Build Back  Better Act for moving the Nation forward and particularly moving  forward those whom the Congressional Black Caucus represents. So I am  very pleased this evening to be joined by my outstanding colleagues,  who will include Congresswoman Adams from North Carolina, Congresswoman  Bonnie Watson Coleman from New Jersey, Congressman Dwight Evans from  Pennsylvania, and Congressman  Steve Horsford from Nevada. There are  others, such as Congresswoman Gwen Moore from the great State of  Wisconsin. Other Members may come.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear and refute a  statement that I just recently heard on the floor. Nothing is ignorant  in the Build Back Better bill and/or the bipartisan infrastructure  bill. In fact, ignorance is stamped out by these bills. One, they are  fully paid for as we are working the final edges of that, and, number  two, they are doing things that are long overdue for America.   Who are we as President Biden stands at the G20 and now at the  climate change conference? Who are we? We are leaders of the free  world. In fact, we are the leader.   Although there are debates on the status of Russia and the  competitive nature of China, all that has a basis in facts. But at the  same time, as these facts are present, the United States continues to  grow and to move and to ensure opportunity for its citizens. It is not  our creed to randomly snatch people off the street and lock them up. It  is not our focus to ensure that voices are not heard or that people of  different religions are treated differently, arrested, isolated, and  brutalized even. It is not our basic creed to enact laws that would  help us take very important proprietary information from others.   We are a democracy, and we are aided by the laws of that principle.  So I take no back seat to whether or not Russia and China are  competitive or are proposed world powers. What I say is that the United  States has all the elements of continuing her posture of leadership,  and one of those elements will be the successful passage of the Build  Back Better Act and BIF, the bipartisanship infrastructure bill. This  is the kind of legislation that is not seen even amongst our European  friends of late nor of China or Russia.   We are standing on the precipice of history, and I am very grateful  for the  [[Page H6057]]  leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus that has been at the  forefront of these matters. Again, working with so many of our  colleagues, we lead as full committee chairs having input into this  bill.   Let me very quickly indicate that we are strongly supporting the  $1.75 billion Build Back Better Act conceived and advanced by the  President and House Democrats. We are grateful that we have had moments  of negotiations with our other caucuses. Those caucuses are likewise  ensuring that the t's are crossed and the i's are dotted.   Mr. Speaker, what is wrong with that? When we finally bring a bill,  we want to make sure that it is vetted, and that is what so many of our  members of the CBC were able to do, to be part of the vetting.   It is also important in 2021, this 21st century, that we go big. It  is often said that the Federal budget is an expression of the Nation's  values and that the investments made to build back better are, in fact,  a clear declaration of congressional Democrats, of the Congressional  Black Caucus, to ensuring that our government, our economy, and our  systems work for the people.   We have always been the voice of the vulnerable. We have always been  the conscience of the Congress. So these are long-overdue investments.   The Build Back Better Act makes transformative investments, as our  chairwoman has often said. We need to continue growing our economy and  lower costs for working families. This $1.75 trillion--which, by the  way, I refute the statement of ignorance because the statement was  ignorant because they were speaking of $3.5 trillion, which was paid  for, but we have come to a conclusion and a compromise of $1.75  trillion.   Are the American people worth this? Are vulnerable communities worth  this? Are children who suffer from lead pipes and water from those  pipes worth it?   The Congressional Black Caucus feels it is the case. That is why we  have supported the improvement in education, healthcare, and childcare.  Childcare, in particular, will particularly help those of our community  who have for too long either gone without childcare and suffered or  paid more than half of their income.   Childcare is an important element of our work, and so I have the  Gingerbread Childcare Center husband and wife who made the sacrifice to  help vulnerable parents have childcare, parents who had to leave in the  middle of the night, people who worked at night, essential workers,  parents who worked for a period of time and, of course, did not have  the kind of childcare that the Gingerbread--a wonderful daycare-- allowed us to have.    We hope that these resources will help these kinds of entities in our  community: $40 billion in education to specifically improve Pell grants  and, as well, to work with historically Black colleges. I know we will  hear that from my colleague, but it is extremely important that we have  never left our HBCUs. They have been at the forefront of funding since  President Biden has come into office. Through the years of the  Congressional Black Caucus, and the voices of our members joined with  our chairwoman of the HBCU Caucus, Congresswoman Adams, we have them  included again in this legislation.   I will be discussing as we go forward healthcare, which is extremely  important. We are excited about getting aid to those in the 12 States,  including Texas, South Carolina, and North Carolina, among others, that  did not opt in to the Affordable Care Act-expanded Medicaid. We left so  many families along the highway of despair. Thank goodness we found a  way to bring them now under the Affordable Care Act, to give them  subsidies.   Help is on the way, Houston. Help is on the way, Texas, with the  highest number of uninsured, 766,000. Now, with Build Back Better, we  will have a pathway for them to get healthcare. I can hear the noise of  shouting now down in Houston, Texas, and I can hear the noise of  helping families with children have healthcare, which they did not.   We will talk about that more extensively and, as well, childcare, as  I have mentioned, to be able to ensure not only childcare with only 7  percent of your income but, again, universal and free preschool for all  3- and 4-year-olds.   That is something to say to China, Russia, and others, that America  recognizes what its priority is, and it is our children.   You will hear, Mr. Speaker, just a long litany of how lives will be  helped, how we will rebuild families, home care, giving dignity to  those essential workers, taking care of people in the latter part of  their lives, ensuring dignity and income but also ensuring the  opportunity for these individuals to be able to be cared for at home.   I will be discussing further the affordable housing that is very  important. Then, of course, is a major element of all of this, as the  President stands in front of the tens upon tens of countries, leading  on climate change, for which we gave him a standing ovation when he  left for his European meetings.   Mr. Speaker, you will hear more about this as we go forward this  evening. I am delighted that the Congressional Black Caucus played such  an instrumental role in dealing with the Federal Medicaid problem and  solving childcare, HBCUs, climate change, and dealing with maternal  issues for African-American women and many others.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Adams).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North  Carolina for her words. Again, I emphasize her commitment, dedication,  and work on historically Black colleges, and she is absolutely right:  $10 billion. But more importantly, that is layered upon the dollars out  of the American Rescue Act, out of the CARES Act, and the debt under  President Joe Biden that has been effectively worked on in this  congressional session. We know  [[Page H6058]]  that we are doing better by our students because we have done better by  them as it relates to education.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson  Coleman), who chairs the Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime  Security of the Committee on Homeland Security and has been committed  to improving the lives of young African-American women and, of course,  those dealing with mental health issues as well.                                time  2000     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much for  recognizing that this will be transformative, but as well, that it will  do and improve in areas that we have not done in the history of the  United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I am now delighted to yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), from Philadelphia, who has been instrumental  in dealing with issues of taxation and the empowerment of small  businesses.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  for recognizing that a vital part of the lives of families is  childcare.   As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I know that he was  extremely engaged in this very vital aspect of the President's Build  Back Better, and, again, we thank the wisdom of the President of the  United States, President Biden and Vice President Harris, for their  wisdom about helping American families.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford), the  first vice-chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and someone who  worked extensively on work training issues, extensively on healthcare,  and of course, on issues like childcare, as well.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank both Mr.  Horsford and Ms. Moore for one of the important colloquies that I have  heard on the floor of this body, and that is to be able to speak to  people who are  [[Page H6061]]  working hard every day, who are single parents, who work with their  minds and their hands.   I am glad to hear that we did not limit who would be able to receive  these benefits, and we also crafted the vitality and the vigorous  efforts of the Congressional Black Caucus.   As I close, Mr. Speaker, I would like to just reiterate what Members,  including the leadership of our chair, Chairwoman Joyce Beatty,  Congresswoman Adams, Congresswoman Watson Coleman, Congressman Evans,  obviously Mr. Horsford and Ms. Moore, what they all have said, if I  might. And that is, let me reiterate that each piece of Build Back  Better is a piece that is vital for the lives of Americans and African  Americans.   For example, $550 more in Pell grants for more than 5 million  students. Then HBCUs, again, $10 billion. Seniors who have never had  hearing aids, only 30 percent of seniors over the age of 70 who could  benefit from hearing aids have ever had them. Medicare in this Build  Back Better will include that extra benefit. Many of us have seen the  caricatures of our seniors on television and elsewhere trying to hear.  That is not anything that is funny, but it has been made light of. I  want to give every senior an opportunity to hear.   At the same time, I want to emphasize the importance of childcare. We  are telling the story. Only 26.8 percent of Black 3- to 4-year-old  children are enrolled in publicly funded preschool, with the average  cost of preschool for those without access $8,600. We are going to stop  it with this.   We are not going to be the Trump trillion-dollar tax cut to the top 1  percent and putting a deep dive into our deficit. We are going to put a  deep investment into the American people, particularly those people of  color.   I think it is extremely important that we talk about children and  healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do we have remaining?    This is about children getting access to healthcare  but, Mr. Speaker, there are many children that don't have access to  healthcare. In those States where families were not able to access the  Affordable Care Act--and there is something called Children's Health  Insurance Program, and that does provide for some aspect of care--we  had the Federal Medicaid concept, and so Build Back Better now is going  to put all of those people under the Affordable Care Act, and that is  going to give the family access to healthcare, which makes a sizable  difference. I think it is extremely important that we do that, to be  able to provide family healthcare.   Now, I heard our Members be very truthful. We still want to get  Medicare reduction on prescription drugs, a system that would allow  that. We still want family paid leave, and somebody said that that was  continuing to be negotiated. No, Mr. Speaker, it is working under the  umbrella and framework of President Biden's agenda, and we want to just  make sure that all of his agenda, within the context of being paid for,  gets recognized. We want these families to receive the kind of  resources that are necessary.   My colleagues talked about the child tax cut. I would like to call it  that. I would just like to be sure that we realize that if this plan is  implemented, it may impact 17 million low-wage employees, such as  hospitality workers and childcare providers, a framework of a tax cut  that would help children. They are people who work important jobs but  receive low pay, and this would get nearly 6 million people out of  poverty with this kind of cut. This is a crucial contribution.   Let me finish by letting you know what we have certainly gone through  in Texas. Infrastructure is extremely important. Part of that is  housing. During the pandemic, these are the kinds of signs we saw: ``My  landlord is calling, and I must pay or I will be evicted.''    Now, we have the American Rescue Plan and the CARES Act, but $150  billion will be in for housing, improving the infrastructure of public  housing. That hasn't been done in decades; 50 years I am told. And we  will get that done. That is what is important about the BIF bill, the  infrastructure bill that will have broadband. The very places where  those people live, take the lead out of the pipes.   And then, of course, for those of us who live in hurricane alley, our  friends in Louisiana with Hurricane Ida, my constituents with Hurricane  Harvey, and the number of hurricanes that have crossed the United  States during 2017, one after another. We will have in that  infrastructure bill a worthy response to the failing infrastructure of  this Nation.   We won't have to worry about what people say about Russia and China  or any other country. We will be enormously competitive, even to the  point of NASA. No one has even expressed their interest in that. They  will have a space here to be able to keep us competitive in space  exploration.   It will be extremely important that we have the opportunity to stop  violence with our community violence investment, $2.5 billion.   I am delighted to say this is the work of the Congressional Black  Caucus. They put their hands around all of it, for our constituents and  the American people. What Mr. Horsford has been speaking of is that he  is proud to give a listing. That is what I did, I did a roll call of  just what is going to be helped with Build Back Better and with BIF.   I am delighted to stand here with the vice chair, and I yield to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, we are excited about this violence  emphasis. As I conclude my remarks, let me pay tribute to deputies in  my district who were shot by an AR-15. We pray for them, their  families, and we should understand that violence has to end.   At the same time, let's take the words of John Robert Lewis, who sat  with us on this floor for more than 27 years, and in his last life he  said to all of us, the Congressional Black Caucus, that is what we are  going to do, carry on. We are going to carry on to make sure that we  bring transformative--transformative--legislation, not only to the  American people but to African Americans and people of color to change  their lives forever. That is what Build Back is, and that is what the  bipartisan bill is. We will work to make sure we cross the T's and dot  the I's. Carry on.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, and the Congressional Black  Caucus, I am pleased to co-anchor this Congressional Black Caucus  Special Order with my colleague, the distinguished gentleman from New  York, Congressman Ritchie Torres.   I thank the Chair of the CBC, Congresswoman Beatty of Ohio, for  organizing this Special Order to discuss the reasons why the CBC  strongly supports the $1.75 billion Build Back Better Act conceived and  advanced by President Biden and House Democrats to support visionary  and transformative investments in the health, well-being, and financial  security of America's workers and families.   Over the next hour, several of our colleagues will share their  perspectives on why it is essential that we ``go big'' in building back  better to our nation and all of its people have the opportunities and  resources to compete and win in the changing global economy of the 21st  century.   Mr. Speaker, it is often said that the federal budget is an  expression of the nation's values and the investments made to Build  America Back Better are a clear declaration of congressional Democrats'  commitment to ensuring that our government, our economy, and our  systems work For The People.   Mr. Speaker, these long-overdue investments in America's future will  be felt in every corner of the country and across every sector of  American life, building on the success of the American Rescue Plan,  accommodating historic infrastructure investments in the legislative  pipeline, and addressing longstanding deficits in our communities by  ending an era of chronic underinvestment so we can emerge from our  current crises a stronger, more equitable nation.   Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan action we took in February 2021 when we  passed the American Rescue Plan was a giant step in the right  direction, but it was a targeted response to the immediate and urgent  public health and economic crises; it was not a long-term solution to  many of the pressing challenges facing our nation that have built up  over decades of disinvestment in our nation and its people in every  region and sector of the country.   We simply can no longer afford the costs of neglect and inaction; the  time to act is now.   The Build Back Better Act makes the transformative investments that  we need to continue growing our economy, lower costs for working  families, and position the United States as a global leader in  innovation and the jobs of the future.   This $1.75 trillion gross investment will build on the successes of  the American Rescue Plan and set our nation on a path of fiscal  responsibility and broadly shared prosperity for generations to come.   The Build Back Better Act will provide resources to improve our  education, health, and child care systems, invest in clean energy and  sustainability, address the housing crisis, and more; all while setting  America up to compete and win in the decades ahead.   The Build Back Better Act is paid for by ensuring that the wealthy  and big corporations are paying their fair share and Americans making  less than $400,000 a year will not see their taxes increase by a penny.   Let me repeat that: No American making less than $400,000 a year will  not see their taxes increase by a penny.   In sum, Mr. Speaker, the investments made by the Build Back Better  Act will expand opportunity for all and build an economy powered by  shared prosperity and inclusive growth.   No one is better prepared or more experienced to lead the American  renaissance that will be produced by the investments made by the Build  Back Better Act than President Biden, the architect of the American  Rescue Plan and who as vice president during the Obama Administration  oversaw the implementation of the Recovery Act, which saved millions of  jobs and rescued our economy from the Great Recession the nation  inherited from a previous Republican administration.   And let us not forget that President Obama also placed his confidence  in his vice-president to oversee the rescue of the automotive industry,  which he did so well that the American car industry fully recovered its  status as the world leader.   Mr. Speaker, let me briefly highlight some of the key investments  made by the Build Back Better Act.   The Build Back Better Act will provide two years of free pre-K and  two years of free community college to ensure every student has the  tools, resources, and opportunity to succeed in life.   It will also invest in our teachers and institutions that serve  minority students and provide funding to give school buildings long- overdue infrastructure updates.   People lead happier, healthier, and more productive lives when they  have had access to high-quality education and that is why the Build  Back Better Act makes necessary investments to increase quality  education by four years for all students at no cost to hard-working  families.   The Build Back Better Act expands access to affordable, high-quality  education beyond high school, which is increasingly important for  economic growth and competitiveness in the 21st century.   Specifically, the Build Back Better Act will increase the maximum  Pell Grant by $550 for more the more than 5 million students enrolled  in public and private, non-profit colleges and expand access to  DREAMers.   It will also make historic investments in Historically Black Colleges  and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and  minority-serving institutions (MSIs) to build capacity, modernize  research infrastructure, and provide financial aid to low income  students.   The Build Back Better Act will help more people access quality  training that leads to good, union, and middle-class jobs and will  enable community colleges to train hundreds of thousands of students,  create sector-based training opportunity with in-demand training for at  least hundreds of thousands of workers, and invest in proven approaches  like Registered Apprenticeships and programs to support underserved  communities.   The Build Back Better Act will increase the Labor Department's annual  spending on workforce development by 50 percent for each of the next 5  years.   The Build Back Better Act expands access to quality, affordable  health care by strengthening the Medicare, Medicaid, and Affordable  Care Act (ACA) Marketplace programs that millions of Americans already  rely on.   It includes a major new expansion of Medicare benefits, adding a  hearing benefit to the program for the very first time.   Only 30 percent of seniors over the age of 70 who could benefit from  hearing aids have ever had them.   The Build Back Better Act strengthens the Affordable Care Act and  reduces premiums for 9 million Americans who buy insurance through the  Affordable Care Act Marketplace by an average of $600 per person per  year.   Just for example, a family of four earning $80,000 per year would  save nearly $3,000 per year (or $246 per month) on health insurance  premiums and experts predict that more than 3 million people who would  otherwise be uninsured will gain health insurance.   The Build Back Better Act closes the Medicaid coverage gap, leading 4  million uninsured people to gain coverage.   The Build Back Better Act will deliver health care coverage through  Affordable Care Act premium tax credits to up to 4 million uninsured  people in states that have locked them out of Medicaid.   A 40-year old in the coverage gap would have to pay $450 per month  for benchmark coverage--more than half of their income in many cases  but thanks to the Build Back Better Act individuals would pay $0  premiums, finally making health care affordable and accessible.   The Build Back Better Act strengthens the ACA by extending the  enhanced Marketplace subsidies that were included in the American  Rescue Plan.   It also provides an affordable coverage option for the more than two  million Americans living in states that have not expanded Medicaid  under the ACA and do not earn enough to qualify for Marketplace  subsidies.   When the Build Back Better Act is fully implemented soon gone will be  the terrible old days when too many Americans are forced to choose  between medical care and putting food on the table or affording other  necessities.   Mr. Speaker, approximately 3.9 million Black people were uninsured in  2019 before President Biden took office and even with the Affordable  Care Act's premium subsidies, coverage under the ACA was too expensive  for many families, and over 570,000 Black people fell into the Medicaid  ``coverage gap'' and were locked out of coverage because their state  refused to expand Medicaid.  [[Page H6063]]    The Build Back Better Act closes the Medicaid coverage gap while also  lowering health care costs for those buying coverage through the ACA by  extending the American Rescue Plan's lower premiums, which could save  360,000 Black people an average of $50 per person per month.   With these changes, more than one in three uninsured Black people  could gain coverage and with the addition of hearing coverage, more  than 5.8 million Black people on Medicare will benefit.   The Build Back Better Act will make an historic investment in  maternal health, including for Black women, who die from complications  related to pregnancy at three times the rate of white women.    Mr. Speaker, the cost of preschool in the United States exceeds  $8,600 per year on average, and for as long as we can remember, child  care prices in the United States have risen faster than family incomes,  yet the United States still invests 28 times less than its competitors  on helping families afford high-quality care for toddlers.   The Build Back Better Act supports families in need of child care by  providing access to safe, reliable, and high-quality care delivered by  a well-trained child care workforce.   The Build Back Better Act will provide universal and free preschool  for all 3- and 4-year-olds.   This is the largest expansion of universal and free education since  states and communities across the country established public high  school 100 years ago.   This is important because our nation is strongest when everyone can  join the workforce and contribute to the economy.   That is why this investment is vital to so many millions of-- especially women--who are often forced to choose between working to  support their family or caring for their family.   The Build Back Better Act will ensure that the vast majority of  working American families of four earning less than $300,000 per year  will pay no more than 7 percent of their income on child care for  children under 6.   Under the Build Back Better Act, parents who are working, looking for  work, participating in an education or training program, and who are  making under 2.5 times their states median income will receive support  to cover the cost of quality care based on a sliding scale, capped at 7  percent of their income.   The Build Back Better Act will help states expand access to high- quality, affordable child care to about 20 million children per year-- covering 9 out of 10 families across the country with young children.   For two parents with one toddler earning $100,000 per year, the Build  Back Better Act will produce more than $5,000 in child care savings per  year.   In addition, the Build Back Better Act promotes nutrition security to  support children's health and help children reach their full potential  by investing in nutrition security year-round.   The legislation will expand free school meals to 8.7 million children  during the school year and provide a $65 per child per month benefit to  the families of 29 million children to purchase food during the summer.   The Build Back Better Act will deliver affordable, high-quality care  for older Americans and people with disabilities in their homes, while  supporting the workers who provide this care.   Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of older Americans and  Americans with disabilities on waiting lists for home care services or  struggling to afford the care they need, including more than 800,000  who are on state Medicaid waiting lists.   A family paying for home care costs out of pocket currently pays  around $5,800 per year for just four hours of home care per week.   The Build Back Better Act will permanently improve Medicaid coverage  for home care services for seniors and people with disabilities, making  the most transformative investment in access to home care in 40 years,  when these services were first authorized for Medicaid.   The Build Back Better Act will improve the quality of caregiving  jobs, which will, in turn, help to improve the quality of care provided  to beneficiaries.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that the  Build Back Better Act will also reduce the cost of homebased care for  the hundreds of thousands of older Black adults and Black people with  disabilities who need it and are unable to access it.   Not to mention that investment in home care will raise wages for home  care workers, 28 percent of whom are Black.   In the area of housing, the Build Back Better Act makes investments  to ensure that Americans have access to safe and affordable housing by  providing resources to increase housing vouchers and funding for tribal  housing.   It also supports investments in programs that will help address our  nation's housing crisis by increasing the supply of affordable homes  for those in need and investing in historically underserved communities  and those that have been previously left behind.   Specifically, the Build Back Better Act makes the single largest and  most comprehensive investment in affordable housing in history and will  enable the construction, rehabilitation, and improvement of more than 1  million affordable homes, boosting housing supply and reducing price  pressures for renters and homeowners.   It will address the capital needs of the public housing stock in big  cities and rural communities all across America and ensure it is not  only safe and habitable but healthier and more energy efficient as  well.   It will make a historic investment in rental assistance, expanding  vouchers to hundreds of thousands of additional families.   And, perhaps even more importantly, the Build Back Better Act  includes one of the largest investments in down payment assistance in  history, enabling hundreds of thousands of first-generation homebuyers  to purchase their first home and build wealth.   In short, Mr. Speaker, this legislation will create more equitable  communities, through investing in community-led redevelopments projects  in historically under-resourced neighborhoods and removing lead paint  from hundreds of thousands of homes, as well as by incentivizing state  and local zoning reforms that enable more families to reside in higher  opportunity neighborhoods.   Th Build Back Better Act will spur and empower comprehensive action  to build an equitable clean energy economy with historic investments to  transform and modernize the electricity sector, lower energy costs for  Americans, improve air quality and public health, create good-paying  jobs, and strengthen U.S. competitiveness--all while putting our  country on the pathway to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2035.   The Build Back Better Act extends and expands clean energy tax  credits and supports clean electricity performance payments so  utilities can accelerate progress toward a clean electric grid at no  added cost to consumers.   The Build Back Better Act invests in clean energy, efficiency,  electrification, and climate justice through grants, consumer rebates,  and federal procurement of clean power and sustainable materials, and  by incentivizing private sector development and investment.   Another exciting aspect of the Build Back Better Act, Mr. Speaker, is  that it will drive economic opportunities, environmental conservation,  and climate resilience--especially in underserved and disadvantaged  communities--including through a new Civilian Climate Corps.   Mr. Speaker, the Build Back Better Act includes a $100 billion  investment to reform our broken immigration system--and does it  consistent with the Senate's reconciliation rules--as well as to reduce  backlogs, expand legal representation, and make the asylum system and  border processing more efficient and humane.   Mr. Speaker, immigrants eligible for such protection are an integral  part of Texas's social fabric.   Texas is home to 386,300 immigrants who are eligible for protection,  112,000 of whom reside in Harris County.   These individuals live with 845,300 family members and among those  family members, 178,700 are U.S.-born citizen children.   These persons in Texas who are eligible for protection under the bill  arrived in the United States at the average age of 8 and on average  have lived in the United States since 1996.   They own 43,500 homes in Texas and pay $340,500,000 in annual  mortgage payments and contribute $2,234,800,000 in federal taxes and  $1,265,200,000 in state and local taxes each year.   Annually, these households generate $10,519,000,000 in spending power  in Texas and help power the national economy.   The expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) enacted in the American  Rescue Plan has already benefitted nearly 66 million children, put  money in the pockets of millions of hard-working parents and guardians,  and is expected to help cut child poverty by more than half.   The Build Back Better Act not only extends this meaningful tax cut,  but it also extends the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and  the expanded Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which help families  make ends meet and put food on the table, reduce child poverty, and  lessen the burden on hard-working Americans so they can provide a  better future for America's children.   Mr. Speaker, 22.1 percent of Black people fall below the poverty  line, struggling to pay expenses like food, rent, health care, and  transportation for their families.   By extending the Child Tax Credit, the Build Back Better Act provides  a major tax cut to nearly 3 million Black people and cuts the Black  poverty rate by 34.3 percent, which will help the 85 percent of Black  women who are either sole or co-breadwinners for their families.  [[Page H6064]]    By permanently extending the American Rescue Plan's increase to the  Earned-Income Tax Credit from $543 to $1,502, the Build Back Better Act  will benefit roughly 2.8 million Black low-wage workers, including  cashiers, cooks, delivery drivers, food preparation workers, and child  care providers.   To put it all in perspective, Mr. Speaker, we have before us a once  in a century opportunity to make gigantic progress in making ours a  more perfect union, and to do it in a single bound with enactment of  the Build Back Better Act, the most transformative legislation passed  by this Congress since the Great Society and the New Deal.   I would urge my Republican colleagues to heed the words of Republican  Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully earlier this  year:         At this point in time in this nation, we need to go big. We       need to quit counting the egg-sucking legs on the cows and       count the cows and just move. And move forward and move right       now.    The same sentiment was expressed more eloquently by Abraham Lincoln  in 1862 when he memorably wrote:         The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy       present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we       must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must       think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and       then we shall save our country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
