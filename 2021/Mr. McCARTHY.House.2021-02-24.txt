 Mr. Speaker, Democrats won the House by the slimmest of  margins in November. In fact, it is the slimmest Democrat majority  since 1875, a mere five seats. 31,718 votes are what determines the  majority. Their victory in the other branches was also tight, 50/50 on  the Senate side.   Usually, when one party has a tiny majority, they recognize that  governing requires compromise. Not this majority.   Less than 2 months into controlling the House, despite promising to  solve problems and restore democracy, Democrats have proven that their  primary goal is not governing but grievance, the politics of  censorship, not common ground.   In January, they eliminated the motion to recommit, the last chance  for the minority to improve legislation, without a single Republican  vote. It will go down in history as the first time in the history of  this body that a majority did that, deny the minority, the millions of  constituents, their voice.   Already, millions have lost their voice in Congress due to the brazen  partisanship. What Democrats are doing this week is even worse.   Today, they will hold a subcommittee hearing that will focus on  broadcasters' and cable news' devotion to journalistic integrity. This  explanation should concern every American.   It has never been Congress' role to define and enforce journalistic  standards. The First Amendment expressly prohibits the government from  controlling what the press says.   But Democrats are trying to give themselves the power to dictate what  you can read and watch in your own home. And their assault on free  speech goes beyond today's disgraceful hearing.   On Monday, Representatives Eshoo and McNerney sent a letter to 12  cable, streaming, and satellite companies, essentially threatening them  to remove ``Fox News'', ``Newsmax'', and ``One America News Network''  from their airways.   Here is just a quick snapshot of the answers they are demanding from  the carriers:   ``What moral or ethical principles do you apply in deciding which  channels to carry or when to take adverse actions against a channel?''   ``What steps did you take to monitor, respond to, and reduce the  spread of disinformation, including encouragement or incitement of  violence by channels your company disseminates to millions of  Americans?''   Then the other question, coming from Congress in a majority of a  committee: ``Are you planning to continue to carry `Fox News',  `Newsmax', `One America News Network', both now and beyond any contract  renewal date? If so, why?''   Now, I am not an attorney, but some people have asked me, does that  reach an ethical complaint against these Members by using undue  influence?   I don't know. I guess the Ethics Committee would have to decide that.   These are Members of Congress who are using their official position  to coerce and control the information Americans can watch and access in  their own homes. They are demanding more censorship, more  deplatforming, and more control of what Americans can watch.   In their letter, Congresswoman Eshoo and Congressman McNerney suggest  that censorship is necessary because conservative views are not only  different, but they are dangerous. This is not only false; it is the  same script used in countries like China to silence speech they  disagree with.   Democrats would bring those same socialist standards to America, but  those standards are dangerous, vague, and easily abused. They have no  place here.   Democrats' action this week make it clear that the greatest threat to  free speech today is not a law from Congress, which is bound by the  First Amendment. The greatest threat is politicians who bully private  companies to silence dissenting views.   The sad part is it isn't only Democrats who have done this. They sent  a letter to a company of Amazon that was created to sell books, to tell  them not to sell books.   Lastly, beyond these serious threats to free speech, the irony of  Democrats' actions this week should not be lost on us. For the last 4  years, we were told that the greatest danger to free speech was  President Trump.   To underscore this accusation, the liberal legacy newspaper in  Washington adopted its first official slogan: ``Democracy dies in  darkness.''   As usual, the heated rhetoric from the other side was off base-- badly. The same party that is now worried about misinformation rumor  mills and conspiracy theory hotbeds was comfortable with endorsing  destructive and false narratives for 4 years.   Back in August, Congresswoman Eshoo herself basically alleged that  the Trump administration was intentionally attacking the U.S. Postal  Service. She called it election theft and a campaign of sabotage.   How about Congressman Adam Schiff? For years, he said he had more  than circumstantial evidence of Russian collusion. We all found that to  be false. Nevertheless, networks like ``MSNBC'' continue to perpetuate  the baseless accusation. I wonder if they sent a letter there.   Or how about our own Speaker Pelosi, who said in 2017, ``Our election  was hijacked. There is no question.''   Mr. Speaker, the American people are capable of making decisions  about how best to live their lives. They deserve to decide how to take  care of their families or open their businesses during a pandemic. And  they deserve to decide to watch the news, judge the information they  choose, and draw their own conclusions about its accuracy. They need us  to trust them, not to try to control them.   If Democrats accepted robust debate, they would find that more people  would trust Washington.   Mr. Speaker, this is a body that is using its power to try to  determine  [[Page H600]]  what books can be printed, what shows can be seen, and what can be  said.   Mr. Speaker, we have debated on this floor the things that happen in  China. And in China, if you try to buy an airline ticket you could have  the money, but they have an app there. And they say, first, we have to  check.   They have had people in their own press that were told: I am sorry,  you can't take the plane.   Why?   You have said something that government doesn't like. You should  apologize.   The reporter apologized but the government thought it wasn't sincere  enough.   To me, it is something I would fight because I believe in free  speech.   I thought that was farfetched in a faraway land. I never thought it  would be written on paper in the U.S. Congress, and the powerful  members of a committee that oversees jurisdiction would threaten people  of why they carry a network and will they carry that network in the  future; and if so, why?   I never thought I would see Members of Congress use their power to  threaten others to go against the First Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, we will not stand for it, nor will the American public.  This is not a partisan issue; this is a constitutional issue.                            ____________________
