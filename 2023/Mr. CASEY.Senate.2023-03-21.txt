 Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in honoring  the life of Judy Heumann, one of the most important disability and  civil rights leaders of our time.   While Judy spent most of her childhood and early adult life in New  York, she is a native Pennsylvanian, born in Philadelphia in 1947. She  was an advocate for disability equality and access to education from an  early age. When her mother attempted to enroll her in public  kindergarten, the school principal denied her admission because Judy's  wheelchair was determined to be ``a fire hazard.'' That determination  wasn't by any official means; it was only in the opinion of a principal  who had the power to bar her from receiving an education. It took over  4 years for Judy's parents to find a school where she could enroll,  starting regular attendance at school at the age of 9.   At the start of her adult life, Judy experienced similar  discrimination when the New York City schools denied her a job as a  teacher, despite having passed all requirements but one, the physical  examination. Judy sued the New York City Public Schools and won her  case and was hired as the first teacher with a disability in the New  York City schools. That was 1970.   One year later, partly inspired by the successful advocacy of Judy,  Pennsylvania parents of children with intellectual disabilities filed  suit to secure enrollment of their children in Pennsylvania public  schools. That successful case, known as PARC v. Pennsylvania, was the  foundation for the 1975 Education of All Handicapped Children Act, now  known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA.   After many years of advocacy, that included the development and  passage of IDEA and the Americans with Disabilities Act, Judy was  appointed by President Clinton to be the Assistant Secretary of Special  Education and Rehabilitation Services in the Department of Education, a  position she held from 1993 to 2001.   With that appointment, Judy had come full circle, from being barred  from attending public school as a kindergartener, to being responsible  for ensuring public schools across the country were accessible to and  educating all children with disabilities.   Successfully advocating for such groundbreaking change in education  of children with disabilities would have been enough for one life, but  Judy did much more than advocate to secure access to education for  children with disabilities. Her work included implementation of section  504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which requires all governments and  public entities that receive Federal funding to ensure their services  and settings are accessible to people with disabilities. She was a key  partner with Democrats and Republicans in the writing and  implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 and the  Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments in 2008.   Judy's work was not limited to the United States. In 1983, Judy,  along with Ed Roberts, one of the fathers of the disability rights  movement, established the World Institute on Disability. She felt that  the disability rights achieved in America needed to be spread  throughout the world. Judy became the first Advisor on Disability and  Development at the World Bank in 2002. And in 2010, President Obama  appointed her to the position of Special Advisor on International  Disability Rights at the State Department, a role she filled until  2017.   Along the way, Judy rarely forgot that she was working for individual  people with disabilities. When visiting countries, she made it a point  to seek out young people with disabilities and encourage them to speak  out and to become leaders in their own towns, districts, States, and  countries. She knew the power of policy to change lives and the  importance of individuals to implement that change.   Judy Heumann changed the world in big and small ways for people with  disabilities and all of us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Affordable Care  Act, passed some 13 years ago, and in particular to talk about the  Medicaid part of that, taking the Medicaid Program and allowing States  to sign up for an expansion of Medicaid.   But I thought the best place to start, as any healthcare discussion  should start, is to talk about just one family. This happens to be a  Pennsylvania family. I will start with two sisters. I will start with  the older sister. Her name is Haley. Haley wrote me a letter just about  2\1/2\ years ago now, talking about her little sister. Here is what  Haley wrote to me. She talked about where her family lives in  Pennsylvania, and then she said--her sister's name is Sienna--she said:         My sister is my best friend. She has Down syndrome so       sometimes things are harder for her. It took her a long time       to walk and she is still learning to talk. Her therapists       help her and sometimes I help her too.    Then she goes on to talk about how she, Haley, introduces her sister  Sienna to her classmates. She said that she shares her sister with her  friends, and I am quoting directly what Haley says:         Mommy and me read a story at my school to explain Sienna's       muscles work different than ours. Our muscles are like rubber       bands but hers are more like play-doh. Now my friends       understand why things are harder for her and they all love       her. They think she is the cutest and so do I.    So said an older sister about her younger sister.   Of course, her mom wrote a much longer letter to me about what that  family is facing every day. I won't go through all of it tonight, but  when this family received that diagnosis of Down syndrome, Sienna's mom  said:         Sienna's diagnosis came as a surprise to us. After enduring       four miscarriages, she was our miracle baby. Our miracle baby       surprised us on the day of her birth with her diagnosis and a       heart condition. We were completely unprepared to raise a       child with a disability. After I delivered her, a kind nurse       explained to me how lucky we were to have Sienna here in       Pennsylvania after the passage of the Affordable Care Act.    Then her mom goes on to describe all the benefits that she received  because of the Affordable Care Act and because of her residence in  Pennsylvania.   That is what we are talking about here when we talk about healthcare.  This isn't a budget question only. This isn't just a policy discussion.  This is about real people's lives. And the further away you get from  real people's lives, the easier it is to make the calculation, as some  have made around here, some Members of Congress whose healthcare is  made available to them because of the Federal Government--that is why  they have healthcare, because of the Federal Government. Whether they  are in the exchange or they have it some other way, most Members of the  U.S. Senate and the House have that healthcare because of the Federal  Government. So those with healthcare provided by the Federal Government  seek relentlessly--too many seek relentlessly to use Federal power to  cut people off of healthcare.    This is about real people's lives, not something abstract, not some  remote discussion about policy and about budgets and deficits and  appropriations. This is about real people's lives, like Haley's little  sister.   I know there has been a lot of discussion of late about Social  Security and Medicare and how we hope they are off the table, and that  is good, those two earned benefit programs being off the table. But  there is a third program that is not an earned benefit, but I would  argue that Medicaid is--Medicaid tells us who we are as a nation. It is  as if we look into a mirror when we consider the Medicaid Program, and  it  [[Page S876]]  tells us what kind of a nation we are or what kind of a nation we will  be if we slash it the way that so many people around here have proposed  in budget after budget, year after year, talking about slashing  Medicaid arbitrarily and outrageously and obnoxiously. We are going to  stop them from doing it once again, but I think it is important to  remind people what we are talking about here.   Medicaid is a program basically about three Americans: children from  low-income families--and not just in urban communities, but there are  certainly a high number of children in our cities who benefit from  Medicaid. Thank God we have the Medicaid Program all these decades  later. The utilization rate is actually higher among rural children or  children who live in rural communities. They have a higher utilization  of Medicaid in the Children's Health Insurance Program than urban kids  by percentage. That is a fact, and we need to remind people of that.   Medicaid is a program that also helps people with disabilities. You  can't march around here every day or year after year and say that you  really care about people with disabilities, that you fight for people  with disabilities, and then go and cut the Medicaid Program like some  have proposed. And the proposals to cut it haven't just been in the  tens of billions of dollars. That is just the annual cut they want to  propose. It has often been hundreds of billions of dollars over the 10  years within which we talk about budgets around here and  appropriations--hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts. That is what  some want to do.   We have to remind ourselves again that this is a program about  children and about people with disabilities. The third group of  Americans, of course, is older Americans, our seniors. A lot of middle- class families may not know it, but their mom or their dad or a loved  one is in a nursing home solely because of Medicaid. You can't get into  the nursing home, unless you can pay out of your own pocket, without  the Medicaid Program.   We could actually call the Medicaid Program the senior long-term care  program or we could call it the program that provides healthcare to  kids or we could call it the program that helps children with  disabilities.   Now we are told that the House Republican Study Committee fiscal year  2023 budget plans to cut Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance  Program, and the Affordable Care Act--all three. They want to cut the  Affordable Care Act marketplace subsidy spending by nearly half over  the next decade.   Again, when it comes to Medicaid, we are talking about a program that  provides the funding for almost half of the births in America. So  everyone who claims to care about children and babies and still wants  to cut Medicaid has some explaining to do when you want to  substantially cut a program that provides the funding for half of the  births in the United States of America. It also provides almost half of  the funding and support for long-term care services--services and  supports, I should say--for older adults and people with disabilities.  That is what the program is.   This Republican Study Committee goes on to say their budget plan  converts Medicaid to a block grant program where Federal funding would  be capped and States would receive a fixed amount regardless of their  actual costs.   Here is what that means in real life: A State gets a block of money,  a block grant, and when the State's costs go up for children or people  with disabilities or seniors, and they hit the cap of that, those  Americans are on their own. They are on their own because the State is  out of money. That is what that means in the real world.   But it gets worse. This plan also, thirdly, wants to cut the Federal  so-called FMAP, the Federal medical assistance percentage, the  percentage that the Federal Government pays for Medicaid. They want to  cut that all the way down to 50 percent instead of the numbers that it  has been at for years--so much higher. That is also a bad idea.   So when we get back to this on what it means for families, we also  have to consider what not just Sienna's sister said in her letter to  me, but what about Sienna's mom, whom I quoted just a little bit a  moment ago? Here is what Sienna's mom said:         As I entered this new world--    Because she just had a daughter diagnosed with Down syndrome.         As I entered this new world of early intervention,       therapies, and medical needs, I began to realize just how       much of a financial toll this would take on us if it weren't       for the protections of the [Affordable Care Act] and       Medicaid.    She goes on to describe that. She says:         Sienna receives 7 weekly therapies. The costs of those       alone are $3,400 per week.    That is $3,400 per week for those seven therapies.         Without the ACA, her therapies and medical care would have       quickly exceeded the lifetime cap--    Which was addressed in the ACA--       and Sienna would be uninsurable for the rest of her life and       left without access to life saving care.    Uninsurable. I can't tell you the number of times that has been in  letters that I receive from parents worried about their child who has a  disability in the United States of America, the most powerful country  in the history of the world. These families are worried about their  child with a disability not having access to services, not having  access to those therapies, not having access to what they need to live  their lives, and becoming ``uninsurable.'' That is an abomination. We  are not the greatest country in the world if we do that. We are nowhere  near the greatest country in the world if we do that. That would be a  stain on America. Every one of us should be ashamed of that if that  were to transpire. If that America transpired, it would diminish all of  us. It doesn't matter what else we do around here if that happens.   That is not the America that I think most people believe we are and  should be, but some want to go there. I know they have all this talk  about, oh, well, the cost of Medicaid is getting so great, and it is  ``unsustainable.'' That is Washington gobbledygook for people who do  not have the guts, the political guts, to say: You know what, when you  passed a tax bill in 2017 that gave away the store and so much else to  big corporations for permanent corporate tax relief--and those same  people who voted for that bill that gave permanent corporate tax relief  to the biggest companies in the world, the biggest companies in the  history of the world, are the same people who are saying: But we have  to cut back on Medicaid because it is unsustainable. That is just  throwing sand in the eyes of the people--that is what it is--blinding  them with falsehoods. That is what that is. So we have work to do to  prevent this from happening.    Now, Mr. President, I am getting close to my time--and I am over  already--but I wanted to make maybe two final points.   We have had a concern, many of us, over the last number of years  about access to Medicaid not being as stable as it should be; and that  stability was enhanced by a provision called continuous coverage--that  is the term of art, ``continuous coverage''--provisions that were  enacted to ensure healthcare coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Across the country, Medicaid enrollment has increased since the  beginning of the pandemic. For example, Pennsylvania's number went up  to about 3.6 million people currently enrolled in Medicaid to keep  their healthcare coverage uninterrupted.   Over the last 3 years, States were prevented from disenrolling people  with Medicaid. If not for the legislation passed in February of 2020,  at the very beginning of the pandemic just before the CARES Act, people  would have had to reapply for Medicaid on an annual basis.   Studies have shown that this annual enrollment process can lead to  unnecessary coverage losses due to administrative and procedural  issues. This can be yet another barrier to ensuring that people with  Medicaid continue to receive the coverage that they need.   Now, here is the problem. Here is the challenge ahead of us. The  appropriations bill passed in December set an end for the Medicaid  ``continuous coverage requirement'' because we are not in the pandemic  anymore, and that was enacted during the pandemic; and that  appropriations bill provided guidance to mitigate coverage losses as  this requirement ends. So this kind of  [[Page S877]]  unwinding of some parts of Medicaid is set to begin April 1. States can  start to disenroll people from Medicaid at the start of next month.   So here comes our responsibility. Both parties in the Senate, both  parties in the House--I should say, all three parties, Democrat,  Republican, Independent--we have an obligation, a legal duty, a moral  obligation that is inescapable to make sure that people know what they  need to do to maintain that coverage. The Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services are working with States to provide information, to  promote continuous coverage, and, thirdly, to avoid inappropriate  terminations as they begin to unwind this continuous coverage  requirement.   In Pennsylvania, the State I represent, the State is working  diligently to clarify coverage in formats and languages accessible to  enrollees to ensure that everyone understands their eligibility and can  access the coverage that they are entitled to.   My constituents are fortunate because Pennsylvania expanded Medicaid  years ago, yet there are still States that have chosen not to expand  Medicaid. We know that the expansion of Medicaid became easier with the  passage of the American Rescue Plan. So we have to continue to  encourage States to expand to make sure that more and more people get  coverage.   Let me end with this, Mr. President. As I outlined before, this is  not just something nice to have. This is about life and death. It is  about quality of life for families and for children, especially; but it  is also about the risk of death if you don't have coverage. That is as  true as any statement we could make, that this is about life and death.   Here is what Sienna's mom--you heard from her sister, but here is  what Sienna's mom said. And I will end with this. Towards the end of  her letter, she said:         I am proud to be Sienna's mom. This journey is full of       wonder, joy, and unimaginable love. It changes life's most       ordinary moments into the extraordinary. But with constant       attacks on our healthcare, it's also agonizing work, hard       decisions, and constant advocacy. It gets exhausting fighting       for your child, having to prove their value to the world.    This is a mother talking about her child and having to live almost a  separate life as an advocate because people in this town, year after  year, are proposing cuts that would badly damage the life of her  daughter Sienna.   She goes on to say:         Once again, we as parents are forced to suit up for battle       and prove that our children are worthy of healthcare.    In America? Is that what we are asking parents to do? Parents who  have had a reliance upon this program for years and, in some cases,  decades and decades, we are asking them to suit up--again, as she said,  ``to suit up for battle,'' to make the case to Washington as to why  they shouldn't cut the Medicaid Program in America? That is an insult  to all of us.   She shouldn't have to suit up for legislative or policy battles. She  should have the opportunity to not worry about that and just to live  her life and take care of her children and to live a life that she has  been able to live with the help that we provided through Medicaid and  other supports.   So we have some work to do here, to stop--not to talk about and hold  hands and compromise--to stop them from cutting what they want to cut  in Medicaid at all costs. So that is what I am going to be doing. We  are going to stop this from happening.   We can compromise on a lot of things around here, but not on that-- not on cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years to  Medicaid. Not in this America.   I yield the floor.
