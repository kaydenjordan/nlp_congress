 Mr. Chair, I thank Representative Tonko for yielding.   Article I, section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, States: ``The  people have a right to clean air, to pure water.''   Similar in spirit, the Environmental Protection Agency's website  proclaims that: ``The mission of EPA is to protect human health and the  environment.''   Unfortunately, EPA has taken only halting steps to deal with our PFAS  water contamination challenge, despite its ongoing harm to human  health. EPA's website describes those harms: ``low infant birth  weights, effects on the immune system, cancer . . . and thyroid hormone  disruption.''   I rise in support of H.R. 535 which will require EPA to mandate  cleanup of contaminated sites, set air emission limits, and limit new  PFAS chemicals in the marketplace;   Identify health risks by requiring comprehensive health testing,  reporting and monitoring;   Require a national PFAS drinking water standard that creates clarity  for States and municipalities;   Holds polluters accountable.   I am pleased to have worked on this public health issue and to see  that part of my bill, H.R. 2600, included, which will require EPA to  develop needed rules for safe PFAS disposal.   I rise in support of this bill.
