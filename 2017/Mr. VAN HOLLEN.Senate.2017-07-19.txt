 Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague and  friend, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, in introducing legislation  that would establish a Bicentennial Commission to honor Frederick  Douglass in 2018. Douglass was an extraordinary individual who was  enslaved at birth in Talbot County, Maryland.   At a young age, Douglass learned to read and write. In 1838 he  escaped from Maryland and moved to New York. Then, in 1845, he  published his first autobiography called ``The Narrative of the Life of  Frederick Douglass: an American Slave''.   He later escaped to Great Britain to avoid being tracked down and  returned to slavery in Maryland. Ultimately, British Quakers paid for  his freedom, which enabled him to return to United States, settling in  Baltimore, Maryland in 1847. Frederick Douglass continued to be a  strong Abolitionist who campaigned against slavery and in favor of the  right to vote throughout the East and Mid-West. In 1850 he oversaw the  Underground-Railroad in Rochester, New York.   As a Freeman he was able to hold significant positions within the  Government. He served as an Advisor to President Lincoln. He was  appointed to serve as the District of Columbia Legislative Council, the  United States Marshall and the Recorder of Deeds. He subsequently  became the Ambassador to Haiti from 1889 to 1891.   Despite his extensive travel, Douglass made four trips back to Talbot  County, Maryland. He reconciled with Captain Thomas Auld who had  enslaved him in the past. He made a pilgrimage to Tappers Corner in  search of his grandmother's cabin and his birthplace. As an  entrepreneur, he invested in several enterprises, especially those that  would benefit the African-American community. These included low-income  housing developments in his old neighborhood in Fells Point (named  Douglass Place) and at Highland Beach, a summer resort community  outside of Annapolis popular with African Americans outside of  Annapolis.   Two hundred years after Douglass' birth is a fitting time to reflect  upon his work and achievements and pay tribute to a man who fought for  his freedom and justice for all. He stated: ``We have to do with the  past only as we can make it useful to the present and the future.''   In that spirit, it will be important to honor this man and explore  how his legacy can help guide the future of our Country. As Douglass  stated, ``The life of the Nation is secure only while the Nation is  honest, truthful and virtuous''.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague and  friend, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, in introducing legislation  that would establish a Bicentennial Commission to honor Frederick  Douglass in 2018.
