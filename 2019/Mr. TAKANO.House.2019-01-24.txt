 Madam Speaker, I rise today because what our country is  going through is a disgrace: 800,000 Federal workers are going without  a paycheck. They are suffering, and their families are suffering, all  because the President wants a wall that is nothing more than a monument  to hate. The American people are tired of this President's games.   Last night, I called some constituents who had contacted my office  because they are furloughed due to the Trump shutdown.   I talked to a Forest Service worker from my district who has missed a  paycheck and doesn't want to be used as a bargaining chip by the  President.   I talked to another constituent who works at the National Archives  and is experiencing the consequences of this shutdown. She knows that  the longer this drags on, the more people who will get hurt.   Last night, I received a heart-wrenching message from a constituent  who is experiencing hardship and needs to apply for assistance  programs, but she can't because she can't even access the information  she needs from the Office of Personnel Management.   This has to end. We have voted not once, not twice, but 11 times to  reopen the government. Leader McConnell and the Senate Republicans have  blocked these bills in the Senate every step of the way. To them, I  say: Enough. Do your jobs, not the President's bidding. 800,000 workers  and the rest of the American people demand it, and so do we.
