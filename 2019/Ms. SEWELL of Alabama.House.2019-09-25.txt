 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor the  remarkable life and legacy of Mrs. Juanita Abernathy, a selfless leader  in the struggle for civil rights whose direction and tireless  engagement was an integral part in the movement of civil rights and  voting rights in America. She, sadly, passed earlier this month.   From the Montgomery bus boycott to the marches from Selma to  Montgomery and onward to Washington, D.C., and beyond, Mrs. Abernathy  played a key role in our Nation's proudest instance of civic  engagement. She fought boldly alongside her husband, Reverend Dr. Ralph  Abernathy, and her dear friends and fellow architects of the movement,  Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Mrs. Coretta Scott King.   While many male leaders of the civil rights movement have rightfully  become household names, the women of the movement, whose struggles and  sacrifices were equal and whose participation was necessary, have not  enjoyed the same recognition. Mrs. Juanita Abernathy was a brilliant,  courageous leader in her own right, and today, we recognize her  remarkable and distinct contributions.   Mrs. Abernathy was born on December 1, 1931, in Uniontown, Alabama.  She was the youngest of eight children born to Alexander and Ella  Gilmore Jones. In the ninth grade, she met her future husband, Reverend  Dr. Ralph Abernathy, who wrote in his memoir that he was impressed by  her audacious spirit and her inherent dignity. In 1952, after Mrs.  Abernathy finished her B.S. in business education at Tennessee State  University, she and Dr. Ralph Abernathy were married.   Mrs. and Reverend Abernathy moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where she  became the secretary for the Alabama chapter of the NAACP and taught  high school courses on business education while Reverend Abernathy  became the pastor of the First Baptist Church on Ripley Street.   In 1955, around the family dining room table, Mrs. Abernathy wrote a  business plan for the Montgomery bus boycott, a plan that later served  as a blueprint for the civil rights movement. Meant to last only 1 day,  the Montgomery bus boycott went on for 381 days, eventually leading to  the courts desegregating public transit.   In retaliation to the success of the Montgomery bus boycott, the  Abernathy home was bombed. Reverend Abernathy was in Atlanta at the  time, but it was said that Mrs. Abernathy and her children only  survived because the bomb landed off by 2 feet.   Over the years, Mrs. Abernathy endured terror, harassment, and  unbridled hatred from white supremacists in her community and beyond.  Yet, in the face of unimaginable threats, she maintained her innate  dignity and bravery.   In 1961, Mrs. Abernathy and her husband moved to Atlanta, Georgia,  where she worked closely with the King family to integrate Atlanta's  public schools.   At this same time, understanding the link between race and economic  inequality in this country, Mrs. Abernathy fought to establish a  national food stamp program for low-income families and a national free  meal program for public schoolchildren.   A true servant leader, Mrs. Abernathy's brilliant mind, full heart,  and resilient spirit should remind all of us of what constitutes a full  and wonderful life.   On a personal note, I was honored to get to know Mrs. Abernathy  during her many pilgrimages to my hometown of Selma, Alabama, for the  annual commemoration of Bloody Sunday and the Selma to Montgomery  marches.   She was a powerful voice for change and a proud product of Alabama's  Black Belt who passionately protected the legacy of her husband and  their lifelong work together to advance civil rights.   Mrs. Abernathy graciously encouraged me to run for Congress and  honored me with her presence in my hometown of Selma on election night  when I won in November 2010. I saw in her face that night the pride she  felt witnessing the election of Alabama's first Black Congresswoman. I  prevailed because of her personal courage and sacrifice that paved the  way for future generations of Black children like me to succeed.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute and  honor to Alabama native Mrs. Juanita Jones Abernathy on the passing of  this civil rights icon and true American heroine, whose tremendous  efforts helped propel our Nation toward a more perfect Union.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this is a sobering moment in  our Nation's history, when the rule of law and constitutional duty  requires Congress to move swiftly to protect our national security and  the integrity of our democracy.   In my time on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I  have been amazed and grateful for the work our intelligence community  performs every day. We hold these men and women accountable to the rule  of law and expect them to adhere to the principles of our Constitution.   In return, those great Americans expect their elected leaders to be  held accountable to the same standard--above all, their Commander in  Chief. President Trump's refusal to adhere to the whistleblower statute  and his unwarranted attacks against one of these professionals flies in  the face of that compact.   The statute is clear, Madam Speaker. The Director of National  Intelligence shall provide the intelligence committee with all  whistleblower complaints, especially those that the inspector general  finds credible and of urgent concern.   It should not take this resolution or the threat of impeachment to  convince the President to uphold the law he swore to obey.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 576, honor our  oaths, and do the right thing.
