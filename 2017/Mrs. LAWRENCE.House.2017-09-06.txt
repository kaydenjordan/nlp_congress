 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DREAMers like Ola, a University of  Michigan pre-med student who aspires to be a surgical oncologist.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the  District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), who deserves a vote in this House,  for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.
