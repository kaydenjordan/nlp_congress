 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Trump  administration's Title X gag rule. The gag rule is a Federal  prohibition on funding for healthcare providers who may refer patients  to an abortion.   The Title X gag rule will endanger patients who rely on health  clinics that will lose Federal funding. That means women will have less  access to cancer screening, reproductive health services, birth  control, and health education.   By prohibiting medical caregivers from making decisions in the best  interest of patients, the gag rule puts lives at risk. All patients,  regardless of geography, income, race, or identity, should be able to  access whatever medical care and health information their healthcare  provider thinks is relevant.   The Trump administration should not be deciding what a doctor or a  nurse or any healthcare giver tells their patients.                            ____________________
