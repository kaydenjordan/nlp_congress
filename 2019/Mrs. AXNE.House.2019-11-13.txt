 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the price of  prescription drugs is too high and prescription drug prices have risen  44 percent in 5 years.   Big pharmaceutical companies have raised the cost of the most  commonly used drugs by 100 percent. I am talking about every day, basic  prescription drugs like insulin for diabetes or Advair for asthma.   Experts say there is no end in sight, and we will see prices rise in  2020 if this continues and if we don't act now.   I recently heard from Joan in west Des Moines, who said the cost of  her generic suddenly skyrocketed, and there is nothing she can do,  because if she doesn't take it she will need a liver transplant.  [[Page H8793]]    And I heard from John in Madrid, who discovered his insulin refills  literally cost more than the price of gold if you broke it down by  price per ounce.   That is why I am supporting H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act.  Iowans and Americans can't wait any longer. Every dollar spent on  overpriced drugs is stealing money away from someone's retirement, from  someone's college fund, and from buying a home, and it is putting  someone's life at risk.   We must act now and pass and support the Lower Drug Costs Now Act.                            ____________________
