 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Portland  Housing Authority, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year.  Portland Housing Authority and its affiliates provide critical long- term affordable rental housing and rental assistance to more than 3,000  low-income families, seniors, and disabled individuals in the Portland  area. They house over 6,500 residents, nearly 10 percent of the city's  population.   Portland Housing Authority was established in 1943 through State  legislation and is authorized by resolution of the Portland City  Council. They receive most of their funding through the U.S. Department  of Housing and Urban Development. Their mission is to provide and  expand affordable housing opportunities and services that ``improve  quality of life, build community, enhance safety, and promote personal  success for the people [they] serve and the neighborhoods in which they  reside.'' Certainly, over the last 75 years, Portland Housing Authority  has made great strides in helping those in the greater Portland area  find affordable housing and strengthening the community for everyone.   One example of the strengthened community can be seen in the  community groups created within the housing units. The Portland Housing  Authority received one of the first grants from Women's United, to help  fund community dinners where single mothers could learn about relevant  topics and get to know each other. Many of these single mothers used  these dinners to make friends, discuss their goals, and encourage and  motivate each other. They have created their own network, helping each  other out when needed.   Another of these community groups is the Pihcintu chorus. This all- girls chorus is made up almost entirely of refugee immigrants who live  in Portland Housing Authority units and who have represented Maine on  some of the biggest stages, including NBC's Today Show and the Kennedy  Center here in Washington DC. This group, whose name in Passamaquoddy  means ``when she sings, her voice carries far,'' is a unique way for  girls who are new to Maine to gather from their diverse background to  join as one voice. This group was started in 2005, and since then, more  than 200 girls have lent their voices to the chorus. For many, the  group offers a bit of serenity, companionship with other girls who have  gone through similar journeys, and a reminder of the home they left  behind. The chorus is also a symbol of their new home in the State of  Maine.   Over the last 75 years, Portland Housing Authority has not only  helped Portland residents find affordable housing, but also has helped  them thrive in their community. I want to recognize all the work they  have done for the greater Portland area and the State of Maine over the  last 75 years, and I look forward to seeing their continued success for  many years to come.                            ____________________
