 Mr. Speaker, Republicans are trying to protect everyone's  right to vote and the integrity of the election.   It boggles my mind that in some cities in the United States  noncitizens are allowed to vote and here in Washington, D.C., and other  cities when we go to a restaurant, we need to show our vaccination  database passport saying that we are fully vaccinated before we are  allowed to enter, but yet my Democrat colleagues don't seem to want  voter ID.   In the State of Arizona, we have a law in place that requires a voter  ID to vote. We also have a law in place that was held up by the courts  that prohibits ballot harvesting. Yet it continues to boggle my mind  that our Democrat colleagues want to undo what the States have done and  undo States' rights.   I am opposed to this bill.
