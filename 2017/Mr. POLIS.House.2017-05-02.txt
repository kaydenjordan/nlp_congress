 Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to help bring forth the  Equality Act, with 194 original cosponsors on both sides of the aisle.  The principle behind the Equality Act is simple: discrimination is  wrong, no matter what form it takes, no matter who it targets.   This is a principle that Americans overwhelmingly choose to embrace  and live by. We see it in the way we treat our LGBT employees, friends,  neighbors, and family. It is apparent in the outpouring of joy and  celebration we witnessed at the Supreme Court's historic marriage  equality ruling 2 years ago.   But sadly, our laws have not yet caught up with our values. It is  still legal in a majority of States to fire somebody just because they  are gay. That is not just a theoretical concern. It means real harm and  real hardship for countless Americans.   For LGBT Americans who are fired or turned away from a doctor's  office or told they are not wanted in their neighborhood, many of them  have nowhere to go for legal recourse. We are better than that as a  nation. It is time we showed that.    We are a nation that prides ourselves on our commitment to equality  under the law. So I call upon this Congress to pass the Equality Act  and put an end to legal discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual,  and transgender Americans once and for all.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Over the last several months, I have heard from thousands of my  constituents over the phone, by email, and record numbers at townhalls.  Frankly, the overwhelming message is frustration with the Trump  administration and Republicans in Congress--no calls to pass this bill,  which every group that advocates for workers' rights and unions  opposes. The people in my district say that, to the contrary,  Republicans continue to put the priorities of the few over the  priorities of hardworking Americans.   People are frustrated that, instead of working with Democrats,  Republicans are focused on gutting healthcare coverage, increasing  premiums, and stripping away workers' rights. People in my district,  across my State, and across the country are worried. The members of our  immigrant community--our neighbors, family, and friends--will continue  to be demonized by the President of the United States. So while I don't  expect this kind of rhetoric or policies to change overnight, I feel it  is important to share these concerns with this body.   Now, earlier this week, frankly, I was encouraged. There were some  signs of positivity. Congressional Democrats and Republicans announced  a bipartisan funding bill through the end of the year that shows a  bright spot of what we can do together when we try. I hope we can all  agree that a government shutdown would be catastrophic. In my district  alone, I am reminded of the devastating impact of congressional  inaction when I hosted a townhall in Estes Park just last week. The  government shutdown in 2013, right during tourist season, cost our  small and vibrant town nearly half a million dollars in tax revenue and  millions of dollars in sales, threatening the existence of many Main  Street businesses that rely on that tourism revenue and keeping Rocky  Mountain National Park open. Estes Park sits at the entrance of Rocky  Mountain National Park, and Rocky Mountain National Park was closed for  most of the 16-day shutdown a few years ago.   But somehow, despite those obvious economic indicators in jobs,  Donald Trump tweeted just this morning that our country ``needs a good  shutdown.''   What does that even mean?   We need a good shutdown like we need a root canal. It would put  people in my district out of work and cost the private sector millions  of jobs.   But I am hopeful now that we will avoid a shutdown; that, thankfully,  the spending bill, through 2017, prohibits funding on a new border  wall. It minimizes cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency,  allowing them to continue their work to keep our air and our water  clean; and Planned Parenthood will continue to receive Federal funding.   Now, that being said, of course, that budget isn't perfect, and we  will have the chance to debate it on the floor. The Republicans insist  on massive government deficit spending for increased military spending  that digs our mountain of debt for the next generation even bigger. The  tax-and-spend Republicans continue to spend hand over fist and increase  the deficit at the cost of the next generation of Americans.   Now, the bill before us, the Working Families Flexibility Act, is  another example of Republicans putting ideology and special interests  over the needs of workers and American families. The trend isn't new.  It comes out of the typical playbook we have seen for decades.   In fact, this very bill has been introduced multiple times over the  past 22 years, never with any success. Nearly identical bills were  introduced in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2013, 2015, and  now 2017. That is 10 times over 22 years. Each time, the bill never  becomes law, and it won't become law now either. But that is how the  Republicans want to spend their time in this body when we actually have  important things to discuss that could become law, like fixing our  broken immigration system.   This bill somehow claims to provide employees with more flexibility,  but the only flexibility are for the bosses. Instead of receiving  overtime, workers would receive comp time; so their paychecks won't get  anything out of extra time worked. It is important to note that this  legislation applies to the private sector and only to employees subject  to overtime provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act. The current  overtime threshold is set at just under $24,000, so only employees that  make less than $24,000 are affected by this bill. We have tried  mightily to increase that threshold to keep up with inflation, but we  have met resistance by the Republicans every step of the way.   In 2017, the Federal poverty level for a family of four is about  $24,000. So we are talking about only giving overtime to families that  are below the poverty level. These families rely on that overtime to  pay their bills, to pay their rent, and to put food on the table. These  are the families who would benefit most from receiving overtime pay. In  fact, a recent study by the Economic Policy Institute showed that 40  percent of people making less than $22,500 a year worked some overtime  hours and needed that income to get by. This same 40 percent are the  very people  [[Page H3015]]  who would lose out under the Republican bill today.   My Republican colleagues claim that no one is forcing workers to  accept comp time instead of overtime pay, and comp time is technically  optional. But this argument represents how out of touch Republicans are  with the real-life workforce conditions and actual working families.   In practice, the power differential between employers and employees  means that many employees would feel obligated to accept comp time  instead of overtime pay, even if that is not what works best for them.  Especially in nonunion workplaces, employees could feel pressure to go  along with their employers' demand or risk not even being offered  overtime or comp time in the future.   Now, Republicans have also made the argument that public sector  workers receive comp time. They are right. But that is not apples to  apples. Public sector union membership is around 34 percent, and public  sector employees have vast protections that private sector employees  lack. As an example, public sector workers can't be fired except for  good cause, and they have administrative appeal rights. They can't be  discriminated against based on their desire to take overtime pay  instead of comp time. Nonunionized private sector workers can be  legally discriminated against in assigning their hours based on their  decisions to take comp time versus overtime pay.   If the Republicans want to enlarge this discussion to include  providing additional workplace protections to workers in the private  sector, we are happy to have that discussion both on the committee  where I serve with my colleague, Mr. Byrne, as well as on the floor of  the House.   Republicans somehow argue that this bill provides flexibility for  workers to get time off, but I will remind my colleagues that nothing  in the current Fair Labor Standards Act prevents employers from  offering time off right now. In fact, the Fair Labor Standards Act  allows the ultimate flexibility. Employers can already provide paid or  unpaid leave on sick days, maternity, and paternity under the FLSA.  They don't need this legislation to provide them flexibility. They just  need to do the right thing.   This bill also ignores the fact that not all businesses are  successful. Before coming to Congress, I started several businesses. I  know this firsthand. A statistic is that 59 percent of restaurant  businesses go out of business within 3 years. I am zero for two. I  tried starting two restaurants. They both failed. Maybe that means if I  try again someday, I will be finally due for a success.   But what is important is that when something goes out of business, we  don't leave the employees in the lurch. What you are effectively doing  here by deferring the overtime pay into potential future time off, if  the company goes out of business, that employee would have to get in  line with other creditors and risk never being paid. That is not a  theoretical risk. The majority of new businesses don't last 10 years.  They go out of business. Depriving people of the payment for the work  they have done already is not the right way to treat workers in those  businesses, and it is not their fault when the bad decision is made by  their bosses.   In our committee markup of the bill, my Democratic colleagues offered  a number of amendments to improve the legislation. Representative  Bonamici offered an amendment that would allow comp time to earn  interest before workers' use. Under the current way this bill is  written, low-wage workers are being asked to give an interest-free loan  to the company. That doesn't make sense. The amendment didn't pass. If  employees receive overtime pay, they should receive interest on it as  well.   Representative Wilson offered an amendment that would exempt workers  who are earning less than 2\1/2\ times the minimum wage, so the  employees earning the very least wouldn't be subject to the law and  could actually rely on their overtime pay. Again, that amendment was  rejected by Republicans.   Representative Blunt Rochester on the committee offered an amendment  that would limit the bill so only workers eligible for at least 7 days  of paid sick leave receive comp time. Yet, again, Republicans rejected  this amendment.   In total, committee Democrats offered eight amendments to try to  improve this bill. Every single one was rejected.   Instead of bringing forward the same, tired, 22-year-old policies  that I certainly don't hear my constituents requesting, Democrats have  offered real solutions that benefit working families. Working families  would benefit from an increase in the overtime salary threshold. Last  year, the Department of Labor proposed an increase to that threshold,  and 248,000 workers in Colorado alone would have benefited under that  rule.   Democrats continue to write bills that provide commonsense solutions.  We have offered legislation that would provide up to 12 weeks of  partial-paid parental leave. Only 14 percent of the workforce has paid  family leave through their employers. As a parent of a 5- and a 2-year- old, I know how important that is to be able to spend time with your  newborn kids.   Democrats have also introduced a bill that would allow employees to  earn up to 7 sick days per year. That would be a tremendous help to the  4 in 10 private sector employees who don't have access to any paid sick  leave at all under current law.   Democrats have also offered legislation to combat pay discrimination.  In 2017, women working full time are still paid 80 cents on the dollar  compared to what men make. Democrats have offered legislation that I am  proud to cosponsor that would address that kind of pay disparity. Those  are the kinds of bills that the American people need, that workers  need, and that we need to help lift people out of poverty and into the  middle class.    Today, House Democrats introduced the Equality Act. I was proud to  join so many of my colleagues in a bipartisan bill to prohibit  discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. Sadly,  in many States, it is still legal to fire someone just because they are  gay. The Equality Act would finally extend Federal workplace  discrimination protections to LGBT Americans in all 50 States and the  territories.   Finally, House Democrats will soon be introducing the bill that would  raise the minimum wage. In my home State of Colorado, voters chose to  raise the wage last November, and many other States have minimum wages  higher than the Federal minimum wage. But it shouldn't come down to  what State you live in to determine if you even earn enough to put food  on the table and pay your rent. It is long past time we update the  Federal minimum wage, and the Raise the Wage Act would do just that.   Yet, again, we are offering many solutions that we would love to  discuss and love to vote on, and, instead, the Republicans are offering  a bill to strip existing rights away from workers.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us represents the same old policies the  Republicans have offered for decades. They have never succeeded, and  they won't succeed now. This time around, they are offering a bill that  might be great for some of the bosses, but it undermines the lives of  hardworking Americans that keep our country going.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the Working Families Flexibility Act and the  rule before us, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have a document from 1997 from then-President Bill  Clinton who opposed a bill that is basically identical to this one in  its current form. The President said he would veto this bill, if  passed, because he said this bill purports to give working families  greater flexibility, but, in reality, it grants employers more rights  at the expense of working people.   I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle stop using President  Clinton's good name in vain in passage of a bill that is nearly  identical to the one that he threatened to veto.   Of course, Democrats want to talk about flexibility. President  Clinton, myself, and Democrats of the Education and the Workforce  Committee are happy to do that, if there is a way to provide workers  with real choices to protect workers against employee abuse in making  their decisions, but the current bill, and the same bill that President  Clinton opposed, fails in that regard and fails to give employees the  rights that they deserve to exercise their comp time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Adams).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of  Administration Policy from President William Jefferson Clinton from  1997, in which President Clinton lays out the criteria, by and large,  which is still the criteria under which Democrats would support a comp  time flexibility bill, had the Republicans been at all serious about  actually passing one into law rather than just passing a symbolic bill  that they have passed for 22 years.     [From the American Presidency Project, John T. Woolley & Gerhard                         Peters, Santa Barbara, CA]  William J. Clinton: Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 1--Working              Families Flexibility Act of 1997, March 19, 1997                   (House) (Ballenger (R) NC and 99 others)         The President will veto H.R. 1 if it is passed in its       current form. The President will not sign H.R. 1, or any       other comp time legislation, unless it adheres to three       fundamental principles: (1) real choice for workers; (2) real       protection against employer abuse; and (3) preservation of       workers' rights.        H.R. 1 purports to give working families greater       flexibility. In reality, it grants employers more rights at       the expense of working people:        H.R. 1 fails to offer workers real choice. In particular,       H.R. 1 would allow an employer to decide when a worker could       use his or her compensatory time-off by disapproving such       time-off if the employer claims it would ``unduly disrupt''       its operations. In addition, H.R. 1 would permit an employer       to ``cash out'' a worker's earned compensatory time over 80       hours.        H.R. 1 fails to protect workers against employer abuse. For       example, H.R. 1 offers inadequate protections for vulnerable       workers and part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees,       including garment and construction workers, and those who are       employed in industries with histories of Fair Labor Standards       Act violations. H.R. 1 also fails to prohibit employers from       substituting compensatory time-off for paid vacation or sick       leave benefits. Furthermore, H.R. 1 lacks meaningful remedies       for workers when employers penalize them for electing to       receive overtime pay in lieu of compensatory time-off. In       addition, H.R. 1 contains inadequate worker safeguards in       cases where an employer goes bankrupt or out-of-business.        H.R. 1 fails to preserve workers' rights. Workers who take       compensatory time-off  [[Page H3017]]       can be forced to work additional overtime in the same week--      even on the weekend--without being paid overtime premium pay.        The Administration supports the substitute amendment to be       offered by Representative George Miller, although procedural       obstacles in the House have prevented the amendment from       addressing all of the important issues that need to be       treated, including expansion of Family and Medical Leave Act       (FMLA). The Administration strongly believes that any       legislation to authorize compensatory time under the Fair       Labor Standards Act should be linked to expansion of the       FMLA. Expanding the FMLA to give working families greater       flexibility to foster the education of their children or       provide routine health care for their children or elderly       relatives will go a long way toward achieving the stated       goals of H.R. 1.        The Miller amendment, however, would ensure real employee       choice, by adding crucial provisions not found in H.R. 1. For       example, employers that adopt comp time programs would have       to make comp time available to similarly-situated employees       on a fair and non-discriminatory basis. Working families are       guaranteed real protection against possible comp time abuse       through the Miller amendment.        Furthermore, the Miller amendment would preclude employers       from using comp time to modify or reduce existing paid leave       plans. It would entitle employees choosing comp time to get       regular statements of their accrual and use of comp time; put       a reasonable limit on the number of hours of comp time that       can be accrued; and allow employees to seek damages when they       incur costs because an employer wrongfully denies them use of       the comp time they earned. The Secretary of Labor would have       the authority to bar employers with a pattern and practice of       comp time abuse from continuing to offer comp time. H.R. 1       has none of these protections. These are all improvements to       H.R. 1 that guarantee the legislation enhances rather than       decreases flexibility for America's working families.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, while we are debating a rule for a bill that would strip  workers of their overtime pay, since President Trump took office,  dangerous bills like this are more likely to become law.   Just a few weeks ago, President Trump signed a bill into law that  strips the American people of our online privacy, allowing internet  service providers to sell yours and my sensitive information to the  highest bidder without our permission.   This information includes location, financial and health data,  information about our children--even pictures of our children--Social  Security numbers, web browsing history, app usage history, content of  communication: emails, video chats. It is simply wrong.   For this reason, when we defeat the previous question, I will offer  an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Jacky Rosen's bill,  H.R. 1868, which would reinstate the Federal Communication  Commission's internet privacy rule.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, sometimes you need a redo or a retake. When  this body narrowly passed the bill that President Trump signed that  took all of our private data and allowed internet service providers to  sell it without our permission, it was a mistake. Hopefully enough  Members of this body have since realized it is a mistake and they will  now change their vote and support defeating the previous question  [[Page H3018]]  allowing for immediate consideration of Representative Rosen's bill to  protect our privacy.   As we know, broadband access through internet access providers is a  critical way to have access to a world of information and commerce, but  the price of that access should not be all of your private information,  including your kids' photographs and birthdays and your Social Security  number.   Under the bill that became law, everything you enter on the internet  on any site, regardless of their privacy policy, would be owned by your  broadband provider and be able to be sold by your broadband provider  without your consent.   That is simply wrong for America; it is wrong for consumers; it is  wrong for innovation. It casts a shadow over the entire internet  ecosytem, which not only has brought so much enjoyment to so many but  has created millions of jobs in my district and across our country.                                time  1315    If we can defeat the previous question, we can do a redo on this  bill. We can pass H.R. 1868, which would reinstate a rule that has  broad, popular support. I haven't heard a single constituent of mine  say that they don't want their broadband privacy protected, and I have  had hundreds of them say that they do want their broadband privacy  protected.   I am hoping that, since my Republican friends have now had the chance  to have townhalls and to listen to their constituents, they will agree  that we should reinstate the Federal Communications' internet privacy  rule to protect our privacy subject to the terms of use; information  can be sold if you consent for it to be sold, but without your consent,  all the information you enter on the internet should not be the  property of the broadband provider for their use and for sale. It is  common sense. The vast majority of the American public agrees. I think  it is time to call the question on Congress to see if we can get  Congress to agree.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I am surprised that people in Alabama weren't clamoring to protect  their online privacy at the gentleman's townhall meetings. I will  certainly take him at his word. Perhaps it is because they were so  concerned with Republican attempts to increase their healthcare  insurance rates by 15 to 20 percent, Republican attempts to raise their  taxes, and Republican spending that will increase the deficit by $12  billion in this continuing resolution that were brought before us.  Maybe they were so overwhelmed by the Republican efforts to get rid of  their health care, increase the deficit, spend more money, and take  away their rights that they didn't get down their list of concerns to  broadband privacy.   Certainly in my district, Mr. Speaker, dozens of constituents in my  townhalls--both Republican and Democratic constituents--brought this  issue up as a way of arguing how out of touch House and Senate  Republicans are to say that, at this time in our Nation's history, what  we need is less privacy, not more. I think that there are a lot of  things that people are concerned about, and that is certainly one of  them.   This debate is about that, frankly, Mr. Speaker, because, if we  defeat the previous question, I will be bringing forth Ms. Rosen's  bill. Members of this House will have an opportunity to vote on  bringing up Ms. Rosen's bill to protect our broadband privacy.   Mr. Speaker, the more work, less pay bill before us is yet another  example by Republicans to roll back workers' rights under the guise of  doing the opposite. Again, if the Republicans have a sincere desire to  actually enhance and improve workers' rights, then we are all for that.  The labor movement is for that. Let's talk about that. But don't  pretend like you have the voices and concerns of workers in mind when  workers' advocacy groups say you are stripping away their rights. We  are happy to have that discussion.   In many ways, the veto statement from President Clinton in 1997 still  lays out as relevant, today, some of the very criteria the Democrats  would want to see in a bill that we could support that would empower  workers to choose additional comp time, a concept that many Democrats  support.   I wish we were working to protect American families today. But  instead of collaborating with Democrats to produce a bill that actually  accomplishes the stated goal of increasing worker flexibility, instead,  the Republicans have chosen to move forward with their 22-year-old bill  that weakens the 40-hour workweek, that President Clinton threatened to  veto, that hasn't become law and won't become law, just perhaps as a  check-off box rather than to do anything to actually empower workers to  choose comp time instead of overtime. They are just checking the box  for the big bosses and moving on to the next item without seeing this  through into law.   There are a lot of bipartisan bills this body could be taking up this  week. Frankly, one of them is Representative Rosen's bill that I will  be bringing up when we defeat the previous question, but, sadly, this  bill is not one of them. I am very disappointed that even in the  majority, even in the governing capacity, even controlling the House,  the Senate, and the Presidency, Republicans are wasting time on what we  around here call messaging bills rather than real bills to address  issues that Americans want us to work on, like bringing down the cost  of college, fixing our broken immigration system, rebuilding our  crumbling roads and bridges, or reforming our complicated tax system to  make it more friendly for growth in our country.   Mr. Speaker, I support legislation that puts the needs of workers  first, but this bill before us does the opposite. This legislation  lifts up the big bosses with the hope that a worker may or may not see  a benefit down the line without interest if the company stays  in business. It is the wrong way to go about it. I oppose the rule. I  oppose the underlying bill. I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
