 Mr. Chairman, debating this budget resolution  is a partisan and pointless exercise, and I will point out to the  chairman that it is October, after the fiscal year has expired and  after we have already passed every single appropriations bill out of  the House of Representatives, and, I might add, a continuing budget  resolution.                                time  1600    Just as when we considered it in committee this summer, this  resolution stands as a demonstration of the  [[Page H7791]]  majority's willful and disgraceful neglect of the needs of the American  people.   With so many critical legislative issues for us to discuss, the  majority has decided it is a better use of our time to discuss tax  breaks for millionaires and wealthy corporations; taking healthcare  away from 20 million Americans; blowing up our deficit with an  ineffective, immoral border wall; and gutting crucial investments in  jobs, education, and medical research.   Instead, this House should be enacting legislation to expand  background checks and ban assault weapons to combat senseless firearm  violence after this Nation witnessed, once again, the deadliest mass  shooting in U.S. history.   This House should be passing the Dream Act to protect DREAMers who  call this Nation home and protect them from this administration's  heartless deportations.   Finally, instead of wasting taxpayer dollars and our constituents'  time with this harmful budget resolution, this House should be  reauthorizing CHIP, the bipartisan-backed Children's Health Insurance  Program, which expired over the weekend and which potentially is going  to leave children who badly need healthcare insurance twisting in the  wind without it.   Congressional Republicans have chosen instead to bring this  incredibly irresponsible and extreme bill to the floor.   In stunning ignorance of reality, it assumes TrumpCare will still  pass. Just how many times must the majority be reminded that TrumpCare  is not going to become law and the Affordable Care Act is the law of  the land that Americans support?   How many times will the majority try to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion,  cut Medicare benefits, and raise insurance costs on elderly and low- income Americans?   Enough is enough. Instead of pandering to the well connected and our  worst impulses, this budget should embody America's best values, and it  is far from it.    Sadly, this budget does not reflect our  responsibility to care for and invest in the American people.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote.
