 Mr. Speaker, we are in unchartered waters. The swamp water  is very murky and it is deep, and you try to navigate those treacherous  waters. Every once in a while you try to find that safe lily pad to  land on, but for George Santos there doesn't appear to be a safe lily  pad.   The United States' House of Representatives is attempting to expel a  Member of Congress who has not been convicted of a crime. In the  history of our country, Mr. Speaker, only five Members have been  expelled from Congress.   In 1861, John Clark, John Reid, and Henry Burnett were expelled on  the grounds of treason for supporting the Confederate rebellion. In  1980, Michael Myers was convicted of bribery involving an FBI sting  that led to the convictions of seven Members of Congress.   Six Members resigned, and Myers was expelled on a vote of 376-30.   Then in 2002, James Traficant was convicted on 10 counts, including  bribery, conspiracy to defraud the United States, corruption, and  obstruction of justice.   All five of these men had one thing in common: They were all  convicted under Federal law and then rightfully expelled from Congress.   Kicking out Mr. Santos is setting a very dangerous precedent. Never  before has Congress expelled a Member based on indictments. Indictments  require nothing more than probable cause. An indictment is not a  conviction.   Then why today would we remove a Member from this House based on an  indictment? It has never been done before. It shouldn't happen today.   In this country, I thought everyone is presumed innocent until proven  guilty in a court of law. I do not and have not and will not support  the removal of Representative Santos, and I encourage my colleagues to  agree.
