 Mr. Speaker, when ObamaCare was debated 7 years ago, I  wrote my Member of Congress to urge him to vote against what I saw as a  government takeover of our healthcare system.   At that time, I was a practicing physician, and I could foresee the  disastrous consequences of this law and what it would do to patients  across this country, including my own. And I wasn't alone.   Citizens from every corner of America stood up and demanded that  Congress reject the ObamaCare bill, but we were ignored. Since then,  out-of-pocket costs for families have skyrocketed, patient-choice has  evaporated, and ObamaCare has inched closer to the brink of collapse.   In that time, those same Americans who fought against passage of  ObamaCare have delivered Republicans majorities in the House, in the  Senate, and put a Republican in the White House. They did so, in part,  based on our promises to repeal and replace ObamaCare.    And here we stand, 7 years after ObamaCare passed, with the  opportunity to finally deliver on that promise, and to bring relief to  patients across this country who haven't been able to find the care  they were promised at a cost they can afford.   It is an opportunity for us to fulfill our promise to our  constituents. Let's be clear: a vote against this bill today is a vote  for preservation of the ObamaCare disaster, a vote to keep critical  healthcare decisions in the hands of bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.,  and a vote against the largest entitlement reform in a generation.   I urge all of my colleagues to do the right thing and vote for this  bill.
