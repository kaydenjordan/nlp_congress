 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Undersheriff George Skuletich of Butte-Silver Bow County as  Montanan of the Month for his steadfast service to the Butte community  for more than 40 years.   George started as a detention officer at the Butte jail on June 5,  1981, and later was appointed as a Butte police officer in June of  1985. Since that time, he has served as a patrol officer, patrol  sergeant, patrol lieutenant, DARE officer, school resource officer,  SWAT officer, and patrol captain. He was instrumental in the design and  building of the Law Enforcement Center as well as the Butte-Silver Bow  Detention Center. George has served as Butte-Silver undersheriff since  January of 2013.   George embodies the heart of a Montanan and the public service and  dedication of a Montana law enforcement officer. Butte-Silver Bow  Sheriff Ed Lester has said if he had to go through a door, not knowing  what was on the other side, he would take George with him because he  would never leave a fellow officer behind, no matter how bad things  got. There is no higher compliment.   George has responded to nearly any type of incident you can think of,  from aircraft crashes to bomb threats, and his calm and respectful  demeanor has proven him to be a valuable leader. George truly cares  about the Montanans he has served. On behalf of a grateful Butte  community, I want to thank George for his service to the great State of  Montana, and I wish him a peaceful and relaxing retirement.                            ____________________
