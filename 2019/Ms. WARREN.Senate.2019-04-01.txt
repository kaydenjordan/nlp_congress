 Mr. President, I would like to offer my  congratulations to Mr. Andy Silins as he retires from the United  Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, where he has served  as the general secretary treasurer since 2000. He began his  distinguished career in the U.S. Marine Corps and served honorably  during the Vietnam war. He furthered his commitment to service through  his decades of work in the labor movement, fighting to ensure all of  our workers get a fair shot at economic opportunity and respect,  dignity, and a voice on the job. He joined the Carpenters Union Local  67 in 1968, and in 1979, the Boston District Council of Carpenters  elected him as the general agent and executive secretary. He was  elected the council's president in 1989 before moving on to work with  the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. His  dedication to the labor movement helped the Carpenters secure good  jobs, fair wages, and strong safety standards for its members. In  addition to his labor efforts, he was one of the founders of First  Trade Union Savings Bank and also served as a board member of the  Massachusetts Housing Authority. I once again offer my gratitude to  Andy Silins for his lifelong commitment to America's working families,  for all he has done for workers across the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts, and for his tireless fight to strengthen our labor  unions. I congratulate him on his retirement and wish him the best of  luck in the next chapter.                            ____________________
