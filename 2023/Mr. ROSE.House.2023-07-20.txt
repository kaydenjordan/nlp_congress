 Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are doing everything we can  to investigate the politicization and weaponization of the Federal  Government.   In fact, the House Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal  Government heard testimony from New York Post reporter Emma-Jo Morris,  whose reporting about Hunter Biden's laptop was censored by almost  every social media platform in the country in coordination with the  most powerful levers of the Federal Government to silence Americans'  First Amendment right to free speech.   Let the record show that Ms. Morris' reporting was factual, as  confirmed by multiple outlets after the fact, and that this egregious  abuse of power was so serious and so detrimental to our free society  that a Federal District Court has enjoined White House and government  officials from communicating with social media companies for the  purpose of censoring or suppressing free speech on their platforms.   Mr. Speaker, these nefarious actions by the White House and Federal  Government agencies are utterly shameful and, frankly, un-American and  must never, ever happen again.
