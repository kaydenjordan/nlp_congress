 Mr. Chairman, I first thank the gentleman for yielding  and for his amendment.   We all know that ozone is a hazardous air pollutant that contributes  to health problems such as asthma attacks, heart disease, and birth  defects--problems being made worse by climate change.   More than 40 percent of Americans, almost 130 million people, live in  counties that receive an F grade for air quality from the American Lung  Association. This includes my district that I represent in Illinois, as  well as Washington, D.C.   This amendment would remove a needless delay in the implementation of  an ozone rule designed to protect public health. The rule in question  involves a modest lowering of the ozone limit from 75 to 70 parts per  billion, a small change that would yield large health benefits,  including preventing 230,000 asthma attacks in children and 188,000  missed school and workdays each year. This decision to lower the ozone  limit was the result of a rigorous multiyear process carried out by  expert scientists.   So I want to urge my colleagues to stand up for the health of our  constituents and support this amendment.
