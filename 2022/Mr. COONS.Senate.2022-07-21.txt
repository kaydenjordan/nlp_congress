 Mr. President, you and I have had the blessing of  traveling to South Africa together, so I know you know, as I do, that  it is a critical nation, not just on its own terms as a country of 70  million people of a multilingual, multifaith, multiethnic democracy  working to achieve the incredible promise enshrined in its  Constitution, working to achieve the vision of a liberation struggle,  but it is also a country that is critical to regional security and for  the path of the globe and to the security and stability of democracy in  this century. This is why I stand to speak briefly on behalf of my  friend, Reuben Brigety, the nominee to be our next Ambassador to South  Africa, whose confirmation we will take up in just a few moments.   Reuben is someone I admire deeply. He attended the Naval Academy,  served in the U.S. Navy, was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State both  for African Affairs and for Population, Refugees, and Migration.   I met him as Ambassador to the African Union, knew him well as dean  of the Elliott School at GW. He took on the challenge of service as the  president of the University of the South, better known as Sewanee; and  now our President has nominated him to represent us in South Africa.   As we have seen in recent votes and actions at the United Nations and  in discussions and debates around the world, African countries--in this  moment, during this war in Ukraine, in the face of Russia's  aggression--are turning away from us. They are not believing the  reality that it is Russian aggression that is causing food scarcity and  fertilizer prices to spike, and they are more than not taking Russia's  side on this.   We cannot take these relationships for granted. The United States,  for decades, has been a close development and public health partner of  South Africa. We have to send our best, and Ambassador Brigety is the  right person at the right time to advance the critical relationship  goals that we have between the United States and South Africa.                          Tribute to Alexandra Davis    Mr. President, one of the blessings of serving here in the Senate is  getting to know natives of New Jersey, like yourself and like my  foreign policy adviser, Allie Davis.   I will do my best to get through these next few minutes of remarks  without being unduly emotional, but she deserves a catch in the throat  and a tear in the eye because Allie is someone who from the moment she  came to join my team 6 years ago has been a remarkable person--a person  of great spirit and character, someone who also spent time in South  Africa as a young person.   After graduating from the University of Delaware, a tour as a  Fulbright in South Africa prepared her to join my team as a foreign  policy fellow.   As she was just confessing to me in my office a few moments ago, she  knew far less about governance and politics than I imagined. She  carries herself with remarkable grace and confidence. She steadily has  risen to be a legislative aide, a legislative assistant, and now my  foreign policy adviser.   I don't have the time--but I wish I did--to detail all the pieces of  significant and important legislation she has helped shepherd through  to success. She has critically supported my leadership on the State and  Foreign Operations Appropriations team. She has been critical as we  have worked to address this moment of global hunger. She has helped get  the Global Fragility Act from concept to enactment. She has helped make  the Development Finance Corporation a powerful tool for development.  She helped shape and craft the Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership  for Peace Act, and she nearly single-handedly, at a time when I was  confident this could not be done, got the Sudan Claims Resolution Act  through this Congress and fundamentally changed the arc of the search  for democracy in Sudan.   We had the chance to travel together on a Presidential mission to  Ethiopia, during which she had truly memorable encounters with its head  of state and an opportunity to see and participate and help drive  diplomacy firsthand. We traveled together to so many other countries:  from the UAE to France to Georgia to Italy and, perhaps most memorably,  to Sudan, where I was honored to receive one of their leading national  awards, which really was an award in recognition of her work on behalf  of the Sudanese people.   She goes to serve the House Foreign Affairs Committee, whose chairman  I accosted last night at an event, and said: You are causing great harm  to me, and I resent deeply the fact that you are causing this most  talented and skilled and trusted member to leave the Senate and go to  the House.   But she joins as a member of their professional staff, a great team.  And I know that we will continue to work hard and to work closely  together in the years and decades ahead. A great friend, a great  colleague, and someone to whom I wish great success in the many years  ahead.   With that, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the nomination  of Reuben Brigety to be Ambassador, and I offer my greatest thanks to  Allie Davis for her talented and skillful service on behalf of the  people of Delaware.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.
