 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R.  2467, but not necessarily in defense or in critique of PFAS.   Unfortunately, this legislation puts the cart before the horse. It  would establish a PFAS standard before the EPA has the information to  determine the best regulatory action.   While written and passed by the Energy and Commerce Committee, this  bill contains provisions within the jurisdiction of the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee, of which I am also a member. However, T&I  never considered this bill, which greatly concerns me. Our committee  didn't hold one hearing or one markup on this bill or on the provisions  contained in it. T&I Democrats completely ceded the committee's  authority and expertise.                                time  1330    If we had held a hearing or a markup, Republicans would have pointed  out that the Clean Water Act, which is squarely in the jurisdiction of  the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, grants ample  authority to the EPA and contains a long-established process for  evaluating chemicals and regulating the discharge of those substances  when they pose a significant risk to water quality.   We would have noted that the EPA already has efforts under way to  evaluate PFAS substances pursuant to the Clean Water Act, including  managing risks from PFAS.   However, this bill short-circuits the long-established regulatory  review process under the Clean Water Act and it ignores the expertise  of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.   H.R. 2467 imposes unrealistic deadlines on the EPA and asks the EPA  to regulate before it has the necessary data to make a legally and  scientifically sound regulatory plan.   Legislating in this careless fashion undermines the confidence in  both the bill and the legislative process to develop it.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill, and I encourage us to continue  looking at this issue.
