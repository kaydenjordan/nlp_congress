 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R.  7606.   I support our country's farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers  because they are the lifeblood of America. They keep us food and fuel  secure and therefore free and self-determining as a Nation.   I cosponsor the Year-Round Fuel Choice Act, which would address  limitations on Reid vapor pressure and allow for producers to supply,  and consumers to purchase, E15 year-round. I have supported this  measure long before my time in Congress, and I will continue to be a  strong proponent of year-round E15. A temporary waiver is not enough.  We must make this decision permanent and provide certainty to  producers. That bill is now part of H.R. 7606.   I cosponsor the Butcher Block Act, which would codify the authority  for the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants and loans to expand  meat and poultry processing capacity. I support consumer choice. That  bill is now part of H.R. 7606.   In the House Agriculture Committee, I voted in favor of four other  bills that are now part of H.R. 7606, but today's vote is disappointing  because House Democrats ignored an effort made by Mr. Davis and others,  one I am proud to cosponsor, to include an amendment separating these  good pro-agriculture bills from a poison pill. Included in H.R. 7606 is  a provision that would create a politically charged special  investigator office at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to  investigate and prosecute food producers in America.   You heard that right. The original H.R. 7606 and a provision in  today's so-called Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act would create a new  office at USDA to investigate and prosecute the people who work to feed  us. I represent the Big First District of Kansas, which ranks number  one in the country for the value of sales of cattle and calves at more  than $9 billion annually. We see the entire beef supply chain in the  Big First, from cow-calf producers to cattle feeders and packers. Under  the Packers and Stockyards Division at USDA, all of those players, all  of them, are already subject to strict inspection. Under H.R. 7606,  they would be subject to a type of politically charged scrutiny we  expect of no other related business.   Do you think that a Democratic-controlled Congress and USDA would  stop there? No. H.R. 7606 would set the horrible precedent for  political administrations to inspect and prosecute anything and anyone  they disagree with.    Mr. Speaker, today it is packing facilities, tomorrow it is  cornfields and biofuel facilities, or wheat growers and milling  stations. I support farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers in  this country, and I am disappointed this poison pill is included.                                time  0945
