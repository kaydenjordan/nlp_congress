 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of the Build  Back Better agenda and the investments it makes in our Nation's care  economy. Specifically, I urge the House to invest $250 billion over 10  years in Medicaid Home and Community Based Services. This will give  domestic workers a long overdue raise in wages and vastly expand  covered services for aging families.   Expanding Medicaid will fail a tragic gap in our long-term care  system that forces seniors and people with disabilities out of their  homes.   Today, over 3.5 million older adults and people with disabilities  receive Medicaid for home-based care, but because of caps on coverage,  820,000 Americans remain on wait lists. Meanwhile, domestic workers  earn poverty wages without access to a safety net.   Let's pass both the Build Back Better Act and the bipartisan  infrastructure bill to right this wrong, invest in our care economy,  and protect American working families.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, September 22, 2021, I was  unable to vote. Had I been present, I would have voted: ``Yea'' on  rollcall vote 269, on agreeing to Amendment No. 5 offered by Rep. Dean  printed in H. Rept. 117-125.       MEMBERS RECORDED PURSUANT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 8, 117TH CONGRESS       Cardenas (Gomez)      Carter (TX) (Calvert)      DeSaulnier (Matsui)      Frankel, Lois (Clark (MA))      Fulcher (Johnson (OH))      Gonzalez (OH)      (Reschenthaler)      Grijalva (Garcia (IL))      Kirkpatrick (Levin (CA))      Latta (Walberg)      Lawson (FL) (Evans)      McEachin (Wexton)      Meng (Jeffries)      Morelle (Tonko)      Napolitano (Correa)      Payne (Wasserman Schultz)      Rice (SC) (Wilson (SC))      Rush (Underwood)      Ryan (Kildee)      Stanton (Levin (CA))      Stefanik      (Reschenthaler)      Strickland (Torres (NY))      Swalwell (Veasey)      Wagner (Walorski)      Wilson (FL) (Hayes)      Young (Mast)                   Amendment No. 6 Offered by Ms. Plaskett     Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for including my  two amendments so that we may learn from the mistakes of the forever  wars and ensure the Taliban cannot benefit from our financial system.   I served in Afghanistan's Helmand Province. I saw what began as a  counterterrorism mission mutate under President Bush into a $1 trillion  boondoggle of a counterinsurgency.   My first amendment ensures that Congress' Afghanistan Commission can  access the classified documents behind the forever war and hold to  account those decision makers who let the fallacy of sunk costs guide  their continual investments of time, troops, and treasure into an  unwinnable war.   My second amendment directs the Treasury Department to closely  monitor illicit financing flowing to the Taliban. This safeguards our  financial system and ensures the Taliban can't use it to finance  terrorist activities. At the close of this war, we must move forward  with the assurance that we will learn from history.   Madam Speaker, to increase transparency and counter the Taliban, I  urge adoption of this en bloc package.
