 Mr. Speaker, in fiscal year 2018, more than  2,000 illegal aliens were apprehended by Federal agents for homicides  committed on American soil. Worse yet, roughly 31,000 Americans die  each year from heroin and cocaine overdoses, 90 percent of which floods  across America's porous southern border. Hence, we can expect at least  33,000 dead Americans each year until America secures our porous  southern border.   For perspective, the 9/11 terrorist attacks killed roughly 3,000  people. In response, America invaded Iraq and Afghanistan at a cost of  trillions of dollars and, roughly, 7,000 lost military personnel lives.   Saving Americans should be a bipartisan issue, yet here we are.  Republicans seek to prevent another 33,000 dead Americans this year,  while partisan Democrats seek to embarrass and stop President Trump  from securing America's porous southern border and saving American  lives.   For emphasis, no national emergency in history has been prompted by  more dead Americans than President Trump's national emergency  declaration. As such, I support President Trump's national emergency  declaration and will vote accordingly.   Mr. Speaker, how many dead Americans does it take for open border  advocates to support border security? How much American blood must be  on guilty hands before Congress recognizes the national emergency we  face at America's southern border? America's military protects the  borders of, and lives in, South Korea, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, many  other countries, and Europe.  [[Page H2115]]    I thank President Trump, as Commander in Chief, for understanding  that America, and Americans, deserve no less protection.   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by noting that dead Americans, Americans  killed by illegal aliens as a consequence of porous borders, had  dreams, too. We, as a Congress, should remember and honor those dreams  and act accordingly and protect this national emergency to protect  American lives by securing our porous southern border.
