 Mr. Speaker, on the heels of Black History  Month, at the beginning of Women's History Month, and 1 year into a  pandemic, I rise today to bring attention to an urgent task: achieving  health equity for Black women and girls.   Over the past year, we have watched firsthand as centuries-long  systemic health and economic disparities have translated into higher  rates of coronavirus and fewer resources to fight it in Black  communities.   COVID-19 did not create these disparities. It has just made them  plain for all to see.   Inequality comes in many forms, but health inequalities are among the  most glaring. As it stands, Black women's life expectancy is nearly 3  years less than our White counterparts.   Recently, the Congressional Caucus on Black Women and Girls unveiled  our first-ever report on this pressing issue and others facing Black  women and girls in our country. More importantly, we have laid out  solutions to these problems.   It is incumbent upon Congress to take on these initiatives because we  cannot be satisfied until every American, including Black women and  girls, can lead a long and healthy life.   Mr. Speaker, to help to accomplish these things, we must pass the  American Rescue Plan.                            ____________________
