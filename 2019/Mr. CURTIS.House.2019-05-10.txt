 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of this amendment to  H.R. 2157, increasing funding for the Emergency Watershed Protection  Program.   Last year, Utah, like many States in the West, faced devastating  wildfires that affected areas of my district. The Pole Creek fire and  Bald Mountain fire, which started on Federal land, collectively burned  over 117,000 acres and left, damaged, infrastructure and watersheds.   Many of my communities affected by the fires need assistance to  rebuild and repair the critical watersheds that they rely on, but they  have not been able to receive it. For example, Utah County has been  approved for over $9 million in aid from NRCS through this program, but  inadequate funding means they won't receive those promised dollars.   Cleaning up and rebuilding after a wildfire is an important step in  protecting against future disasters. I am pleased to support this  amendment that will bring aid to communities like Utah County that have  been affected by catastrophic natural disasters.
