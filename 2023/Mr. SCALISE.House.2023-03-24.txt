 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for  yielding and for her amendment to such an important bill.   The Parents Bill of Rights Act is a basic concept, but it is a  powerful statement that says we stand with parents and children in the  ability for them to have a say in their kids' education. You would  think: Who would be against this? Why do we need a law to do what  everybody should think is the right thing to do?   Unfortunately, what we have seen through this debate is that the left  is scared to death of parents having more of a say in their kids'  education. Union bosses are scared to death of parents having a say in  their kids' education.   It begs the question: Why would they be so afraid of parents wanting  to see the curriculum that their kids are experiencing when they go to  school?   I think we all saw why their concern is so vocal. This all happened  during COVID. As we went from classroom learning to virtual learning,  millions of parents actually got a glimpse into what was going on in  the classrooms of their kids.   I am sure most of those parents thought they were just going to be  watching their kids learn how to read, how to write, how to break down  sentence structures, and how to learn math. Some of that was going on,  but what alarmed parents were all the other things that had absolutely  nothing to do with their kids having an opportunity to achieve the  American Dream.   In fact, some of the things that were going on undermined the basic  values that those parents are teaching their kids at home, things that  had nothing to do with helping those kids learn and be prepared for  better opportunities in the future. They started asking questions, and  they were right to ask those questions.   Except the Biden administration got concerned because the union  bosses didn't want those parents to see what was going on. You had the  Justice Department trying to tag parents as domestic terrorists for  showing up at school board meetings, for God's sake, because they cared  about what was happening in their kids' schools.   It shouldn't have taken an act of Congress to give parents that  right. If it does, I am proud to stand with the  [[Page H1420]]  parents and kids against the union bosses who don't want parents to  have that right to care about their kids' education.   For God's sake, we shouldn't have to be here doing this. The unions  shouldn't be fighting this every step of the way, but it really shows  you what they care about if they don't want parents to have these  rights.   Thank goodness we have Virginia Foxx's committee, Julia Letlow's  bill, and Members of Congress coming together and saying parents ought  to have that ability. Republican, Democrat, Independent, it doesn't  matter what your political viewpoint is because, for anybody in this  country, part of the American Dream is being able to pass on better  opportunities to your kids than what you had. The best way to do that,  the greatest equalizer, is education.   If you have to be concerned about what is happening in your kid's  classroom, and the school doesn't want you to see what is happening in  your kid's classroom, you really ought to be alarmed. Every parent  ought to have that right because when kids are sent to school, they  should be learning how to get more opportunities, how to advance and  have more success than we had. If they are being taught things that  undermine that, every parent ought to be able to know about that. Under  this bill, they finally will.    This is a power that every parent should already have. We saw during  COVID some parents had that ability, but unfortunately, many parents  were denied that ability to have a basic understanding of what was  happening in their kids' classrooms. Millions of kids were denied  education, which ultimately means those millions of kids are denied  opportunity. No one should stand for that.   Mr. Chair, on this day and on every day, I am proud to stand with the  parents and the kids. Nobody should get in their way, especially union  bosses who don't want parents to be able to have that opportunity to  stand up for their kids.   Let's stand with the parents and the kids. Let's pass this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for the  introduction, but I especially thank him for having the idea to call  Coach Rollo, as we call him, and say: Can these Members of Congress  come on over and spend a few minutes to see what true excellence is all  about?   That was a treat that we got to experience for that next hour and a  half or so, to watch what so many young men through the years got to  experience.   You can only think of the joy and the treat it was for those students  at Mater Dei High School who had the great fortune to play for Coach  Bruce Rollinson over those years. We just saw it in a brief period of  time, and since getting to know him over these last few months, we see  what kind of leader of men Coach Rollo is. We surely saw it in the eyes  of those young high school students.   Although, I will say, when I was looking up to some of those six- foot-plus linemen, many of them looked like they might have played for  the New Orleans Saints. I would have encouraged a few of them to go and  play for--I didn't want to get into trouble and encourage them to play  for my alma mater of LSU, but they could have been playing in the NFL.  In fact, many have gone on to play at higher levels.   This year, maybe the number one pick in the NFL draft, Bryce Young,  had the honor of playing for Coach Rollo, as did Matt Leinart, who  tried to throw a pass to my colleague, Congressman Gallagher.   The treat was just watching the character of those young men at Mater  Dei High School. That doesn't happen by accident, it comes through  leadership.   As Coach Rollo and I were talking about earlier, I am sure when  people look at his career--and we didn't know at the time that he was  going to retire when we met with him just a few months ago. At the  time, his team was the number one high school team in the country. That  was not anything new to Coach Rollo.   A lot of people would look at all of the accolades. For a State as  large as California to win eight State championships, six of those were  deemed national titles--a high school national champion. That doesn't  just happen by itself.   Sure, it takes great players, but to do it year-in and year-out and  to build that record of excellence, it takes a special leader--a leader  who touches the hearts of young men and shapes them.   What I recognized the most, it wasn't about the size or the physical  abilities of these high school players, it was their character. You  could see it just as we were talking to them.   They were all incredibly polite and respectful. They were eager to  learn from Coach Rollo. They came to learn from him, and that is what a  real leader is all about.   As we talked about earlier, we had the opportunity to listen to Drew  Brees a few days ago. Of course, I have known Drew for many years, as a  fan of the New Orleans Saints I had gotten to know him--talk about a  person of character who led us not only to a Super Bowl, but he would  probably tell you the NFL Man of the Year Award--the Walter Payton Man  of the Year Award might be the accomplishment he appreciates the most  because it really signifies what he did in communities.   One of the things he said to us the other day, he was talking about  how young people--he was talking about it in relation to his kids. They  might not always listen to what you say, but they watch everything you  do. All of those young men got to watch Coach Rollo and watch his  leadership. That is what really lasts with them.   The trophies and the championships, those are all things that you can  put up on a shelf. You saw three Heisman trophies in a box in that  school, but it was really the character and the values that he stands  for.   The old sports adage that ``game recognizes game.'' I have another  great high school coach in my State, Coach J.T. Curtis--John Curtis. He  won State championships, multiple championships, over the years. He was  the second most-winning high school coach in the country. He won this  year's State championship in Louisiana.                                time  1200    I texted him. I said: I don't know if you know him, but I am here  with Coach Rollo at Mater Dei High School.   He texted me back, and he said: I know Coach Rollo. We got to run  into each other.   He knew who you were, and he had nothing but tremendous respect for  you and what you have done.   When I saw him the night when he won the State championship a few  weeks ago in Louisiana, I said: Do you know that Coach Rollo just  announced he is retiring?   He didn't know that yet. He almost teared up because of the respect  that he has for you.   So as Congressman Gallagher said a little while ago, while you have  touched the hearts of so many at Mater Dei High School, your legendary  character and your values transcend and reach people all across this  great country.   I appreciate that my colleague from Arkansas took the time to reach  out and that we got to go and spend some time with you because  everybody who has gotten the opportunity to meet with you has come out  a better person.   Thank you for your years dedicated to young men. I know there are  better things ahead for you in the future. This isn't the last chapter.  What a legacy you have left for so many.   Congratulations to you, Coach, on your many years of service at Mater  Dei.
