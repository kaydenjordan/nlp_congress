 Madam Speaker, it is a tragedy any time a United States  servicemember is killed or gravely injured in the line of duty. Those  events, however, don't happen in a vacuum. They have lasting impacts on  that hero's family and their loved ones.   That is why I rise in support of this bill, H.R. 2227, which I  introduced with Representative Bustos. Our legislation would give  spouses and dependents of servicemembers who are killed or  catastrophically injured in the line of duty the flexibility to move  closer to family and friends for support, because no one enduring that  type of life-altering event should go through it alone.   In 2018, Representative Bustos and I worked together to pass the Gold  Star Spouses Leasing Relief Act and get it signed into law. It gave  Gold Star spouses the ability to terminate their property leases  without penalty if their servicemember was killed in the line of duty.   We expanded those protections to include auto leases, as well, in  last year's National Defense Authorization Act.    Now, this bill builds upon the good work of those two efforts by  extending those protections to dependents of servicemembers in addition  to spouses.   I thank Representative Bustos and the members of the House Committee  on Veterans' Affairs for their work in bringing this important bill to  the floor.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2227.
