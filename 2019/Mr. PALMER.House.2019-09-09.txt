 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding,  particularly in regard to the fact that I am speaking in opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition. This bill would authorize the  appropriation of $100 million, annually, for the Diesel Emissions  Reduction Act. While this may sound like a worthy goal, the devil is  always in the details.   Although the EPA touts the program as a way to achieve cost-effective  emissions, the reality is much different. Funds from this program have  gone to a number of questionable items, including $750,000 for cherry  pickers in Utah, $1 million for electrified parking spaces at a truck  stop in Delaware, and $1.2 million for a new engine and generators for  a 1950s locomotive in Pennsylvania.   The President's budget only requests $10 million for this program,  yet this bill would authorize 10 times that amount. We simply cannot  continue asking taxpayers to fund a program that wastes their money on  frivolous projects.   This program was intended to be a short-term effort to assist States  and local government in meeting diesel emissions standards but has  joined a long list of temporary government programs for which there is  no end in sight.   The GAO has noted that funding to reduce diesel emissions is  fragmented across 14 programs at the Department of Energy, the  Department of Transportation, and the EPA. Surely, we can make due with  one less.  [[Page H7543]]    With a national debt exceeding $22 trillion and growing every day, we  cannot afford to give additional resources to a program that clearly  duplicates, at least in part, 13 other programs and has a marginal  impact, at best.   The authorization for this program expired in 2016, and it should not  be resurrected.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
