 Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize  Keilan McWhorter, the Franklin County Teacher of the Year from Franklin  County School in Eastpoint, FL.   Keilan grew up in a small agricultural community in Albany, KY. After  graduating from Clinton County High School in 1987, he started college  at Gulf Coast Community College, later transferring to Florida State  University, graduating in 1992. When at FSU, he completed his teacher  training requirements while working on his plant physiology research.  Shortly after, Keilan moved to Rickards High School in Tallahassee and  completed his student teaching requirements.   Keilan began his first full-time teaching opportunity teaching  biology and chemistry at Shanks High School in Quincy. He also served  as department chair for 3 years and coached baseball for the Shanks  Tigers.   Keilan then moved to Panama City and began a job at Rutherford High  School, teaching higher level biology for the International  Baccalaureate Program, where he later served as department chair. He  taught within the IB program for 16 years before coming to the Franklin  County School, where he has been a valued faculty member for nearly 4  years.   I extend my best wishes to Keilan for his dedication to teaching  students. I look forward to hearing of his continued success in his  future endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Joy Prescott, the  Glades County Teacher of the Year from Pemayetv Emahakv Charter School  in Okeechobee, FL.   Joy employs a simple teaching philosophy that creates a fun learning  environment that is welcoming and, most importantly, safe. In her  classroom, her students know it is okay to make mistakes.   Joy indeed has a record of excellence as demonstrated in 2005 when  her students made the most writing gains in Florida and in 2006 when  she was named New Endeavor High School's Teacher of the Year.   Joy is a lifelong resident of Okeechobee County and spent the first  13 years of her teaching career giving back to the students in her  hometown. She has been with Pemayetv Emahakv Charter School for the  past 4 years, where she and her colleagues work to help preserve the  Seminole Tribe of Florida's cultures and traditions. She currently  teaches fourth-grade math.   I offer my best wishes to Joy and I look forward to learning of her  continued success in the years ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to honor Es  Swihart, the Sarasota County Teacher of the Year from Riverview High  School in Sarasota, FL.   After Es was presented with the Teacher of the Year award, she was  asked what inspires her. She stated it was her fellow teachers that  offer inspiration, through the long hours and their desire to teach  lessons in new ways, plus the creative veracity with which educators  make space for students as they learn to navigate the world and allow  students to value their own voice serves as inspiration.   Es notes the desire for students to come to class each day while  shouldering the weight of what they carry, sometimes gracefully and  sometimes with awkward honesty, inspires her the most. Their optimistic  view of the world and wanting others to see them for who they truly are  serve as her motivation as their teacher.   As an English teacher, Es teaches her students to analyze everything,  whether it be books or movies that are recent or decades old. She knows  her students are understanding and experiencing educational growth when  they realize books from the 1500s through 1600s can still be relevant  today. Her colleagues note she opens up pathways to language with her  content and is focused on the learning process for all of her students.   I am thankful to learn of Es's commitment to teaching. I extend my  best wishes to her on receiving this important award and look forward  to hearing of her continued success in her future endeavors.                            ____________________
