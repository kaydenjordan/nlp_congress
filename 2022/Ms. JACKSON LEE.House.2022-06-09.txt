 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding,  and let me personally on this floor--I have said it many times--offer  my sympathy to Lucy McBath for the pain that she continues to live with  for the loss of her son.   Let me say to my friends, your arguments could not be more absurd.  Over these last 2 days, I have heard welfare  [[Page H5427]]  state; I am a person of faith as all who profess such, challenging  whether or not we have faith; speaking about the absurdity of not  understanding the Constitution; disrespecting the democratic system  that we have; that there will be an outrageous attack on individuals  with the red flag laws.   You are just simply wrong. My plea is to the American people because  you can force people who masquerade as believing that it is a shame for  children to die, but yet do nothing. This is the side of doing  absolutely nothing but casting aspersions and challenging what is  right.   Red flag laws are right. Why? Indiana passed it in 2005, and in years  since, the State's firearms suicide rate has gone down 7.5 percent.  They work. A little boy, 16 years old, in New York was getting ready to  shoot up his students, had shotguns at home. An order was put forward,  and he admitted that not having the guns in the home was helpful and  the order helped him.   Is there no desire to do something in the name of those who died  wrongly in Buffalo? Is there no desire?   Are you not in any way aware of Zaire, a mother's child trying to  work in a job and was severely injured?   Are you not aware of Amerie, 10 years old, who died and bled out as  she called 911?   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two lists of victims from the  Uvalde school shooting and the Buffalo supermarket shooting.                the 21 victims of the uvalde school shooting         Makenna Lee Elrod, 10;        Layla Salazar, 11;        Maranda Mathis, 11;        Nevaeh Bravo, 10;        Jose Manuel Flores Jr., 10;         Xavier Lopez, 10;        Tess Marie Mata, 10;        Rojelio Torres, 10;        Eliahna ``Ellie'' Amyah Garcia, 9;        Eliahna A. Torres, 10;        Annabell Guadalupe Rodriguez, 10;        Jackie Cazares, 9;        Uziyah Garcia;, 9;        Jayce Carmelo Luevanos, 10;        Maite Yuleana Rodriguez, 10;        Jailah Nicole Silguero, 10 ;        Irma Garcia, 48;        Eva Mireles, 44;        Amerie Jo Garza, 10;        Alexandria ``Lexi'' Aniyah Rubio, 10; and        Alithia Ramirez, 10.                     the 10 people killed in buffalo, ny         Roberta A. Drury of Buffalo, N.Y., age 32;        Margus D. Morrison of Buffalo, N.Y., age 52;        Andre Mackneil of Auburn, N.Y., age 53;        Aaron Salter of Lockport, N.Y, age 55;        Geraldine Talley of Buffalo, N.Y., age 62;        Celestine Chaney of Buffalo, N.Y., age 65;        Heyward Patterson of Buffalo, N.Y., age 67;        Katherine Massey of Buffalo, N.Y., age 72;        Pearl Young of Buffalo, N.Y., age 77; and        Ruth Whitfield of Buffalo, N.Y., age 86.     Are you not aware that 80 percent of people  considering suicide give some sign of their plans, and nearly 80  percent of perpetrators of mass violence in public places make explicit  threats?   Red flag laws are crucial to saving lives.   Yes, the FBI didn't act in Parkland, but a red flag law that was  implemented by a Republican Governor could have been effective. There  would have been another tool.   The Constitution, for some people, they can't seem to read it  clearly. The Second Amendment says to create a militia, but Justice  Scalia, who is idolized by the right, made it very clear that the  Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and  carry any weapon whatsoever.    Madam Speaker, let me say this: Do you want guns in  the hands of dangerous people?   I don't want Republicans shot. That was a dangerous person.   Do you want guns in the hands of gang members? Do you want us to  continue like all of these school shootings in the State of Texas?   Let us realize where your heart is and ensure that the mentally ill  are not the persons that are the ones that are most dangerous, but it  is dangerous people who need red flag laws.   Maybe we need to sit down in the name of John Lewis, who said: Where  is your heart, and where is your soul?   We need to pass this red flag law and all of our gun safety laws, and  the Senate should pass it as well.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2377, the ``Federal Extreme  Risk Protection Order Act of 2021,'' of which I am a cosponsor.   In recent weeks, we have mourned the loss of life resulting from an  ever-increasing number of mass shootings that have shocked the  conscience of our nation.   We have a duty to do all we can to prevent gun violence and end the  bloodshed. Expanding the availability of extreme risk protection orders  is one step we must take because access to firearms can be the  difference between life or death--for one person or many.   These laws have proven to be effective, particularly in reducing  suicides, which involve firearms more than 50 percent of the time.   We know that suicides are often times an impulsive action. Extreme  risk protection orders can generate time and space between the impulse  and someone's access o firearms.   Recognizing that up to 80 percent of people considering suicide give  some sign of their plans and nearly 80 percent of perpetrators of mass  violence in public places make explicit threats or behave in a manner  indicative of their intent to carry out an attack, it is clear these  orders can help save lives.   Yet under federal law, a person suffering from mental illness is  generally not prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm unless  certain statutory circumstances occur.   Similarly, a person who has committed a violent act towards others is  generally not prohibited from accessing firearms under federal law  unless they are the subject of a domestic violence restraining order,  have been convicted of a felony, or have been convicted of a domestic  violence misdemeanor.   In many instances of gun violence, family and friends noticed warning  signs that their loved ones were a significant risk of harm or injury  to themselves or others.   For example, more than a month before the Parkland shooting, someone  close to the shooter provided information to the FBI's tip line about  his gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and  disturbing social media posts, as well as the possibility he might  commit a school shooting. But there was nothing to prohibit him from  possessing firearms.   Extreme risk protection laws empower those close to people at risk of  committing irreversible, hateful acts upon themselves or others to  intervene before tragedy strikes.   Instead of focusing primarily on those who suffer from mental  illness--the majority of whom are not violent--these laws focus on  preventing access to firearms by people who exhibit dangerous  behaviors.   While some states have enacted these laws, including Florida  following the Parkland shooting, many have not. That is why we need  H.R. 2377. Everyone deserves to be safe from gun violence.   This bill would provide nationwide access to extreme risk protection  orders through federal courts, improve implementation of existing state  extreme risk laws, and through grant funding, encourage more states to  adopt such laws.   It would also ensure law enforcement is trained in the use of extreme  risk protection orders, including crisis intervention and making  referrals to social service providers.   When a concerned loved one can demonstrate that an individual  presents a serious threat of injury to themselves or others, they  should have an opportunity to request an order, allowing a judge to  weigh the evidence and issue an order when appropriate.   This bill would also provide important due process protections  including notice, an opportunity to be heard at a hearing within 72  hours after an order is issued if there is a request for a long-term  extreme risk protection order, and a right to counsel.   If an order is dissolved or expires any firearms would have to be  returned.   And the bill would establish a penalty for anyone who files a false  or frivolous petition.   I recently read that 44 percent of Republicans believe mass shootings  are ``something we have to accept as part of a free society,'' and I  simply cannot and will not accept that.   We must never concede defeat to the epidemic of gun violence.  Instead, we must continue to encourage and support the implementation  of evidence-based solutions like extreme risk protection orders.   I would like to thank Representative Lucy McBath and Salud Carbajal  for their dedication to this issue and this bill.   I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation that will  make our communities safer, whether in our homes or on our streets.
