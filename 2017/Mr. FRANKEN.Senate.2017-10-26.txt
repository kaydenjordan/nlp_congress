 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the urgent  need for action on the Children's Health Insurance Program and other  vital safety net programs.   On September 30 of this year, 3 weeks ago, funding for the Children's  Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, expired, and funding for community  health centers also expired, as did funding for the National Health  Service Corps. These three cornerstone programs provide essential  health services to hundreds of thousands of my constituents and to  millions of people across the country.   Although these programs have historically secured strong bipartisan  support and, ostensibly, still do today, the Republican majority has  not moved these bills forward toward passage, and it is really time to  act.   My home State of Minnesota is one of the first States to exhaust its  funding for its Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, a program  that covers 125,000 low-income children and 1,700 pregnant women.   While the Federal Government has provided some emergency stop-gap  funding, that, too, is slated to run out by the end of November.  Minnesota has a long tradition of insuring coverage to vulnerable  populations. So coverage for low-income children will continue, no  matter what. However, over the next few weeks, if CHIP funding is not  reauthorized, the State will have to decide whether it will take  extraordinary measures and incur significant financial losses to  continue providing coverage for vital services, like prenatal and  postnatal care for the pregnant women, whose coverage is currently  funded by CHIP. This is a terrible  [[Page S6833]]  choice that States shouldn't have to make, and it doesn't have to be  that way.   Minnesota is not alone. Five other States and the District of  Columbia will see their funding dry up by December, and 25 more States  will exhaust their funding by early next year.   Pretty soon, thousands of families could receive notices informing  them that their coverage will be terminated. Imagine for a second what  that moment would feel like. You have a son or a daughter with a  serious medical condition, and, perhaps, they are even in the hospital.  You find out that their health insurance is going to be cut off because  the Republican-controlled Congress couldn't get its act together to  continue funding for a bipartisan program that has been in existence  for decades. I would be livid. That is why we have to act now.   For most of this year, the Republican majority has been consumed with  destructive and counterproductive debates focused on repealing  ObamaCare. They have done little else. That meant that not only did we  blow past the funding deadline for the Children's Health Insurance  Program, but we also blew through the funding deadlines for community  health centers and the National Health Service Corps program. Now this  critical reauthorization is on hold because Republicans can't agree on  how to pay for it. This comes just a week after Republicans in the  Senate endorsed the budget to increase the debt by up to $1.5 trillion  over 10 years for tax cuts that will largely benefit the wealthiest  Americans. In fact, the Tax Policy Center estimates that 80 percent of  benefits of the Republican tax plan would go to the top 1 percent of  income earners in this country.   This is truly a case of the absurd. When it comes to providing  healthcare for needy children and keeping Americans healthy,  Republicans are saying they can't do it unless it is paid for, and,  often, that means making cuts to other safety net programs in which  vulnerable individuals rely. But when it comes to tax cuts for the  wealthy, which costs many, many, many, many times more than the cost of  providing children with health insurance, my Republican colleagues are  perfectly happy to do that without demands for offsets and, instead,  adding costs to the debt. This is not responsible budgeting, and it is  not just kids that stand to lose under this type of budgeting approach.  Let me tell you about the other programs at risk in my State of  Minnesota.   In Minnesota, there are more than 70 community health center clinics  that receive a total of $27 million in funding to care for the  uninsured and the underinsured in the State. If this funding is not  reauthorized soon, these community health centers and the patients they  serve are going to experience serious losses and not just financial  losses.   Take, for example, Sawtooth Mountain Clinic, which provides care to  some of the most isolated and rural counties up in the northeastern  corner of my State, in the Arrowhead. Sawtooth reports that it would  lose up to $1 million, which would force them to cut back on staff and  services, having a drastic ripple effect across the entire community.   The CEO of the clinic in Grand Marais explains:         We are the only clinic and providers in all of Cook       County--    Parenthetically, that is a big county--       and also one of the only providers serving the Grand Portage       band.    That is the band of the Chippewa or Ojibwe.         Since 1965, Congress has provided this stable and       critically important funding that supports our isolated and       rural communities. Congress needs to do its work and needs to       act now.    Similarly, without funding for the National Health Service Corps-- this is what the program does. It provides financial support and loan  repayment for clinicians who practice in underserved areas. I know the  Presiding Officer must be interested in that, as Alaska has some  underserved areas and needs providers to serve in those areas. Many  providers, including those in greater Minnesota, will not be able to  recruit or hire new staff.   In a recent news article, the chief executive of a Minneapolis-based  network of clinics stated that the National Health Service Corps Loan  Repayment Program offered him a unique bargaining chip against the  larger health systems. Without this program, he believes he wouldn't be  able to successfully compete for providers.   Look, I recognize how we got here and where the time and energy has  been spent over the last few months, and I am proud that we were able  to abide by the will of the people and successfully stop the effort to  repeal the ACA and strip healthcare from millions of people. I would  hope that we would recognize that we have here historically bipartisan  legislation to reauthorize funding for children's health insurance  coverage and other safety net programs. It is incumbent upon us to act,  and act now. We have to reauthorize these programs so that Minnesotans  and millions of the families across the country are not unnecessarily  and unfairly harmed as a result of our inaction.   In the same news story I referred to earlier, the CEO of NorthPoint  Health & Wellness, another safety net clinic in Minnesota, stated:         There is a high degree of anxiety for staff and for some of       our patients. . . . I think Congress understands that we are       vital to the safety net and they have to continue to support       the community health centers.    Let's work together to pass this legislation so we don't let these  clinics and the patients they serve down. It is time to act, and time  to act now.   Thank you very much, Mr. President.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to talk about the recent terrorist  attack in Somalia.   On October 14, a truck filled with explosives detonated in a crowded  district in Mogadishu--Somalia's capital. The blast was especially  devastating because the truck blew up next to a fuel tanker, causing a  massive fireball and leveling structures, including the nearby Safari  Hotel, which collapsed and trapped many people under its rubble.  According to Somali authorities, the target of the attack may have been  the city's international airport which also houses many Embassies.   This is the worst terrorist attack in Somalia's history. Three  hundred fifty-eight people were killed, hundreds have been injured, and  dozens are still missing.   As a Minnesota Senator, I represent the largest Somali-American  population in the Nation. For Minnesota, this wasn't just a massive  attack overseas. It affected every one of my estimated 74,000 Somali- American constituents.   Among those killed is Ahmed Eyow. He was from Bloomington, MN. He had  attended Normandale Community College and Metropolitan State  University. He left behind his wife and three children.   Another Somali-American who was killed in the blast was Mohamoud  Elmi. He had lived in Ohio and had moved back to Somalia about 2 years  ago. He was a young man with a bright future, working at the Ministry  of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management in Somalia.   There was Abukar Mohamed. He lived in Virginia before moving back to  Somalia, where he worked in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. He  was killed along with his wife, Shadiye Hassan. They left behind seven  children who are between the ages of 3 and 20.   Hundreds of others perished in that heinous attack. They all have  their own stories. They left behind their wives, their husbands, their  children, their friends, their parents.   Somalia is one of the most, if not the most, fragile nations on  Earth. It has been an incredibly difficult country to  [[Page S6844]]  govern ever since the civil war tore the country apart in 1991. It  suffers from the massive displacement of people, hundreds of thousands  of refugees, lack of sufficient public services, and warring factions  and clans. To make matters worse, a severe drought has ravaged Somalia,  leaving 6 million people--half of the nation's population--facing food  shortages. The combination of instability, lack of security, and  shortage of goods and services has enabled terrorist groups like al- Shabaab--widely believed to be the culprit in this attack--to gain a  foothold in Somalia.   We have to have a comprehensive strategy to help the people of  Somalia. One component of that strategy is to help Somalis root out  terrorism. The Government of Somalia has announced its intent to step  up the fight against al-Shabaab. The United States has and will  continue to aid those efforts, as will the African Union Mission in  Somalia--a multinational peacekeeping force that is supported by the  United States.   At the same time, we have to erode and eliminate the conditions that  enable terrorist groups to thrive. That means redoubling our efforts to  help stabilize fragile nations. That means supporting good governance,  reducing extreme inequality, and helping marginalized, disenfranchised  individuals who are preyed upon time and again by terrorist recruiters.   It is more important than ever that we fully fund our international  programs that support these efforts, for humanitarian and security  reasons. Unfortunately, the administration's 2018 budget proposal does  the opposite. It includes a 30-percent cut to programs that seek to  bring stability, rule of law, and humanitarian assistance to places  that need it the most. The administration's budget is making the world,  and us, less safe. And I want to urge the President to rethink his  approach to foreign aid.   My colleagues, Senators John McCain and Tim Kaine, put it this way in  a recent op-ed they coauthored, saying:         Today, 80 percent of our assistance provides relief and       promotes stability in conflict zones and states on the verge       of collapse. There are U.S. Agency for International       Development programs in many of the countries most plagued by       terrorism, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Mali,       Yemen and Somalia. We're saving lives and creating partners       to help address the instability that produces the threats our       military risks life and limb to fight.    In conclusion, I urge my colleagues and the American people to not  forget about the terrible tragedy in Somalia. I urge everyone to keep  Somali victims and other victims of terror acts throughout the world in  their thoughts and prayers.   The world needs to know that the United States will continue to  support Somalia and other nations that are fighting those who are  wreaking havoc on their nations. But we have to remember that we will  all be more successful when we combine military efforts with diplomatic  and humanitarian ones. While we cannot bring back those who perished,  if we focus on rooting out the conditions that give rise to terrorism,  we can have a shot at averting the next one.   Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my health  policy fellow, Laura Knudtson, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of this Congress.
