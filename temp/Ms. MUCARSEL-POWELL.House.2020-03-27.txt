 Mr. Speaker, as of this morning, the U.S. has  the most COVID-19 cases worldwide. Over 1,200 have tragically lost  their lives.   In Florida alone, we have over 2,300 cases, with 652 in Miami-Dade  County and 14 in Monroe County. South Florida is quickly becoming  another epicenter of this pandemic.   We are watching how numbers for unemployment are skyrocketing, and  small businesses are closing. It is a tough reality to face. But we in  Congress can do something. We can come together, set aside our  ideological differences, and help people now. That is why I support  this bill.
