 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator  Mike Crapo and Representative  Mike Simpson, I congratulate College of  Southern Idaho, CSI, president Jeff Fox on his well-deserved  retirement.   At age 10, just as CSI was gearing up to offer its very first classes  in the fall semester of 1965, Dr. Fox's grandfather took him to the  farm fields where the new local college was being built. Twenty-two  years later, Dr. Fox returned to the College of Southern Idaho to begin  his career in education.   For 33 years, Dr. Fox has dedicated his life to educating and  developing the citizens and the communities of South-Central Idaho. He  first came to CSI as an English professor, spending 15 years in the  classroom helping his students learn and grow. His talent and skill  eventually led him to accept positions in the college's administration,  serving as the director of the Academic Development Center, chairman of  the English Department, and executive vice president and chief academic  officer.   In 2014, Dr. Fox was selected to serve as the fourth president of  CSI. During his tenure, he oversaw a rapid expansion of the campus and  community, introducing new training programs and academic offerings to  better equip students to thrive after graduation. Among his many  accomplishments, he was instrumental in the dedication and  administration of the Applied Technology and Innovation Center that  houses CSI's workforce development and custom training programs for  businesses and industries.   Today, CSI is known throughout South-Central Idaho for its  outstanding nursing, agriculture, business, and workforce development  programs, and its passion for equipping students with the tools needed  to build a successful career and life. The students and faculty at CSI  have been fortunate to prosper under Dr. Fox's skilled and steady  leadership, and there is no question he has left an indelible mark on  the CSI campus and the Magic Valley community at large.   President Fox, congratulations on your outstanding career. You make  our great State proud, and we wish you all the best in your retirement  and future endeavors.                            ____________________
