 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  ninth President of Savannah State University, Mr. Cyrus G. Wiley.   At the time called the Georgia State Industrial College for Colored  Youths, Mr. Wiley made tremendous strides forward for the oldest public  historically Black college in the State of Georgia.   He started his term in 1921 and was the first alumnus to become  president of the school. In that same year, he allowed women to attend  for the first time and he transitioned the college out of its role  providing high school programs and into a 4 year, degree-granting  institution.   Nearly 100 years later, the school remains a vital part of the  Savannah community. They have earned patents in battling Alzheimer's  and ALS, built new science and technology buildings, and purchased new  property for a new marine lab.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank everyone at Savannah State University,  especially President Kimberly Ballard-Washington, for following in Mr.  Wiley's footsteps to continue breaking barriers, their commitment to  the Savannah community, and for providing a great education for the  students.                         World Pharmacists' Day 2019     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize World  Pharmacists' Day 2019 being celebrated today. I am proud that we have a  day like this for people all over the world to remember the important  role that pharmacists play in keeping all of us and our loved ones  healthy.   There are currently over 2 million practicing pharmacists around the  world, but in each nation, pharmacists are combating unique problems.  For some countries pharmacists are at a severe shortage.   In the United States, pharmacists have been thrown into the front  lines of a critical issue: the opioid epidemic.   Currently, more than 115 people die every day from opioid addictions,  and pharmacists will play an integral role in bringing this number all  the way down to zero.   Madam Speaker, I encourage everyone to get to know their pharmacists  and to thank them for the work that they do.   As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I thank all our  pharmacists around the world.      Congratulating EMD Performance Materials on their 40th Anniversary     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  40th anniversary of EMD Performance Material's Savannah location.   I am so proud of the work this company has done over the last 40  years, providing nearly 140 jobs for citizens in the First  Congressional District of Georgia.   More than just jobs alone, EMD brings a prestige to our area that  comes along with its brand name.   At the Savannah location specifically, they manufacture  groundbreaking liquid crystals that are largely responsible for  advancing razor sharp margins in smartphones, laptops, flat-screen TVs,  and more.   EMD's success is a great example of why the State of Georgia was  named as the top State to do business for the sixth year in a row. And  Savannah itself has a strategic location with its connection to a major  seaport and interstates.   Madam Speaker, I thank EMD for their work in our area, and I  congratulate them on their anniversary. I hope that we will have  another 40 years of working together.                   Recognizing Georgia Army National Guard     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Georgia Army National Guard, whose last unit is coming home this month  from Afghanistan.   Stationed at Fort Stewart in the First Congressional District of  Georgia, the 177th Brigade Engineer Battalion is the only unmanned  aerial vehicle unit in the entire Georgia National Guard.   Because of that expertise, they remained in Afghanistan longer than  other units, and their high quality of work has not gone unnoticed.   Upon returning home, they will be working in a brand-new facility at  Fort Stewart for the first time. I am proud  [[Page H7908]]  to have this group located in the First Congressional District of  Georgia.   Madam Speaker, I thank them for their service to our country, and I  welcome them home.                            ____________________
