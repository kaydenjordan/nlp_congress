 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to once again stand for life  and to prevent American taxpayers from paying for abortion services  overseas. Americans should never be forced to fund abortions against  their conscience, period.   I have long supported the Hyde amendment, which prohibits taxpayer  funding from paying for abortions domestically. Yesterday, I proudly  spoke in support of this key pro-life protection, which the Democrats  stripped from these appropriations packages.   Now, Democrats are trying to force Americans to foot the bill for  abortions abroad. For decades, the Helms amendment has prohibited  abortion services from being included in our Nation's foreign aid.   Driven by a radical agenda, Democrats and the Biden administration  have removed this longstanding, commonsense prohibition from the State  and Foreign Operations bill on the floor today.   To make it clear, congressional Democrats and the Biden  administration are trying to force the American taxpayer to fund  abortions in foreign nations.   The facts are on our side. Seventy-seven percent of Americans oppose  using taxpayer dollars for this purpose. It is deeply disappointing,  but not surprising, that Democrats are continuing to attack our pro- life values and Americans' fundamental conscience rights.   Taxpayers in Indiana and around the country should never be forced to  bankroll abortion services here at home, and we most certainly should  not be forced to bankroll abortions abroad.   This is a dangerous path of destruction. I urge my colleagues to  oppose the bill.
