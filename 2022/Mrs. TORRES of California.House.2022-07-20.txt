 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express  concern about the building material supply change bottlenecks and  elevated construction costs that continue to put a damper on the  single-family housing market.   For the first time since June 2020, both single-family starts and  permits fell below a 1 million annual pace. Additionally, builder  confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes declined  for the seventh straight month in July, falling 12 points to 55.   According to the National Association of Homebuilders and the Wells  Fargo Housing Market Index released just this week, this marks the  lowest HMI reading since May 2020 and the largest single-month drop in  the history of the HMI, except during the pandemic.   Building material prices during the pandemic have hit record highs  with low stock, and prospective buyers are faced with unaffordable home  prices as a result. Affordable housing is a critical need in the Inland  Empire, the district that I represent, and I urge the administration to  prioritize the ability and the availability and price of lumber to make  more homes affordable.                            ____________________
