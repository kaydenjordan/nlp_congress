 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Transportation and Infrastructure be discharged from further  consideration of the bill (H.R. 1318) to restrict the imposition by the  Secretary of Homeland Security of fines, penalties, duties, or tariffs  applicable only to coastwise voyages, or prohibit otherwise qualified  non-United States citizens from serving as crew, on specified vessels  transporting passengers between the State of Washington and the State  of Alaska, to address a Canadian cruise ship ban and the extraordinary  impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Alaskan communities, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
