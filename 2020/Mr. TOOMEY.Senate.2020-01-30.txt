 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senators Sasse, McSally, Crapo, Thune, Young,  Ernst, and Braun.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Toomey and others is for  counsel for the President:         Given that the election of the president is one of the most       significant political acts in which we as citizens engage in       our democratic system, how much weight should the Senate give       to the fact that removing the president from office and       disqualifying him from ever holding future federal office       would undo that democratic decision and kick the President       off the ballot in this year's election?    Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate.   One of the concerns that we have raised throughout this process over  the last several months, going back to the time when the House was  dealing with this in their various committees, is we are in an election  year. There are some in this room that are days away from the Iowa  caucuses taking place. So we are discussing the possible impeachment  and removal of the President of the United States not only during  election season, in the heart of the election season. And I think that  this does a disservice to the American people.   Again, we think the basis upon which this has moved forward is  irregular, to say the least. But I do think it complicates the matter  for the American people that we are literally at the dawn of a new  season of elections. I mean, we are at that season now, and yet we are  talking about impeaching a President.    And I want to tie this into the urgency that was so prevalent in  December with my colleagues, the managers. It was so urgent to move  this forward that they had to do it by mid-December, before Christmas,  because national security was at stake, and then they waited 33 days to  bring it here. And now they are asking you to do all the  [[Page S695]]  investigation, although they say they proved their case but still need  more to prove it.   Whereas, we believe--and I want to be clear here--that their entire  process was corrupt from the beginning, and they are just putting it on  this body. But to do it while the American people are selecting  candidates for nomination to be the head of their party, to run as  President of the United States--some of you in this very room--and to  talk about the removal of a President of the United States, I think  that is all part and parcel of the same pattern and practice of  irregularities that have taken place with this impeachment proceeding  since the beginning. The Speaker allowed the articles to linger. It was  such a nationally urgent matter that they could linger for a month.   So we think that this points to the exact problem of what is taking  place here and that is, as my colleague Mr. Cipollone said, this is  really taking the vote away from the American people.   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Montana.
