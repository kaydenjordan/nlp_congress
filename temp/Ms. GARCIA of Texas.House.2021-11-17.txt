 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  critical investments coming to my home State of Texas.   This week, the President signed the Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act. This bipartisan bill is bringing over $35 billion to Texas  for important projects that will rebuild our communities. The fact is,  Mr. Speaker, that this is long overdue.   When I was a Harris County commissioner, I built a few roads. I saw  firsthand how badly our roads and bridges had deteriorated. We  regularly scored Cs and Ds on infrastructure that my precinct relied on  every day, creating extra costs and putting lives in danger. In fact,  roads in terrible condition have forced Texas drivers to pay over $700  in extra costs each year. Since 2011, Texans have seen their commute  increase to about half an hour because our roads haven't kept up with  our growth.   In that same time, Texans were hit with 60 extreme weather events  that cost taxpayers over $200 billion. More than that, crumbling  infrastructure has taken the lives of thousands in our great State.  Just this February our electric grid nearly collapsed, and over 200  people--many of them seniors--froze to death in their homes.   We are past due in the work to improve our State's infrastructure.  That is why I am proud to have voted for this jobs bill and for all of  the investments coming to Texas.   The bill that we passed is over $3.5 billion to weatherize our grid  and prepare it for future crises. We also invest $27 billion in our  State's highways and bridges. We will also get $3 billion to bring  safe, clean water to every Texan, especially in our rural communities.  This is not small potatoes.   We know how dangerous lead pipes are for growing children. Lead  contamination can cause developmental problems, mental health issues,  and serious medical emergencies. Because of this funding, we can remove  lead pipes from Texas schools and ensure that every child can drink  clean, safe water.   Thanks to all of these investments, Texans will have safer commutes,  cleaner water, and lower bills for reliable electricity.   But this law does not solve just today's problems. It prepares us for  tomorrow's opportunities. Thanks to this law, Texas will receive nearly  half a billion dollars to expand the electric vehicle charging network.  We will also receive over $1 billion to improve our State's airports  which are some of the Nation's busiest. We can also expect over $100  million to bring internet access to 1 million Texans who currently lack  it. This is especially important to rural Texans like my sister who has  to drive all the way into town to get to the library to access the  internet.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to solve these problems and create jobs for  our community. That is what this law is going to do. The bill will  create thousands of jobs in my State from construction  [[Page H6325]]  workers and laborers to engineers and scientists, and all of these are  good-paying jobs. For every mile of road that is repaved from Houston  to El Paso, we will be supporting roadway workers and construction  workers. For every electrical line that is repaired to be more reliable  in the cold, we will be supporting electricians and engineers. And for  every lead pipe that is replaced to keep our children safe, we will be  supporting plumbers, laborers, and other workers.   Altogether, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is just about  that: rebuilding our infrastructure, investing in the future, and  bringing jobs, jobs, jobs to our communities.   I am looking forward to seeing these projects come together in my  home State, and I am grateful for the leadership of our President and  this Congress in making sure that this can get to all communities in  our country.   Together we will truly build back better for Texas.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, Representative Gosar's behavior  is alarming, unacceptable, and should never, ever be tolerated.   The official communication accounts of a Member of the United States  Congress should never in any way show or encourage violence against a  colleague or threaten the President of the United States.   On January 6, we personally experienced the consequences of allowing  this kind of viciousness and vulgarity. Put simply, violent images in  our politics encourages violence against any of us. No one, especially  women and women of color, should fear coming to do the work they were  elected to do for the people.   We must encourage our women to lead, not silence them by tolerating  threats like Congressman Gosar's. As Members of Congress, we must set  an example for the entire country instead of encouraging violence  against others. It is our moral imperative to be collegial to one  another. It is our responsibility to hold ourselves accountable. And it  is our obligation to protect the integrity and honor of the United  States Congress.    Madam Speaker, children are watching. The world is watching. We must  do better.
