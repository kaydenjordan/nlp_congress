 Madam Speaker, I thank the Chairwoman and all of the  very important people on the Appropriations Committee for their work on  this bill.   I ask the question, what side do you want to be on? Do you want to be  on the side that provides our hardworking military pay raises for the  troops, to be able to get money away from a misdirected war?   Do you want to be on the side that provides for working families?   Do you want to be on the side that stops those who can't pay for  daycare to have that?   Do you want to be on the side of those who say, ``I am a Federal  employee, and I have been shut out of my job''?   What side do you want to be on? I want to be on the side of  negotiating an omnibus that works for the American people. I want my  Republican friends to know that we have tried to negotiate, but we are  adults and we are not going to let this government shut down.   What we are going to do is recognize these are dangerous times. We  know that there is now an omicron variant. We are not going to play the  antivaxxer game, we are not going to say that it is about vaccine  mandates because we know that most of the Federal Government has been  vaccinated; but what we are going to do is extend this resolution to  keep the government open because the side that Democrats are on is the  side of the American people and our government workers who go out and  work every day and the families who go out and work every day.     I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. A shutdown  would induce furloughs that could hit 62 percent of the U.S. Centers  for Disease Control, right in the middle of COVID-19.   In addition, families would be desperate as well.   I want you to understand that veterans would suffer. During the  Thanksgiving holiday, I went to the veterans hospital. I can tell you,  it is not empty. Veterans are there every day, and when they are there,  they are getting services. Do you want to be part of a government  shutdown where veterans hospitals are closed and veterans are standing  outside with their hand asking what is happening?   I want to be on the side of those who understand the value of working  for the American families and doing what Democrats have done, passing  bills, passing laws that serve the American people.   Vote for the CR and vote for the omnibus so that we can get the job  done. I thank the gentlewoman for her courtesies.  [[Page H6883]]    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in support of H.R.  6119, the ``Further Extending Government Funding Act,'' which provides  funding to continue the operations of the federal government through  February 18, 2022, and avoids a wasteful and irresponsible shutdown,  and also the underlying bill.   House Democrats passed government funding bills to create good paying  jobs, support the hard-working middle class, and protect our national  security; Senate Democrats have also released all their appropriations  bills.   Without an omnibus, there will be a shortfall that will cause  veterans not to receive their benefits in full.   For our national security, we need an omnibus to support defense  readiness and modernization, sustain good-paying American jobs, secure  our cyber infrastructure, and strengthen American leadership abroad.   Without an omnibus, a pay raise for troops will not be funded while  funds will be misdirected to a war we are no longer fighting.   With a new deadline of February 18, we need Republicans to offer  constructive proposals to address the critical issues facing the  country by funding the federal government's important work for the  American people.   Madam Speaker, I need not remind my colleagues that we are at a  critical point in the fight against this pandemic--less than 24 hours  ago, it was reported that the first case of the Omicron variant was  confirmed in the United States.   Our response in the following days and weeks will be crucial.   Yet some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the House  and the Senate have indicated that they intend to block the passage of  this stopgap spending bill in order to trigger a shutdown of the  Federal government unless a bill is passed that undoes President  Biden's initiatives to vaccinate and test employees at large companies.   Simply put, this is irresponsible and dangerous at a time when we  have a new threat on our soil in the form of the Omicron variant.   A government shutdown would induce furloughs that could hit 62  percent of employees at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.   It would be nothing other than reckless to hamstring the agency at  the center of America's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic at this  time--we need all hands on deck.   In September, Congress voted on a bipartisan basis to extend  government funding through December 3 to allow time for bicameral,  bipartisan negotiations to complete omnibus government funding  legislation.   Since then, House and Senate Republicans have refused to negotiate  with Democrats on government funding.   In fact, while House and Senate Democrats have put forward their  proposals, Republicans have not presented an offer of their own.   Therefore, the Appropriations Committee introduced H.R. 6119, the  Further Extending Government Funding Act, which continues government  funding at current levels through February 18.   It makes minimal changes to address the most urgent of needs during  the period of the Continuing Resolution.   Although this bill is necessary, working families, small businesses,  veterans, and our military need the certainty that comes with passing  an omnibus as opposed to short-term funding patches.   Republicans must join us for bipartisan, bicameral negotiations to  resolve our differences and keep government working for the people.   For our communities, we need an omnibus to create jobs by supporting  small businesses, bolster our public health infrastructure to prevent  future pandemics and medical research to save lives, strengthen public  schools with a focus on those serving students with the highest need,  protect our air and water through environmental protection and  enforcement efforts, combat the opioid epidemic on the ground in our  communities, and support core services such as food safety and consumer  product inspections.   Without an omnibus, investments in all these areas will be denied.   For our veterans, we need an omnibus to provide sufficient funding  for veterans' benefits, reduce backlogs for veterans and their families  seeking assistance, and meet the needs of the VA's health care system.   Throughout the 117th Congress, House Democrats have worked to deliver  results for the American people, passing legislation to address each  pillar of the ``For The People'' agenda: lower health care costs,  higher wages by rebuilding America, and cleaning up corruption and  strengthening our Democracy.   And under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, the House has passed  hundreds of bills, including legislation to crush the COVID-19  pandemic, build our economy back better, lower health care and  prescription drug prices, raise wages, advance economic and retirement  security, end gun violence, act on the climate crisis, protect  Dreamers, and strengthen voting rights.   For example, in this Congress the House has passed and sent to the  President the following legislation that has been signed into law:   H.R. 1799, Paycheck Protection Program Extension Act:   This legislation extended the Paycheck Protection Program application  deadline for two months through May 31, 2021 to help struggling  businesses keep workers employed during COVID-19.   H.R. 1276, SAVE LIVES Act:   This law ensured that more veterans, their families, and caregivers  got access to COVID-19 vaccines in a timely manner.   S. 937, COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act:   This law addresses the dramatic increase in hate crimes targeting the  AAPI community since the start of the pandemic. This law designates a  point person at the Department of Justice to review hate crimes related  to the COVID-19 pandemic, bolsters state and local governments to  improve their reporting of hate crimes and ensures that hate crime  information is more accessible to Asian-American communities.   S. 475, Juneteenth National Independence Day Act:   This law established the first federal holiday in 38 years to  formally recognize Juneteenth National Independence Day and commemorate  the end of slavery in the United States.   House Democrats have also worked to advance critical pieces of  legislation, which await action in the Senate:   H.R. 1, For The People Act:   This comprehensive legislation would promote government transparency,  strengthen access to the ballot box and make it easier for Americans to  exercise their right to vote, secure election infrastructure, and curb  the influence of dark money in politics.   H.R. 5, Equality Act:   The Equality Act would codify consistent anti-discrimination legal  protections for LGBTQ Americans by amending several existing civil  rights laws to include explicit non-discrimination protections in key  areas of life.   H.R. 6, Dream and Promise Act:   The Dream and Promise Act would protect Dreamers, Temporary Protected  Status (TPS), and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) status holders from  deportation and provide an opportunity to obtain permanent legal status  that would enable these groups to work legally within the United States  and continue to contribute to their local communities and economy.   H.R. 7, Paycheck Fairness Act:   This bill would strengthen labor protections around equal pay by  prohibiting the use of salary history to set compensation, provide more  transparent options for joining class-action lawsuits challenging  systemic discrimination, and require employers to show that gender pay  gaps are job-related and consistent with business need.   H.R. 8, Bipartisan Background Checks Act and H.R. 1446, the Enhanced  Background Checks Act:   These bills would modernize federal laws around gun sales. The former  would close current loopholes that allow buyers to purchase guns  without a background check in certain venues, while the latter would  prevent gun sales from going through before background checks are  completed.   H.R. 1280, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act:   This bill, which House Democrats also passed in the 116th Congress 30  days after the murder of George Floyd, will address racial bias in  policing, ensure accountability for police brutality and misconduct,  and work to change the culture of law enforcement to promote better  relationships with the communities they serve.   H.R. 842, Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act:   This bill aims to strengthen labor protections for union workers  through overriding Republican-led ``right to work'' laws, promoting  free and fair union elections, and holding companies that attempt to  restrict union activity accountable.   H.J. Res. 17, Removing the Deadline for Ratification of the Equal  Rights Amendment:   This resolution would remove the deadline for ratifying the Equal  Rights Amendment in order to enshrine women's equality in the  Constitution.   H.R. 1620, Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act:   This long-overdue legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against  Women Act passed the House with bipartisan support. It would  reauthorize funding to vital grant programs that help prevent sexual  assault, domestic violence, and improve access to resources for victims  and survivors.   H.R. 3237, the Emergency Security Supplemental to Respond to 1/6  Appropriations Act:   This bill provides $1.9 billion in funding to secure the U.S. Capitol  Complex and ensure the brave men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police  have the resources they need to do  [[Page H6884]]  their jobs. The legislation responds to the direct costs incurred by  the National Guard and DC police on January 6, provides funding to  improve the security of windows and doors in the Capitol complex, and  secures funds to improve Capitol Police training and equipment.   H.R. 3005, Legislation to #RemoveHate from the Capitol Building:   This bill would remove statues of those who perpetuated and supported  slavery and segregation in this country, along with statues or busts of  those who served voluntarily in the Confederate States of America, from  public display in the U.S. Capitol.    H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act:   This bipartisan bill would stabilize the agriculture industry's labor  supply by reforming the H-2A guest worker program and creating a  pathway to citizenship for agricultural workers, many of whom worked  through the pandemic.   H.R. 51, the Washington, DC Admission Act:   This bill would admit Washington, DC as the 51st state in the Union  and end the injustice in denying nearly 700,000 citizens the right to  be represented fully in Congress. It would also end the unjust practice  of treating District of Columbia residents differently when allocating  government resources or relief.   H.R. 3985, ALLIES Act:   This bill would increase the visa cap and expedite the visa process  for Afghan allies who worked alongside American military personnel,  diplomats, development professionals, and partner forces, to help  ensure they make it safely out of harm's way.   H.R. 803, Protecting America's Wildness and Public Lands Act:   This comprehensive bill would conserve and protect natural landscapes  across America, designating over 1.5 million acres of public land as  protected wilderness and withdrawing significant amount of public land  from drilling and mining activities to promote a healthier environment.   H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act:   This bipartisan bill would improve the safety of Americans' drinking  water by requiring the EPA to set a drinking water standard, prevent  the future release of PFAS chemicals into our bodies of water, and  start the process of cleaning up affected communities.   H.R. 256, Repeal of the 2002 AUMF Against Iraq:   This bill, which passed with bipartisan support, would repeal the  2002 Authorization of Military Force Against Iraq.   H.R. 1230, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act:   The bipartisan Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act  restores protections for older workers that were weakened in a 2009  Supreme Court ruling that made it harder for older workers to prove age  based discrimination in the workplace.   H.R. 2662, the Inspectors-General Independence and Empowerment Act:   This bill seeks to promote government transparency and accountability  by ensuring the independence of federal inspectors-general, allowing  government watchdogs to act freely without fear of political pressure  or threats. It would also protect whistleblowers from threats of  retaliation by making it a violation of House rules for Members to  reveal their identities.   In addition, three Congressional Review Act resolutions have been  signed into law, overturning dangerous rules put in place by the Trump  Administration:   S.J. Res 13, a CRA overturning an EEOC rule to address discrimination  in the workplace;   S.J. Res. 14, a CRA addressing dangerous methane emissions; and   S.J. Res. 15, a CRA to protect against predatory lenders.   These along with many, many others are among the bills awaiting  Senate action.   Madam Speaker, let me briefly list several of the programs vital to  Americans that are protected or extended by H.R. 6119. The bill:   Provides waiver language for certain intelligence programs as well as  agencies that operate under the State Department Basic Authorities Act  and Foreign Relations Authorization Act;   Allows the Food and Nutrition Service to spend at a higher rate  during the period covered by the legislation to provide supplemental  USDA foods to low-income seniors (age 60 and over) and to some low- income women, infants and children up to age six.   Allows a higher spending rate for the White House to support  continuing COVID-19 operations.   Allows the Small Business Administration flexibility to spend at the  rate necessary to accommodate potential demand increases for  commitments for business loans through the 7(a) and 504 business loans,  for the Secondary Market Guarantee Program, and for the Small Business  Investment Company (SBIC) program.    Allows District of Columbia voucher schools an additional year to be  accredited and therefore remain in the program. The accrediting process  requires in-school visits, which are not happening during the  coronavirus.   Allows the District of Columbia to spend FY 2021 funds received from  local tax revenues and other non-Federal sources in the amount and for  the programs and activities provided in DC's FY 2021 Budget Act.   Extends the term of certain bankruptcy judgeships.   Allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency to access the entire  DRF appropriation for fiscal year 2021 under the continuing resolution  as necessary to respond to declared disasters.   Continues the authorization for the NFIP.   Extends funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  program and the Child Care Entitlement to States program during the  period of the continuing resolution. The extension will allow HHS to  make first-quarter payments to States.   Extends the availability of funding for multiyear research grants  supported by the National Institutes of Health that were interrupted in  fiscal year 2020 by COVID-19 and would have expired at the end of the  fiscal year.   Madam Speaker, our colleagues across the aisle have in both chambers  have been obstructive, dilatory, petulantly uncooperative throughout  the first session of the 117th Congress.   Nowhere was this more apparent than the refusal of the majority of J  Republican members in the House voted 175-35 against H.R. 3233,  legislation modeled after the 9/11 Commission establishing a National  Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States  Capitol Complex Act.   Madam Speaker, American families do not get to choose which bills to  pay and which ones to ignore; neither can the United States Congress  without putting the nation into default for the first time in its  history.   Long ago, in 1789, Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first and  greatest Treasury Secretary, understood that the path to American  prosperity and greatness lay in its creditworthiness which provided the  affordable access to capital needed to fund internal improvements and  economic growth.   The nation's creditworthiness was one of its most important national  assets and according to Hamilton: ``the proper funding of the present  debt, will render it a national blessing.''   But to maintain this blessing, or to ``render public credit  immortal,'' Hamilton understood that it was necessary that: ``the  creation of debt should always be accompanied with the means of  extinguishment.''   In other words, to retain and enjoy the prosperity that flows from  good credit, it is necessary for a nation to pay its bills.   To preserve the sanctity of the full faith and credit of the United  States, protect American jobs and businesses of all sizes, and ensure  the continued growth of the economy, I strongly support the provision  in the bill before extending the public debt limit to December 16,  2021.   Madam Speaker, I would also like to discuss an important topic that  is closely related to this bill and that this House must address very  soon--raising the debt ceiling.   Preserving the full faith and credit of the United States by raising  to the debt limit to ensure that America pays the bills for past  expenditures when they come due is not a partisan exercise but an act  of patriotism, a recognition and embrace of the solemn obligation to  preserve the unrivaled advantages that flow from the ability provided  in the Article I, Section 8, clause 2 of the Constitution to ``borrow  money on the credit of the United States.''   Long ago, in 1789, Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first and  greatest Treasury Secretary, understood that the path to American  prosperity and greatness lay in its creditworthiness which provided the  affordable access to capital needed to fund internal improvements and  economic growth.   It is because of the existence and wise use of the Borrowing Power  that the nation was able to expand its reaches, resources, and riches  by financing the Louisiana Purchase, the purchase of Alaska from  Russia, to fund the investments to end the Great Depression, to finance  the mobilization of resources needed in World War II to defeat fascism  and save freedom in the nation and the world, to revive the economy  after the catastrophic Great Recession of 2008, and most recently, to  protect the public health and safety and restore the economy during the  COVID-19 pandemic.   This is why the ability to borrow money on the credit of the United  States to finance its growth and protect its people and interests is  essential to the national security and led Hamilton to proclaim that  ``the proper funding of the present debt, will render it a national  blessing.''   But to maintain this blessing, or to ``render public credit  immortal,'' Hamilton understood that it was necessary that: ``the  creation of debt should always be accompanied with the means of  extinguishment.''   In other words, to retain and enjoy the prosperity that flows from  good credit, it is necessary for a nation to pay its bills.  [[Page H6885]]    The United States has never defaulted on the payment of any debt  incurred, and because of the size and strength of its economic and  unmatched creditworthiness, is able to borrow on the lowest and most  favorable terms of any nation or entity in the history of the world.   So secure and reliable is a bond issues by the Department of Treasury  that the Unites States is the preferred haven for investments of  foreign governments, corporations, and sovereign wealth funds.   The interest rate charged the federal government of the United States  is the base for which every rate, from the prime rate charged the  richest corporation to rates charged small business on purchases to the  mortgages rates and students loans taken out by consumers.   If you raise the cost of borrowing for the government of the United  States, you set off a chain reaction of increased interest rates for  every other borrower in the United States and around the world.   This is why leading public finance experts and agencies, like Moody's  Chief Economist Mark Zandi, have said it would be ``cataclysmic'' for  the United States to default on its loan obligations.   Republicans know the debt ceiling needs to be raised; in 2019 during  the Trump Administration, the Republican Senate Majority Leader  marshalled Senate Republicans to vote to raise the debt ceiling,  saying: ``We raised the debt ceiling because America can't default[,]  that would be a disaster.''   Madam Speaker, this debate over extending the debt limit is not about  restraining future spending, it is about paying the bills piled up  already under both Republican and Democratic administrations.   The question of raising the national debt limit does not depend on  how one feels about the Build Back Better agenda, as wildly popular as  it is among all Americans, Democrats, Independents, and Republicans  included.   It is instead about preserving the singular asset of the United  States, its enviable and unrivaled creditworthiness, to finance future  investments beneficial to the national interest, like the provision of  free college for two years, or $2 billion investment to reduce violence  in communities approved by the Committee on the Judiciary, or  investments to preserve and strengthen Medicaid expansion programs, or  extend broadband to underserved rural and urban areas, an action that  will be as life-changing as the rural electrification program was in  the 1930s.   Madam Speaker, if our friends across the aisle really want to shrink  the deficit, reduce the national debt, practice fiscal responsibility,  and bring about sustained economic growth and prosperity, there is a  much better, easier, and more certain way to achieve these goals than  by tampering with the U.S. Constitution.   The easier and better way is for the American people to keep a  Democrat in the White House and place Democratic majorities in the  House and Senate.   In the 1990s under the leadership of President Clinton the budget was  balanced for four consecutive years, the national debt was paid down,  the national debt, 23 million new jobs were created, and projected  surpluses exceeded $5 trillion.   Under President Obama the financial crisis and economic meltdown  inherited from his Republican predecessor was ended, the annual deficit  was reduced by 67 percent, the auto industry was saved from collapse,  and 15 million jobs were created.   In contrast, under every Republican administration since President  Reagan the size of the deficit bequeathed to his successor was  substantially larger than the deficit he inherited, a major economic  recession occurred, and economic growth was lower than it was at the  beginning of his administration.   To preserve the sanctity of the full faith and credit of the United  States, protect American jobs and businesses of all sizes, and ensure  the continued growth of the economy, raised.    Madam Speaker, I have been here since the Columbine  tragedy, which is more than 20 years ago. I have faced a mountain of  tragedies in schools with children dying at the hands of guns.   I offer my deepest sympathy for the loss of the beautiful, precious  people in Michigan. I think a simple addition to this whole idea of the  gun safety discussion--I intend to introduce a bill that is in tribute  to Kimberly Vaughan who died in Santa Fe at the hands of a young  gunman. I want to just simply say, Store your guns.   This storage act in honor of her name responds to the tragedy that  just happened as well because it requires manufacturers and retailers  to sell guns with storage safety devices to ensure that those penalties  for not doing so are ahead of the loss of life; providing tax credits  for those who do that; and as well, providing grants for more  information about safety devices.   We have to do whatever we can to save the lives of our children.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York  for both his leadership and his inspiration. He obviously cares. That  is why he is on the floor tonight.   I think that is the point that I want to make. It looks as if we are  lonely on this floor tonight. It looks as if we are in the eve of the  day's work. It looks as if we could be somewhere else.   I can tell you, being from a district in Houston that is surrounded  by universities, and I know that I will get someone in trouble for  trying to call the roll of the universities around the 18th  Congressional District, like the historic Texas Southern University,  University of Houston, University of St. Thomas, Houston Baptist  University, Lone Star College, Houston Community College, and San  Jacinto College. I know someone is texting me right now. But I am full  of college students, all of them working very hard.    I thought I would bring to the floor today the Constitution. I love  the words of the Declaration of Independence, the opening words, that  we are all created equal with certain inalienable rights of life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Does that mean the students that are right now struggling to make  ends meet--I think of that famous noodle meal that they eat because  they just don't have the money to survive--does that mean that one  person, that is still the first person to go to college, in 2021, the  single mother that has made it to 20-something hours, has to drop out?   America has always said that the American Dream is defined singularly  by your presence here in the United States. Yet, we are finding that  State and Federal policymakers are ignoring the $1,730,000,000 plus of  national student debt and that one-sixth of the American people,  47,900,000, about that number, are indebted to student debt. That is  why we are here on the floor today, recognizing that it also is an  imbalance.                                time  1930    I thank Mr. Bowman, an educator, who has seen little babies grow up  with little stars in their eyes. They can play a piano or they can play  an instrument or he sees them playing on the field of recreation, and  they are little scientists, scholars, but yet the hopes and dreams of  the opportunity is somewhat denied.   Black families must take on more debt for the same degree as White  students and often need to get several degrees in order to be in the  middle class. The burden of student debt reaches deep into communities  of color. Increasing evidence suggests that it is hampering the ability  to build wealth.   One of the reasons my good friend and myself are also interested in  the idea of the commission to study slavery and develop reparation  proposals is to get a roadmap of some of the populations that are  impacted negatively by student debt.   Default and delinquency rates on student loans remain appallingly  high. 3.6 million students are in the State of Texas. The Nation  carries $1.7 trillion debt, and we know that 79 percent of Black  students had student loan debt by their fourth year. We know it impacts  our Latinx families and families that come from rural communities. We  are concerned about them.   I hold in my hand the Constitution, as I said. I don't know how many  students have time to even look in that direction, but I will tell them  that the Founding Fathers, although not perfect, said that they came  together to create a more perfect Union.   And what does that mean? I think it means, give us hope, give us a  lifeline, let us breathe, and let us be able to buy the things that  will help our families. Let us not, as a Black male borrower, default  on loans within 12 years of beginning school.   This, of course, covers the gamut of all of America. It is not just  the issue of people of color. It impacts older borrowers, 60 and older,  whose numbers swelled from 700,000 in 2005 to 2.8 million in 2018.  Their debt load was $8.2 billion. Can you imagine being 60 and older  and still paying debt?   I came here to the floor tonight because I have wanted to join the  gentleman for people to see that in spite of the fact that we are here  at a moment  [[Page H6901]]  into the evening, we care about getting this done. It must be the  Congress and the administration that takes ahold of this and determines  that people who are now struggling to pay mortgages, to survive, to  feed children, we hope the Build Back Better bill will be a lifeline,  but right now we have got to deal with people who wanted to do right  and are suffering.   I want to close on this note: To create a more perfect Union, the  Constitution guarantees me that. The Declaration of Independence says  that this Nation was created to ensure the inalienable rights of life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   And I want to say to those who have gained student debt but never  completed their degree, they are not in any way bad people, defaulters,  deadbeats; no, they are not. The Constitution applies to all. But they  are people who are working in jobs just to survive. They wanted to  finish school, but they were so overloaded; maybe they had to leave to  take care of a sick mother or a sick father or maybe they had to leave  to take care of younger brothers and sisters. I know those stories. But  maybe they are now back in school struggling to just try to get that  degree.   Let's give them hope. Let's give them dignity. Let's help them with  that default and turn it into success. Let's join in--Congressman,  thank you--to cancel student loan debt. And we are not frivolous, big  spenders. We are trying to put people on the right track so that they  can contribute to this great economy and be givers, givers for what is  good in America. I hope we can get the job done.
