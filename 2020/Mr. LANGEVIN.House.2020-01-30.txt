 Madam Speaker, this week we commemorate the 75th  anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and honor Holocaust  survivors and those who lost their lives during this terrible period of  history. Horrible atrocities were visited upon millions of innocent  souls, driven by fear, hatred and oppression.   Seventy-five years later, as anti-Semitism, racism, and other forms  of bigotry continue to plague our society, we are reminded that we  cannot be silent in the face of intolerance or discrimination.   Earlier this week, I was proud to support the Never Again Education  Act, which will help educate the next generation about the genocide  that occurred during the Holocaust and the dangers of allowing hatred  to go unchallenged.   As we reflect on this moment in history, let us set an example by  condemning senseless acts of aggression and intolerance and, instead,  encouraging equality and inclusion and honoring our enduring pledge:  ``Never Again.''                            ____________________
