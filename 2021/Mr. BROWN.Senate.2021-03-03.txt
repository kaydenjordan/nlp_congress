 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Thank you, Madam President. This week, we have an  opportunity to finally deliver for millions of retirees and workers and  small businesses by saving America's pensions. The multiemployer  pension system is on the verge of collapse, threatening the livelihoods  of more than a million Americans and thousands of small businesses from  New Hampshire to Ohio, across the country. This affects more than  100,000 workers and retirees in my State alone and millions more around  the country. These pension plans were in danger before. Now the  economic emergency we are in has accelerated the crisis even further.   Multiemployer pension plans receive contributions based on the hours  worked. As workers have been laid off during the pandemic, their  employers no longer contribute to the pension plans, while current  retirees continue receiving their earned benefits, making the plan even  more likely to fail. And if that happens, it won't just be retirees  feeling the pain.   Current workers will be stuck paying into pension funds for benefits  they will never receive. Small businesses will be left drowning in  pension liability they can't afford to pay. Small businesses that have  been in the family for generations could face bankruptcy, and workers  will lose jobs in businesses which have been forced to close up shop.  The effect will ripple across the entire economy at a time when we can  least afford it.   The Chamber of Commerce has said:         The multiemployer pension system is an integral part of       [our] economy.    It is not only union businesses that participate in these plans that  will close their doors. This will devastate small communities across  the industrial heartland. Small businesses in these communities are  already hurting because of the virus. That is why we have to get this  done.   After a lifetime of hard work and service to our country, these  workers and retirees have already waited far too long for Congress to  do the job we should have done. We have been trying to solve this for  years. Unions, the Chamber of Commerce, small businesses pretty much  agree we need to get this done.   The House has done its part. They have passed a solution multiple  times. Every time it stopped because of Mitch McConnell and the U.S.  Senate. He has deliberately blocked it. We have continued to try. The  House does it year after year. People like the Presiding Officer and  others have fought for this in the Finance Committee, have fought for  this on the Senate floor, and we simply haven't been able to move it.   Now that Senator McConnell is out of the way, we can finally keep the  promise to these workers and their families. They spent years working  on assembly lines, bagging groceries, driving trucks, working to keep  our economy going, and money came out of every single one of their  paychecks to earn these pensions.   People in this town don't always understand the collective bargaining  process. People give up dollars at the bargaining table today for the  promise of a secure retirement with healthcare and a pension. That is  what collective bargaining is. Union workers sit down with each other  and their employer, talk about giving up wages. They are willing to  give up wages today to have a more secure future. What is more American  than that?   For years now, they have lived in fear of drastic cuts. One retiree  from Michigan told us he would lose two-thirds of his income and that  ``at 71 years old, there's no jobs out there that we could get to  recover what we'd lose.''   He said:         Pass the Butch Lewis Act so . . . we can take this weight       off of us, and retire with the dignity that we earned for 30,       40, 50 years of hard working labor.    It is always the same story. When Wall Street is in trouble, there is  a bailout. When corporations need something, the stock market is in  trouble, the Washington elite drop everything to help. But these  workers, they are not asking for a bailout; they are not asking for a  handout; they are just asking for what they earned.   These workers have been in the fight for years. Their activism has  gotten us this far. They have traveled all day and all night on buses.  They have rallied outside in the bitter cold, in the hot DC summer, all  trying to get people in this town to listen.   Let's finally deliver for them. Let's give them peace of mind. Let's  keep this promise. It comes back to the dignity of work. When work has  dignity, we honor the retirement security people earned. When work has  dignity, we honor their retirement security that they gave up at the  bargaining table in collective bargaining.   I urge my Republican colleagues in this body--colleagues with  healthcare and retirement plans paid for by taxpayers, including these  taxpayers that have been paying into their own pension funds for years.  I urge my Republican colleagues to think about these retired workers  and think about the small business owners. Companies like Smucker's-- there is a baker in Navarre, OH. Think of the candy company, Spangler,  in Bryan, OH--companies like that. Think about these retired workers.  Think about these small business owners and think about the stress they  are facing.   I have listened to my colleagues' speeches for years, extolling the  values of hard work and the virtue of small businesses. This is your  chance to live up to your own words, to show Americans if you work hard  all your life, your government will, in fact, be there for you.   Join us, and let's pass a solution that really indeed does honor the  dignity of work.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
