 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  man from my district whose legacy of serving his community will  continue to resonate for generations.   Last Monday, Jim Van Engelenhoven, a former Iowa State representative  from Mahaska County, passed away.   Jim began his career in public service by serving in Iowa's Air  National Guard. In 1993, Jim was elected to Mahaska County's Board of  Supervisors, where he served until 1998, and then began his run as an  Iowa State representative.   Jim was loved by many in the Mahaska County community and across the  State of Iowa for his compassion and his willingness to go the extra  mile to serve his community.   My heart and prayers go out to Jim's wife, Carol; his son, Jeff; and  the rest of his loved ones. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
