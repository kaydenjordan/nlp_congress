Mr. HOYER (during the reading). Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to dispense with the reading.    Madam Speaker, I move that the motion to postpone  consideration be tabled.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 214,  nays 196, not voting 19, as follows:                                [Roll No. 5]                                 YEAS--214       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Auchincloss      Axne      Barragan      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bourdeaux      Bowman      Boyle, Brendan F.

So the motion to table was agreed to.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.   Stated against:    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the time  allocated to me be controlled by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), the chairman of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I will continue to address my remarks to  you notwithstanding the fact that you ruled against me just a little  while ago on a vote, which excited some.   I am an institutionalist. I believe in this body, I believe in  democracy, and for your information, I believe in the free enterprise  system.   Madam Speaker, I listened to the remarks of the minority leader. I  listened to the outrage that he expresses. I share the view of the  Rules Committee chairman that he was a principal leader in the most  closed Congress in which I have served, which was, of course, presided  over by my Republican colleagues. He talked about free speech. Nothing  in this rule undermines the free speech of any Member in this House-- nothing.   When they had closed rules, I didn't get up and say: You are muzzling  my speech.   You muzzled my ability to make legislation, but you did not muzzle my  [[Page H31]]  speech. The First Amendment is sacrosanct, hopefully for everybody in  this body. But I will tell you I have been in this body when Republican  Members, Madam Speaker, rose to their feet demanding that people do  something in the galleries.   Madam Speaker, I am going to show hypocrisy--not from me. The  gentleman, the chairman of the Rules Committee, Madam Speaker,  mentioned that the minority leader mentioned hypocrisy. I presume his  assertion was that somehow we were being hypocritical. I intend to  speak a little bit of time and I intend to show hypocrisy.   First of all, the gentleman is wrong in his facts. The motion to  recommit was taken from the British Parliament and was present at the  first Congress in 1789. Interestingly enough, the motion to recommit  was used to correct something that had not been included in the bill  and was considered a friendly amendment and remained that way for a  very, very long time.   In 1934, it was ruled that instructions in a motion which were  present from time to time was not necessary, and that is the way the  rule maintained essentially for the next 20 years--actually, excuse me,  60 years, until 1995.   The gentleman is correct. When the Republicans took office for the  first time in a very long time under the leadership of Newt Gingrich,  Madam Speaker, they changed the rule. They said that you have to have a  motion to instruct, as if they were giving us something, as if they  were giving us something. Remember that phrase because I am going to  show it meant nothing. It was an illusion. It was a pretense.   Madam Speaker, I am going to first go through, of 34 examples, about  10 of the examples of what our Republican friends, Madam Speaker, said  about the motion to recommit.   First of all, the minority leader--I read from the Wichita Eagle of  May 12, 2013: ``The political book on McCarthy is that he does a good  job at counting votes, of knowing where the 233 House of  Representatives Republicans are at any given time. He points out that  Republicans, unlike Democrats in a previous Congress, haven't lost  certain procedural votes''--procedural vote. Let me underline  procedural vote. Not substance of the First Amendment and not substance  of free speech. Procedural vote--``called a motion to recommit, that  are a test of floor control.''   That is what the minority leader was bragging about: floor control.  He was not in the minority at that point in time. He was in the  majority. I believe he was the whip.   A subsequent--or previous to the present minority leader, Eric Cantor  went on to amplify the Republican perspective on the motion to  recommit. Majority Leader Eric Cantor publicly went on the defensive  about an MTR, stating that the MTR was simply a gimmick. Eric Cantor,  the majority leader of the Republican Party in 2012.   Mr. Bishop, one of the ranking members, he is no longer here. He  left. He retired last year. Referring to an MTR, he said: ``Mr.  Speaker, this is a procedural motion.''   Madam Speaker, Mr. Bishop went on to say that it is just ``another  delay tactic.'' Just a delay tactic. He didn't say anything about the  First Amendment. He didn't say anything about substantive consequences  of the MTR. He said that it was a delaying tactic.   Referring to the MTR, Representative Conaway said: ``To come in here  now and pull this procedural trick. . . . When we are in the minority,  we do it.''   He is correct. When we are in the minority, we do it.   Madam Speaker, very frankly, I will tell you--and you can take my  words down for the future--if this never came back, ever, it wouldn't  bother me because it is a charade of substance. It is a pretense of  legislating.   Representative Goodlatte, who was then-chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, I believe, or at some subsequent point chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, said: ``This is simply a dilatory tactic. . . . `'   That is what the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--I am not sure  if he was at that point in time in 2015. I think he was.   Madam Speaker, a dilatory tactic is what the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee on the Republican side of the aisle called the MTR.  It ``seeks to distract from the urgent needs. . . . `'   Representative Lamborn said: ``Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit  is a procedural motion. . . . `'   Madam Speaker, I am sorry the Chamber is not full. It can't be full.  I would have liked to speak to all the Members of the Congress, and  they can judge on the hypocrisy of the arguments that are being made.   This motion to recommit is a procedural motion designed to slow down  consideration of this important bill. It is purely, purely procedural.  Not a little bit procedural and a little bit substantive; it is  purely procedural.    Representative Olson, in 2019, referring to it, said: ``It fits a  pattern of delay and obstruction that we simply can't afford.''   Hypocrisy. He didn't say anything about its having to do with free  speech. A motion that we were offering as an MTR that we thought, like  you think--excuse me, Madam Speaker, as the Republicans think, is a  gotcha amendment. It is politics on both sides. It is not substantive  and it is not about free speech. It is about politics and gotcha. Yes,  I am an institutionalist and, yes, I think we ought to not be doing  gotcha in a nonsubstantive way.   Madam Speaker, obviously, we disagree on issues. And when we offer an  issue and they don't vote for it, we think that is politically helpful  to us because we think it is for the people. They do the same thing and  they think it is for the people. So no party is free of its gotcha  actions. Mine is not, nor is theirs.   Representative Upton, one of the institutionalists in this body,  former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Republican from  the State of Michigan, being kind, as Fred Upton is kind, said: ``I  appreciate the motion to recommit, and I would just say to all my  colleagues: Our side certainly views that as a procedural issue, not a  real amendment.''   Madam Speaker, I would say to the ladies and gentlemen of the  Congress: Who is hypocritical? Who is hypocritical when their Member, a  valued senior chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, says that  this is a procedural issue, not a real amendment?   My goodness gracious, the Rules Committee is taking away not a real  amendment.   Isn't that horrific?   How could they do that, Madam Speaker, when the Republicans say that  it is not a real issue, it is not substantive, it is a gimmick, and it  is a delaying and obstruction tactic?   Now, let me say that the Republicans uniformly vote against the MTR.   Mr. Woodall was a member of the Rules Committee. He is no longer  here. He is from the State of Georgia. Mr. Woodall said, after being  here for about 10 years of the motion to recommit, that he was told by  the leadership when he started in this body that it is a procedural  motion aimed to obstruct and delay, we always vote ``no.''   Now, let me tell you, Madam Speaker, what they always vote ``no'' on.  On April 7, 2011, an MTR was offered, a motion to recommit that would  ensure that our troops would get paid. The Republicans defeated that  motion overwhelmingly. Only one person on the Republican side voted for  it, Walter Jones. He is no longer in the Congress. He was pretty  iconoclastic when he was here, and he did what he darn well pleased  irrespective of the directions of the leadership who said: Always vote  ``no'' on the MTR.   So what they are complaining about, Madam Speaker, is the preclusion  of doing something they always opposed. And, very frankly, when they  won those MTRs from time to time--very few--they then voted against the  bill. There was no substance.   A little while later, about a month later, the motion to recommit  that we offered ensured that our top priority in funding our  intelligence services is the campaign to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat  al-Qaida and affiliated organizations.   Raise your hand if you are opposed to that. Madam Speaker, not your  hand. But our colleagues ought to reflect on whether they are opposed  to that premise. Not a single Republican voted for that MTR--this  substantive assertion that our campaign and intelligence services ought  to be not disrupted in their fight against al-Qaida and affiliated  organizations.  [[Page H32]]    A short time later we offered another MTR. The motion to recommit  provides our troops with a $100 per month increase in combat pay.   As you sit in your chairs in this House, or you are watching these  proceedings on television, I want you to say to yourself: Am I against  $100 for our troops who are at risk?                                time  1345    Because if you are, voting against the MTR was justified. Every  Republican save--except--one more time--Walter Jones, voted against  that amendment, that substantive amendment that we are stealing away  from them, which they say we never vote for.   Madam Speaker, if Mr. McCarthy were here, I would ask him: Have you  ever voted for an MTR?   I ask him rhetorically. Perhaps, at some point in time, he will tell  us. Maybe he was against the substance of all of these amendments that  I am speaking about.   In 2012, the following year, the motion to recommit would prohibit  the issuance of leases to any entity that is in violation of the Iran  Sanctions Act or the Syrian Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty  Restoration Act.   Madam Speaker, not a single Republican voted for that amendment. The  substantive amendment that they are so aggrieved--and by the way,  energizing their party to be more partisan than they ought to be doing.  We ought to all praise   Don Young, the dean of the House. He served  here longer than anybody else. He said yesterday that we ought to come  together and reach out our hands to one another and make this place  work for the people.   Another motion to recommit would prohibit export of helium from the  Federal Helium Reserve to Iran, North Korea, and Syria.   Madam Speaker, not a single Republican voted for that MTR. Why?  Because it is procedural. It is a gimmick. It is obstructing. That is  what we are taking away that you are so aggrieved at.   Now, I have about 35 or 40 of these. The good news is, I am not going  to read them all. But in 2014, the motion to recommit would ensure that  the intelligence community continues to protect the United States--hear  me--from Chinese and other state-sponsored computer theft. I am sure  all of you will say, ``Well, I am against that. That is an awful thing  to do.'' But everyone on that side of the aisle in the Congress today  voted against that amendment. Our new Members didn't vote against it,  obviously, but people who were here, every Republican that was here,  voted ``no'' on protecting ourselves from the Chinese, the theft of our  computer technology.   Madam Speaker, the next year, 2015--and I am just taking a couple  from each year--the motion to recommit would deter terrorist  cyberattacks, homegrown terrorist attacks, and strengthen America's  cybersecurity by increasing prevention efforts to stop the recruitment  and travel of homegrown terrorists by ISIL, al-Qaida, and other  terrorist organizations.   Now, I know you are going to be shocked because you are probably  thinking, ``Oh, of course we voted for that.'' Not one. Not a single  Republican voted for that MTR.   So, this aggrieved rhetoric that we hear about taking something away,  the only thing being taken away is their gotcha opportunities and ours.   Now, in the majority, you don't have the motion to recommit. I get  that. But we may be in the minority at some point in time. Don't give  it back to us because it is a political game that undermines the  integrity of this institution, and it is covered as a gotcha game, for  the most part, by the press and media that knows what that is--a game.   Madam Speaker, in 2015, the motion to recommit would require the  Department of Homeland Security to prioritize protection and technical  assistance to stop cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, such as the  electric power grid and nuclear power plants.   By now, you know what I am going to say. Only one Republican voted  for that. It won't surprise you that it was Walter Jones because Walter  Jones really did treat it as a substantive piece of legislation.   But the party that is so aggrieved today instructs their Republican  freshmen and all of their Members: Vote ``no'' on the MTR.   Madam Speaker, I am available to yield to anybody who is going to  tell me that is not the truth. Nobody has propounded that question to  me.   In 2015, again, a month later, the motion to recommit would protect  troop pay, guaranteeing a pay increase of 2.3 percent for our  servicemembers and ensuring no lapse in troop pay in the event of a  government shutdown. And there was my friend, standing tall--Walter  Jones, alone but standing tall. Not a single other Republican voted for  that.   Just three left.   Madam Speaker, in 2017, I am bringing you up to date because this has  been a consistent pattern. This is not some ``one person said this; one  person said that.'' It is a consistent pattern of Republicans  dismissing the motion to recommit as not of substance, only a delay  tactic, a gimmick, if you will, according to Mr. Cantor.   The motion to recommit, in November 2017, to ensure rural communities  have adequate funding for educational services, conservation projects,  and fire prevention programs.   Madam Speaker, now, Walter Jones got a friend on this one, Rod Blum,  who is no longer here. And, tragically, Mr. Jones died too early. They  are not here, but they thought that was a good idea. No other  Republican thought that was a good idea.   In 2018, just 2 years ago, the motion to recommit would amend the  underlying bill to prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency from chartering a private plane or flying any class  above coach. That was because a couple of Secretaries clearly did not  meet their responsibilities to the American taxpayer in the  expenditures of moneys in their Departments.   Again, Mr. Blum and Mr. Jones thought that was a good idea, but the  Republican leadership had instructed them, you will recall, according  to Mr. Woodall, to vote ``no'' because this is just a delaying tactic.  This is just a game. Vote ``no.'' It is procedural. It is not  substance.   Lastly--and people are now saying amen--the motion to recommit would  ensure, in this case, that we would: protect students and children from  a person who has been convicted of a sex offense against a  minor; secondly, prevent domestic violence; thirdly, prevent rape or  sexual assault; or four, require criminal background checks for schools  or other employment.    Rod Blum and Walter Jones stayed true to themselves and did not  follow the instruction: This is a game. This is an obstruction. This is  a gimmick. This is a way to delay and defeat.   Madam Speaker, I have taken some time to discuss this because I don't  like hypocrisy. I don't like wasting time. I don't like not respecting  one another and playing a gotcha game to see if you guys are afraid of  this amendment. And then when we adopt the amendment, if we adopt, a  very few--vote against the bill because, after all, it was just a  political game. We don't like the bill, no matter what you have in it.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule. Madam Speaker,  the people who are watching this debate may not have the knowledge that  all of us have. Almost invariably--almost invariably--this is a  partisan vote. The Republicans will vote against our rule, and we will  vote against their rule. And, invariably, we will find some problem  with it that we can rationalize our vote on.   Madam Speaker, I regret that we are starting this Congress--and I am  going to look at Mr. Ryan's speech. I am going to look at Mr. Hastert's  speech on the opening day. I am going to look at all the Speakers with  whom I have served and see what their comments were on the opening day.   I regretted the minority leader's opening statement. I regretted it  because, as   Don Young said, we need to come together. We are at a  time of pandemic. We are at a time of economic distress. We ought to be  acting not for ourselves, not for our politics, but for our people.   Madam Speaker, I would urge every Member to vote for this rule. And  as they do so, be assured they are not denigrating or denying anybody's  free speech any more than the Republicans denied free speech in the  most closed Congress in our history just a few years ago.  [[Page H33]]         Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during the  117th Congress, the Speaker, majority leader, and minority leader be  authorized to accept resignations and to make appointments authorized  by law or by the House.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during the  117th Congress, all Members be permitted to extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material within the permitted limit in that section  of the Record entitled ``Extensions of Remarks.''    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during the  first session of the 117th Congress:   (1) on legislative days of Monday or Tuesday when the House convenes  pursuant to House Resolution 11, the House shall convene 2 hours  earlier than the time otherwise established by the resolution for the  purpose of conducting morning-hour debate;   (2) on legislative days of Wednesday or Thursday when the House  convenes pursuant to House Resolution 11, the House shall convene 2  hours earlier than the time otherwise established by the resolution for  the purpose of conducting morning-hour debate;   (3) when the House convenes pursuant to an order other than House  Resolution 11, the House shall convene for the purpose of conducting  morning-hour debate only as prescribed by such order;   (4) the time for morning-hour debate shall be allocated equally  between the parties and may not continue beyond 10 minutes before the  hour appointed for the resumption of the session of the House; and   (5) the form of proceeding for morning-hour debate shall be as  follows:   (a) the prayer by the Chaplain, the approval of the Journal, and the  Pledge of Allegiance to the flag shall be postponed until resumption of  the session of the House;   (b) initial and subsequent recognitions for debate shall alternate  between the parties;   (c) recognition shall be conferred by the Speaker only pursuant to  lists submitted by the majority leader and by the minority leader;   (d) no Member may address the House for longer than 5 minutes, except  the majority leader, the minority leader, or the minority whip;   (e) no legislative business shall be in order except the filing of  privileged reports; and   (f) following morning-hour debate, the Chair shall declare a recess  pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I until the time appointed for the  resumption of the session of the House; and   (6) the Speaker may dispense with morning-hour debate upon receipt of  a notification described in clause 12(c) of rule I, or upon a change in  reconvening pursuant to clause 12(e) of rule I, and notify Members  accordingly.
