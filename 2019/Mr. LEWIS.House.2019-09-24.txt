 Mr. Speaker, today I come with a heavy heart, deeply  concerned about the future of our democracy, and I am not alone.   People approach me everywhere I go, whether I am traveling back and  forth to Atlanta or around our country. They believe, they truly  believe, that our Nation is descending into darkness.   They never dreamed that the United States, once seen as a beacon of  hope and as an inspiration to people striving for equality and justice,  would be falling into such disgrace. I share their concerns for the  future of our country.   It keeps me up at night. We took an oath to protect this Nation  against all domestic enemies and foreign enemies.   Sometimes I am afraid to go to sleep for fear that I will wake up and  our democracy will be gone and never return.   At every turn, this administration demonstrates complete disdain and  disregard for ethics, for the law, and for the Constitution.   They have lied under oath. They refuse to account for their actions  and appear before legislative bodies who have the constitutional right  to inquire about their activities.   The people have a right to inquire, they have a right to know.   The people have a right to know whether they can put their faith and  trust in the outcome of our elections.   They have a right to know whether the cornerstone of our democracy  was undermined by people sitting in the White House today.   They have a right to know whether a foreign power was asked to  intervene in the 2020 election.   They have a right to know whether the President is using his office  to line his pockets.   Mr. Speaker, the people of this Nation realize that if they had  committed even half of these possible violations, the Federal  Government would be swift to seek justice.   We cannot delay. We must not wait. Now is the time to act.   I have been patient while we tried every other path and used every  other tool.   We will never find the truth unless we use the power given to the  House of Representatives, and the House alone, to begin an official  investigation as dictated by the Constitution.   The future of our democracy is at stake. There comes a time when you  have to be moved by the spirit of history to take action to protect and  preserve the integrity of our Nation.   I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings  against this President has come.   To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our  democracy.                            ____________________
