 Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Florida for  yielding and congratulate him on the success of this launch in Florida.  As he said, it is a huge boost, if you will, for the space industry in  his State and a huge advantage for our country. It is a really amazing  technological feat that I think will be positive.                        Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling    Mr. President, I rise just for a few minutes to talk about the  decision to allow drilling for oil and gas off of our coasts. This is a  very consequential and serious decision involving important policy  questions, and it has important implications for all of the coastal  States and indeed for our country.   My concern, to echo some of the comments that have already been made,  is that there was very little, if any, consultation with the interested  parties along our coastal States. In Maine--which, by the way,  according to geographers I have talked to, has the longest coast of any  State in the country; I am sure I will get some debate about that from  some of my colleagues--we depend upon our coast. Tourism and visitation  to our beaches and coastal communities are a billion-dollar industry-- the largest single employer in our State. So that is an enormous  economic engine that is currently working and running and powering at  least a portion of the economy of our State. Of course, on my tie, I  have lobsters, which is a $1.7 billion-a-year industry in Maine, and it  promises to be even stronger as processing is developed. We also have  an offshore fishing industry--shrimp, shellfish. It is enormously  important. It is a part of who we are in the State of Maine.   In my view, this is a pretty straightforward decision. What are the  benefits, and what are the costs? The benefits are speculative at best,  limited at best, and the costs are immediate and an enormous challenge  for us. The cost of a single incident along our coast, which would  affect our lobster industry or our visitor industry in the summertime  and in the spring and the fall, would be catastrophic for our State.   I hope that the Department of the Interior will back off and enter  into a process by which they make this decision by talking to the  people who are most directly involved. I think this is a very important  issue for all of the coastal States, and some may say that this could  be advantageous to us. But let's get the facts, let's get the data, and  let's understand the upside and the downside.   The entire Maine congressional delegation, nonpartisan--that is, a  Democrat, an Independent, and two Republicans--came out against this  designation within hours of its having been made. This is one where I  think the people of our State, through their  [[Page S634]]  elected representatives, need to be heard.   I hope that the Department of the Interior will back away from this  unilateral decision, make it in a much more considered way, listen to  the residents, the industries, and the businesses that are affected by  a decision like this, and let our States have the important role that  they should play in a decision of this magnitude, affecting their  citizens.   As I said, I think this is an important decision. It deserves much  deeper consideration, and I believe the people of Maine will very  promptly say that this isn't something we are willing to support.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.
