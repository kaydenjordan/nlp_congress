 Madam President, yesterday, we had a series of  successful votes to move forward on the Great American Outdoors Act. I  am excited with the votes we have taken last week and the votes last  night and that we will finally move to passage of the legislation, the  Great American Outdoors Act, tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.   We had the opportunity over the last several weeks--last week, in  particular--to talk about what it means for every State in the country,  what it means for every county in the country, and the significant  opportunity for conservation, which is the crown jewel of conservation  programs and, of course, our national parks. It is not just national  parks, of course. It is our forests, and it is our BLM grounds and the  efforts we have with the Bureau of Indian Education.   I thought I would talk specifically about some Colorado projects  today and what the Land and Water Conservation Fund has meant for  Colorado.   This is a photo of Wilson Peak in Colorado. It rises over Telluride  in southwest Colorado. Wilson Peak is one of the 54 mountains in  Colorado that top 14,000 feet. Climbers and hikers eager to summit the  14,500-foot peak, located in the Lizard Head Wilderness, have been  frustrated for years by key land access routes being blocked, which  made it impossible to get to. In addition, Wilson Peak long remained  the last ``fourteener'' in Colorado without public access.   Through 9 years, very complex land exchange negotiations, and work to  assemble suitable exchange properties and funding, the Trust for Public  Land purchased 25 patented mining claims, including the summit and key  portions of the main summit trail from multiple private owners. In  2011, the Trust for Public Land formally transferred ownership of land  to the U.S. Forest Service, ensuring in perpetuity the public access to  Wilson Peak summit.   If you go to the next one, this is a photograph of the Big Thompson  River. In 1976, rains began to pour near Estes Park, CO, and caused one  of the biggest natural disasters in Colorado's history. A remarkable 12  inches of rain fell in about 4 hours. As a reminder, there are areas of  Colorado that only get about 14 inches of moisture a year. A remarkable  12 inches of rain fell in about 4 hours, bringing the Big Thompson  River to 19 feet above its normal level, and sending 31,000 cubic feet  per second of water racing downstream, down the canyon, carrying with  it everything and anything in its path. The flood claimed 145 lives,  418 homes, 52 businesses, and caused millions and millions of dollars  of damage in 1976.   In the aftermath of the disaster, Larimer County recognized that  simply rebuilding new homes in harm's way within the floodway didn't  make sense. The county turned to the Land and Water Conservation Fund  as an important part of the solution. With just over $1 million from  Land and Water Conservation Fund and some other matching resources, the  county acquired a number of properties along the Big Thompson River,  which provided  [[Page S2995]]  new outdoor recreation opportunities to residents and visitors on 156  acres of land along the river, highlighted by four new county parks.  This has been an incredible recreation opportunity, but it has  certainly led to greater safety for Coloradans.   The Blanca Wetlands Area of Critical Environmental Concern is another  incredible area of Colorado. The Bureau of Land Management has  benefited. After decades of water overappropriation caused the lowering  of the valley's water table, the rapid disappearance of wetlands and  plummeting bird population, State and Federal agencies initiated the  Wetland Restoration Effort in the 1960s, including this wetlands area.  You can see the work we have done with the Land and Water Conservation  Fund on this.   Red Mountain Pass is another example. It is a multiphased project  completed by the Trust for Public Lands and Colorado Partners with  funding from the LWCF. It is a scenic property lying above the town of  Ouray that forms portions of the panoramic backdrop used by motorists  from Highway 550's Red Mountain Pass and on Ouray and San Juan  Counties' rugged alpine loops. It is an incredible experience. You can  see the work we have done with it here.   If you go to the Uncompahgre National Forest, over the years, LWCF  has invested nearly $27 million into the Uncompahgre[-]San Juan  National Forest of Colorado to protect this valley, which is a 10-year- long process that ultimately resulted in the conservation of thousands  of acres surrounding the town. It is incredible for recreation and  preservation--this critical habitat and environmental treasure and  conservation accomplishment for all of the country.   I also want to point out some of the great news about this bill back  in Colorado.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record this article from the Durango Herald, which was written on June  13, and an article from the Denver Post, dated June 9, 2020   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Durango Herald, June 13, 2020]           `Holy Grail' Conservation Bill Advances in U.S. Senate                             (By Jacob Wallace)         A new bill funding maintenance and improvement projects for       public lands is gaining steam in the U.S. Senate.        The Great American Outdoors Act would permanently fund the       Land and Water Conservation Fund, a trust set up by the U.S.       government to pay for park maintenance projects, and       establish a consistent source of revenue for park       conservation that would reduce years of maintenance backlog       throughout public lands.        The bill, spearheaded by Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and       Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., passed on an 80-17 vote Monday,       allowing it to proceed to floor debate in the Senate.        ``This is a historic opportunity for us, in a bipartisan       fashion, to pass the most significant conservation measure in       over 50 years,'' Gardner said.        More than 800 conservation and outdoor recreation groups       have signed on to a letter published in March supporting the       bill, arguing that it was a permanent fix to a long-neglected       issue. The Outdoor Alliance, one of the nonprofit       organizations that signed the letter, pushed to expand the       legislation to include the Bureau of Land Management and       other public agencies in addition to the National Park       Service.        ``This is definitely the biggest investment in parks and       public lands that we've seen in years, in decades,'' said       Tania Lown-Hecht, spokeswoman for the Outdoor Alliance.       ``This is not to be underestimated.''        If passed, the bill would mandate $1.9 billion in money       raised from offshore oil and gas leases, and other energy       projects would go toward outdoor maintenance and recreation       projects through 2025. It would also fully fund the about       $900 million budget of the LWCF, with the money split between       the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Fish and       Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of       Indian Education, with the bulk of the money going to       national parks.        Lown-Hecht and others have been making the pitch that       conservation spending is a strong job creator: One study       found that every $1 million spent on the LWCF could support       between 16.8 and 30.8 jobs.        ``It will put people to work in public lands, and that's an       investment that will bring back more than a dollar for every       dollar spent,'' Lown-Hecht said.        The LWCF was created in 1964 and was based on the idea that       the depletion of one natural resource, offshore oil and gas,       should be offset by the care of other natural resources       protected as parks.        Since that time, however, Congress has often failed to       appropriate the full amount of money that the fund could have       received each year, creating a logjam of maintenance projects       in national parks across the country that have totaled to       more than $30 billion in deferred maintenance, according to       the fund's own account.        The bill gained momentum after Sens. Gardner and Steve       Daines, R-Mont., visited the White House in March to convince       President Donald Trump to support the bill. Since then, the       bill has earned the attention of Senate Majority Leader Mitch       McConnell as well as other Republican senators eager to       support a bipartisan bill during an election year.        Gardner also noted that the timing of the bill is       especially prescient as rural communities in Southwest       Colorado and elsewhere have been hard hit by a drop in       tourism and job losses during the pandemic. Advocates agree,       arguing park projects could be part of a broader plan for       recovery.        ``We see this as a way to not only address the maintenance       backlog on these lands but to put jobs on the ground for       people where they've lost them,'' said Tom Cors, policy       director for The Nature Conservancy.        The Senate will continue to debate the bill throughout the       week. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., has also announced his       support of the bill. If it passes, the House of       Representatives will then have the option to vote on an       identical companion bill introduced last week.        Cors is cautiously optimistic about the bill's chances,       saying it is a conservation win 55 years in the making.        ``We've been working on this for years and years and this       is the holy grail of the conservation community,'' Cors said.       ``We're ecstatic that this is happening''                                   ____                     [From the Denver Post, June 9, 2020]   With Cory Gardner Leading the Charge, Senate Takes Up Great American                                Outdoors Act                             (By Bruce Finley)         Colorado senators are leading a congressional push to pass       landmark conservation legislation that would deploy $9.5       billion to maintain overrun national parks and permanently       direct $900 million a year for outdoor recreation on public       lands.        President Donald Trump has said he will sign this Great       American Outdoors Act if lawmakers get it to his desk.       Senators this week took up the issue, aiming for a vote next       Tuesday, and around 200 House members have said they'll       support similar legislation.        Conservationists for decades have prioritized these       measures as crucial steps to ensure healthy public lands,       increasingly seen as essential for a booming recreation       industry that has become an economic mainstay, especially in       Colorado and the West.        Congress has failed to provide the full $900 million a year       for land acquisition and other spending that the 1965 Land       and Water Conservation Act requires. Lawmakers have approved       spending between $255 million and $450 million a year since       2008 and only twice in 55 years provided the full $900       million.        National Park Service officials have estimated deferred       maintenance as land and facilities deteriorate will cost more       than $20 billion.        ``We've been trying for decades to get this done. Now we       have an historic window to actually achieve it. This is a       moment where we need to capitalize to get this great       achievement accomplished,'' Sen. Cory Gardner said in an       interview Tuesday.        On March 3, Gardner, of Yuma, went to the White House and,       in a discussion with Trump, showed a photo he'd taken on his       iPhone of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in       Colorado. Trump said it was beautiful. Gardner also said he       pointed to a portrait of President Teddy Roosevelt, a leading       conservationist, in suggesting that Trump support could lead       to a major achievement. He said Trump gazed up at the       portrait and said he would sign the legislation.        Sen. Michael Bennet of Denver is one of some 60 Senate       sponsors of the Great American Outdoors Act but is proposing       amending it to include the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and       Economy (CORE) Act, which would protect about 400,000 acres       of public land in Colorado, establishing new wilderness and       recreation opportunities.         ``This week, we have an opportunity to secure new       protections for public lands in Colorado that were left out       of the public lands bill Congress passed last year,'' Bennet       said, urging colleagues to incorporate the CORE Act ``or to       quickly pass'' it on its own.        Gardner said, regarding the amendment, that Bennet ``may       try to get a vote on that. That is his bill. The GAOA       certainly will help the CORE Act.''        A June 3 letter to congressional leaders from six former       Department of Interior secretaries, including Ken Salazar       (2009-2013) and Gale Norton (2001-2006) of Colorado, urged       swift passage of the GAOA ``without any amendments.''        This push to provide permanent full funding for the Land       and Water Conservation Fund and step up public lands       maintenance reflects years of wrangling in Congress to       support outdoors recreation on public land.        The Land and Water Conservation Act, passed in 1965, says       money should go to federal agencies to acquire land and to       states for acquisition of land and waters and to develop       recreation facilities.  [[Page S2996]]         The Great American Outdoors Act combines two previous bills       that each had strong majority bipartisan support. One part       would provide full and permanent funding of $900 million each       year, the amount the fund is authorized to receive, from       offshore oil and gas revenues--not tax dollars. The other       aims for parks restoration by investing $1.9 billion annually       for the next five years to maintain land managed by the       National Park Service, Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife       Service, Bureau of Indian Education and Bureau of Land       Management.        Conservation groups have welcomed the bill.        ``This will be a remarkable gift for the future and also is       important for the present. It's going to put up to 100,000       people to work each year fixing our national parks,'' said       Tracy Stone-Manning, associate vice president for public       lands at the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation       group with 6 million members.        Beyond national parks and forests, the congressional       spending each year could help cities such as Denver and       Missoula, where urban voters are pushing leaders to acquire       more land for parks and other open space.        ``Our parks and open space set-asides need to grow with our       population. We've seen, during the pandemic, the importance       of the ability to be safely outside in parks,'' Stone-Manning       said.        ``Denver could identify property that is worth acquiring       and use Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars to help       acquire it,'' she said. ``Humans have to have access to       nature for our health, and we have a long-term need to       protect our larger landscapes.''     Madam President, this article is entitled the `` `Holy  Grail' conservation bill advances in U.S. Senate.'' If you take a look  at the article, it quotes conservationists and people across the  country who are working on the legislation, and it ends with this:         ``We've been working on this for years and years and this       is the holy grail of conservation community,'' Cors said.       We're ecstatic that this is happening.    That is from a member of the Nature Conservancy.   The article from the Denver Post talks about the legislation and,  again, the conservation community that supports the legislation.         ``This will be a remarkable gift for the future and also is       important for the present. It's going to put up to 100,000       people to work each year fixing our national parks,'' said       Tracy-Stone Manning, associate vice president for public       lands at the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation       group with 6 million members.    It goes on to point out ``cities such as Denver and Missoula, where  urban voters are pushing leaders to acquire more land for parks and  other open space.''   This is an opportunity for us to achieve those goals in our urban  areas.   Finally, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in  the Record a letter from a number of Coloradans in support of the Great  American Outdoors Act sent to Congress a few weeks ago   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Dear Senators & Representatives: As Colorado-based       businesses and organizations, we urge you to support our       state's great outdoors through full funding of the Land and       Water Conservation Fund LWCF. We ask that you lend your       full support to passing the Land and Water Conservation Fund       Permanent Funding Act, so that our nation's most successful       conservation program can continue its long track record of       success.        LWCF is built on a simple idea: that a portion of offshore       drilling fees should be used to protect important land and       water for all Americans. Through its over 50-year history,       LWCF has invested more than $278 million in Colorado's public       lands and outdoor recreation. Funds have gone toward public       lands including Colorado crown jewels like the Black Canyon       of the Gunnison and Rocky Mountain National Parks, toward       healthy working forests through the public-private       partnerships of the Forest Legacy Program, and toward local       parks and trail projects in communities across the state.        These investments not only benefit the public lands and       outdoor opportunities that are a valued part of our Colorado       way of life, but also promote tourism and the outdoor       recreation industry which are among our state's most       important economic drivers. The Outdoor Industry Association       reports that active outdoor recreation in Colorado generates       $28 billion in consumer spending, supporting 229,000 Colorado       jobs. Our great outdoors isn't just good fun--it's good       business.        Congress last year passed permanent reauthorization of the       LWCF; now it is time to ensure that it is fully funded now       and into the future. Please support passage of the Land and       Water Conservation Fund Permanent Funding Act, to benefit       Colorado's vital outdoor recreation economy and the quality       of life we enjoy as Coloradans.

Madam President, this is signed by David Nickum,  executive director of Colorado Trout Unlimited; Suzanne O'Neill,  executive director of Colorado Wildlife Federation; and Colorado  Mountain Club, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, Odell Brewing Company in  Fort Collins, on and on, talking about the LWCF being built on a simple  idea and the fact that we can help restore our national parks and our  greatest treasures with the combined efforts of the Land and Water  Conservation Fund and the Great American Outdoors Act in this  legislation.   As Members prepare for this vote tomorrow, I hope they will consider  the impact this will have on generations to come.   Yesterday, we talked about a letter written by the great-grandson of  President Teddy Roosevelt. The fact that we are continuing today that  legacy to build on the conservation and the environmental successes  that started well over 100 years ago in this country and our public  lands is an incredible treasure that this country has and that we can  build on for generations to come.   I yield the floor.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
