 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Today I hope my colleagues will join me in standing in  solidarity with thousands of UAW workers in Ohio and around the  country. Workers are going without their paychecks today because they  are demanding General Motors respect the work they do which has made  this company so successful.   All workers have the right to stand up for fair pay and benefits, for  better working conditions, and for a voice in their company. Let's be  clear. The autoworkers, shall we say, are the engine behind GM's  success. GM wouldn't be making a dime of profit without the workers who  actually make their cars and trucks. Autoworkers stood up and made  sacrifices to help GM when times were tough.   The Presiding Officer was a Member of the House then, and I was a  Member of the Senate. We saw what happened during the rescue of the  auto industry and how much those workers gave up to save this industry.  We remember the depths of the recession. We remember when President  Obama took office as 800,000 were losing their jobs the first month and  700,000 the second month until, with the auto rescue, House Democrats,  with President Obama, turned this economy around. We have seen,  literally, economic growth each quarter over the last 10 years. This  was, in large part, because so many workers, like the UAW workers, were  willing to give up something at the bargaining table.   In some cases, clearly, some people in this town wanted to abandon  that company. Now that times are better, all the workers are asking for  is their fair share. So far, GM has not treated these workers as the  critical partners they are in our auto industry.   Look at what GM has done in my State. Look at what they did in  Lordstown, OH. The company shut down its most productive plant in North  America, by GM's own measurements. The Lordstown plant near Youngstown,  OH, as recently as 2\1/2\ years ago--back during the Obama  administration--had 4,500 workers working there. Even though President  Trump said: Don't sell your homes; these jobs are coming back, they  have been laid off--hundreds of workers, 4,500 over the last couple  years. At the same time, GM announced they were going to build the  Chevy Blazer in Mexico.   GM could retool that Lordstown plant, and they could build the Blazer  in Ohio. They could put some of their electric vehicles in the  Lordstown plant in Ohio. We know they have plenty of money to work  with. They earned higher than expected profits in the first quarter of  this year. President Trump's tax cuts for the rich gave huge amounts of  tax breaks to General Motors. Much of the money went to General Motors'  executives. All these workers are asking for is to share in those  profits, have a voice in their company.   GM made the decision to close Lordstown and other plants around the  country with no input from the workers who earned those profits for  that company. Now workers are standing up and fighting for increased  investments in their local communities.   I spoke this week with Gary Jones, the international president of the  United Auto Workers, about Lordstown and bringing these jobs back. That  is what they are trying to win at the bargaining table.   We know strikes are always a last resort for workers. My wife grew up  in Ashtabula, OH. Her dad carried a union card, Utility Workers of  America. He did maintenance for that plant for more than 30 years.  Twice when she was growing up they went on strike. She knows, as  workers know, they never get back what they lose in a strike. So when  they strike, it is when their backs are against the wall. The wife of  one GM worker posted online this week: ``I can only pray this strike is  short.''   These workers want to do their jobs. They want to work. They don't  want to be on the picket line. They want to reach a solution that  honors their work.   GM needs to agree to a contract that honors the dignity of work and  recognizes autoworkers, the communities, and the families who are  affected by this and who helped drive the success of the auto industry  in Ohio and across the country.    Mr. President, I want to recognize the work that Professor  Peter B. Edelman, faculty director of the Center on Poverty and  Inequality at Georgetown University, has done and for his decades-long  career fighting for working families. Along with his equally if not  more impressive wife, Marian Wright Edelman, it is not an exaggeration  to say the two have improved the lives of millions of Americans.   A key figure in planning Senator Robert F. Kennedy's memorable tour  of the Mississippi Delta, Professor Edelman continues to help expose  the crippling poverty that still permeates through our country. His  books ``So Rich, So Poor: Why It's so Hard to End Poverty in America''  and ``Not a Crime to Be Poor. The Criminalization of Poverty in  America'' have been important in shaping my view on the lack of  economic mobility in America. A dedicated public servant who has worked  in various administrations and organizations, Professor Edelman has  been on the forefront of promoting and implementing social justice  policies.   While I recognize we live in a time where politicians and special  interests groups have tipped the scales in favor of corporations and  the wealthy, I am encouraged to know that Professor Edelman is  educating the next generation of anti-poverty advocates.   As the Coalition on Human Needs honors Professor Edelman as a  recipient of its 2019 Human Needs Hero award, I want to express my  thanks for his work as an advocate of working families. He has improved  countless lives, and his pragmatic yet principled approach serves as a  model for those pursuing social change now and for years to come. For  these reasons, it is my honor and privilege today to recognize the  achievements of Professor Peter B. Edelman.                            ____________________
