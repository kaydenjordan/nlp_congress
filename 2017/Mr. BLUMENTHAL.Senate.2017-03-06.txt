 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to be here with a number  of my colleagues to oppose H.J. Res. 37. As it has just been announced,  we will vote on it later today. I am glad to be joined by so many of my  colleagues to fight against efforts to limit the application of the  Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order.   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I fought to ensure that  harmful provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal  year 2017 seeking to limit the applicability of this Executive order to  DOD were stripped from the final bill signed into law in December, and  I continue to feel strongly that we must do everything possible to  defend American workers. That is what this issue concerns.   In 2014, President Obama issued a critical Executive order, the Fair  Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order. Then, last summer, after  thorough analysis and due diligence by the Department of Defense and  several other agencies, he implemented what is known as the fair pay  and safe workplaces rule. That rule requires companies doing business  with the Federal Government to disclose when they violate any of 14  laws. The list of laws include some that are very familiar to all of  us, like the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical  Leave Act, and the Civil Rights Act. This list includes some other laws  that may be somewhat more obscure, but those laws have been around for  decades. They are well known in the workplace, and they are designed to  protect  [[Page S1592]]  veterans, women, and people with disabilities from harmful,  debilitating discrimination.   There is no requirement that companies disclose trivial allegations;  rather, the rule requires disclosures of violations that rise to a  determination by a court or administrative body of an actual violation  or serious pending administrative proceeding by an agency. Companies  would know of such violations.   Most companies play by the rules; all they need to do is check a box  confirming they are in compliance. For those companies with compliance  issues, the contracting agency would take information about those  violations into consideration in the procurement process, and the  contracting agency would then try to work with the company to make sure  that it comes into compliance with the law. This Executive order is not  about exclusion or about blackballing; in fact, it is about including  and working with companies to bring them into compliance so they obey  the law, knowing what the rules are, and wanting everybody to play by  the same rules--not having an unfair advantage.   This rule is not about blackballing or blacklisting companies. It is  about ensuring that, if they want to do business with the Federal  Government, they follow the law and provide a safe and equitable  workplace, protecting American workers--veterans, women, and people  with disabilities--who may be victims of harmful, debilitating  discrimination.   The rule is an effort to make Federal resources go to companies that  are complying with the law or that are coming into compliance with  Federal law. The reason behind it is to protect American workers, but  it is also about creating a level playing field for all contractors and  making sure there is a relationship of trust with contractors because  we need partners who can be trusted to carry out the Federal  Government's important work, especially in the area of building our  defense weapons.   Companies that violate the law are creating an unlevel playing field,  forcing law-abiding companies into unfair competition, potentially  raising their costs. They skirt the law, saving dollars, presenting  low-ball offers, based on noncompliance, cutting corners by, in effect,  ducking their legal obligations. If they are hired, they are also at  risk of providing poor performance because a company that violates the  law and disregards its obligation is much more likely to disregard its  moral as well as its legal duties in complying with the contract.   It is not just about saving dollars. It is about workers. Every year,  tens of thousands of American workers are denied overtime wages, they  are unlawfully victims of discrimination in hiring and pay, they have  their health and safety put at risk by Federal contractors when they do  cut corners, or they are denied basic workplace protections. That is  another reason we need this rule, this Executive order, protecting  workers and creating a level playing field.   Some have called the fair pay rule one of the most important advances  for workers in years, and it is. According to one assessment, one in  five Americans are employed by companies that do business with the  Federal Government. Ensuring that those one in five workers are  protected helps countless Americans. It helps them in those workplaces,  and it also sets a model for workplaces elsewhere.   It is basic, simple transparency that enables the American people to  know who executive agencies task with the work, using taxpayer dollars.  So requiring companies to disclose--and this rule is about disclosure-- compliance records is something that many States, including  Connecticut, already have in place through responsible bidder programs  that use self-reporting to improve contractor quality by identifying  companies with records of violating workplace laws, among other things.   President Trump was rightly praised by many of my colleagues in  calling for a ``level playing field'' for businesses in his speech  before us, in Congress, last week, and he has been lauded for saying we  need to deliver ``better wages for Americans.'' Yet here we are, just  weeks into the administration and this new Congress, and we are seeing  what the real priorities unfortunately are. Once we put aside the  rhetoric, actions are what matter, and these actions truly demoralize  and destroy law-abiding companies' chances to compete fairly, and they  decimate rights of workers to safe and fair workplaces.    I am troubled that rolling back this Executive order which I fought  to achieve in the NDAA is so high a priority for the new administration  and my colleagues here. Many organizations opposed this effort, and I  am proud to join them in trying to forestall this rollback--the  Easterseals organization, Paralyzed Veterans of America, VetsFirst,  Vietnam Veterans of America, and many others who rightly fear that this  course of action will do damaging injustice to our veterans and  constituents with disabilities. It will also do potential damage to  countless other workers involved in doing the people's work, such as  performing contracts for the Federal Government funded with taxpayer  dollars--our dollars--that can be used in discriminatory and unfair  ways if this resolution is approved.   I urge my colleagues to vote against H.J. Res. 37 later today and  protect the fair pay and safe workplaces rule. For the sake of our  constituents--women, veterans, workers with disabilities, and  businesses of America--we must reject this assault on fairness and  common sense.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
