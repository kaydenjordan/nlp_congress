 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of 44th District  Court Judge Jamie Wittenberg, who passed away last winter after a  courageous 3-year battle with brain cancer. Elected in 2008, Jamie was  one of the youngest judges ever to be elected in Oakland County,  Michigan.   A Huntington Woods native and longtime Berkley resident, he attended  Indiana University before graduating  [[Page H2078]]  from Wayne State Law school where he was a two-time recipient of the  Leonard Gilman Scholarship. He served the State of Michigan honorably  as a prosecutor in both Wayne and Macomb Counties prior to his  election.   During his many years on the bench, Judge Wittenberg doubled the size  of the sobriety court and helped to establish a teen court, a diversion  program to help keep juveniles out of the judicial system and build  brighter futures.   His family's world was upended over 3 years ago when he was diagnosed  with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. No matter how  daunting a diagnosis, Judge Wittenberg never complained. He never  complained. He faced his cancer head-on by undergoing numerous  surgeries, radiation, and chemotherapy. He remained in a state of  ketosis. He far exceeded his original prognosis, handling a full court  docket the entire time.   Judge Wittenberg was a respected and admired jurist who was a fixture  of our southeast Oakland County community in Michigan. He was a mentor  to countless attorneys and respected by everyone who appeared before  him in court, no matter what side of the issue they were on. He will be  remembered as being deeply fair and compassionate.   He is missed in our community, and this month he would have  celebrated his 49th birthday. In addition to his beloved wife, Staci,  Judge Wittenberg is survived by his four incredible daughters, Arielle,  Talia, Brooke, and Maya, the lights of his life. He is survived by his  parents, Mollie and Howard; his sister, Jodie; and, of course, his  incredible brother, Robert Wittenberg who was sworn in by Judge  Wittenberg as the Oakland County treasurer in just 2021.   We know his memory will be a blessing. May his memory be a blessing,  and may we join together in this Chamber to continue to push for a  cure, to continue to push for investments in tackling the scourge that  is glioblastoma.                                time  1745                 Reflecting on State of U.S. Industrial Base     Mr. Speaker, I would like to shift focus. I rise in this  Congress reflecting on the state of the U.S. industrial base,  reflecting as a Member of Congress from Michigan, as a Member of  Congress who represents Oakland County, as a Member of Congress who  lives in Oakland County, as a Member of Congress who represents  Automation Alley, as someone who represents the largest concentration  of automotive suppliers and, certainly, some of our automotive  manufacturers, our original equipment manufacturers, as we like to call  them.   Nearly every week since I got elected to Congress, I participate in a  program. I call it ``Manufacturing Monday,'' and I visit our small  businesses, our small manufacturers, our mom-and-pop shops, often  passed down from parent to child; manufacturers who have been through a  whole lot; manufacturers who guided the passage of the USMCA, which was  done before COVID ever entered our lexicon, to give the North American  Continent a fair shot at competing, a framework to compete, a framework  to sell our goods internationally.   Export channels are phenomenal. They lead to revenues. They lead to  productivity. People want to buy American products throughout the  world. They recognize our flag. They recognize our craftsmanship.   Then, in no short order, after we passed USMCA, renegotiating NAFTA,  giving our manufacturers and our workers a leg up, of course, we were  disrupted. We were disrupted by a global pandemic.   In this very Chamber, as Members of Congress representing every ZIP  Code throughout this Nation gathered to vote, gathered to respond to  the charge of the time, people were tapping me on the shoulder. How are  you doing this in Michigan so well? How are you responding to these  supply chain disruptions? How do Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis,  otherwise sometimes known as Chrysler, know how to immediately act to  these supply chain disruptions, sourcing masks, producing ventilators,  finding out who has the specs and who doesn't?   We kept working. We kept making. We stood up and responded to the  industrial call to action of this very Nation, similar to how we did in  the World War II era. It is in our very blood.   By the way, Michiganders, we are a northern State. Spring hits later  than here in the mid-Atlantic, where the Nation's Capital resides. We  are full of grit. We are full of toughness. We have seen some tough  times, but we know how to rise through challenges and how to stick to  the knitting and stick to the good work, even when the times aren't  easy.   Mr. Speaker, we find ourselves in a very unique and interesting  moment, yet again on the springboard of the remarkable passage of the  CHIPS and Science Act that I was so proud to play a leading role in  passing as the vice chair last term of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee and the subcommittee chair for the Research and  Technology Subcommittee.   $52 billion for chips manufacturing is not a platitude. It is a real  investment in industrial policy in this Nation.   Why do we need to invest in chip manufacturing? We innovated the  microchip. We innovated the company called Intel. The late Gordon  Moore, who we recently said good-bye to within the last 6 weeks, I  believe, innovated that microchip alongside his fellow academics out in  the Western part of this Nation. At one point, we were making 40  percent of the chips, and then something happened. We got laissez- faire. We forgot about what it means to have an industrial base in this  country, taking it for granted.   Of course, Mr. Speaker, I served very proudly in the administration  of President Barack Obama when we were responding to the inherited  crisis of the Great Recession, working on what was known as the auto  rescue, the largest managed industrial bankruptcy in the history of  this Nation of General Motors and then Chrysler, at the time selling 8,  9 million cars globally a year. It is known as SAR, the indicator. It  was unfathomable where we would be 12 years later, a dozen years later,  at 16, 17 million SAR.   We were talking about semiconductors. We were focusing on  semiconductors. We were focusing on the minerals, not just the trade  relationships, but the need to double down on manufacturing policy in  the United States of America.   Some of you might know that President Obama created the White House  Office of Manufacturing Policy. He created what was then called the  National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, now known as  Manufacturing USA, about a dozen institutes in various research  concentrations that exist throughout this Nation.   One we boast about in Michigan is known as LIFT. We are very proud of  our friends at LIFT. It used to be focused very specifically on  lightweight materials. Now, they are in a variety of spaces and joined  with The Composites Institute doing R&D, doing workforce training,  smaller scale.   We must look bigger. I am on the select committee, very proudly,  serving under Chair   Mike Gallagher, also from the Midwest, from  Wisconsin, the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between  the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.   We are so dependent. We are so dependent on foreign markets. We want  to sell to those markets, but when the pandemic hit our shores and you  can't get the masks, and you can't get your manufacturing supply chains  going because you outsourced it all, it is a wake-up moment. It was a  major wake-up moment for microchips and semiconductors in the United  States of America.   All of a sudden, very brilliantly, this very body, our Chamber, the  House of Representatives, where all great ideas begin, we put forward a  bill in partnership with our colleagues in the other Chamber, the  Senate. It became the CHIPS and Science Act, $52 billion. We will talk  about the number.    Have we talked about what taxpayers spent, what is the return on that  investment? It is a $52 billion spend over half a decade. It was  already signed into law in August 2022. It has already begat $200  billion of private-sector investment.   This is absolutely remarkable and brilliant. We are seeing these  amazing microchip factories come into places across this country--Ohio,  Arizona. We have Hemlock in Michigan.   The challenge isn't over. We can't manufacture fast enough. It is not  a light switch, complex manufacturing.  [[Page H2079]]  Fabricators for chips can't get a hair strand caught in them. You must  suit up. You must be trained. You must be disciplined.   We are focused on the workforce consideration, which is why I was  delighted that my CHIPPING IN bill made it into the CHIPS and Science  Act--$25 million to the National Science Foundation to invest in the  workforce development and training for chips manufacturing.   This is cause for celebration. It is also cause for reflection  because this bill, in many respects, was a catch-up bill. We were  catching up to where we needed to be--40 percent of chips manufacturing  in the 1990s, down to 10, 12 percent in the 2020s.   The tide rolls out. Cars are sitting in parking lots.  Microelectronics industries are going haywire. Prices are going out of  control. Then, people are wondering about China and Taiwan, why we have  to get all of these chips from Taiwan, and what happens with the  national security ramifications of this.   We can't move fast enough. Now, as we are doing the work on the  competitiveness committee to lessen our reliance on the CCP and to  recognize that the American way of doing business, the Western way of  doing business through free markets in democratic nations, must  continue to succeed as we inch our way, not just into the quarter-21st  century, but the mid-21st century, which will be here before we know  it.   What is our charge? We understand the trade relationship. We  understand that, between 1985 and 2000, the U.S. trade deficit with  China grew steadily from $6 billion to $83 billion, a trade deficit.   The deficit ballooned after the Chinese Communist Party joined the  World Trade Organization in 2001. It is standing at a very  stratospheric level at $309 billion.   When we look specifically at key industries, we see it here as well.  I have already expounded on chips. We recognize there is still a  weakness. We can't move fast enough. This is a call to action.   I have briefly mentioned rare minerals, critical minerals. Somewhere  between 85 and 92 percent of the refining capacity is taking place in  China, taking place on behalf of the CCP.   We don't want to be overly reliant. We want to focus on our trade  relationships and our strategy.   I cannot tell you all the hundreds of manufacturing visits I have  made as a sitting Member of this Chamber, not going in with a fancy  podium, not going in with the press. I have two ears and a notepad and  a member from my team, and we are establishing relationships. So, we  are geeking out. It is great to see the equipment in action, but there  are supply chain vulnerabilities.   There are supply chain gaps. We have gone through this with  materials. Steel has gone haywire. We have tried to tariff. We are  still paying high prices. We are glad that U.S. Steel is making money,  finally.   Tariffs aren't going to be a comprehensive industrial policy for the  United States of America. We have to figure out how to strategically  invest.   We don't need to do it at the rate of our competitors who do  everything--well, the one competitor in this case, the CCP that is top  down. That is autocratic. That is state sponsored. We don't need to do  it like that. We need to bring the private sector along.   Sometimes, these key stakeholders are begging for the table of  collaboration. I saw this at the research institute that I worked in  about a decade ago that was a part of that national network for  manufacturing innovation, the Industrial Internet of Things, large data  stacks, bringing together competitor companies, research institutions,  and States to co-invest to get access to R&D.   We have to scale. That is what we have been doing. It is actually  quite amazing.   Now, we ask ourselves, what is next? How are we going to build  batteries in the United States of America?   A small startup in my district, located in Troy, Michigan, called  Intecells, absolutely brilliant, making the batteries to go into the  electric vehicle. Of course, that is what we mean now when we say  ``battery.'' We think of the electric vehicle, the sustainability  charge, absolutely brilliant.   Every Democrat in this Chamber, both House and Senate, joined  together toward the end of the last term to pass the Inflation  Reduction Act. Can you believe it?   If you looked to last century, well, my goodness, you would never see  the environmental groups and the automakers being on the same page, but  they were on the same page with this one--zero emissions, making the  sustainable vehicle.   We did the bipartisan infrastructure bill. See, those who sit on this  side of the Chamber can actually talk about our passage of the  legislation.   They do thank us a lot on the CCP committee for CHIPS and Science. It  was bipartisan, I will give you that, but we could have gotten more.                                time  1800    We didn't get any on IRA. We got a few on the Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law. I am always delighted when we can work together in  a bipartisan way, and I don't mock when we can't.   These are the things I am talking about that bring people together,  our House Manufacturing Caucus, with Mr. Joyce. We have a Democratic  task force that I run with Whip Clyburn on manufacturing: doing,  delivering, and setting us up for success.   Manufacturing is technology. Manufacturing is high-tech.  Manufacturing is software engineering. Manufacturing is computer  numerical controls machines and computer-aided design. We are doing 2D  and 3D, and we are doing the printing and all that other good stuff,  but we need to get access to the materials. We need to figure out why  we are behind on batteries and not blame each other and not blame the  manufacturers who just want to build this stuff here.   I want the jobs here. I want the union jobs here. I want the lithium  to come through good sources that we have access to, so we are not just  hanging around and waiting and hoping that this comes in. Hydrogen is  also a great opportunity for us.   But here is the deal, folks. Fighting each other isn't going to  change the reality that 80 percent of the manufacturing capacity of  those batteries is done in China. It is not. But Intecells, when I  first met with them several years ago, their CEO, Shawn, said to me:  Stevens, we have got to make this here. We have got to do this here. We  are losing this race.   Now, some of these whiz kids at Stanford University, that the  chairman of the committee brought us to, are working on technology  readiness. They are working on technology indicators.   Well, my automakers bring this to me: Who is doing what? Where are we  in the spectrum? Here is where the U.S. is with the EU and the CCP and  on.   We are also very excited and energized by our trade partnership with  India and what that might mean, democracies working together. I happen  to represent a very large concentration of Indian Americans who came to  this Nation by Ford, primarily, to engineer and help work on the autos.   This is exciting. Let's continue to bring in high-skilled talent. Mr.  Durbin has a bill. We would like to get this done. We can't be  operating off of 20th century immigration policies as we try and  function and compete in the 21st century.   Some are chasing the glitz and glamour that comes with the job. I get  it. They want attention. They want to raise dollars. I am not out here  to attack anyone specifically. But our work is not just profound and  tied to the great history of this very Chamber and this institution and  all the things we need to do. No, Mr. Speaker, it is tied to the very  charge of this century that we exist in, which is renovating our  systems, focusing on the functionality and efficiency of government to  best serve its stakeholders, the voter and the constituent. Period. End  of story.   Well, it is a heap. We have got healthcare entanglements and  bureaucracies that we need to address. We have got infrastructure  challenges ongoing that, again, a bipartisan infrastructure bill, which  was catching us up to work on fixing roads. Governor Whitmer in  Michigan is highly focused on this.   Lead in the pipes. I have got pipe challenges in Oakland County,  Michigan. I have got Royal Oak Township that has water costs through  the roof. I have got Pontiac that had power outages like the rest of  the county from  [[Page H2080]]  trees that we decided not to trim. Pontiac to West Bloomfield. We have  got power outages for weeks on end in the innovation capital of the  Midwest.   So we have got to do the nitty-gritty, right? We have got to roll up  our sleeves and do the stuff. I say this with all due respect, Mr.  Speaker. That isn't always sexy, but it makes us work better. Then we  can get in, and we will focus, and we are focusing. We are not going to  wait.   We parallel track our charge, we parallel track our effort, because  artificial intelligence is here. This is maybe, in part, why I have a  master's in philosophy and social policy, because it is raising  unbelievable philosophical questions, artificial intelligence. It is  not these gimmick podcasts that are just talking about falling in love  with a robot or your kids doing homework with the AI chat. That is all  interesting and disruptive.   No, this is about systems. This is about systems of artificial  intelligence in our Department of Defense, in our hospitals, that are  making decisions about our everyday life.   We need trust. As the vice chair of the Committee on Science, Space,  and Technology, I chaired a hearing on artificial intelligence and  bias. That is one leg of this. A regulatory framework would help.  Continuing to invest would help. Continuing to lead, as we have in the  United States of America, brilliantly, because we have the talent. We  want the talent. We are in a global race for talent.   Our universities of all stripes are really wonderful places to learn,  educate, receive higher education, climb that ladder, produce that  original research, and change the world. That is the only way we are  going to succeed.   We measure ourselves sometimes by how many Ph.D.s we have. How many  people get to stay in America after they get that Ph.D., right?   What are we losing out on because we haven't reformed?   I have talked about the materials. I have talked about steel. I want  to mention aluminum. We are very proud of both industries. We want to  have more here in America. We want to be strong on the materials front.  We also want to continue to work on advancing our charges in the  composite space.   I am also the originator of the House Plastic Solutions Task Force.  Now, people get obsessed with the bottles, and the bottles need to be  recycled. But plastic is in everything. It is in your clothes. It is in  your shoes. It is in the chairs. We have got to think about better  technologies to reuse.    Interestingly, my manufacturers in Michigan have Reman, and I have  introduced legislation called Reman Day to salute their work and to  continue to encourage it. There is no incentive to remanufacture your  steel or your aluminum, but many companies see a bottom line with it,  which is great. Those in the plastics sector, from my chemical  manufacturers to my back-end manufacturers, are saying: We have got to  reuse this plastic. Plastic comes from oil, folks. We don't want to  just keep sourcing that way. We can reuse it.   We have got companies, startups, innovators, who are helping us  better recycle plastic. But we also could look for other composites.   I don't really think banning plastic straws and drinking out of  plastic cups with plastic lids is solving the meta challenge. I would  be keen to the conversation of which we have entered into in this body  of thinking through a limitation of single-use plastics for better  recycling. By the way, there are other composites and other materials  we can use.   Forvia, which is in my district, an auto supplier, is trying to  minimize the plastic in the interior of the car to breathe healthier.  That is what they are calling it. They are using hemp. I am not  knocking anyone. I am just simply looking at solutions for us.   I have introduced the last two terms in Congress a plastic recycling  technology bill that has really been bipartisan, and Representative  Troy Balderson has joined with me in that bill in the past. We have  worked on that in the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. That  is a great start, because in some ways we are naive to think about  their durability and plastics going into all of our food and plastics  going into all of our equipment and cell phones and our medical tests  and things like that. But we have got to think forward in terms of how  we are going to succeed.   Here are some other bills that we would like to support in this  Chamber, I would like to implore the support of my colleagues on.   Passing the Manufacturing Guard Act. The Manufacturing Guard Act is a  bill to shore up our supply chains and prevent future emergency  disruptions.   Some, when COVID hit our shores, were saying this is like a weather  event that has disrupted a part of the world. No, that wasn't a weather  event. It was a global challenge, and it was a sustained disruption.  Cybersecurity attacks are the same way. Tsunamis are a part of this. We  have got to better prepare.   A bill I introduced last Congress, alongside Mr. Balderson, Senators  Coons, Rubio, Hassan, and Cornyn, would establish an Office of Supply  Chain Preparedness in the Department of Commerce. How delightful would  that be, as we have gotten CHIPS and Science done.   So they are cooking up a great team at Commerce under the great  leadership of Secretary Gina Raimondo, who I would like to salute for  her great effort and dedication to passing CHIPS and Science. I fully  believe that the Department of Commerce could house such a supply chain  preparedness office, working cohesively with the Department of Homeland  Security. Mr. Ritchie Torres has a like bill along these lines which I  endorse.   Members of the manufacturing guard would advise the supply chain  office, would run simulations, would test our systems.   Where are we weak?   Where do we need to implement technologies for supply chain  visibility?   We don't always know what's around the corner. We don't need to be  afraid. Truman's wise words: America was not built on fear. America was  built on courage, determination, and the willingness to do the job at  hand.   This is our American moment, industrial policy for the 21st century.   Another bill that I would like to encourage my colleagues to support  is the Promoting Digital Privacy Technologies Act. This is a great bill  utilizing the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which we  authorized and plussed up in CHIPS and Science and gave more energy to.   By the way, NIST is playing a huge role in the CHIPS and Science Act.  My privacy-enhancing technologies bill is going to direct the NSF to  support competitive fundamental research on privacy-enhancing  technologies. It's going to direct NIST to facilitate the development  of standards and best practices for the integration of what we call  PETs, privacy enhancing technologies, in the public and private sector  to ensure that Americans continue to reap the rewards of data analysis  while also protecting their most sensitive information.   We don't need to jump in on hyper-regulation. But we can use Federal  agencies like NIST and NSF, as we have seen them do since their origin,  to serve as trustworthy and good partners with stakeholders from  academia, industry, and the general public.   We also have a great bill called the Shifting Forward Vehicle  Technologies Research and Development Act. It is a total mouthful, but  it is a great bill. I introduced it last Congress alongside my  colleague from Michigan, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. That bill  reauthorizes the Advanced Vehicle Technology Program for R&D at the  Department of Energy.   I don't like to skip over the fact that the CHIPS and Science bill  that was passed and signed into law did a lot of great things for DOE.  We are seeing a lot of nice manufacturing partnerships and engagements  with the Department of Energy throughout this country.   We are also seeing the Department of Energy being exercised as a  critical part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, some of these  early-stage grants that are going out for cell batteries and hydrogen  in the hydrogen hubs.   But my Shifting Forward Vehicle Technologies Research and Development  Act supports research for improving vehicle batteries for extremely  fast-charging and wireless charging capabilities and efficiencies to  lower costs, exploring efficient use, substitution, and recycling of  critical materials.   Here we go again: Technology for recycling, thinking about how we can  use  [[Page H2081]]  that approach for access to rare earth minerals or precious metals that  are at risk of supply chain disruption, testing advanced battery safety  protection systems for high-voltage power and heat and on.                                time  1815                          we must pass quantum bills    Mr. Speaker, we know we have got to make a move on quantum. Quantum  bills, there is kind of a nice package cooking out in the Science  Committee.   I am proud to share that in the last month I have served as the co- lead, coauthor for two quantum bills. The Quantum Sandbox for Near-Term  Applications Act, which I have done with my colleague Mr. Obernolte to  establish a quantum sandbox through public-private partnerships focused  on quantum applications and development for the acceleration of this  technology.   Supercomputers, quantum. We are always in a race with the CCP on who  has the fastest supercomputer. Well, quantum has arrived. Quantum, like  AI and like the supercomputers before it, are very expensive to run,  very cumbersome, and very costly. How far does this go and how fast  does it go?   We want to have these technologies here. This is why in CHIPS and  Science we encourage the National Science Foundation, and we said to  them, you are now going to create a new directorate: technology,  innovation, and partnerships. It is all in this vain.   Mr. Speaker, I actually heard this from the Senate majority leader,  Mr. Schumer, he said that we want to be leading in quantum.   The Quantum in Practice Act, which includes quantum molecular  simulations and modeling in the National Quantum Initiative Act. That  is my other bill.   The Science Committee is absolutely on the brink of taking up a  reauthorization of the National Quantum Initiative Act to support and  expand quantum information science and technology research. It is a  critical technology for the U.S. to remain a global leader on.   Mr. Speaker, I have got a few closing points. One is a note of  braggadocios. I boast in the great State of Michigan, the 10th largest  State in the Union, and geographically the largest State east of the  Mississippi, the most number of first robotic teams in the Union.   We are engaging our students with the industry of the future. We are  building. We are making. We are doing exciting workforce development.  Those students are going on to skilled trades. Those students are going  on to engineering. Those students are going on to communications to  help us compete in these industries of the future.   We must invest and lead in the development of the next generation of  vehicles. That is what we are working on. We must have a robust  investment in manufacturing and technology. I say investment as  strategy. We have to do these things to win the future, and, most  assuredly, we will do from the place that I call home, Michigan.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 18 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, April 28, 2023, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
