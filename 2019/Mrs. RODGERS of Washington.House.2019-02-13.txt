 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues this afternoon in  celebrating the dignity and the value of every human life.   I am a mom of three young kids, Cole, Grace, and Brynn, and I can  testify that becoming a mom, bringing a life into the world, is the  most amazing thing ever.   With technology today, we can look into the womb; we can see day by  day how a baby is developing. It is a miracle to witness and it is  proof that we as human beings are not defined by our limits. We are  empowered by the potential that we have and who we can become.   So, Mr. Speaker, I am frightened and I am heartbroken that anyone  would oppose the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act led by  Congresswoman Ann Wagner.   Just as the science is undeniable, it should be unthinkable to deny  lifesaving care to a newborn baby.   We have amazing technology. We can do more than ever. It is  limitless.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to take a step  back, to look at the science, and let this bill come to the floor. It  is the right thing to do.   You know, since our founding, we have been a country that cherishes  every person's inalienable human right, and it is the right to life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is in all of us to uphold  those values and ensure that we are protecting the dignity of every  person as God intended.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jackie Walorski for her  leadership. I thank her for bringing us all together so that we could  be warriors of human dignity and human value.
