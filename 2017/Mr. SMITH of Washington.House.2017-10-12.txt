 Mr. Speaker, I just really want to support  Mr. Langevin for his leadership on this issue, something that we  brought up in committee, and a program that really should be just  discontinued, and I think the motion to instruct is perfectly  appropriate.   It was a program that was originally created, and the reason that we  were selling back firearms to the public from the U.S. military, the  program was literally created because we were worried that there  wouldn't be enough people in our country that knew how to fire a weapon  if we should need to draft them into a war. That is why the program was  created.   Obviously, for a whole bunch of reasons, that is no longer  applicable. We have an all volunteer military. They are trained to  shoot. They know how to shoot. We don't need to train random folks with  weapons from the military.   Also, originally, the program was simply aimed at rifles; and now  they have thrown in, I think it is, around 100,000 pistols that they  want to sell back to the public, in general. And this company makes  money, the taxpayers don't, and we put 100,000 more weapons out on the  streets.   I think if there is one thing we should be able to agree on is that  there is more than enough firepower out there amongst the public. We  should not be taking military weapons and selling them back out into  the public, and this motion, this amendment that Mr. Langevin first  brought up has a very simple solution. We will hold onto those weapons;  we will melt them down. I think that is the appropriate response. We do  not need to sell more firearms out there into the public.   I think the gentleman from Rhode Island has done an outstanding job  showing leadership on this issue. I urge us to adopt this motion to  instruct, and I urge the conference committee to adopt this as part of  the final National Defense Authorization Act that we ultimately will  pass.
