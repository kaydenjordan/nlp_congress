 Madam President, over the past few days, new allegations  have come to light about President Trump's nominee to the Supreme  Court, Brett Kavanaugh. These allegations ought to be treated with the  utmost gravity. The allegations are extremely credible. They were made  by someone who voluntarily submitted to a lie detector test and had  been discussed in the past--long before Kavanaugh's nomination to the  Supreme Court--with a family therapist. I believe her, and many, many  Americans believe her. Many women in America who have been taken  advantage of certainly believe her. For too long, women have made  serious allegations of abuse and have been ignored or dragged through  the mud. It would be a disgrace if this body and our fellow Republicans  let that happen.   Chairman Grassley must postpone the vote on Judge Kavanaugh's  nomination until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible  allegations are thoroughly investigated. The FBI conducted a background  check on Judge Kavanaugh before these allegations were known. When they  did their background check, the FBI had no knowledge of what went on,  so it is now the FBI's responsibility to investigate these claims,  update the analysis of Judge Kavanaugh's background, and report back to  the Senate.   The FBI is the right place for this investigation for two reasons:   First, the FBI has the resources, the information, and the legal  tools to conduct an investigation the right way--far better than some  staffer talking to Professor Ford on the phone. You cannot lie to the  FBI--that is a crime. The FBI will get to the truth. They almost always  do.   Second, our Republican colleagues have run a transparently partisan  confirmation process, and then they immediately insinuated that Dr.  Ford is being untruthful. Republicans and their staff cannot  impartially investigate these allegations; they have already said that  they are not true. Republicans and their staff cannot do this in a  respected way because they have run such a partisan investigation thus  far. There is no bipartisanship here--none--so to have any credibility,  this has to be done by an independent, outside body. The FBI is the  best one.   The vote must be postponed until it is complete. It would be an  insult to the women of America to rush this through after these serious  allegations have been made. It would be an insult to the majesty of the  Supreme Court to rush this through when these serious allegations have  come forward.   In addition, Dr. Ford has said she is willing to testify before the  Judiciary Committee. Does anyone believe it is better for staff to talk  to her on the phone--Republican staff only because no Democratic staff  will participate in this biased, far-fetched process. Does anyone think  it is not better for her to come testify? Then why can't she? Chairman  Grassley should provide the American people the forum to hear her out.  I believe she is credible. A lot of my Republican friends don't. What  are they afraid of? Are they afraid that she might be very persuasive?  Well, if she is, it will be a whole different ball game, won't it?   Chairman Grassley should and must provide the American people the  forum to hear her out and decide for themselves whether her testimony  reflects on Judge Kavanaugh's character and fitness for the Supreme  Court. Of course, he can have a chance to testify again, too, and both  of them said they would. Why in the Good Lord's Name--why wouldn't we  do that? Why? There is no reason. No reason. There is no requirement,  rule, or precedent that says the Judiciary Committee must move forward  on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination this week--none. What is the reason we  have to rush it through when these allegations are hanging out there,  when women who are victimized deserve the right to be heard at the very  minimum?   Then the gall of my dear friend the Republican leader, who delayed  Justice Scalia's seat being filled for 9 months, to say that we can't  take a couple of extra weeks--unmitigated gall. The seat of Justice  Scalia was held open for a long time, and now, with no reason, my  colleague says we can't do that.   Chairman Grassley has to stop playing games, pretending like the  nomination can continue to glide through while at the same time the  Senate conducts a review of these allegations. Hastily arranged private  phone calls with committee staff members is not even close to  constituting a fair and thorough review, is not part of any sort of  regular order, and does not substitute for an FBI background check or  public hearing.   Again, let me ask my dear friend the leader, what is the reason, now  that both Judge Kavanaugh and Professor Ford have said they will come  and testify, that we won't do it? Give me one good reason. One. It is  unrelated to how we became aware of these allegations. Whether you like  it or not, there is a right for them to be heard.   With allegations as serious as the ones before us, the Senate must  not--it cannot for the honor of the Senate--conduct a haphazard,  slipshod review of Dr. Ford's claims or be rushed to a vote. There must  be time for the FBI to do its work and for the Judiciary Committee to  properly prepare to hear testimony from Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh.   There is another issue here. Judge Kavanaugh's credibility has  already  [[Page S6168]]  been seriously questioned in the aftermath of his testimony regarding  emails stolen from the Judiciary Committee by a Republican staff  member, his involvement in the nomination of Judge William Pryor, and  other controversies. In all of these cases, Judge Kavanaugh's  credibility was questioned because documents revealed that he was far  more involved than he led on to when he testified.   Now, he has unequivocally denied this. So there is an issue of  credibility here. You have two people with diametrically opposed views  as to what happened. This is not just an argument for its own sake; it  is for a nomination to the Supreme Court, the highest Court in the  land, which determines through their legal rulings the lives of  Americans and in many instances is seen as the arbiter of right and  wrong.   Are we going to let this happen, not even hear what someone who  believes she was terribly aggrieved--and I believe her--has to say?  When the credibility of a Supreme Court Justice is on the line, we are  going to just brush it under the rug--again, after delaying Merrick  Garland for over 1 year--with no explanation as to why we can't wait a  much shorter period of time? The double standard, the twisting of this  body into a cruel, nasty partisanship, unprecedented, in a feverish  desire to fill the bench with people with whom the other side agrees-- it is one of the lowest points I have seen in my years here.   I want to applaud my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who  have called for hearings. I believe one way or another, six have said  this should be delayed. I hope they will be strong. I hope they will  tell Leader McConnell he is doing the wrong thing. Dr. Ford deserves to  be heard. To railroad a vote now would be a deep insult to the women of  America and a lasting scar on the integrity of the Supreme Court.                               Opioid Epidemic    Madam President, now on another matter, tonight the Senate will take  up legislation that will help our country fight back against the opioid  epidemic. The bill will help people from all backgrounds and all ages  and is designed to address the spectrum of opioid addiction. That means  medical prevention and law enforcement prevention, reversing overdoses,  helping those in treatment, and enabling those in recovery to get back  to their lives.   On this one, we have had real bipartisanship. Democrats and  Republicans came together to pass major funding increases to fight the  opioid crisis. When we consider the Labor-HHS appropriations bill this  week--I hope we will see it signed into law soon by the President-- Congress will have appropriated $7 billion over 2 years to address  opioid addiction, and that funding is now making its way to the States.   The legislation we will consider this week is another side of the  same coin. The funding increases are important, and now this bill will  complement those efforts by making important policy changes and  creating new programs to help providers, first responders, law  enforcement, communities, and families fight back against the scourge  of addiction. Stopping this crisis will take a multifaceted effort, and  this bill recognizes that fact.   I want to thank Members on my side whose legislation is included in  this bill: Senators Baldwin, Donnelly, Manchin, McCaskill, Nelson,  Casey, Heitkamp, and Klobuchar. Many more Democratic Senators  contributed to this bill, as did many Republicans, and I thank them for  their hard work.   Addiction has held too many Americans in its grip for too long. We  cannot let up our efforts to fight this scourge. In the coming days and  weeks, Congress will work diligently on merging the Senate bill with  the House bill that has already passed. It is my sincere hope that we  will come to an agreement and that we will have a new opioid law signed  in the future.                              Hurricane Florence    Madam President, along with so many others, my heart goes out to the  people of the Carolinas and surrounding States. To see the pictures of  houses being flooded--it breaks your heart to see the devastation. It  reminded me of what happened in my State a few years ago with Sandy.  Our hearts go out to these people.   The Federal Government always pulls together when part of the Nation  has a problem. I am not going to look up the voting record of those  from the other side who are now going to ask for aid when they voted no  when my State was so beleaguered. I don't believe that is the proper  way to approach this. They are suffering, and we need to be there for  them.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3440         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Measuring Real Income Growth       Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Economic inequality in the United States has increased       dramatically during the 4 decades preceding the date of       enactment of this Act, with fewer households taking home a       larger share of the national income.        (2) While growth was once distributed relatively evenly       across all individuals in the United States, research shows       that economic gains are increasingly enjoyed by the most       affluent. By contrast, the majority of individuals in the       United States have seen income and wage growth significantly       below what is suggested by national measures of output and       income.        (3) The Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of       Commerce (referred to in this section as ``BEA'') reports       annual and quarterly estimates of gross domestic product       (referred to in this section as ``GDP'') in the United       States. These estimates are important measures of the overall       size and health of the economy of the United States but do       not describe how economic gains are distributed across the       population of the United States.        (4) In a country of 325,000,000 individuals, top-line GDP       numbers do not capture the full range of household economic       experiences and may be misleading. The real GDP grew more       than 3 percent annually between 2003 and 2005, but the       average income for \1/2\ of all individuals in the United       States fell during that period.        (5) Disaggregating economic growth by income groups will       provide a more complete picture of how families in the United       States are faring across all rungs of the economic ladder and       whether economic growth is benefiting all individuals in the       United States.        (6) Recent academic estimates of distributional growth show       how much of the economic gains during the 40 years preceding       the date of enactment of this Act have accrued to the top of       the income distribution. Between 1980 and 2014, the average       income of the top 1 percent of the income distribution grew 5       times as much as the average income of the bottom 90 percent       of the income distribution and more than 9 times as much as       the average income of the bottom \1/2\.        (7) Official and timely estimates of distributional growth       from BEA, reported alongside top-line GDP numbers, would       enable Congress to better evaluate economic policies that       impact every individual in the United States.        (8) Efforts to address slow wage growth, stagnant incomes,       and growing economic inequality require broadening the focus       beyond GDP and obtaining metrics that better correspond to       the experiences of all families in the United States.
