 Mr. Speaker, due to a flight delay I was forced to  miss tonight's votes. Had I been present, I would have supported the  three bills considered under suspension of the rules. I would have  voted ``aye'' on H.R. 4830, the SIT-REP Act. I would have voted ``aye''  on H.R. 4451, the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Programs  Reauthorization Act. I would have voted ``aye'' on H.R. 3832, the  Veterans Opioid Abuse Prevention Act.                            ____________________
