 Mr. President, Maine is home to strong communities and  compassionate citizens. Nowhere are those qualities more evident than  in our State's commitment to end the scourge of homelessness.   This effort has taken a significant step forward through the  establishment of a single continuum of care for the State of Maine. The  merger of the Portland Continuum of Care and the Maine Balance of State  Continuum of Care will better enable local service providers, the  statewide homeless council, and State and Federal agencies to address  homelessness throughout Maine while accommodating specific local needs.  This consolidation began in 2012 with the merger of the Bangor/Greater  Penobscot Continuum with the Maine Balance of State Continuum of Care.  I particularly commend the Maine State Housing Authority for its  leadership during this process.   Maine's unified continuum of care will create greater efficiencies in  the use of Federal funding under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance  Act of 1987, the first major national response to homelessness. As  chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, I am confident  that this unification will enhance the ability of Maine's service  providers to help guide Federal policies and programs that assist low- income Americans, families with children, young people, seniors, and  our veterans in obtaining safe shelter and affordable housing.   With a 9-percent reduction in homelessness from fiscal year 2016 to  2017, Maine is making great progress in aiding our most vulnerable  citizens. The creation of a unified continuum of care will accelerate  this progress, and I congratulate all who made it possible.    Mr. President, today, I join my colleagues, Senators  Shaheen, Isakson, and Menendez, in introducing the International  Violence Against Women Act of 2017. This legislation makes ending  violence against women and girls a top diplomatic priority. It  permanently authorizes the State Department's Office of Global Women's  Issues and the position of the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's  Issues. It requires the Administration to develop and implement an  annual strategy to prevent and respond to violence against women and  girls for each of the five years after the date of enactment. This bill  would ensure that efforts begun under President George W. Bush and  President Obama to combat gender-based violence continue in future  Administrations.   Mr. President, we have witnessed great strides in women's equality in  our own Country, and in much of the world, over the past century.  Across vast swathes of the globe, however, violence against women and  forced marriage remain everyday problems. One out of every three women  worldwide will be physically, sexually, or otherwise abused during her  lifetime, with rates reaching 70 percent in some countries. This type  of violence ranges from domestic violence, rape, and acid burnings to  dowry deaths and so-called ``honor killings.'' Violence against women  and girls is a human rights violation, a public health epidemic, and a  barrier to solving global challenges such as extreme poverty, HIV/AIDS,  and conflict. Such violence is often exacerbated in humanitarian  emergencies and conflict settings.   In Iraq and Syria, girls and women have been abducted from their  homes and villages, sold into sexual slavery, and forced into marriages  with fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In Burma,  rape is used as a weapon against the women and girls of the Rohingya  ethnic group. In Nigeria, girls as young as 11-years-old are offered a  horrendous choice by Boko Haram: carry out suicide bomb attacks against  Nigerian villages or live in forced marriages and sexual slavery.   This systemic targeting of women is not confined to conflict zones.  In India, the United Nations special rapporteur on violence against  women said that they experience such crimes ``from womb to tomb.''  Compounding this tragedy, local police often decline to investigate or  seek justice. In Afghanistan, women and girls are concerned that as  Western forces draw down and attention shifts away from their country,  the fragile gains that have been made there could be lost.   The International Violence Against Women Act--IVAWA--ensures that the  U.S. will continue to take a leadership role in combatting these  problems. It establishes that it is the policy of the United States to  take action to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls  around the globe and to systematically integrate and coordinate efforts  to address gender-based violence into U.S. foreign policy and foreign  assistance programs.   Specifically, IVAWA will foster efforts in four areas. First, it will  increase legal and judicial protections by establishing and supporting  laws and legal structures that prevent and appropriately respond to all  forms of violence against women and girls, including ``honor killings''  and forced marriage. Emphasis will be placed on promoting political,  legal, and institutional reforms that recognize violence against women  and girls as a crime and train police and the judiciary to hold  violators accountable and to respond to the needs of victims. Second,  IVAWA will increase efforts to build health sector capacity,  integrating programs to address violence against women and girls into  existing health programs focused on child survival, women's health, and  HIV/AIDS prevention. Third, IVAWA will focus on preventing violence by  changing community norms and attitudes about the acceptability of  violence against women and girls. And fourth, IVAWA will focus on  reducing women and girls' vulnerability to violence by improving their  economic status and educational opportunities. Efforts will include  ensuring that women have access to job training and employment  opportunities and increasing their right to own land and property,  allowing them to potentially support themselves and their children.   Violence has a profound effect on the lives of women and girls. In  addition to being a pressing human rights issue, such violence  contributes to inequality and political instability, making it a  security issue as well as a moral issue for us all. I am committed to  continuing to work with my colleagues to end violence against women and  girls and to provide the assistance and resources necessary to achieve  this goal.                                  ______                                         By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Markey, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Wyden,          Mr. Franken, Ms. Baldwin, and Ms. Harris):   S. 2124. A bill to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive  personal information, to prevent and mitigate identity theft, to  provide notice of security breaches involving sensitive personal  information, and to enhance law enforcement assistance and for other  protections against security breaches, fraudulent access, and misuse of  personal information; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
