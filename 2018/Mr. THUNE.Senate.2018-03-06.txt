 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to  7 minutes.    Mr. President, the steady stream of good news for American  workers continues. Just take a look at the headlines:   ``Craft brewers putting tax savings toward expansions and new jobs.''  That is one headline.   ``Grocery chain investing in employees and brand after tax reform.''   ``Quad/Graphics to give $22 million in stock to employees.''   ``Entergy Arkansas files plan to pass corporate tax cuts to  customers.''   ``Taco John's International Inc. Shares Tax Reform Benefits With  Employees And Surrounding Communities.''   ``Largest Health Insurer in New Jersey Says It Will Use Tax Refunds  for Members.''   ``Tax reform payday: Kid's clothing giant Carter's giving bonuses,  boosting retirement funds.''   ``Tax reform positive for farmers, ranchers.''   ``Express scripts giving employee bonuses averaging $1,200 following  impact from tax law.''   ``Franklin Savings Bank to Give Employees $1,000 Bonus; Cites New Tax  Reform.''   ``Sprouts plans to invest tax reform savings in employee programs.''   ``First Horizon announces minimum pay level increase.''   ``NC Blue Cross: Tax cut will hold down rate increases, workers to  get $1,000 bonuses.''   ``Hormel to give employees stock shares, increase wages.''   I could keep reading. These are all headlines--headlines from the  past 2 weeks that have come from news organizations around the country,  highlighting the ways in which tax reform is benefiting American  workers.   Businesses large and small are seeing the benefits of tax reform, and  they are passing them on. More than 400 companies, and counting, have  announced good news for American workers, from wage increases to  increased retirement benefits. Utility companies in at least 39 States  are passing tax savings on to consumers.   CNBC reports that small business confidence has hit a record high in  2018, driven by small business owners' optimism about the new tax law.  In other words, tax reform is working exactly the way it was supposed  to. It is putting more money into Americans' pockets and giving them  access to new jobs, higher wages, and increased opportunity.   I don't need to tell anyone that Americans had a tough time during  the last administration or that our economy had stagnated. All you have  to do is look at the numbers. A chief priority of the Republican  majority of this Congress has been turning things around for American  families, and that is why we took up tax reform.   The Tax Code might not be the first thing people think of when they  think of economic prosperity, but it actually plays a key role in  determining the success of individual families and of our economy as a  whole.   The more money the Federal Government takes from you in taxes, the  less money you have to save or pay bills or buy a house or repair your  car. The more money a business has to give to the Federal Government,  the less money it has to grow the business and invest in its workers.  If businesses are struggling to grow and succeed, that is a big problem  for American workers.   In order for American workers to thrive, American businesses have to  thrive. It is pretty hard for a small  [[Page S1350]]  business to hire a new worker or to raise wages if the owner can barely  pay the tax bill.   It is unlikely that an American company is going to have a lot of  spare cash for investing in its workforce if it is struggling to  compete with foreign companies that are paying far less in taxes. And  it is unlikely that America's global companies are going to focus on  reinvesting in the United States if they face a tax penalty for  bringing foreign earnings back home.   When it came time to draft a tax reform bill, Republicans knew that  the bill had to do two things. First, it had to lower the tax burden on  American families and put more money in Americans' pockets right away,  and it had to create the kind of economy that would give American  families access to security and prosperity for the long term.   To achieve the first goal, we lowered tax rates across the board for  American families. We nearly doubled the standard deduction, and we  doubled the child tax credit.   To meet the second goal, we lowered our Nation's massive corporate  tax rate, which, until January 1, was the highest corporate tax rate in  the developed world. We lowered tax rates across the board for owners  of small and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We expanded  the ability of business owners to recover investments they make in  their businesses, which will free up cash so that they can reinvest in  their operations and their workers. We brought the U.S. international  tax system into the 21st century by replacing our outdated worldwide  system with a modernized territorial tax system so that American  businesses are not operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign  counterparts. It is working.   In less than 3 months, we have seen lower tax burdens for American  families, pay increases, bonuses, new jobs, increased investment in the  American economy, better employee benefits, and other kinds of  benefits, such as lower utility bills. All of that means more money in  Americans' pockets. It means more money to put toward a child's  education, more money to save for a house or a car, and more money to  save for retirement.   Tax reform is accomplishing our goal of making life better for  American families, and the benefits have just begun.
