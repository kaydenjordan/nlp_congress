 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. I thank  the ranking member for his service, and his leadership as chairman.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to reject the President's executive  order and to support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution introduced by  my friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy). His  resolution simply states what millions and millions of Americans know  to be true, that the Trump administration's ban on transgender people  serving their country in our military is discriminatory. It reflects  bias. It reflects prejudice. Indeed, it reflects bigotry.   Martin Luther King tried to teach us that what we said in the  Declaration of Independence, we ought to live out. He said that all of  us--and, certainly, he would have included women as we did yesterday in  our Paycheck Fairness Act--are created equal in the image of God.   Martin Luther King said that we ought to judge one another on the  content of our character. The President's order does not do that. The  President's order is based upon a prejudiced view of somebody because  of a distinction that is not the content of their character nor the  quality of their performance.   I was proud to be a sponsor of and brought to this floor as majority  leader, the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell legislation. That has  enhanced our national security, not diminished it.   The President's resolution states what millions and millions of  Americans know to be true: that the Trump administration's ban on  transgender people serving their country in our military is  discriminatory; that it denigrates the service of patriotic Americans.  That is a facet of their character. They are patriotic, and they want  to serve, and the service judges them able to do so.   This resolution, millions of Americans understand, undermines our  national defense at a time of serious global threats. This resolution  rightfully calls on the Trump administration not to implement such a  ban on April 12. To do so would be a blow to our country and the  principles it represents.    Let me remind my colleagues that there was a time when we said  African Americans ought not to serve with White Americans together  because that would undermine morale and undermine the security of our  country. That was a manifestation of prejudice and bigotry, not of  intellectual honesty, content of character.   Have we not yet learned that lesson? Are we not big enough to live  out the premise that all men and women are created equal? This  resolution seeks to redeem the best of America's principles, not the  worst of our discriminatory past.   I was proud to bring legislation to the floor as majority leader that  ended Don't Ask, Don't Tell, and it was overwhelmingly supported in  this House and in the Senate, and passed. It has been a benefit, not a  detriment.   In the years since, we have seen our military strengthen by the open  service of many LGBT Americans who have contributed a great deal to  keeping America safe and advancing our national security interests  around the world.   To say to transgender servicemembers in uniform that they must leave  their units, not because they are not performing well, not because they  are not needed, but because of who they are, not the content of their  character, not their service, not their performance, but because of who  they are, would be a shameful action for our country and deprive us of  their talent and contributions.   To deny transgender Americans the opportunity to put on that uniform  and wear the flag of the country they wish to serve--as I do every  day--would be to diminish that flag, that Declaration of Independence,  that Constitution of the United States of which we are so proud.   I hope my colleagues in this body will join in sending a clear  message that the House, not Republicans or Democrats, that the people's  House reflects the values, the service, and patriotism of our  transgender fellow Americans.   Let us today reflect the best of our values, not the worst of our  values. Pass this resolution. Make America proud of its Declaration of  Independence and its Constitution, and of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s  admonition to make our judgments based upon content of character.    Mr. Speaker, I anticipated this was going to be an  extraordinarily hostile colloquy.   Louisiana was so incredibly lucky. However, it cost me, I admit to  the world, I guess. I hope I don't get in legal trouble. But the  Republican whip and I had a little sort of side bet, so I owe the  Republican whip a crab dinner for four people. That is the bad news.   The good news is the minority whip will now be eating the best crab  in America, not Louisiana crab. It will be Maryland crab that I will be  giving him for dinner.   Mr. Speaker, if my friend would like to ask some questions about the  schedule--or he did ask me, I am told. But I knew that game was coming.    Mr. Speaker, I think it keeps getting worse. In any event,  we will move on to the schedule.   I congratulate LSU. They played an excellent game, as did Maryland.  It was a really good game. There has to be one winner and one loser,  and we lost.   We have the fourth youngest team in the NCAA, so we will be back next  year. Maybe we will be able to play LSU again, if they make it.   On Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour debate and 2  p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate  and noon for legislative business.   On Wednesday, Mr. Speaker, the House will meet at 9 a.m. and recess  immediately. The House will reconvene at 11 a.m. for the purpose of  receiving a joint meeting with the Senate. His Excellency Jens  Stoltenberg, the Secretary General for the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, will address us. Members are advised to be on the House  floor and seated no later than 10:30 a.m. for the joint meeting.   Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for  legislative business, with last votes no later than 3 p.m. We will  consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The complete list  of suspension bills will be announced by the close of business  tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider a major piece of  legislation, H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act  of 2019. Frankly, that bill should have been reauthorized prior to  September 30 of last year in the last Congress. We extended it until  February 15 of this year, at which time it lapsed. We are very hopeful  and expect that this will pass this next week.   It is sponsored by Representative Karen Bass. I am pleased to bring  this bipartisan bill to the floor, in response to our Nation's crisis  of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.   The Violence Against Women Act officially expired on September 30. As  I said, it was extended. It is way overdue that we consider a long-term  authorization of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, it is possible that we will bring to the floor  legislation regarding the crisis that is occurring in Yemen. There are  22 million people at risk of starvation--22 million people at risk of  starvation--noncombatants, women, and children.   We also may consider other legislation, if it comes from the Senate.    It is a very interesting question, Mr. Speaker, that the  minority whip asked me.   I would ask, in response, a question: Does the minority whip remember  when last year, when you were in charge, you brought the budget to the  floor?     Mr. Speaker, I asked the gentleman a simple question. He  asked me about when the budget was coming, and I asked him when did he  bring the budget to the floor last year.    I appreciate, Mr. Speaker, a lot of words of the minority  whip.   He didn't pass the budget last year. There was no fiscal year 2019  budget. He is correct that we had reached a caps deal. That is not the  budget, Mr. Speaker.   A budget is a plan that is reported out and brought to the floor and  passed and sent to the Senate, and the Senate passes it and we have a  budget that is in the same position on each side of the aisle. That is  a budget. That has rarely been done in the last 8 years.   A caps deal has been reached. I would like to see a caps deal  reached.   I have been talking to Mr. McConnell, who wants a caps deal reached;  I have talked to Mr. Shelby--both of those, Republican leaders. I have  talked to the White House about a caps deal.   Unfortunately, I don't think Mr. Mulvaney wants to reach a caps deal.  He wants to use it as leverage as opposed to allowing us to proceed in  the regular order.   But a budget is a different kettle of fish, I will tell my friend,  than a caps deal. A caps deal does, in fact, set the 302 level of  discretionary funding for both defense and nondefense spending.   Yes, we reached the 2-year cap deal. I have been trying for the last  2 months to get meaningful negotiations underway to do the same. I have  not been successful, largely because the President, apparently, and Mr.  Mulvaney are not interested in reaching such a deal. I regret that.   But the Budget Committee is meeting this week--it is going to meet  next week, and we are going to be reporting out what will be what the  minority whip refers to as a budget. It will certainly speak to the  levels of funding that we need to spend.   I want to pass the appropriation bills by June 30. That has never  been done, but I want to do it. I think we can do it, Mr. Speaker, and  I am going to work towards that objective. It will require reaching  what numbers are going to be for discretionary spending.   Unfortunately, the budget that the President of the United States  sent down to Congress is totally unreasonable and irrational, and there  is not a single person, I think, on this floor who will support his  budget.   I will tell the minority whip that I will be glad to give his party  the opportunity to vote on the President's budget. If he asks me, I  will have it put on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we are not able to get to a  budget caps deal. We passed and began, in my view, an irrational--and I  voted for it, and I am sorry that I voted for it--Budget Control Act,  creating the sequester.   ``Sequester'' is a complicated word which starts with S, which I tell  my people in my district and town, many, stands for ``stupid.'' It was  an irrational document that took numbers out of the air without regard  to our responsibilities and our opportunities.   But I am hopeful, and I tell the Republican whip, my friend, that we  are going to try to--hopefully, working with his party--establish some  reasonable, rational numbers for defense and nondefense discretionary  funding so that we can move ahead with doing what really makes the  difference, and that is the adoption of appropriation bills on this  floor; send them to the Senate; have the Senate consider them; and we  will have a conference, and we will pass those bills and send them to  the President of the United States.    Will my friend yield simply for clarification?    I want the public, Mr. Speaker, to understand that a caps  deal is not a budget. They are two separate items:   A budget is a plan for expenditure on defense and nondefense  objectives. A caps deal is to simply set not necessarily those  priorities per se, but to set a top level of discretionary spending.  That is why it is called a cap.   It has been about $1.1 trillion or $1.2 trillion--now, it is going to  be a little over that this year, I presume--for discretionary spending.  Most of the budget, of course, is not discretionary spending. Two- thirds of the budget is either mandatory spending or debt payment.   I just want to clarify that we are talking about two separate items.  One is a budget, which is a budget plan which can, in fact, include  caps within it, but a caps deal is a separate deal.   As the gentleman has pointed out, we have usually made them now for 2  years since the sequester would otherwise have gone into effect. The  reason we made that deal is both sides--both sides--are unwilling to  follow the sequester because we think the sequester does not make  rational sense for the security of our country and for the investments  our country needs to make.   The President doesn't want to do that either. The difference is, he  wants to borrow an additional $180 billion-plus to fund defense and  leave domestic discretionary spending largely at 2010 or 2009 levels.  We think that doesn't make sense.   But I will clarify for the gentleman again that the Budget Committee  is, in fact, considering what legislation they should bring to the  floor in order to facilitate us, as the caps deals did, to facilitate  us achieving the ability to mark up our appropriation bills, send them  to the Senate, and try to reach agreement between the Senate and the  House prior to September 30, and certainly to avoid the historic and  very harmful shutdown that occurred at the end of the last Congress and  continued into this Congress.    Will the gentleman yield?    The Mueller report is not out, Mr. Whip.    Will the gentleman yield?   The Mueller report is not out. The only report that is out is the  Barr four-page letter report.    I hope you are right, Mr. Whip.    Mr. Speaker, what it found is six of the President's  closest associates--his campaign manager, his deputy campaign manager,  his foreign policy adviser, his national security adviser, his lawyer  and counsel for over a decade--all committed crimes. All were either  convicted or pled to crimes.    You had a lot to say. I have something in response.   There is not a person on our side of the aisle who doesn't believe  the letter that you issued regarding Mr. Schiff isn't totally a  partisan distraction from what you hope is not found. There has been no  Mueller report yet that we have received.   The gentleman, Mr. Speaker, voted to have the Mueller report, as did  every other member on his side of the aisle and every member on our  side of the aisle, to be disclosed. Hopefully, it will be.                                time  1130    Hopefully, it will not be just a four-page letter from the Attorney  General of the United States appointed by Mr. Trump. Hopefully, we will  get Mr. Mueller's full report. That is what the Congress voted to get.  That is what we expect to get, and that is what we hope to get.   Let me assure the gentleman that there is not a person on my side of  the aisle that believes that Mr. Schiff has done anything but act in  the highest interest of our government, of the Intelligence Committee,  and of full knowledge for the American people, unlike his predecessor  who worked hand-in-glove with the White House, not as an independent  coequal branch of government, but as an advocate for the White House's  position, who clearly should have been removed and was not.   Mr. Speaker, I say to the minority whip that Mr. Schiff is a member  of the highest integrity, highest intellect, and has great  responsibility. I expect him to pursue his responsibilities as chairman  of the Intelligence Committee to assure that neither Russia nor any  other country will in the future be able to interfere in the elections  of the United States, as Mr. Mueller concluded the Russians have.   Now, the President hasn't concluded that, but almost every American  understands that the Russians tried to, on behalf of the President of  the United States, affect the elections. So I tell my friend, I hope  that we can have the debate. Let's look at the Mueller report.   Very frankly, there are other investigations that are going on, as  the gentleman knows, in the Southern District of New York, as well as  in the Government Operations Subcommittee, as well as in the Foreign  Affairs Committee, as well as in the Financial Services Committee, as  well as in the Intelligence Committee.   We still pale in insignificance in the number of investigations that  we have had or oversight hearings that we have had when compared to the  oversight hearings the Republicans had of the Obama administration and  Mrs. Clinton in trying to undermine their credibility, an  administration that, by the way, I don't think anybody was put in legal  jeopardy and there were no scandals in the Obama administration.   There were disagreements, but I would think the gentleman ought to be  very reserved, very frankly, in terms of making conclusions based upon  a four-page letter before we have seen the Mueller report, before we  have seen the actions of the Southern District of New York, and before  we have seen the results of the oversight hearings that are continuing.    Mr. Speaker, I don't think I will respond to all of that,  time being of the essence, I suppose.   The gentleman represents a party who held eight hearings, all headed  by Republicans, on Mrs. Clinton. All eight reached the same conclusion,  but the first one wasn't enough. The second one wasn't enough. The  third one wasn't enough. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh weren't  enough. So the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Gowdy) was appointed  to do one more because it was pretty close to the election then, Mr.  Speaker.   The majority leader, now the minority leader of this House, said: Oh,  no, they accomplished something. They accomplished the political  objective. He said that on television, roundly criticized by his party.  Why did you say that? Why did you admit that?   But for the minority whip to say that the Mueller report instigated X  millions of dollars spent for political purposes, Mueller was appointed  by a Republican, not by a Democrat, and the Attorney General recused  himself so the Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Rosenstein, was the one  that appointed him.   Why did he recuse himself? Because he had been involved, contrary to  what he testified to in his nomination hearing, with the Russian  Ambassador. I don't know if there was anything of substance in this  conversation because we don't fully know what that conversation was.   But the fact of the matter is, for the minority whip to be talking  about political hearings or oversight, and then to say he has had an  opportunity to review the Mueller report, the gentleman has had more  than I have had.   He reviewed the four pages of the Barr letter, appointed by Mr.  Trump, and what we know is Barr's reading and his conclusion. But,  frankly, we knew that before, because he sent a 19-page letter months  ago that he thought  [[Page H2905]]  this investigation would not reach any conclusion, and that it should  not, and that the President could not be held accountable, in any  event. That was Justice Department policy.   So I listened to a long discussion, in my view, with all due respect,  I tell my friend, the whip, at odds with the performance of their  administration and the eight hearings they had in trying to bring Mrs.  Clinton down and never finding--never, eight hearings, all led by  Republicans--a conclusion that led to anything.    So we will see what the Mueller report says, I hope. And I am pleased  that the whip and his party voted to have the Mueller report fully  disclosed. He is correct. There are some national security interests  that will properly restrict some of that, so we don't out sources or  ways and means of discovering information.   But having said that, I say to the whip that we will have a time to  debate this. We will have a time to debate it when we have the  information. We will have a time to debate it, perhaps months from now,  when all of these investigations are through.   But I wouldn't take too much solace in what the Mueller report did.  It led to, as I said, the indictment and conviction of the President's  campaign manager. It led to the indictment and conviction, either  through plea or trial, of five other individuals to date.   That is not something to be very proud of in terms of the President  of the United States being so close to and so involved--Mr. Cohen, in  particular, brings that information forth to a hearing, and he was  apparently his closest legal adviser for over a decade. We will see.  But I don't think now, Mr. Speaker, is the time to debate it. Because  the time to debate it will be to see when we see, and the American  people see the Mueller report.   I want to say to my friend, so he understands, I am pleased that we  don't have a finding that the President of the United States colluded,  as he said he did not do. Colluded, of course, is not a legal term.  Conspiracy is the gravamen or the essence of a criminal activity, a  conspiracy to commit something that is illegal.   But we have a time to debate that and discuss it. And the American  people, hopefully, are going to have an opportunity to reach their own  conclusion, which, obviously, in the final analysis, will be the most  important conclusion.   But the good news is, we are continuing to do the substantive  business of the people of the United States. We are continuing to focus  on jobs. We had numerous hearings this week on jobs, on wages.   We had numerous hearings on healthcare, and the costs of healthcare,  and the costs of prescription drugs. We passed one of the most far- reaching reform bills that we have seen on the floor of this House,  H.R. 1. Every Democrat voted for it. Almost every Republican voted  against it.                                time  1145    We have passed some rational and reasonable controls on people with  criminal records who are on the no-fly list or with mental health  problems from not getting weapons to hurt a lot of people quickly. We  have seen the tragedy here and around the world.   So we have done a lot of very substantive legislation in a relatively  short time, and, very frankly, we would have done more if the  Republicans hadn't let the government shut down and repeatedly voted  against opening it up for the first month of our session.   Mr. Speaker, this is obviously about scheduling, and we are going to  continue to bring substantive bills to the floor to respond to the  needs of the American people. Yes, we can do oversight as well, but  that will not preclude us from pursuing, as the majority, the agenda  that we think the American people sent us here to Washington and made  us the majority to do.   I hope that my Republican friends will join us in that effort and  offer substantive amendments when they think there are differences that  they have with that legislation, consider those, and send them to the  Senate, because that is really what the people want us to do.   To the gentleman's observation about impeachment, I know he has been  here. I know he has voted on efforts by some to move ahead on  impeachment, and surely I know that he knows the overwhelming majority  of Democrats voted ``no.'' I know that he must have heard Speaker  Pelosi say that we are not pursuing impeachment and that we want to  focus on the needs of the American people. I am sure he heard that, Mr.  Speaker, but he tends to reference otherwise on that. I think that is  not accurate.   The American people ought to understand that we are pursuing their  agenda: their jobs, their healthcare, and the welfare of their  families. That is what our duty is, that is what our responsibility is,  and that is what we are doing.    Mr. Speaker, I would ask my friend: Is he at all concerned  that somebody that he didn't mention, Mr. Flynn, was, in fact, indicted  and convicted of lying about his relationship with the Russians and his  having clients in Europe, in Ukraine, which he failed to disclose?   He was appointed to one of the highest offices, the National Security  Advisor to the President, and he lied about  [[Page H2906]]  his relations with the Russians to law enforcement, which is a crime,  and was convicted and, in fact, pled.   I understand what Mr. Barr has said in a 4-page letter after some 48  hours of review of all of the documents, all of the evidence, that was  adduced. None of us really knows. I am not going to make a conclusion  until I have an opportunity to review the report. I hope we will have a  full debate on that.   All of us are concerned, Republicans and Democrats, about the  extraordinary number of people very close to the President--and, most  importantly, Flynn, who was the National Security Advisor to the  President--who were convicted of lying to law enforcement, some not  paying their taxes and cheating the American people and all of us by  not paying their fair share of what was due. I think that ought to be  of concern to all of us.   These weren't just some people. They were the President's campaign  chairman. They were one of the President's foreign policy advisers, Mr.  Papadopoulos. It was his personal attorney for 10 years, a so-called  fixer, did anything he was told or implied to do. We all ought to have  concern about that.   But we ought to also be happy that, hopefully, correctly, Mr. Mueller  found that we were not in a conspiracy with--I don't know about that,  but colluding with--I don't really know what that exactly means; I have  a sense, but it is not a legal issue--that the President did not,  because any President who did collude with a foreign government that  was clearly not our friend and, indeed, for the most part, our  competitor and, yes, enemy, that would be something, I think, of which  all of us would be extraordinarily concerned. I am glad that Mr.  Mueller didn't find that.   But to think that, as the President says, this was a whitewash and no  problems when five or six of your closest allies and friends have been  or are about to be sent to jail, that is not something to be happy  about.   It wasn't that Mueller didn't find wrongdoing. What Mueller didn't  find was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, there was criminal behavior on  which he believed he could act. That is what Barr said. And, in fact,  Mr. Mueller, in Barr's letter, concluded that the President could not  be exonerated or indicted on the basis of obstruction of justice. He  made a conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence.   We don't know the answer to that question, but Mr. Mueller says that  he could not find beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, made no  assessment as to whether he did or did not.   In any event, we need to move on, as I said, Mr. Speaker, with the  people's business: jobs, healthcare, integrity in government, safety in  our neighborhoods, education of our children, and the health of our  people.   Mr. Speaker, I want to tell the whip that I look forward to working  with him on such an agenda for the people.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow, and further,  when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet at noon on  Monday, April 1, 2019, for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.
