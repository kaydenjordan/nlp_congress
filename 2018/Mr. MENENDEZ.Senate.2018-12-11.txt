 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss--and I  appreciate the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island and the work he  has done on this critical question of climate change. I am pleased to  join him today on the floor in pursuit of what he has been doing.   I rise today to discuss the negotiations taking place in Katowice,  Poland, to finalize the rule book on implementing the Paris climate  change agreement. There is an immediate urgency for global action to  reduce greenhouse gas pollution as emissions continue to increase. The  longer it takes for us to fully accept and acknowledge the problem, the  more aggressive the world will have to be to avoid the worst effects of  climate change from becoming a reality.    For decades, the science has yielded increasing causes for concern.  Today, the connection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions-- primarily fossil fuel combustion--and climate change is undeniable.  Three major reports on the growing climate crisis have been published  in the last 30 days alone. That includes reports from the world's top  climate scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and  the U.N. Environment Programme. That includes the National Climate  Assessment, which was assembled by 13 Federal agencies and 300  government experts--our Federal agencies and our government experts.   What the scientists are telling us is that robust and immediate  action is necessary to prevent catastrophic changes in the Earth's  climate--changes that have already begun to affect every single  American.   There is a tendency to dismiss scientific reports as abstract, as  hard to understand. The President seems to simply not believe them. So  let me speak plainly: The consequences of climate change are anything  but abstract--regional food and water shortages, inundation of island  nations and coastal communities that are home to billions of people  around the world, mass migration, and refugee crises.   Our own National Climate Assessment makes clear that the United  States--with all our wealth and good fortune--is far from immune from  the effects of climate change. If we fail to confront this challenge,  the United States will experience effects that will cost American lives  and billions in losses to our national economy.   While we shouldn't point to any single event as evidence, the changes  in trends depicting climate change's harsh reality are undeniable. It  is a fact that the average global temperature on Earth has increased by  about 0.8 degrees Celsius--1.4 degrees Fahrenheit--since 1880, and two- thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975. It is a fact that the  frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in many regions of  the United States are increasing, including conditions that heighten  wildfire risks. It is a fact that sea level has been rising over the  past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades. In 2017,  global mean sea level was 3 inches above the 1993 average--the highest  annual average in the satellite record. None of these facts are new.  None of these fact are deniable. The science predicted these climate  change effects 20, even 30 years ago.   To echo a common sentiment among climate change leaders on the  urgency of the situation, ``We are the first generations to experience  the effects of climate change and the last that can act to prevent the  worst.''   This urgency is fueling the negotiations in Poland this week.  Deliberations on the various elements of these rules began shortly  after the Paris Agreement's entry into force in November 2016, and the  agreement requires that the rules be completed this year, making the  COP in Katowice the most consequential conference of parties since  COP21 in Paris.   The Paris Agreement establishes firm, albeit nonbinding, global  emissions reduction goals--reductions sufficient to prevent a 2 degrees  Celsius increase in global average temperatures. The Paris Agreement  also clearly outlined robust and transparent reporting so that parties  can hold each other accountable via diplomatic engagement as opposed to  binding legal punishment.   Of course, success comes down to execution. That is what makes the  development of the implementation rule book so consequential and  President Trump's decision to abandon the Paris Agreement so  antithetical to our own interests.   The current administration's wholesale rejection of meaningful  engagement with the global community is disturbingly naive and is bound  to result in repeating past mistakes with detrimental outcomes.   China is emboldened by President Trump's plan to abandon the Paris  Agreement. China effectively slowed progress at COP23 and will continue  its efforts. In the leadership vacuum that President Trump has created,  China is stepping in to write the rules.   It is completely absurd to assume that the United States, by  withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, is somehow immune to the global  economic implications of climate change.   The President couched his decision to abdicate American leadership  regarding the Paris Agreement as putting ``America first'' in a June  2017 announcement riddled with inaccurate characterizations of the  Paris Agreement and alternative facts on climate change.   There is no truthful, factual, or reality-based argument to justify  how allowing every country in the world except the United States to  build the clean energy economy of the future and confront our most  pressing global challenge puts America first.   Continued U.S. leadership and climate diplomacy can only yield  economic benefits for U.S. workers. More than 900 U.S. businesses  support keeping the United States in the Paris Agreement, including  more than 20 Fortune 500 companies.   Acting to prevent the worst effects of climate change holds  tremendous economic and job-growth opportunities for New Jersey and our  Nation. I am proud to say that New Jersey is a national leader in  deploying clean energy technologies, creating clean energy jobs, and  planning and investing in climate change resilience.   New Jersey is home to 417 solar energy manufacturing and installation  companies employing more than 7,000 workers.   New Jersey is also competing hard to become the first Mid-Atlantic  State to produce offshore wind energy, supported by the recent  enactment of legislation establishing a 3,500-megawatt production goal  for offshore wind energy.   New Jersey has also recently increased its renewable energy standards  to 50 percent by 2030 and set a new State carbon emissions reduction  goal of 80 percent by 2050.  [[Page S7421]]    New Jersey's leadership among the States working to combat climate  change is rooted in our vulnerability to the effects of climate change.  The fact is, if we continue on our current emissions trajectory, the  world could see global average temperature increase by 3 degrees  Celsius. This would devastate New Jersey, risking $800 billion in  coastal property value, along with the health, security, and livelihood  of millions of residents. The potential losses from sea level rise and  increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather associated with  climate change would cost my State's economy billions in economic  losses.   Just yesterday, the Star-Ledger--a statewide paper--published a  column by Robert Kopp, the director of the Rutgers Institute of Earth,  Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, highlighting many of these  consequences, as outlined by the recent National Climate Assessment.   Our winters have been warming faster than our summers. Pests like  pine beetle and ash borer are no longer kept in check by winter  freezes. Perhaps even more alarming, we have seen our crops begin to  bud earlier and earlier, only to see them decimated by cold snaps later  in the season. In the Garden State--famous for our tomatoes, cranberry  bogs, blueberries, and other specialty crops--that is a big deal.   As temperatures rise, we also expect to see a surge in heat-related  deaths and illnesses due to allergies and asthma, while disease- carrying bugs like mosquitos and ticks thrive in increased seasonal  moisture.   Our fisheries--the life blood of so many of our coastal communities-- have already begun to see how changing water temperatures are changing  migrations, making it harder for us to manage historic fisheries and  harder for our fishermen to earn a living.   Of course, perhaps the clearest threat to New Jersey from climate  change comes in the form of coastal flooding from sea level rise and  extreme weather events. We saw it with Superstorm Sandy, and we  understand the devastating consequences it can have for our families,  our communities, and our infrastructure.   There is no convincing me that ignoring climate change and walking  away from the world's only mechanism for holding countries like India,  China, and Russia accountable for their emissions puts New Jersey  first.   The Trump administration's failure to recognize this potential and  its refusal to recognize the growing market demand for clean energy is  a stunning example of the transactional relationship this President has  with the fossil fuel industry. He is putting wealthy, politically  connected corporations ahead of the best interests of the American  people. Proof of the administration's political favoritism for fossil  fuels is exemplified by the only U.S. Government-sponsored event at  COP24 in Poland, titled ``The Future of Coal.''   Never mind how insulting and tone-deaf it is to sponsor an event to  promote dirty, coal-powered energy at a climate change conference while  countries like the Marshall Islands, the Maldives, Mongolia, and  Mozambique, which face existential crises from climate change, look  on--even more than that, this public forum flaunts the administration's  wholesale sellout to the industries the government is tasked with  regulating. It also shows us this administration's contempt for the  booming renewable energy sector in the United States, which, according  to Trump's own Department of Energy, employs more Americans than the  U.S. fossil fuel industries by a 5-to-1 reality. All told, nearly 1  million Americans work in the energy efficiency, solar, wind, and  alternative vehicles sectors. That equals nearly five times the number  of workers employed in the fossil fuel electric industry, which  includes coal, gas, and oil workers.   As the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I  believe that climate diplomacy must be a priority for U.S. foreign  policy. Climate change poses an imminent and long-term threat not just  to U.S. national security but also to the long-term prosperity of this  country and of our world. Addressing the crisis requires collective  action and cooperation by local and national representatives, small and  large businesses, and every one of us.   If the United States is to maintain our status as the world's  superpower, it is in our best interest to lead the global cooperative  effort to address the serious challenges posed by climate change and to  promote stability and resilience by helping developing countries reduce  their vulnerability to the effects of climate change. If we stand alone  on the sidelines as these changes and international economics take  shape, we will ultimately be the loser.   I urge my colleagues to join me in calling on the administration to  advance continuing U.S. climate diplomacy and reconsider the decision  to withdraw. It is essential to U.S. national security interests, as  defined by our own Department of Defense, and growing U.S. economic  opportunity.                           Congressional Review Act    Mr. President, I want to take one moment to speak to a different  topic, which is to support the Tester-Wyden Congressional Review Act.   This is an administration cloaked in secrecy and deception. It is an  administration that doesn't want the American people to know what it is  doing. So it is no surprise that in July, the Treasury Department  issued their dark money rule. They don't want the American people to  know that behind every bill, amendment, and Executive order is a big- money special interest. They want to make it easier for big  corporations, billionaires, and even illegal foreign money to influence  our elections. These special interests know that so long as the money  keeps flowing, there will be someone in Congress to do their bidding.   At a time when Americans want transparency from their government,  this rule would allow special interests to hide their donors from the  IRS.   It has been 8 years since the Supreme Court's Citizens United  decision--a decision that gave corporations the right to spend  unlimited, unchecked, and, more often than not, undisclosed money on  our elections. For 8 long years, more and more money has flowed from  corporate coffers into campaign ads and political expenditures, and  Republicans have defended the dark money poisoning our politics every  step of the way.   Let me demonstrate the sheer magnitude of the dark money that has  been pumped into our recent elections. In 2016, outside groups spent  more than $1.4 billion, much of it funneled through trade associations  and nonprofits. In 2018, outside groups spent more than $1.3 billion.   These funds were not spent by the candidates' campaign committees but  by groups that did not have to reveal their donors and disclose them to  the public.   Spending by independent, outside groups reached an alltime high of  $49 million in this year's congressional elections in my home State of  New Jersey. State and county parties spent about $8.1 million. In other  words, outside groups this year outspent formal parties by over 600  percent.   All of this secret cash and dark money undermines the ability of the  American people to hold their government accountable. Yet, for the  President and some of my Republican colleagues, that is not enough.   Ask yourself: Under these rules, what is to prevent anonymous foreign  corporate donors that have unlimited amounts of cash to influence the  American political system and help elect candidates who benefit them  and then exert influence over those candidates once elected?   It is no wonder this administration would want to make it harder for  the American people to know who is behind donations to tax-exempt  organizations. It is the wrong direction and is a dangerous one.   As we now know, the President benefited from this dark money,  particularly money that came from the NRA. What is baffling, however,  is that the administration would make it easier for hidden money to  flow through these organizations when we know that the Russian  Government and its agents have used them as a conduit to try to  influence our political system.   The recent indictment and guilty plea of Maria Butina shows this is  not fantasy but reality. The Butina case came about because she was  discovered to be an unregistered foreign agent. Yet she may just be the  tip of the iceberg when it comes to Russians who are trying to pass  money into our electoral system.  [[Page S7422]]    Under this administration's rule, uncovering those efforts will be  made harder, not easier. That is why, tomorrow, I will be urging the  FBI and the FEC to investigate whether other covert Russian sources may  be behind political contributions the NRA made during the 2018  electoral cycle to any House or Senate candidate. We need to know who  is contributing millions of dollars to influence the political system  right now.   In our democracy, the size of your wallet should not determine the  power of your voice. I urge my colleagues to listen to the American  people, who have been loud and clear that they want disclosure, that  they want to reduce special interest influence in our politics, and  that they want this government to work for them.   I yield the floor.
