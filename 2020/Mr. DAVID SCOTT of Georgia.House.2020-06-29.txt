 Mr. Speaker, I say to ladies and  gentlemen  [[Page H2657]]  on the floor and people all across this Nation: If you listened to my  Republican friends, you would think we are not in a crisis. We are in a  terrible crisis.   Just think, 42 million Americans that had jobs just 14 weeks ago no  longer have those jobs. Their homes are on the verge of being  foreclosed. They need our help.   Yes, the gentleman from Michigan is right. We did pass this bill in  the HEROES Act, but the Republican leader over there says: Let's pause.   This is the wrong time for this Nation to pause. This is a crisis.   And let me tell the gentleman something. It is a crisis in terms of  health, but it is also a crisis in terms of our great economy going  down and the great pillars of our economy: our homeownership, real  estate values, and the security of our banking system. That is what is  at stake here.   So it makes sense for us to move. With 42 million Americans no longer  working, they are not going to be able to pay for their mortgages. They  are not going to be able to keep their water on, the electricity on,  the utilities. They are coming due already.   So I want to say to the gentleman that, when Senator McConnell says  ``put a pause on it,'' this Nation stands in horror when we see this  epidemic already creating 42 million jobless people, but now burdening  us with the revival of an additional thrust of this pandemic.   Nothing is more important than showing the American people we care  about them. And we can't tell them to keep in their homes if they don't  have a home, I urge my Republican friends.
