 Mr. President, I rise to honor the life and legacy  of Marie Greenwood, who passed away late last year at the age of 106  years old. Marie, a teacher by trade, spent her life dedicated to the  idea that each child--regardless of their race, gender, or class-- deserves a quality education. Her intellect, compassion, and vigor  propelled countless children through the Denver Public School system  and towards lives of purpose. Marie's work as Denver's first tenured  Black teacher and an integration pioneer increased educational equity  in our schools and helped shape Denver into the great city that it is  today.   An only child, Marie was born in Los Angeles in 1912 before she and  her family relocated to Denver in 1925. As a Black family in segregated  Denver, they faced no shortage of obstacles. Despite being a star  student who time and again overcame the bigotry leveled against her,  Marie was told by her high school guidance counselor not to apply to  college because it would be a waste of her parents' money. Thank  goodness Marie did not heed this wrongheaded advice. She went on to  graduate third in her class and earned a scholarship to Colorado  Teachers College. Marie had set out on a path that would eventually  lead to touching the lives of generations of Colorado's students.   Marie was a trailblazer in civil rights and the ideal teacher. In  1938, she earned tenure in the Denver Public Schools, the first Black  teacher to do so. Throughout the 1940s, Marie was involved in local  activism that challenged discriminatory policies. In 1955, Marie made  history again when she became the first African American in Denver to  teach at a segregated school. In the 1960s, she served on a Denver  Public Schools committee tasked to study racial inequities in district  funding and staffing. All the while, she was a kind and determined  teacher who ensured that her students always tried their hardest.   In retirement, she authored two books, one outlining her philosophy  on teaching children facing difficulties and the other her  autobiography. In 2001, her legacy was further solidified as the school  district named a new elementary school in her honor. She will continue  to be remembered by students who participate in the Greenwood Scholars  program, which teaches the history of Denver through her life story.   As the former superintendent of Denver Public Schools, I can  confidently  [[Page S1071]]  say that our students would be well-served if Marie was the lodestar  for our teachers. Her grace and passion for the profession made a  tremendous difference in the lives of our young people, and we are all  in her debt. Thank you, Marie. May she rest in peace.                            ____________________
