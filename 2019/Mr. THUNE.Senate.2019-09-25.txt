 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, readers of Forbes might have seen an  article earlier this month entitled ``Russian Navy To Be First To Field  Hypersonic Cruise Missiles on Submarines.'' Articles like this are a  timely reminder of the ever-present need to invest in our military.   It can be easy to take U.S. military superiority for granted, but our  military preeminence did not come out of nowhere. Our military is  strong as a result of sustained investment and commitment. If we don't  stay committed to maintaining our military strength and advantage, we  will lose them.   Meanwhile, as the Forbes article reminds us, other countries are busy  investing in their militaries. Great powers with aggressive military  tendencies are building up their armed forces and investing in the  weapons and equipment of the future. We need to ensure that our  military is not falling behind.   Later today, we will vote on additional measures related to the  National Defense Authorization Act--legislation that we take up every  year to authorize funding for our military and our national defense.  Both the House and  [[Page S5675]]  Senate passed versions of this legislation this summer. Now Members  from both Houses are working on reconciling the House and Senate  versions of the bill. The Senate-passed National Defense Authorization  Act was a strong bill, and I hope the final bill will look a lot like  it.   Right now, our military is rebuilding after years of underfunding and  the strains of the global War on Terror.   In November 2018, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission  released a report warning that our readiness had eroded to the point  where we might struggle to win a war against a major power like Russia  or China, and the Commission noted that we would be especially  vulnerable if we were ever called on to fight a war on two fronts.   Here in the Senate, Members of both parties have been working  together to address the military's rebuilding needs and ensure that we  are prepared to meet any threat.   The bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act that we passed in  the Senate in June authorizes funding for our military's current needs  and for the equipment and technology of the future. It invests in  ships, combat vehicles, and planes--including development of the future  B-21 bomber, which will be based at Ellsworth Air Force Base in my home  State of South Dakota--and continued procurement of the F-35 Joint  Strike Fighter, which I hope will someday soon be based at Joe Foss  Field in Sioux Falls. It authorizes funding for research and  development and advanced technology. It authorizes funds to modernize  our nuclear arsenal to maximize our deterrence capabilities. It focuses  on ensuring that we are equipped to meet threats on new fronts,  including in the space and cyber domains.   Of course, while up-to-date weapons, equipment, and technology are  essential, the greatest strength of our military is our men and women  in uniform. Both the Senate and House versions of the National Defense  Authorization Act authorize a 3.1-percent pay increase for our troops-- the largest increase in a decade. This is not only something our troops  have earned, it is also an important way to retain troops in our All- Volunteer Force when the economy is as strong as it is. Both the House  and Senate bills also focus on addressing the recent significant health  and safety issues faced by many families with private on-base housing.   I hope House and Senate conferees will produce a strong bill and that  both Houses will be able to pass this legislation in the near future.   In a 1793 address to Congress, President George Washington noted:         If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it;       if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful       instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known that       we are at all times ready for war.    The surest way of preserving peace is to be strong militarily.  Weakness is a tempting target for aggressive regimes and evil men.  Strength, on the other hand, can and does restrain those who might  otherwise pursue war with the United States or our allies. Maintaining  our military strength helps ensure the security of our country and her  inhabitants, and it also helps promote peace around the world.   We can't change the fact that there will always be bad actors who  will threaten our freedom and security, but we can ensure that we are  always prepared to meet any threat.   I look forward to passing a strong National Defense Authorization Act  in the very near future.   I yield the floor.
