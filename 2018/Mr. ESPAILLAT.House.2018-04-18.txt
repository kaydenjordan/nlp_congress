 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Dabney N.  Montgomery.   Dr. Montgomery's selfless service and his courage have made him an  institution in Harlem. In the face of segregationist attitudes and  racial animus, Dr. Montgomery joined the U.S. Army Air Corps as a  member of the prestigious Tuskegee Airmen fighting in World War II. He  walked in lockstep with Dr. Martin Luther King in the march from Selma  to Montgomery during the civil  [[Page H3405]]  rights movement. Dr. Montgomery influenced communities far and wide,  but we are so fortunate that in Harlem he worked to make the community  a better place for all of us.   In 2007, Dr. Montgomery's lifetime of service and commitment to civil  rights and the principles of equality were honored when he received the  Congressional Gold Medal, one of the highest civilian awards in the  United States.   Now, in 2018, I am so proud that we will soon unveil the Tuskegee  Airman Dabney N. Montgomery Place on the northwest corner of West 136th  Street to preserve and commemorate his legacy.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to share this with you and this body. I am  hopeful that his memory will continue to live with us.                            ____________________
