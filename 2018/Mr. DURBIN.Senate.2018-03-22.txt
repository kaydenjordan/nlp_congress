 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I use the term loosely, but last  Saturday, the 17th of March, was one of the high holy days in Chicago-- St. Patrick's Day. They color the Chicago River green. Everybody wears  green. There are great parades, great celebrations. I look forward to  it each year--going back to my parish, Old St. Pat's, for mass and  celebration and having a wonderful day of a lot of good feelings.   During the course of the St. Patrick's Day Parade, I walked along  with various groups who were going to march and came upon the Chicago  Police Department's bagpipe and drum band. I noticed that the banner  they were carrying for the day was in honor of a wonderful man by the  name of Commander Paul Bauer.   Paul Bauer, a commander of the Chicago police force, was downtown in  the Loop of Chicago on February 13. He was attending an important  meeting, and he heard over his radio that a fugitive was trying to  escape. He dropped what he was doing, joined in, and participated in  trying to catch this fugitive. He was cornered in the stairwell by this  man and shot dead. The man who shot him got off six rounds and killed  this wonderful man who had served not only the city of Chicago but our  Nation in his role with law enforcement. He left behind a young wife  and beautiful teenage daughter. He was from the Bridgeport community of  Chicago, and when his funeral was held, massive crowds showed up,  people paying tribute to Paul Bauer.   The reason I raise that is because they traced the gun that was used  to kill this brave policeman. It was a gun that was originally sold  legally through a federally licensed dealer in Madison, WI, and then  the person who purchased it sold it, without a background check, to a  member of his gun club. We don't know whether that person was  disqualified, under the law, from owning a handgun, but we do know that  the next purchase was the purchase that made a difference. That person  decided to sell the gun on the internet, with no background check, and  ended up selling it to a convicted felon--a person disqualified, under  the laws of this country, from owning a gun. That is when that handgun  got into the world of crime. It was used in the commission of a crime  months before the shooting of Commander Bauer, and it was used to kill  him on that day, February 13.   The reason I raise that is we know what we need to do. We need  universal background checks--no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Whether  selling to a person at a gun show or over the internet, there ought to  be a background check. There is no excuse for selling a gun legally in  the United States to someone who is prohibited by our laws from owning  it--none. That is what happened. That is why that wonderful man, that  brave policeman, lost his life.   The reason I raise that is we have a bill before us now. It is an  Omnibus appropriations bill, and it includes some provisions about gun  safety. They are good. I don't argue with them. One is called Fix  NICS--try to make sure more information is put into the background  check system. There is another one related to school violence, which  provides grants to schools to make them safer and such. I have no  objection whatsoever. But we are not getting to the heart of the issue.   This is the heart of the issue: We have a Second Amendment that gives  rights to Americans to legally own guns and use them responsibly, and  the Supreme Court has made clear that we can draw clear lines as to  what is permissible in that gun ownership and gun usage. We can draw  lines that say: Yes, if you have been convicted of a felony, you cannot  own a gun. You cannot assert a Second Amendment right. You have  disqualified yourself. We can say: If you are mentally unstable, you  can't legally own a gun in America. You can't assert Second Amendment  rights in that circumstance. We can put provisions in the law relating  to the type of gun that you own, how old you have to be to buy that  gun, what kind of background check takes place. But none of that--none  of that--is included in this omnibus bill.   My fear is that many Members of Congress will say: Well, we got a lot  of contacts after the Parkland, FL, situation, and met with a lot of  people. Now we have taken care of our constitutional obligation with  the provisions in this omnibus bill.   It will be a sad day if that is the case because what we have done in  this omnibus bill would not have stopped that killer from taking the  life of Commander Paul Bauer--not at all. So as far as I am concerned,  we have fallen far short from where we need to be when it comes to gun  safety.   Something is about to happen this Saturday, a week after our St.  Patrick's Day Parade. There are going to be marches and parades across  the United States on March 24. Tens of thousands of students and their  supporters are going to march right here in Washington, in Chicago,  where I will join them, and in cities and towns all across America,  including Springfield, IL. They will march to urge lawmakers--like me-- to finally pass meaningful gun reforms that help keep our children safe  and our communities safe.   There are things that happen in our personal lives that we bring to  our professional lives, and I will share one of them with you.   After the terrible shooting that occurred in Florida, my daughter,  who lives in Brooklyn, NY, was talking to her daughter, my little  granddaughter, a first grader. Her daughter, that first grader, said:  Mom, the teacher told us that if there is a shooter in our school, stay  away from the windows and get down on the floor.   In first grade, they are being warned about shooters coming into  their classroom. Who would have dreamed that  [[Page S1890]]  America would reach this point? It has. Who would possibly argue that  the Second Amendment envisioned that possibility, that we would arm  teachers so we could have some sort of a shootout in a first grade  classroom anywhere in this country?   The marches that will take place on Saturday are a sign that perhaps  America has reached a tipping point on gun safety. The fact that a  majority of gun owners have stepped up and said that we should have  universal background checks is an indication that we are reaching that  point. The younger generation is standing up, speaking out, and,  frankly, confronting us--those of us who are in positions of power,  elected office--confronting us to do something and stop talking about  it.   These young people are tired of living in fear, as are many students  across this country. They are fed up with the status quo, in which  hundreds of Americans are getting shot every day while politicians sit  on their hands in fear of the gun lobby and the National Rifle  Association.   I don't care what my scorecard is with the National Rifle  Association. I know, incidentally, it is a failing grade, which I wear  with pride. I don't care about my scorecard there. I care about my  scorecard with the people I represent in Illinois, and I particularly  care about the students and the parents who are worried about whether  the school for their kids will be the next site of gun violence.   These young people who are going to march on Saturday are fed up with  lawmakers who ignore the overwhelming majority of Americans who want to  close loopholes in the background check system. Through their powerful  advocacy and eloquence, these juniors and seniors in high school are  already bringing about change.   Listen to what businesses across the country are doing. They are  distancing themselves from the National Rifle Association. It is no  longer considered just another political organization. They are  voluntarily changing their business practices so they don't give a  break to a gun lobby that will not give a break to honest Americans who  want to be safe in their homes and schools. The students from Parkland,  FL, have helped these businesses recognize that they need to be part of  this effort.   We are seeing new gun safety reforms passed in State legislatures-- not so much here in Washington but in States like Florida that have a  long tradition of voting the other way on gun issues.   Unfortunately, the Republicans, who control the House, the Senate,  and the White House, still haven't gotten the message. What we have  included in this omnibus bill is weak soup; 17 lives in Parkland, FL,  are worth more than what we are putting in this bill. Even after  Parkland, after all of the lives that have been lost to violence, even  as the school shootings continue, including a shooting in a Maryland  high school this week, President Trump and the Republican majority of  Congress are still unwilling to push for universal background checks  and an end to high-capacity magazines and assault weapons.   There were modest measures included in this bill. Is that all we get?  Is that it? Is that the end of the national debate on gun safety for  another 5, 6, or 8 years?   There is important language that I included in the defense portion of  the bill, directing the Department of Defense to not only submit all  its relevant records for NICS background checks but also to flag and  prevalidate the records that would prohibit a person from buying a gun.  It is a step in the right direction. It is necessary, but it is not  sufficient to really make a difference when it comes to gun safety.   The prevalidation and flagging are important for the FBI to help us  and will help them quickly confirm whether a person should be blocked  from a gun sale. But let's be honest; this omnibus bill that we are  considering today and tomorrow doesn't address the fundamental  challenges our Nation faces when it comes to gun violence. It takes a  pass.   It is time for Congress to start considering legislation on gun  violence that the gun lobby might not like. We can't let the National  Rifle Association have veto power over gun policy in this Nation.  Politicians need to recognize the obvious. The gun lobby is  increasingly angry, sometimes paranoid, often isolated in its political  positions. It no longer speaks for the majority of people who own guns  responsibly in America.   Remember, the gun lobby cares about one thing more than anything:  selling firearms. It is all about the business side of the ledger--the  bottom-line profit margin.   Violence prevention is not the focus of the gun lobby's agenda. In  fact, the gun lobby usually opposes violence prevention legislation  just in case it might hurt gun sales. It has reached the point where  the NRA endorsement of gun reform proposal is typically a sign that the  proposal is not meaningful.   We can't settle for the status quo anymore. We are facing a public  health crisis of gun violence, and half-hearted measures are not  enough. We need to fight for meaningful gun safety reforms. We need to  call up measures like universal background checks and ending high- capacity magazines.   Tell me why a person who owns a firearm, whether it is handgun or a  semiautomatic weapon, needs to have a high-capacity magazine so that  they can fire 30 or 60 rounds at a time. Tell me why. You might need  that if you are in the military. You might need it when it comes to  police work and keeping our communities safe. There could be  circumstances where they are needed, but why would an individual  citizen need the capacity to fire 30 or 60 rounds at one time? Those  are the clips that are being used, incidentally, by these shooters.  Those are the clips that are being used for mass killing in America.  Those clips do one thing: They take human lives. It is not a question  of sport or hunting or target practice.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3  additional minutes, if the Senator from Utah will give me that  opportunity.    Let me close by saying, on March 24, students and  Americans of all ages will march in the streets to honor those who have  been lost to senseless gun violence and to call on their elected  representatives to step up. I support the marchers. I will continue to  work for meaningful action to help reduce gun violence. I am going to  keep doing everything I can to put the safety of our kids and our  neighborhoods ahead of the gun lobby's agenda.   I don't have any obligation to the National Rifle Association  whatsoever, but I do have an obligation to a granddaughter living in  Brooklyn, NY, in the first grade, who has been warned about what to do  if a shooter comes into her classroom.   I hope my colleagues from across the aisle will join me. It is time  to take a stand and show leadership. America is waiting.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today, on this side of the aisle,  to thank my friend Senator Cochran.   Yesterday, I made a longer speech in the Congressional Record, but I  didn't want this moment to go by without tributes from both sides of  the aisle while you are personally present on the floor.   My relationship with Senator Cochran was fortuitous. There used to be  two giants in the Senate--Ted Stevens and Danny Inouye--and forever and  ever they were the two, a Democrat and Republican--who were in charge  of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill, and we bowed to their  knowledge and wisdom. Then the day came when they were both gone, and  the new people stepping in were Thad Cochran and Dick Durbin.   I felt totally undeserving to be given that responsibility, and  certainly could never follow the act of Danny Inouye, as great as he  was in serving our country, both in the military and the U.S. Senate,  and Thad had the responsibility of following Ted Stevens as the Defense  Committee chair.   While we both knew we were being held to high standards as people  compared us, as they inevitably would, the thing we decided to do from  the beginning was to do it together--to learn on the job and to work  together. It really hearkens back to a Senate that I remember--and I am  sure Senator Shelby and others remember--when we first got here, when  the Appropriations Committee assignments were really bipartisan  assignments, start to finish.   My work on the Defense Subcommittee with Thad Cochran was bipartisan  from the start. It always was. There was mutual respect. If I ever had  an issue, I could go to him. He knew the same thing was true, if there  was an issue related to his concerns or the State of Mississippi, he  could come to me. We never ever set out to trouble or embarrass one  another publicly. We tried to always have a good, positive working  relationship. The very few disagreements we had were behind closed  doors and usually resolved behind closed doors. It really was the  Senate I was elected to and the one I miss today. We need more of it.   Thad Cochran, you made it easy when you were chairman of the Defense  Committee for this ranking Democrat to be an active partner of yours in  doing some important things. I think we accepted our responsibility and  did our level best; I think our American national defense is stronger  today because of it; and I am lucky because I had a good friend, good  mentor, and good colleague by my side.   I wish you the very best. If you want a longer version of this  speech, it was given in the Record yesterday, so you could take it home  and read it, if you would like.   I thank you again for being such a great Senator, a great  representative of your State of Mississippi, and a great colleague when  it came to our appropriations work.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded    Mr. President, we are in the process of considering an  omnibus budget bill. It is over 2,000 pages long. In fairness, it  includes many provisions of legislation that has been worked on by many  of us for months, so it isn't a surprise package, by and large. There  are elements in it that are new and that have been recently negotiated,  but the underlying bill--the appropriations bills included in it--has  been the subject of committee hearings and negotiations literally for  months. I know that because since last year, we have been working on  the Defense Department appropriations, which is included in the bill.   My reason for coming to the floor, though, is to address an issue  that is not included in the omnibus bill--one that I believe should be  and one that is timely and compelling--and there is no reason why it is  not included. It relates to those young people who were brought to the  United States by their parents when they were infants, toddlers,  children, and ended up in undocumented status in this country.   Some of them--a very small number of them--may have been smuggled  across the border into the United States. More likely, a common  situation is that they came here on a visitor's visa with their  parents, the visa  [[Page S1916]]  expired, and they stayed. That accounts for almost half of those who  are currently undocumented in the United States.   The difference is obvious. We are talking about children who really  had no voice in their parents' decision about coming to this country  and who literally grew up here, many times believing they were legal in  the United States. It wasn't until later in life, usually when they  were 10 or 12 years old, that their mothers and fathers sat down and  said to them: We never filed the appropriate papers. You are  undocumented in America. It means that your life is different from the  lives of all the other kids you go to school with.   These kids may be worried about making the football team or getting  an A in math, but then their parents say: You also have to be worried  about somebody knocking on our front door and deporting our family back  to some other country.   Your life in the United States could end at any moment. Be careful.  Be careful not to violate the law. Be careful to keep your head down.  Whatever you do, don't tell people that you are undocumented because it  could subject you and members of your family to automatic deportation.   That is what they grew up with. Through no fault of their own, they  were brought to the United States. They are living in this country.  They are standing in classrooms in our schools, pledging allegiance to  that flag every single day, yet not legal, not documented in the United  States. They are undocumented.   Sixteen or seventeen years ago, I introduced a bill called the DREAM  Act, which said that those young kids deserve a chance--a chance to  earn their way to legal status, earn their way to citizenship. If they  become part of drug gangs or criminal enterprises, so be it--they will  forfeit any right to become any part of America's future; if not, if  they are prepared to finish school and prepared to either continue  their education, enlist in our military, or get a good job, we will  give them a chance. That is what the DREAM Act said, and for 17 years,  I have been trying to make it the law of the land, and I have fallen  short.   President Obama, when he was a Senator here from Illinois, was my  colleague, and he was my cosponsor on the DREAM Act. So when he became  President and it was clear that we couldn't pass the DREAM Act in  Congress, I asked him: As President, can you do something to help? And  he did. He created the DACA Program.   Under the DACA Program, these young people could come forward, pay  about a $500 filing fee, and go through a criminal background check to  make sure they were no danger to this country. If they passed it, they  would be given permission under President Obama's Executive order-- under the DACA order--to live in the United States for 2 years at a  time and then to renew their status. During that 2 years, they couldn't  be deported, and they could legally work.   It was a big decision for a lot of these young people. Remember what  I said earlier--that their parents had warned them: Don't tell the  government who you are. Don't tell them where you live. They could use  that information against you.   But 780,000 young people came forward, trusting this government-- trusting that if we invited them to be a part of the United States on a  renewable, temporary basis, it would not ultimately hurt them--780,000.   What did they end up doing? Most of them went to school, but going to  school as an undocumented person in America is a different challenge.  You don't qualify for one penny of Federal assistance--no Pell grants,  no government loans--so getting through college under those  circumstances means borrowing money from some other source or working  jobs to pay for your education, which many of them did.   Over the years, these DACA recipients ended up graduating from  school. There are 20,000 of them teaching in schools across America.  They are the teachers in the grade school and middle school and high  school classes, and they have DACA protection. Nine hundred of them  volunteered to serve in our military. Think about that for a moment.  They stood up and took an oath to serve the United States in the  military and to literally risk their lives for a country that does not  recognize their legal status. Nine hundred of them are in that  circumstance.    Many of them have done amazing things in their lives. I have come to  the floor and told maybe 100, 110 stories of these Dreamers. They are  amazing young people. They are resilient; they are talented; they are  promising; they are exciting. Yet they are not legal in the eyes of the  law in America.   So we tried. We tried to make sure there was a way to protect them  when the new President came into office. President Trump had said very  clearly in his campaign that immigration was a big issue. He said a lot  of things. Some of them were inflammatory, but, interestingly enough,  he said several times that Dreamers are different. These young people  are different.   He told me personally: Senator, don't worry about it; we are going to  take care of those kids. I believed him. I was hoping he would find a  way to either embrace the Dream Act or extend DACA so that these young  people would have their chance.   But on September 5 of last year, President Trump made an announcement  with Attorney General Sessions. He said: This is the end of DACA. This  is the end of protection for these young people. By March 5 of this  year, 2018, the program will no longer exist. He said to Congress: Do  something about it. He challenged us to pass a law.   The March 5 deadline was looming. Young people were falling out of  the protection of DACA status, and their lives were uncertain. Some of  them had quit school. They just didn't think there was any future or  hope for them. Some of them faced the prospect of losing their job when  they lost DACA protection. That was the reality.   So there we sat, with that March 5 deadline looming--a deadline we  knew was important because that was when all protection and all  renewals would end for many, many thousands of these young people. A  number of us took it up as a challenge, six of us--three Democrats and  three Republicans. We sat down for months to try to write a new DACA  law--and then there was a breakthrough.   On January 9 of this year, President Trump called about 24 or 25  Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate Members, to actually come  to a meeting at the White House in the Cabinet room. It was an  interesting meeting. It was the fourth time I had ever spoken to  President Trump, and he invited me to sit right next to him. It was a  little surprising that a Democratic Senator would be allowed to do  that, but he invited me to, and we spent an hour, with the television  coverage constant, discussing this issue. The President said some  things that were encouraging about what we could do to solve this  problem--a problem he had created when he eliminated the DACA Program.   He said many things during the course of that meeting. He said:  ``We're going to do DACA, and then we can start immediately on . . .  phase two, which would be comprehensive.'' He was referring to other  immigration measures. Then he said: ``We do a phase one, which is DACA  and security, and we do phase two, which is comprehensive  immigration.''   The President added that as part of any immigration deal, he wanted  to end the diversity visa lottery--a separate issue--and change our  longstanding laws that have allowed families to stay together and  eventually be reunited as Americans. He referred to this as chain  migration.   When the President made that offer to solve the problem, which he had  created when he eliminated DACA, several of us came back to Capitol  Hill and said: We have to get this done.   We labored quickly and made some tough decisions, Democrats giving on  some issues, Republicans giving on others. We came up with a bipartisan  bill--just what the President had asked for.   We called him. It was 2 days later--January 11. I know; I made the  call. I said: Mr. President, we have a bill. Senator Graham, a  Republican of South Carolina, and I, as well as four other Senators,  have come up with a bipartisan bill.   He said: Bring it to the White House. Don't waste any time. I want to  get this done.   That was at 10 in the morning. We were scheduled and went to the  White  [[Page S1917]]  House at noon. By the time we arrived, it was pretty clear that  something dramatic had happened in the meantime, because someone in the  White House had invited five other Members of Congress from the  Republican Party, all of whom opposed our effort. The meeting was  pretty well stacked against us. I will not get into the detail of the  meeting. It has been widely reported. But at the end of it, President  Trump rejected a bipartisan approach to solving this problem.   It wasn't the only time he rejected a bipartisan approach. Senator  Schumer and Leader Pelosi had offered him a similar approach before,  saying: We can work together. It appeared they had an agreement, but it  evaporated in a matter of hours.   We know, as well, that there were offers made of bipartisan  approaches. Senator McCain and Senator Coons offered a bill on the  floor of the Senate. It was a good bill--not exactly what I wanted by  any means, but at least it solved the problem. It was vehemently  rejected by the Trump administration.   All in all, there were six different bipartisan proposals offered to  President Trump to solve the problem he had created by eliminating  DACA. He rejected every single one of them.   He sent to the floor of the Senate a bill offered by Senator Grassley  of Iowa. Senator Grassley's bill embodied the President's approach to  this. Now, understand the Senate's scorecard here. There are 51  Republican Senators and 49 Democratic Senators. So when the President  called his own bill, one of our Senators, Senator McCain, was away ill,  but there were 50 Republican Senators and 49 Democrats who voted on  that day.   How many votes did the President's immigration proposal get? Thirty- nine. The President got 39 votes. It was kind of a shock that the  President's own party didn't support the President's bill--at least not  all of them.   When we offered the one I supported, the plan offered by Senator  Rounds and Senator King, it ended up with 54 votes. Eight Republicans  joined to have a bipartisan measure. But it wasn't enough; 54 votes  will not do it. On an issue like this, it takes 60. So we have  nothing--nothing. What that means is, in the eyes of the law, for the  time being, these DACA-protected young people have no legal  protection--save one other element.   While we were debating, the courts were also involved. Two different  Federal courts issued an order to the Trump administration and said:  Stop. Don't do another thing; don't deport these kids. In fact, allow  them to renew their DACA status.   Former Senator Sessions, now the Attorney General, filed an emergency  effort before the U.S. Supreme Court to stop that decision, and the  U.S. Supreme Court rejected it. So now, today, there at least has been  a postponement of deporting the young DACA kids. We don't know if that  postponement will last a week, a month, a year. There is no telling. It  is a pending court case. That is the only thing that is stopping the  deportation of these 780,000 young people. That is it.   The obvious question is, Well, why did you stop? If you failed to  meet the March 5 deadline, why didn't the Congress--why didn't the  Senate, why didn't the House--continue the effort to try to solve this  problem? Isn't that what you were elected to do, Mr. Senator?   The answer, obviously, is: Yes, we should. But we haven't.   That is why I have come to the floor today. We have this 2,000-page  bill that does not solve the DACA problem. We have this 2,000-page bill  that addresses every subject imaginable but doesn't address the looming  deadline we face in America. We are one court decision away from  hundreds of thousands of young people being deported.   What do the American people think of this idea of undocumented  people, here but not recognized by law? I will tell you what they  think. Eighty-five percent of the American people believe we ought to  do what is right and fair for these young people. They support the  Dreamers, and they support giving DACA protection. Eighty-five  percent--60 percent of those who voted for President Trump--say that we  should fix the DACA Program.   But we have failed again. We have failed to do what the President  challenged us to do, as he continues to reject every bipartisan  proposal that has been brought before him--every one of them.   I am going to be making a unanimous consent request when this is  over. I think I know how it will end. Any single Senator can object and  stop the protection of these DACA young people, and one is prepared to  do it. It is my understanding that he is going to demand that we  instead pass the President's immigration plan, which received-- remember--39 votes. Not even all of the Republican Senators supported  it. It wasn't bipartisan in any way. There are provisions in the  President's plan that are just plain wrong, and even 14 Republicans  realize that and voted against it.   So here we are at this moment, with an important bill with many  positive aspects in it for all of America, including my State of  Illinois. Yet there is one critical element still missing. We have  failed to include a provision to solve the DACA problem created by  President Trump. His refusal to accept any bipartisan compromise leaves  us emptyhanded and these poor young people struggling to figure out  what their lives will be.   Last week, I was in the Chicago for what I refer to as high holy days  in Chicago--the St. Patrick's Day weekend, with parades and parties and  breakfasts and lunches. I skipped one of the traditional breakfasts to  go out to Loyola University's school of medicine. The reason I went  there is called Match Day at medical schools. It is when graduates of  medical schools apply for their residencies. Residency, of course, is a  continuation of their education, leading up to their becoming actual  practicing physicians. It is a huge day in each of their lives. They  have gone through college; they have finished medical school; and now  they wait for that letter that gives them a chance to finish their  medical education.   I wanted to be there because six of the graduates of the Loyola  University Chicago Stritch College of Medicine were protected by DACA.  They are young people who are extraordinarily talented from all over  the United States. They were given a chance to go to medical school,  and here they were in a situation, waiting to see if they could become  doctors. It turned out that because of our failure--because of the  President's removing the DACA Program and our failure to pass a  replacement, two of them have their residencies in doubt. A residency  is a job. It is a big job. You don't just work 40 hours a week. It is  sometimes 60 to 80 hours a week. It is a big undertaking. These young  people, without DACA protection, cannot legally work in America and,  therefore, found it next to impossible to find hospitals and  universities that would take them and allow them to complete their  medical education. That is the real-life consequence of our failure to  act.   That is the real-life consequence of our failure to include in this  omnibus bill--or any bill to this point--a solution to the problem  created by President Trump. That is why I am going to make this  unanimous consent request that will, in fact, pass the Dream Act, solve  this once and for all, and create a law that protects these young  people and others in similar categories--one that has been offered on a  bipartisan basis in the Senate and one that I believe should be passed  immediately.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1615    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the  Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. 1615 and the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I further ask consent  that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I thank the  Senator from North Carolina, and I believe he does have a genuine  interest in this issue. I attended several of our meetings to discuss a  bipartisan compromise, and I hope we can continue to do that. In the  meantime, though, what he has offered is the Grassley approach, which  was President Trump's immigration approach, which limited legal  migration to the United States and members of families who wanted to be  reunified, some of whom have waited 10 or 20 years to rejoin their  families in the United States. Unfortunately, it also included the $25  billion wall, which may be the price that has to be paid to spare these  young DACA Dreamers, but I object.    Mr. President, this past Saturday was St. Patrick's Day.  The city of Chicago celebrated, as it has every St. Patrick's Day since  1962, by dyeing the Chicago River a deep emerald green.   In the Windy City and in cities and towns throughout Illinois, across  America, and around much of the world, people wore green and attended  St. Patrick's Day parades and parties.   No nation--including Ireland herself--celebrates St. Patrick's Day  with as much enthusiasm as Americans do. Whether your ancestors came to  this country from Dublin or the Dominican Republic, from Galway or  Greece, on March 17, as the saying goes, everyone is Irish.   But America didn't always love the Irish. From the middle of the 19th  century and well into the 20th century, it was not uncommon for  employment ads in America to carry the warning: ``No Irish Need  Apply.'' In 1857, Harpers Weekly asserted that ``nearly 75 percent of  our criminals and paupers are Irish . . . [and] 75 percent of the  crimes of violence committed among us are the work of Irishmen.''   Irish immigrants had been an integral part of America since our  earliest days as a nation. Nine of the 56 men who signed the  Declaration of Independence were Irish Americans. They included four  men who were born in Ireland. And Irish Americans fought and died in  the Revolutionary War to secure America's freedom from England.   The Irish who came to America beginning in the mid-1840s, however,  were different than the earlier arrivals from Erin's shores. These were  ``the Famine Irish.'' They fled Ireland to escape one of the greatest  catastrophes ever to befall that nation.   We know it today as ``the potato famine.'' In Ireland, it was called  ``the Great Hunger'' or, in Gaelic, the old Irish tongue, ``An Gorta  Mor.''   In 1845, a fungus, carried to Ireland from America, destroyed all of  Ireland's potato crops. All across Ireland, potato fields turned black  and rotted from the blight.   Ireland was not an independent nation then, as it is now. It had been  occupied and ruled for hundreds of years by England, and most of the  land was owned by absentee English landlords.   The native Irish were mostly tenant farmers, what Americans would  call ``sharecroppers,'' allowed to farm only tiny plots of land. The  calorie-rich potato became the subsistence crop for the Irish, the one  crop they could grow on their small parcels of land that could feed a  family.   When the potato crops failed, England refused to intervene. Some in  England warned that providing emergency food relief to the starving  Irish would disrupt with the workings of a free market. Others declared  that famine  [[Page S1934]]  and death were God's way of punishing the Irish.   Starving Irish who could no longer pay their rent were driven off  their land and into workhouses. Others died on the sides of roads,  their mouths stained green from eating grass. Soon, typhus and cholera  were claiming as many lives as starvation.   When the Great Hunger began, 3 million people lived in Ireland. Three  years later, 1 million people had died, and another 1 million had fled  Ireland, most of them to America. In the period between 1845 and 1860,  approximately 20,000 Irish a month were flooding into America.   They called America ``An t-Oilean Ur''--``The Fresh Land,'' but many  of the old prejudices followed them. The Famine Irish, the first large  group of non-Protestants immigrants to America, were derided as  superstitious Papists incapable of adapting to America's Anglo-Saxon  culture.   Irish Americans were denounced as ``simian'' or apelike.   An editorial published in the Chicago Tribune in 1855 captured the  antipathy with which many native-born Americans regarded Irish  immigrants. It asked, ``Who does not know that the most depraved,  debased, worthless and irredeemable drunkards and sots which curse the  community are Irish Catholics?''   In the 1850s, a new political party emerged. The Native American  Party, better known as the ``Know Nothings,'' was virulently anti- Catholic and anti-immigrant.   Many politicians were cowed by the anger of the Know Nothings, but  Abraham Lincoln was not. Lincoln employed Irish staff at his home in  Springfield and, later, in the White House. He donated to Irish famine  relief.   In a letter he wrote to a friend in 1855, he came out foursquare  against Know Nothingness. ``How can anyone who abhors the oppression of  Negroes, be in favor or degrading classes of white people?'' he asked.  ``Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid,'' As a  nation, we began by declaring that `all men are created equal.' We now  practically read it `all men are created equal, except Negroes.' When  the Know-Nothings get control, it will read `all men are created equal,  except Negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.' When it comes to  this,'' Lincoln continued, ``I should prefer emigrating to some country  where they make no presence of loving liberty--to Russia, for instance,  where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of  hypocrisy.''   A decade later, Lincoln's brave refusal to embrace the bigotry of the  Know Nothings helped save the Union. Although Irish Americans were  mostly Democrats, they heeded the call of America's first Republican  President to save the Union when slavery threatened to destroy it.   During the Civil War, more than 150,000 of the reviled Irish rallied  to the side of Lincoln and the Union. They included some of Lincoln's  best generals.   Among them was Brigadier General Thomas Francis Meagher. A brilliant  orator and the son of a wealthy Catholic family in Ireland, Meagher was  a leader in a failed 1848 revolution in Ireland called the Young  Ireland Rebellion. He was convicted of treason and sentenced to a life  in exile in an Australian penal colony. Within 3 years, he had escaped  to New York and became a prominent attorney.   Thomas Meagher's remarkable, improbable life is told in an excellent  new biography, ``The Immortal Irishman,'' by National Book Award winner  Timothy Egan. I recommend it highly.   When the Civil War broke out, Tom Meagher wrote to President Lincoln  seeking permission to form an ethnic Irish brigade. He recruited a full  company of infantrymen to be attached to the U.S. 69th Infantry  Regiment New York State Volunteers.   ``The Fighting 69th'' fought in some of the war's bloodies conflicts,  including the first battle of Bull Run and the battles of Antietam and  Chancellorsville. After seeing Meagher's men at the Battle of  Fredericksburg, General Robert E. Lee declared, ``Never were men so  brave.''   The Fighting 69th was not the only Irish brigade fighting for the  Union.   This year, Illinois is celebrating its 200th anniversary as a State.  Among the countless chapters in our State's history in which we take  pride is the story of the 23rd Regiment of the Illinois Infantry,  Illinois' own ``Irish Brigade.''   The brigade's commander, James Mulligan, was born in New York and  moved to Chicago as a boy. He became the first graduate of Chicago's  first university, St. Mary's of the Lake. Later, he became a lawyer and  a friend and confidant of Stephen Douglas.   When the Civil War broke out, Mulligan placed an ad in the Chicago  Tribune on April 20, 1861, calling for a rally that evening. Thirty-two  men enlisted at the rally; 3 days later, 1,000 men had joined the  regiment.   Mulligan's Irish brigade spent most of the war in Virginia. They  participated in Siege of Petersburg, and they were present for Lee's  surrender at Appomattox.   James Mulligan did not live to see the Union victory. He was wounded  on September 19, 1864, at the third battle on Winchester. As his Irish  soldiers rushed to his side, Mulligan saw that the colors of the 23rd  Illinois were about to be captured, and he gave his men an order, ``Lay  me down, and save the flag.''   The colors were saved; Mulligan was captured and died of his wounds  in Confederate captivity.   Private Albert Cashier was an Irish immigrant who fought for 3 years  with the 95th Illinois Infantry, Company G. At just 5' 3'', he was the  smallest man in his company and, many said, the bravest.   He returned to Belvidere, IL, after the war, and in 1869, he moved to  Saunemin, IL, where he made his living as a farmhand and church  janitor.   In 1911, after he was hit by a car and was no longer able to work,  Albert Cashier moved to the soldiers and sailors home in Quincy,  Illinois.   His mental state deteriorated, and he was moved to Watertown State  Hospital for the Insane. It was there that hospital staff discovered  his secret and told it to newspapers: Albert Cashier was born Jennie  Hodgers.   The reactions were disastrous for Private Cashier. The government  charged him with defrauding the government in order to receive a  pension. The case was dropped after Private Cashier's comrades from the  95th Illinois rallied to his defense.   The hospital staff forced Private Cashier to wear women's clothing.  At 67 and frail, he tripped on his skirt, broke his hip, and spent the  rest of his life despondent and bedridden.   He died on October 10, 1915, and was buried in the Army uniform he  had kept intact all those years. His tombstone was inscribed ``Albert  D. J. Cashier, Co. G, 95 Ill. Inf.''   Albert Cashier is one of the best known of the 400 women who fought  in the Civil War.   Whether Private Cashier was transgender or simply a woman unwilling  to accept the severe limits imposed on women in the 19th century will  likely never be known.   This much is clear, however: The brave service of Irish Americans in  the Civil War helped to diminish the hostility that greeted the Famine  Irish. Within two or three generations, Americans would elect two  Irish-American Presidents: John Fitzgerald Kennedy, still the only  Catholic President, and Ronald Reagan.   Some of the voices we hear in today's immigration debate would sound  right at home among the Know Nothings of Lincoln's time. Sadly, one of  the loudest of those harsh voices belongs to the current President of  the United States.   President Trump opened his campaign by vilifying Mexican immigrants.  He tried to ban visitors from seven predominantly Muslim nations from  entering the United States. He has cruelly placed Dreamers in legal  jeopardy. He has recommended cutting legal immigration--legal  immigration--to America by one-half, to its lowest levels since the  1920s.   President Trump's anti-immigrant, antirefugee proposals are an  affront to America's history as a nation of immigrants, and they would  deal a harsh blow to our economic future. If you doubt it, just ask  yourself: Where would America's economy be today without the  contributions of immigrants Sergey Brin and Elon Musk, or Steve Jobs,  the son of a Syrian immigrant?   I believe that future generations of Americans will look back on  today's anti-immigrant agitators with sadness  [[Page S1935]]  and bewilderment. They will applaud those Americans who worked to  preserve America's values as a nation of immigrants.   I am proud to say that one of those champions is an Irish immigrant  from Chicago. His name is Billy Lawless. He moved to America with his  family nearly 20 years ago.   Billy, his wife, Anne, and their four grown children are all American  citizens now. Together, they own some of the best, most popular  restaurants and pubs in Chicago.   Billy Lawless is also a tireless and eloquent advocate for  immigration reform. It is not just Irish immigrants that he cares  about; it is all immigrants and refugees. He is chairman of a group  called Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform and a founding member of  the Illinois Business Immigration Coalition.   Two years ago, he gained another, extraordinary platform from which  to advocate for just immigration policies. Lawless, who holds duel  U.S.-Irish citizenship, was appointed to serve in the Irish Senate,  representing the Irish Diaspora overseas.   ``The America that I believe in,'' he says, ``is a humane nation. It  is the land of the free, the land of opportunity, and the land of  immigrants.''   Let us remember that this month, as we celebrate the contributions of  Irish immigrants to America.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it has been nearly 4 years since the  collapse of Corinthian Colleges and almost 2 years since the collapse  of ITT Tech, two of the largest college collapses in U.S. history.   These infamous companies left tens of thousands of students in the  lurch, interrupting their education and leaving them with worthless  credits and tons of debt.   Rather than being anomalies, these companies embodied the for-profit  college industry, an industry that enrolls only 9 percent of all  postsecondary students but accounts for 33 percent of all Federal  student loan defaults. The same predatory practices that took down  Corinthian and ITT Tech are commonplace throughout the for-profit  college industry, even today.   So this notion that some would have you believe--that, with  Corinthian and ITT Tech gone, this industry is magically cleaned up and  purged of bad actors--is nothing more than an attempt by the industry  to justify rolling back important consumer protections like the Gainful  Employment and Borrower Defense rules.   Case in point: Ashford University is owned by Bridgepoint Education.  This is a company that, from its very inception, has shown a  determination to work the system in order to profit.   It all began in 2005, when a group of investors bought a tiny  Catholic college in Iowa, which at the time had an enrollment of 312  students, but what came along with that small campus was the gold for  Ashford: regional accreditation. That accreditation opened the  company's coffers to millions in Federal student aid funds.   Since that time, Ashford has closed the Iowa campus and become an  online giant, enrolling more than 40,000 students across the country  and taking in almost $390 million in Federal title IV funds.   Boy, have Ashford executives and owners gotten rich. From 2014 to  2016, Bridgepoint's CEO, Andrew Clark, made more than $10 million in  total compensation.   Meanwhile, its students have been left buried in debt with worthless  diplomas that employers often don't recognize. According to a recent  Brookings study, as of 2014, Ashford student cumulatively owed almost  $6 billion in Federal student loan debt, making it one of eight for- profit schools in the top 10 schools whose students owe the most  cumulative debt. Of the Ashford students who left in 2009, nearly half  had defaulted on their debt 5 years later.   Just like Corinthian and ITT Tech, Ashford has been the subject of  numerous Federal and State investigations and lawsuits.   Ashford is currently being investigated by State attorneys general in  Iowa, Massachusetts, New York, and North Carolina, as well as the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Department of Justice. The  California Attorney General is currently suing Ashford for ``defrauding  and deceiving students.''   In addition, in 2014, Ashford was forced to pay $7.25 million in a  settlement with the Iowa Attorney General for consumer fraud. Once  again, Ashford used false and misleading statements, as well as unfair  and high-pressure sales tactics to lure students into enrolling and  taking on debt.   Just last year, Ashford agreed to pay $30 million to the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau for deceptive acts and practices, including  misleading students about their student loan payments.   Also like Corinthian and ITT Tech, Ashford uses mandatory predispute  arbitration clauses to hide its misconduct and prevent students from  holding them accountable in court.   These clauses, often buried in stacks of enrollment documents that  students must sign in order to take classes, force students to give up  their right to sue the school of misconduct either as individuals or  part of a class. The practice is almost unheard of at public and  legitimate not-for-profit institutions, but is a hallmark of the for- profit college industry.   Not only does the practice steer disputes into arbitration proceeding  where the deck is often stacked against the student, nondisclosure  agreements often prevent the alleged misconduct or the outcome of the  arbitration proceeding from becoming public. This hides misconduct from  regulators and accreditors, often allowing for-profit colleges like  Ashford to continue illegal practices for years without detection.   In addition to receiving millions of dollars in Department of  Education title IV funds, Ashford also heavily recruits veterans and  servicemembers who qualify for Department of Veterans Affairs G.I. bill  funds.   You see, for-profit colleges see veterans and servicemembers as gold.   Federal law prohibits for-profit colleges from receiving more than 90  percent of their revenue from Federal sources, but rather than counting  all taxpayer-funded education assistance programs, including VA G.I.  bill and Department of Defense tuition assistance, current law only  counts title IV funds as Federal revenue.   This means that by aggressively targeting and recruiting veterans and  servicemembers, for-profit colleges like Ashford can receive an  unlimited amount of their revenue straight from the Federal Treasury.   Marine veteran James Long found himself on the receiving end of that  aggressive recruiting. A few years ago, Bloomberg told his story:         His Humvee was struck by artillery shells in Iraq. He       suffered a severe brain injury. While recovering at Camp       Lejeune, he was visited by an Ashford recruiter who signed       him up for classes. But despite knowing he was enrolled, his       brain injury was so severe that he couldn't remember what       courses he was enrolled in.    The California Attorney General's complaint against Ashford includes  the stories of two other veterans.   First, an Army Reserve veteran referred to as P.M. was encouraged by  Ashford representatives to attend courses at a local community college  while taking classes at Ashford.   P.M. was told that, by attending a ground-based campus rather than  just Ashford's online classes, he would qualify for a higher monthly  housing allowance under the G.I. bill, and he could transfer his  community college credits toward his Ashford program. He was later  ``alarmed'' to find that Ashford limited the number of credits he could  transfer and refused to recognize some of the courses he had previously  completed.   As a result, P.M. had to take additional courses at Ashford,  receiving the lower housing allowance rate, to make up for the lost  credits. He then ``fell behind on his rent, had to take on another job  to keep up with his bills, and his credit score suffered.'' In  addition, he wasted part of his limited G.I. bill education benefits on  courses that he could not put toward a degree.   Another veteran, ``P.J.,'' was told that Ashford would accept most of  the 140 credits he had earned at other institutions and could expect to  graduate within 18 months. He was also assured that he would be able to  transfer his Ashford credits to a community college.  [[Page S1936]]    After he had already enrolled and began taking classes at Ashford,  P.J. discovered that Ashford had accepted none of his credits from  other schools despite their promises. When he later tried to transfer  his Ashford credits to two other schools, he found that neither would  accept them.   This is how Ashford treats veterans.   In recent years, Ashford has taken in as much as $38 million in G.I.  bill funds and is currently engaged in a fight to maintain eligibility  to receive these funds in the future.   Here is what it boils down to: Ashford is not approved for G.I. bill  benefits by the California State Approving Agency, a requirement for it  to be eligible for G.I. bill funds nationwide. The company has spent  months on dubious legal action and other schemes to skirt Federal G.I.  bill eligibility requirements. The matter is now in court.   With its G.I. bill eligibility in doubt, Ashford announced in  November it would voluntarily suspend new enrollments of veterans using  G.I. bill funds. This would prevent new veterans from being put at risk  and additional taxpayer dollars being wasted should the company lose  eligibility.   As reported by The Chronicle of Higher Education, the company resumed  new G.I. bill enrollments in February and acknowledged on a call with  investors that the suspension had ``negatively impacted fourth-quarter  performance.'' That is right; the company made the blatant decision  that profits are more important than veterans.   Last week, Senator Hassan and I sent a letter to Bridgepoint's CEO,  Andrew Clark, expressing our outrage and calling on him to immediately  halt new enrollments until their G.I. bill eligibility is resolved with  the VA. If the company fails to do so, it will lay bare the true  disregard they have for the students, especially veterans, they claim  to serve.   Also last week, Bridgepoint announced that it is up to even more  shenanigans. It will attempt to separate from Ashford and another  school it owns to become an Online Program Management company while  Ashford seeks to become a not-for-profit college. If approved, this  complicated maneuver would mean that Ashford would no longer have to  abide by the Federal 90-10 rule or other accountability measures  focused on for-profit colleges.   At the same time, other for-profit conversions have been structured  in a way that their owners are still able to personally profit from the  new not-for-profit entity. It is the best of both worlds for owners and  investors; the school is able to shed Federal accountability  requirements while still profiting off of students and taxpayers.   I call on the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Education,  and Ashford's accreditor--the WASC Senior College and University  Commission--to carefully scrutinize this proposal in light of other  dubious for-profit conversions and Bridgepoint's own long record of  misconduct.   Despite the closure of Corinthian and ITT Tech, companies like  Ashford continue to exploit students and veterans while raking in  billions in Federal taxpayer dollars, using every possible scheme they  can think of to do it.   Until Secretary DeVos stops siding with her friends in the for-profit  college industry or Congress acts, students will continue to be harmed  and taxpayer dollars will continue to line the pockets of cheats and  crooks.                            ____________________
