 Madam Speaker, an unborn child is a human life.  All you have to do is realize that.   Sixty-two million unborn human lives have been killed since Roe v.  Wade. That is almost 1.3 million a year of unborn human lives killed.  That is almost 3,500 a day or one every 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, in my 90 seconds, two unborn human lives have been  snuffed out.
