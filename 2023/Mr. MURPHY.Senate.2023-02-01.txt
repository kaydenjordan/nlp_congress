 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 21, submitted earlier  today; that at 3:30 p.m., the Senate vote on adoption of the  resolution; that if the resolution is agreed to, the preamble be  considered and agreed to and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor.    Madam President, if you were working for the sandwich  shop Jimmy John's--I don't know if the Presiding Officer has ever had a  Jimmy John's sandwich. It is a pretty good sandwich. If you were  working for Jimmy John's sandwich shop in the middle of the last  decade, around 2014, 2015, 2016, you might have been required to sign a  contract with Jimmy John's to make sandwiches. Buried in that contract,  as a fast food worker at Jimmy John's in 2014, 2015, 2016, was  something called a noncompete clause.   A lot of Americans have heard of noncompete clauses. They think of  them as applying to executives, individuals who make a lot of money,  who possess really intricate, detailed information about a product. But  Jimmy John's made everybody who came to work in many of their sandwich  shops sign a noncompete agreement. The noncompete agreement for Jimmy  John's sandwich makers said that if you ever left Jimmy John's, you  would not be able to work at any business within 2 to 3 miles of any  Jimmy John's for any company that made over 10 percent of its revenue  from selling ``submarine, hero-type, deli-style, pita, and/or wrapped  or rolled sandwiches'' for 2 years. Low-income, minimum-wage workers at  Jimmy John's, if they tried to leave that job, were prohibited from  going to work for Subway or going to work for D'Angelo's or maybe even,  according to this definition, McDonald's or Burger King.   Of course, that sounds patently ridiculous. Why would you need to  protect the intellectual secrets of sandwich making at Jimmy John's by  applying noncompete agreements for these low-income workers? But this  wasn't and isn't an anomaly. In fact, one out of six hospitality  restaurant workers, by some studies, has a noncompete agreement. Today,  noncompete agreements apply to one in five American workers. That is 30  million workers.  [[Page S208]]    Amazon warehouse workers were required for a long time to sign  noncompete agreements. I read a story the other day of a company called  Camp Bow Wow that pays people to pet-sit. They required their pet  sitters to sign noncompete agreements.   The reason that noncompete agreements are being used at industrial- level scale today is not to protect the trade secrets of sandwich  making or pet sitting; it is to keep wages down. It is to prevent low- income workers from being able to go out and get a better job and thus  pressure their existing employer to increase wages. This practice has  become pervasive throughout our economy, and it is just a fundamental  restraint on free trade.   Now, many of these noncompete agreements end up being nonenforceable.  A lot of State laws don't allow you to have a noncompete agreement for  a low-wage worker. But in practice, it doesn't really matter because  when that individual tries to leave and they get told they can't  because of a noncompete agreement, they don't know that it is  nonenforceable in State law or if they do know, they don't have the  resources to contest the cause in a court of law. So what do they do?  They just end up staying.   The FTC filed a complaint in January of this year against two  Michigan-based companies that required their security guards to sign  noncompete agreements prohibiting them from working for a competing  business within a 100-mile radius. Despite the fact that these security  guards were making very low wages, the company's noncompete included a  restriction that required the employee to pay a $100,000 penalty for  any alleged violation of the clause. The intention here is simply to  bind the employee to the company, to give them no ability to bargain  for a higher wage because they might be able to get a better wage  somewhere else. There is no proprietary information that those security  guards possess.   What is equally interesting is that there is increasingly great data  to show that there is actually no reason to have noncompete agreements  even for higher income workers. The imposition of noncompete agreements  on low-wage workers is primarily about just trying to restrain wages,  but the imposition of noncompete agreements on higher income workers is  about impeding innovation. It is about a company that doesn't want  competitors, so they bind their executives to noncompete agreements  such that their executives can't go work for a competing company or  can't go out and start a company that may compete.   What is so maddening is that there are plenty of protections in our  existing law that protect companies from intellectual property theft or  patent theft. If what you worry about is your trade secrets being  appropriated by a competitor, well, the law already protects you from  that. You don't have to deny your employees or your executives the  ability to go work for another company.   California rightly has the reputation as probably the world's center  of innovation, right? More startups, more world-changing companies have  come out of California than any other State and probably than any other  part of the world. California was the first or one of the first in this  country to ban noncompete agreements. California decided it didn't need  noncompete agreements to protect intellectual property in a State that  probably has a greater interest in protecting intellectual property  than any other State. In fact, California's economic engine is  dependent on their prohibition of noncompete agreements because by  prohibiting noncompete agreements, California has a culture in which  startups are encouraged, in which executives can leave one company and  start another.   Eric Yuan was an executive at Cisco Webex. If he wasn't working in  California, he might have had a noncompete agreement applied to him,  but he didn't, and so he could leave and start a company that was  arguably competing with Cisco Webex--a company called Zoom.   To many economists on the right and the left, this is becoming a no- brainer. Noncompete agreements are bad for wage growth. Noncompete  agreements are bad for innovation. Noncompete agreements are bad for  low-income workers. Noncompete agreements are bad for high-income  workers.   So today I am on the floor to talk about what the data tells us about  noncompete agreements as a means to encourage my colleagues to take a  look at a piece of legislation that we are introducing today, the  Workforce Mobility Act, a pretty simple piece of legislation that would  ban the use of noncompete agreements for both high-income and low- income workers.   It is a bipartisan piece of legislation. Senator Todd Young, Senator  Kevin Cramer, Senator Tim Kaine, and I are introducing this bill today.  I don't know that there is another policy that the four of us can find  common ground on, but we find common ground on this issue because maybe  if you are a progressive, you come to this issue through the rights of  workers and boosting their wages. If you are a conservative, you come  to this issue through the restraint on free trade that exists through  the perpetuation of noncompete agreements. But all across America, this  is a pretty bipartisan issue, and here in the Senate, it is bipartisan  as well.   I am glad that the FTC, just a week or so ago, announced that they  were going to undertake a rule to ban noncompete agreements. I  congratulate the Biden administration and the FTC for taking a  leadership role. It may be that that rule, once it is adopted and in  place, will do the work of this legislation, but we know that rules are  only as good as the commitment of one particular administration.   So my hope and my recommendation is that no matter what the FTC does  when it comes to restrictions on noncompete agreements, that we pass  the Workforce Mobility Act so that we provide a guarantee in the law  that noncompete agreements are not going to stand in the way of wages  rising or small businesses starting.   There is a lot of public support out there as 92 percent of voters  think that it is way too hard today to start or grow a new business and  as 80 percent of voters--again, across party lines--support policies  that allow people who want to start a new business more freedom by  reducing the restrictions that come when you try to venture out on your  own. Increasingly, one of the primary restrictions that exists for  people who want to start a new business, who want to become  entrepreneurs, are these noncompete agreements.   So I am coming to the floor today to recommend this bipartisan piece  of legislation to my colleagues, to point to the States that have  already adopted these restrictions, and to show how not only does the  sky not fall when you get rid of noncompete agreements but that  startups flourish and that wages increase.   Finally, I come to recommend to my colleagues that, in an environment  where it is going to be a little harder to find agreement between  Republicans and Democrats, this is a place where we can find that  common ground. In one piece of policy, we can stick up for low-income  workers and the free market. This is something that we can do together  to help raise wages and to help power our economy.                            ____________________     Madam President, if you were working for the sandwich  shop Jimmy John's--I don't know if the Presiding Officer has ever had a  Jimmy John's sandwich.
