 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Nassau County Sheriff's Deputy Joshua Moyers, who was tragically killed  last weekend in the line of duty.   On September 26, 2021, Deputy Moyers gave his last full measure of  devotion to our northeast Florida community. He was only 29 years old.  My heart breaks for his friends, fellow officers, and loved ones who  already miss him dearly.   Deputy Moyers graduated from Hilliard Middle-Senior High School,  Florida State College, and St. Johns River State College before joining  the Nassau County Sheriff's Office in 2015.   Madam Speaker, Joshua wasn't just a good officer; he was a great  officer. In fact, in 2018, Deputy Moyers received the ``Above and  Beyond the Call of Duty'' award for his work on a very significant  narcotics case.   Having spent a career in law enforcement, I have seen the names of  far too many outstanding officers go up on our National Law Enforcement  Memorial wall here in D.C. Deputy Moyers will be no exception.   His death serves as a tragic reminder of the dangers facing law  enforcement officers across the country every single day. We are so  thankful for men and women like Officer Moyers, who volunteer to step  into the breach in defense of our citizens, and we owe them a deep debt  of gratitude.   I am reminded of a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson, which says: ``The  purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be  honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that  you lived and lived well.''   Officer Moyers' life may have been cut short, but he lived with honor  and compassion, and he made a real difference, a tangible difference,  to so many lives on the First Coast.   I am grateful to the Nassau County Sheriff's Office for capturing the  man responsible for his death, and I hope that justice will be swiftly  served.   May God bless the Moyers family, and may He give them the strength to  persevere during this difficult time.   Madam Speaker, I would like to now ask that this Chamber join me for  a moment of silence in remembrance of Officer Moyers.                            ____________________
