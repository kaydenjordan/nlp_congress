 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark Pride Month and to tell  members of the LGBTQ community that they are seen, that they are  supported, and that they deserve the same rights, responsibilities, and  protections as every other American.   That shouldn't be a controversial statement but we know that many  LGBTQ Americans face discrimination and are targets of an intensifying  effort to deny their right to simply live as their authentic selves.   Pride is a time to celebrate our differences and the diversity that  helps make our country great. It is a time to mark the progress that we  have made, and it is a time to rededicate ourselves to the unfinished  work to achieve freedom and equality for all.   As co-chair of the LGBTQ Equality Caucus, I am continuing to work to  pass legislation that will protect benefits for veterans, that will ban  the use of so-called panic defenses in Federal court, and will protect  Americans from discrimination by passing the Equality Act.   No one chooses to be LGBTQ, but America can choose to continue to  have an open mind and an open heart and a commitment to a future that  includes everyone, regardless of who we are or whom we love.   I wish everyone a happy Pride Month.                            ____________________
