 Mr. Speaker, climate change is already wreaking economic  and security havoc: deep freezes; an incredible 5 feet of water dumped  on Houston, Texas, by a hurricane; in other areas, droughts, amazing  wildfires, and extensive disease.   What we need is alternative energy, not Trump ``alternative facts,''  and decisions that are based on science, not on mythology. President  Trump's rejection of sound climate change facts only makes Chinese  clean energy great again.   We need to lead on the road to clean green energy, not get run over.  Fighting climate change is an existential challenge, but it is also an  amazing economic opportunity. We can create green jobs right here with  technology that is exported to the world, instead of letting our  international competitors prevail.   Recommitting to the Paris climate agreement is more than bipartisan.  It is joining 2,000 American businesses. It is joining 23 States. It is  joining cities across America, like San Antonio and Austin, that have  already pledged that they want climate action, not more nonsense and  climate denying.    It is joining 21 senior Defense officials who identify  climate change action as a way to address a major national security  challenge.   President Trump continues to block meaningful environmental action by  clogging the corridors of power with fossil fuel industry cheerleaders.  A Green New Deal is an alternative to the same old dirty deal  threatening our planet with dark money, where the only thing green is  that money clogging and polluting our democracy.   Climate action does bear some costs, but inaction has even greater  costs. Let's embrace the simple truth that preserving the Earth is  worth it. Let's embrace an America that is leading on a green economic  revolution.
