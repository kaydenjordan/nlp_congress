 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of family farmers  throughout the Midwest and in my home State of Minnesota. We are facing  a year of unseasonably wet conditions, leaving many producers weighing  their options for the future of their farms.   I am proud to join my colleague, Representative Dusty Johnson of  South Dakota, in introducing the FEEDD Act, a bipartisan bill to give  farmers flexibility to graze and harvest cover crops on prevent plant  acres.   Congress has a responsibility to do right by our Nation's farmers who  feed, clothe, and fuel our communities by providing them the  flexibility they need to do their jobs successfully. This bill will  help alleviate concerns of a forage shortage and improve soil health  through the use of cover crops.   This is a bipartisan, commonsense solution, and we need a whole lot  more of that in this House. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to come together and support this bill and stand up for our  farmers throughout the country.                            ____________________
