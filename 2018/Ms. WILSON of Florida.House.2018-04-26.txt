 Mr. Chair, I was not present for the following  votes because I chose to remain in my congressional district in Miami  for an important district event.   Had I been present, I would have voted: ``yes'' on rollcall Vote No.  155; ``no'' on rollcall Vote No. 156; ``no'' on rollcall Vote No. 157;  ``no'' on rollcall Vote No. 158; ``no'' on rollcall Vote No. 159; and  ``yes'' on rollcall Vote No. 160.
