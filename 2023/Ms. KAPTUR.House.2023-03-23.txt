 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight major challenges  plaguing our banking and financial sector to the detriment of everyday  Americans. Specifically, I refer to banking deregulation, lax  oversight, and major consolidation.   Albert Einstein said that insanity is doing the same thing over and  over again and expecting different results. Well, the most recent  financial market tremors follow the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in  California and Signature Bank in New York. These events remind us that  our economy is still digging out of the 2008 massive market collapse.   The key question is: Do U.S. banking laws still allow too much  speculative financial activity and excessive risk-taking?   Just three trillion-dollar megabanks now control one-third of U.S.  banking assets. This chart tells the story. That is too much power by  too few.   The financial crash of 2008 was a harsh reminder that, throughout  U.S. history, speculators have squeezed through every regulatory  keyhole to bring their much higher-risk, reckless, speculative ventures  inside the confines of what should be prudent banking.   Regulators must provide firm separation between speculation and  prudent banking. Regulators must provide firm separation. Do they hear  me?   SVB was investing in speculative Chinese tech startups. How about  that? Signature was intertwined with Swiss Bank's operations and  cryptocurrency. Well, both banks collapsed.   History has taught us that speculation, derivatives, and venture  capital are not normal banking activities. They are much higher risk,  and their complexity and uncertainty can threaten the assets of other  depositors like me and my constituents who choose not to highly  leverage their assets. We should protect American depositors from  rampant speculation.   The Biden administration is working to stem the bleeding. Management  of both failed banks was shown the door, and the Federal Reserve, for  the moment, put in place programs for banks or credit unions to meet  their depositors' withdrawal requests.   After these collapses of SVB and Signature, both high-risk mega  coastal banks, I might add, where all of our major financial problems  have started over my term of service, which is long, we are all  enduring a truly troubling trend of massive bank consolidation that has  been happening since the 1980s.   The pandemic pushed even more consolidation into overdrive. Another 9  percent of all branch locations in the U.S. closed between 2017 and  2021, a loss of 7,500 more brick-and-mortar locations in places where  the American people live and work.   The empty buildings pockmark every community across our country. The  branch closure rate doubled again during the pandemic, and more than  4,000 more branches have closed since March 2020.   People, pay attention. The money is walking away from your community  to the very institutions that are causing the problem.   The rate doubled for bank closures from 99 per month during the 10  years prior to the pandemic to now 201 closings per month. The big fish  are eating the smaller fish.   Those of us who have fought against the megabank culture that  squashes prudent banking need look no further than the severe  diminishment of market share held by local and regional banks over the  last 40 years.   Step one is to reinstate Glass-Steagall's separation of prudent  banking and speculation. The second is to develop a decoupled financial  system that strengthens regional banks to manage an increasing share of  local housing finance and commercial loans.   Soon, I will reintroduce in this Congress the Return to Prudent  Banking Act, and I invite all of my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to  join me. This bill would put America back on a path to fixing reckless  speculation inside our banking and financial sector. As a result, no  single company could be both an investment and a commercial bank.  [[Page H1332]]    This structure worked for decades. It proved to be a sound way of  creating local economic growth and limiting the systemic risks posed by  hiding reckless speculation and venture capital inside our financial  institutions.   They have a right to exist but put them elsewhere in the system.  Depositors' safety, not speculation, must be our objective.   We must strengthen regional and community banks. In the wake of SVB  and Signature Bank, the time is now. Congress must implement real  reforms to protect depositors and the American economy.   Congress must demonstrate we stand with the American people and their  communities, not just for the coastal scions of massive wealth who use  the safety of our deposits for their reckless, speculative gambles.  Prudent banking should be rewarded, not reckless behavior.                            ____________________
