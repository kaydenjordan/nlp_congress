 Mr. President, I recognize Brian D'Isernia as he  retires from a distinguished 53-year career as a lawyer, fisherman,  sailor, and shipbuilder at Eastern Shipbuilding Group of Panama City,  FL.   Brian graduated from Georgetown University with a bachelor's degree  in economics and a law degree from Fordham University School of Law. He  passed the New York State Bar, practicing for a few years before  changing careers and opening his commercial fishing enterprise out of  New Bedford, MA.   Operating his commercial fishing business for 8 years, it eventually  grew to become a vessel construction shipyard. Constructing fishing  boats allowed Brian to design fishing vessels his way. These designs  quickly drew the attention of other professionals in the boating  industry, and customers soon contacted Eastern Shipbuilding Group from  across the Nation.   By the 1980s, Brian's reputation was that his shipyard could fulfill  any custom vessel request. Today, Eastern Shipbuilding Group's vessel  portfolio consists of more than 350 vessels, with many used by  commercial fishermen and the U.S. Coast Guard. His work was recognized  in 2017 by receiving the National Maritime Historical Society's  Distinguished Service Award.   Brian's work over the decades has made a lasting impact on the  boating industry. As he embarks on his new retirement journey, Eastern  Shipbuilding remains a family-owned and operated business led by the  next generation of his family.   I extend my best wishes to Brian, his wife Miriam, their children,  and grandchildren.                            ____________________
