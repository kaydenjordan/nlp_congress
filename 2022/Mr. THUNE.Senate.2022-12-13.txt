 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last Tuesday, President Biden was asked why  he wasn't taking the opportunity to visit the border while traveling to  Arizona. His reply? ``Because there [is a] more important [thing] going  on.''   ``[A] more important [thing] going on.''   Mr. President, no offense to new investment, but if President Biden  thinks that visiting a plant to celebrate new investment is more  important than the security and the humanitarian crises raging at our  southern border, then his priorities are seriously out of order, but,  of course, we already knew that.   This is hardly the first time the President has made it clear what he  thinks of the crisis at our southern border--as just an annoying  distraction from what he would rather be doing as President. In fact,  he has shown a remarkable ability throughout his Presidency to ignore  or minimize crises that he isn't interested in dealing with.   ``There [is a] more important [thing] going on.''   I venture to suggest that for overwhelmed border communities  struggling with an apparently never-ending influx of illegal  immigration, there isn't anything--anything--more important going on,  and the President's  [[Page S7110]]  trivializing of our border crisis is a serious betrayal of the  responsibility he owes to these Americans and to all Americans.   The situation at our southern border is out of control and has been  that way for most of the President's administration. Over this past  weekend alone, Customs and Border Protection encountered more than  16,000 individuals attempting to cross our southern border illegally.  That is an average of 8,000 per day--higher than the daily average in  May, which posted the highest number of attempted illegal crossings  ever recorded. October saw a staggering 230,678 attempted illegal  crossings along our southern border.   All told, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered nearly 2.4  million individuals attempting to cross our southern border illegally  during fiscal year 2022. That is the highest number ever recorded,  exceeding the previous record set the year before by roughly 640,000.  Of course, these numbers just refer to individuals the Border Patrol  actually apprehended. There have also been almost 1 million known  ``got-aways'' over the past 2 fiscal years and an untold number of  unknown ``got-aways.''   President Biden's comment doesn't just trivialize the scope of this  crisis; it also trivializes the human misery that has resulted. At  least 853 migrants died crossing the southern border in fiscal year  2022--the highest number ever recorded. It is hard to imagine that that  number wouldn't have been smaller if President Biden had gotten serious  about addressing this border crisis instead of inviting illegal  immigration with his lax border policies.   I mentioned overwhelmed border communities. I should also mention the  incredible strain the past 2 years have placed on the Border Patrol,  which has been forced to divert agents from border enforcement to the  overwhelmed humanitarian mission. Then, of course, there is the very  real danger represented by unchecked illegal immigration, including the  risk of dangerous individuals entering our country undetected and the  potential for increased drug trafficking.   Illegal drugs are flowing across our southern border and contributing  to violent crime not just in border communities but in communities  around the Nation. And that is not even to mention our Nation's  fentanyl crisis, which is being fed by drugs that are trafficked  across--where else?--our southern border. Our current border crisis is  an open invitation to increased illegal drug activity, but the  President has more important places to be than the southern border even  though, I should point out, he has never actually visited the southern  border--not once. The closest he got was literally driving by the  border on the way to a campaign rally in 2008.    For border communities and strained Border Patrol agents, I venture  to say that there is nothing more important than getting our Nation's  border crisis under control, but I guess we will just have to keep  waiting. After all, the President has more important things to do.                                  Inflation    Mr. President, in other tone-deaf comments from the Biden  administration last week, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said:         Fiscal responsibility is very important to us in the Biden       administration. We're very well aware that we have to stay       within our means economically. I think . . . you see that in       everything we've tried to do these past two years.    That was from the President's Chief of Staff.   Well, when I read that, I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry or just  be angry on behalf of the millions of Americans who are currently  suffering as a result of the Democrats' lack of fiscal responsibility  over the past 2 years. We are currently in the midst of the worst  inflation crisis in 40 years. My daughters, who are married and have  their own children now, weren't even alive the last time inflation was  this bad.   November's inflation numbers came out this morning, and they just  confirmed what we already know: that we are still very much in the  midst of this crisis. Currently, inflation is up 13.8 percent since  January of 2021, when President Biden took office. Even if our  inflation crisis ended tomorrow, the inflation we have already  experienced will cost the average household more than $9,000 over the  next 12 months--$9,000. Now, for a lot of families, that is the  difference between prosperity and just getting by. For many others, it  is the difference between just getting by and not being able to get by  at all.   How did we get here? Well, in substantial part, it is thanks to the  President's and Democrats' fiscal irresponsibility.   When Democrats took office in January 2021, Congress had just passed  a fifth bipartisan COVID bill that met essentially all of the current  pressing COVID needs, but the Democrats just wanted to keep spending.  So, despite being warned that the size of the package they were  contemplating risked overheating our economy, under the guise of COVID  relief, the Democrats passed a massive and partisan $1.9 trillion  spending bill filled with unnecessary spending and payoffs to the  Democrats' interest groups. The economy, not surprisingly, overheated  as a result. Inflation began climbing and climbing and climbing again.   But what is almost worse and what makes the White House's claim that  they care about fiscal responsibility so incredibly ludicrous is what  the Democrats and the President did next. Even as it became clear that  their massive spending spree had helped set off a serious inflation  problem, the Democrats and the President kept pushing for more  spending. In fact, their goal, which they were, fortunately, prevented  from achieving, was passing another massive spending spree in the  neighborhood of $5 trillion.   Even after that plan was foiled, the Democrats and the President kept  right on pursuing more fiscally irresponsible legislation. In August,  the Democrats passed legislation, their so-called Inflation Reduction  Act--again filled with hundreds of billions of dollars in Green New  Deal spending, partially financed by tax hikes that will raise energy  prices and slow job creation.   Democrats tried to clothe the bill in an aura of fiscal  responsibility by claiming--dubiously, I might add--that it would  reduce the deficit by $300 billion.   Do you want to know how long that purported deficit reduction lasted  once the bill was signed into law? Eight days. Eight days. That is how  long it took for President Biden to completely wipe out any deficit  reduction of the bill by implementing his massive student loan  giveaway--a giveaway that not only wipes out any possible deficit  reduction but will also, according to the Committee for a Responsible  Federal Budget, ``meaningfully boost inflation.'' Yet we are supposed  to believe that the Biden administration values fiscal responsibility.   When it comes to fiscal responsibility, the Biden administration has  demonstrated that it could not care less. The Biden administration is  interested in implementing the big-government priorities of the far  left, no matter how much they cost. And, unfortunately, the American  people are the ones paying the price.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
