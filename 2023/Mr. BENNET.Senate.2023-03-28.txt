 Mr. President, this week, the Senate debates whether to  end two authorizations of the use of military force against Iraq.  Congress passed the first authorization in 1991 for the original Gulf  war, a strategic and narrowly scoped campaign to liberate Kuwait and  punish Saddam Hussein's unlawful aggression.   Congress passed the second one in 2002, paving the way for the  disastrous invasion and occupation of Iraq and the biggest blunder in  the history of American foreign policy.   We have spent far too little time on this floor considering the  legacy of both wars, and I want to thank Senators Kaine and Senator  Young for this long overdue debate about the constitutional  responsibility of Congress in our foreign policy.   Most Americans, I think, would be surprised to learn that Congress  has much of a role in foreign policy because for virtually my entire  time in the Senate, there has been very little evidence that we have  played one.   The Founders envisioned a very specific role for Congress, and it  wasn't to micromanage foreign policy. They knew matters of war and  peace required a level of coherence and action at odds with a  legislative branch that, by design, often moves slowly and encourages  disagreement and some would say sometimes even incoherence.   But if the Founders had a reason for giving the Executive broad  flexibility to conduct war, they also had a reason for giving Congress  sole power to declare war.   They wanted to make it hard to start a war, not easy. They knew that  Presidents would often find war tempting as a means to amass power, run  roughshod over our constitutional checks and balances. From their study  of ancient times, they also understood the ways in which endless war  threatened and undermined democracy.   Here is what James Madison wrote in 1795, just 6 years after  ratification of the Constitution:         Of all the enemies to public liberty, war is, perhaps, the       most to be dreaded. . . . No nation could preserve its       freedom in the midst of continued warfare.    The Founders understood this because they studied history. They knew  our history better than we know it ourselves, and they sought to apply  its lessons to decisions in their time. For example, they read about  how the 27-year war between Athens and Sparta corroded Athenian  democracy from within by straining its economy, by feeding unrest, and  creating a vacuum for strongmen who were peddling easy answers to  difficult questions.   That is why they gave Congress--not the President--the sole power to  declare war, but also to ratify treaties, confirm our military and  diplomatic leaders, and approve our budget for national security. And  they expected Congress to oversee foreign policy actively on behalf of  the American people.   If we look back over the last 30 years--twice the length of time that  the pages on this floor have even been  [[Page S986]]  alive. If you look at the last 30 years from when Congress first  authorized the use of force against Iraq until today, what can we say  about how Congress has lived up to its responsibility? Has Congress  fulfilled the responsibility that the Framers gave it? I am afraid  there is not very much that is good in that record.   For 30 years, I would argue, this body has been derelict in its  responsibility, and it has come at a terrible time and with a terrible  price--a terrible price. If we go back three decades to the early  nineties, I had just started law school. The first President Bush was  in the White House, and we were living in the early years of a post- Cold War world. President Bush had inherited what he called a new world  order following the collapse of the Soviet Union. We didn't really  appreciate it at the time, but when the Soviet Union collapsed, the  United States lost a fundamental organizing principle that had been  with us, really, for decades.   The Cold War was not just a fight against the Soviets; it was a fight  against tyranny. For Americans of my generation, the Cold War defined  our foreign policy for good and for ill. It also defined us as a people  and defined who we were not. It gave us purpose. It unified us. It made  us deliberate about our role in the world.   The Presiding Officer may have read today--I did--a new poll from the  University of Chicago where, for the first time, there is a vast  minority of Americans who say patriotism is important to them; for the  first time, there is a vast minority of Americans who say religion is  important to them. You know, the vast majority of people are worried  that they are not going to provide something better for the next  generation, which is where I think a lot of that comes from.   But think about that change--that change--from when we were being  raised to how people feel about it today. It is dramatic. I would say  we can't give up. There is a lot of patriotic business for us to do,  not just on the floor of the Senate but in America today. I would  argue--and I will in a minute--there is as much for us to do now as  when we were in the Cold War and we were having our fight with the  Soviet Union.   Those principles of sort of engagement and disengagement, of  agreement and disagreement, but a way of thinking about the world also  had an important effect in terms of constraining our actions, limiting,  to some extent, our behavior abroad and disciplining our politics at  home.   In the fight against communism, we made more than our fair share of  egregious mistakes, to be sure. Among them--the worst--the Vietnam war.  But I would say, still, our foreign policy in those days and the values  that underlay it in total, in sum, strengthened our democracy at home  and advanced U.S. interests abroad--not perfectly but mostly.   The fall of the Berlin Wall disoriented us. Could America continue to  lead the world without the moral and political organizing principle of  an ideological foe? That was the question. One answer was to reject the  question, to sort of assume it away; that to imagine that the triumph  over Soviet communism meant that the liberal order--our democracy and  capitalism--had prevailed. And there were people writing books about  the end of history, if the Presiding Officer will remember, saying that  is exactly what had happened.   When Saddam Hussein threatened that new world order by invading his  neighbor Kuwait, the U.S. rallied the world to drive him out. In just 7  months, our military routed the Iraqi Army, liberated Kuwait, and  effectively put Saddam Hussein in a box. George H.W. Bush showed  restraint. The first President Bush showed restraint. No country in the  world--no tyrant in the world--was more locked down by our no-fly zone  than Saddam Hussein's Iraq.   We had built international support from all over the world for what  George Bush had done. You think it wasn't a hard decision for him to  say we could go into Baghdad--we could go in and get that terrible  dictator--but he knew we didn't have an answer for the sectarian  violence that would break out in the aftermath of toppling Saddam  Hussein, so he showed restraint.   I think, at the time, our total and swift victory gave confidence to  those who believed that our political project was done; that history  had ended; that we had finally swept tyranny into the dustbin of  history; and that all we had to do was clap our hands, sit back, and  watch democracy spread.   Unfortunately, as is often the case in human events--as is always the  case in human events--reality turned out to be far messier. That naive  optimism ended when al-Qaida flew planes into the World Trade Center  and the Pentagon and crashed a plane in Pennsylvania, murdering 3,000  of our fellow Americans.    So the first decade of the 2000s was characterized by a single-minded  focus on responding to the pain, to the shock, and to the tragedy of 9/ 11.   All of this, I think, had an incredibly disorienting effect. Since  those times, since those days, we have been fighting not a Cold War  against a single rival power but a perpetual Global War on Terror that  finds enemies everywhere and has led to catastrophic decisions; a  perpetual war on terror that has terrorized us. And this endless war  led Congress to cede vast authority to the President to wage that war,  surrendering our constitutional responsibility to set the boundaries,  to debate the wisdom, and oversee the use of lethal force in the name  of the American people, which is one of the reasons that we were sent  here in the first place.   In the first Gulf war, Congress's deference to the executive had no  significant consequences because the first Bush administration actually  had a coherent strategy based on limited and achievable objectives:  liberate Kuwait, defeat the Iraqi Army, contain Saddam.   After 9/11, congressional deference cost the American people and our  leadership in the world dearly.   In Afghanistan, what began as a limited mission to destroy al-Qaida  metastasized into a 20-year campaign to transform the country into a  liberal democracy, something Afghanistan would never become--certainly  not over that time period and probably not in our own lives--and a cost  of over 2,300 American servicemembers, nearly 4,000 contractors, and  over 46,000 Afghan civilians.   In 2002, when the second President Bush came to Congress and  misrepresented the threat of weapons of mass destruction--which Saddam  had destroyed years before and which many of our allies and our own  intelligence Agencies doubted that he had--when they claimed that  Saddam's secular regime was somehow tied to al-Qaida, a terrorist group  driven by religious fanaticism, when they said the war could pay for  itself with Iraqi oil, conclude in months, not years, and that we could  somehow turn a Nation whose sectarian rivalries Saddam had prevented  from exploding through violence and oppression into yet another  pluralistic democracy; most people in Congress went along for the  ride--except, I should say, for a few of my colleagues still in this  body, including Senator Durbin; Senator Murray; Senator Reed; Senator  Stabenow; Senator Wyden; my former senior Senator Mark Udall, then a  Member of the House--I say to the pages that are here: Mark their names  into history books for the vote that they took. That was a courageous  vote that they took. I believe the Presiding Officer's--he is not  here--but I believe the Presiding Officer's predecessor, Chairman Leahy  from the great State of Vermont, took that courageous vote as well.   Except for the handful of them and my colleague Mark Udall, then a  Member of the House--except for them, almost no one here asked if there  was even a strategy or what it was. They didn't ask how toppling a  Sunni dictator in a Shia majority country would strengthen Iran. And I  can assure you, they didn't ask what China was doing, as we committed  ourselves to a second nation-building project in the Middle East.   And by acquiescing to the President, Congress essentially cut off the  American people from the vital debate about the true cost and  consequences of the war.   And in the end, the cost was terrible. The Iraq war killed over 4,600  American servicemembers and over 3,600 contractors. Over 50 times--50  times--more troops were killed or injured in the post-war insurgency  than in the original march to Baghdad. The war killed  [[Page S987]]  200,000 Iraqi civilians and displaced over 9 million people. It left  the country in ruins and its identity in tatters.   Twenty years later, Iraqis are still trying to pick up the pieces.  Since the war, corruption has stolen $150 billion of Iraq's wealth.  That is over half of the country's entire GDP last year. Twenty years  later, Iran is also in a stronger position than ever, seizing on the  vacuum we created with proxies from Iraq to Syria to Lebanon to Yemen,  threatening our troops in the region and vital allies like Israel.   China is cutting deals today. Having avoided those 20 years of  bedlam, they are now showing up and making peace agreements between the  Iranians and the Saudis, not having paid the price that we've paid. And  20 years later, America's global leadership and credibility have yet to  recover as a result of the decisions that we made.   In the name of spreading freedom across the globe, we, instead,  spread images of chaos and civil strife, of torture at Abu Ghraib, of  waterboarding and black sites--all violations of the values that we  claimed to serve; that I believe we do serve.   And to pay for it all, we borrowed $8 trillion from our children--$8  trillion--from the next generation of Americans.   In fact, we were so committed to not paying for that war, to not  sacrificing the way our parents and grandparents did when they were  engaged in wars, we were so committed to not bearing the burden that we  cut taxes twice and borrowed another $10 trillion from our children to  pay for those.   Imagine what we could have done for this country if we had spent that  $18 trillion here at home, the good-paying jobs we could have created,  the 21st-century industries and infrastructure we could have built, the  opportunities we could have created for the next generation of  Americans. Instead, from their perspective, we would have been better  off lighting that $18 trillion on fire.   I bring this up not to relitigate the past but to remind us of the  profound cost to America and the world of giving Presidents a blank  check in foreign policy, of shirking our constitutional responsibility,  our duty to provide real oversight and hold the Executive accountable  to our democratic values, to the rule of law, and to the voices and  opinions of the American people.   We should acknowledge that there will be moments when doing so will  be inconvenient for us in the short term. There are countries around  the world that are not inconvenienced by the set of values we purport  to live by. The fact that they are inconvenient doesn't mean they are  not right.   As the Founders understood, there is always going to be a temptation  to trade freedom for the illusion of security, to act instead of  consult, to ignore our commitment to human rights and the rule of law  for expediency, or to turn a blind eye to corruption or incompetence by  a President of your own party--especially of your own party. But over  the long term, our willingness to resist those temptations I think is  what makes America different. It is what makes our foreign policy  different at its best. It is what has made us a beacon to the world  even if our light has flickered at times. It is why the world doesn't  look to China or to Russia for moral leadership; it looks to us.  Because American foreign policy at its best has never been about  serving the whims of a tyrant or a party boss; it is about serving the  American people and offering a better vision for humanity through the  power of our example and our partnership with the world. And it is why  we in Congress have to take our roles seriously in this democracy--we  really do--to take our obligation to the American people just as  seriously and not simply honor our constitutional balance of power in  the breach but every single time.   So my hope is that this modest vote we are going to take is the  beginning of a new commitment by Congress to fulfill our constitutional  responsibility, to bring the American people back into this  conversation about what our global leadership should look like in the  21st century, and to work in partnership with the President to define a  new organizing principle for our leadership because we don't have  another 30 years to wait, and the whole world is watching.   I, for one, know that--I think when we pick up the enduring values  that reflect our foreign policy at its best, that reflect a sense of  justice here at home as well, when we can stand for both freedom and  for opportunity, which we have decade after decade after decade, there  is a coalition of countries all around the world that would rather sign  up to that vision than sign up to the tyranny that is on offer from  other societies.   But we have to remember what the Founders told us. In our time, we  have to exercise this responsibility that we have here in Congress, and  we need to do the work faithfully that the American people sent us here  to do.   I yield the floor.
