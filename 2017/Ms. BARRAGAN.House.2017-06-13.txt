 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the San Pedro  High School girls softball team who late last month reclaimed their  crown as L.A. City Section Division I champions.   On the night of Friday, May 19, the Pirates won their first city  title in 8 years and 17th overall. Star pitcher Cindy Robles persevered  through illness to throw a four-hitter with three strikeouts,  illustrating her toughness after coming down with a 102-degree fever  earlier in the day.   Her teammates were behind her every step of the way, always making  the key play at the necessary moment. By rallying together and  continually picking each other up, the Pirates girls softball team  represents the true spirit of California's 44th Congressional District.   No matter what adversity we might face individually, our community  always finds a way to rally together in pursuit of our common goals.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to these strong young women  and all they represent.                            ____________________
