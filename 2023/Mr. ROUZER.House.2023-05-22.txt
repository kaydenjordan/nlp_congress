 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career and service  of Brunswick County Sheriff John Ingram, who recently retired from his  long and distinguished tenure in law enforcement.   A proud native of Brunswick County, Sheriff Ingram dedicated his life  to his community by joining the Brunswick County Sheriff's Department  in 1991. Starting as a patrol deputy, he quickly rose through the ranks  and served in many different capacities, including in the warrant and  detective divisions, and then became lieutenant in the narcotics  division and commander of the department's SWAT team.   Mr. Ingram later joined the Columbus County Sheriff's Office, where  he was named chief deputy before returning to Brunswick County in the  same role. Shortly thereafter, he was appointed Brunswick County  Sheriff, earning reelection to the post in each and every election  since.   During his tenure leading the Brunswick County Sheriff's Office, he  expanded the department to accommodate the fastest growing county in  the State. He increased recruitment efforts and brought in additional  911 telecommunicators and detention officers to increase safety.  [[Page H2466]]    He also offered a variety of community programs to further the  sheriff's office mission to enhance public safety and education and  promote community-based relationships between law enforcement and the  public, including his support for establishing drug courts where those  battling addiction could be better treated and not only treated but  provided with a path to recovery.   To facilitate these missions, he created the Sheriff's Citizens'  Academy along with the Sheriff's Volunteer Program. He also launched  the Anchor Initiative Program in 2018 to help those suffering from  addiction start their recovery, providing hope for those suffering from  their addictions and breaking the typical continual cycle of continued  drug use and crime.   Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Ingram has been recognized  for his leadership on all these fronts. He was elected to the board of  directors for the National Sheriffs' Association and served as  president of the North Carolina Sheriffs' Association from 2019 to  2020.   Most recently, he was awarded the prestigious Order of the Long Leaf  Pine, a recognition considered North Carolina's highest civilian honor.   It is an honor to recognize a friend who is a no-nonsense individual  with such a sense of duty, integrity, and distinguished service to the  people of Brunswick County.   On behalf of the citizens of North Carolina's Seventh Congressional  District, I congratulate and extend my sincere gratitude to Sheriff  Ingram for his extraordinary service and commitment to protecting our  communities.   May God continue to bless him, his family, and the Brunswick County  Sheriff's Office. I am proud to call him my friend.                            ____________________
