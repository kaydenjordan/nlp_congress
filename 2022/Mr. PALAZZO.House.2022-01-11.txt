 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remind the American  people that our national security is still under attack at the U.S.- Mexico border. The violation of our borders has been allowed to happen  and is even facilitated by the Biden administration for nearly a year.   Since Joe Biden took office, over 1.7 million illegal immigrants have  been apprehended at the southern border. What is worse, Joe is flying  these individuals deeper into our Nation with a ticket you paid for.   Because of President Biden's failed open border policies, more drugs  have been smuggled into our neighborhoods than ever before. CBP  estimates that nearly 1,200 pounds of fentanyl were apprehended last  year alone, doubling from the prior year.   Fentanyl flowing through Joe's open border has caused unthinkable  harm by poisoning our communities and killing our children.   The Biden administration's failure has had costly consequences.  Cartels are profiting while Americans are paying with their tax  dollars, safety, and lives.   Border security is national security. It is time to stop risking the  safety of innocents for the sake of politics. This crisis has gone on  long enough. Americans deserve better. They deserve a closed border,  and they deserve to be safe.                            ____________________
