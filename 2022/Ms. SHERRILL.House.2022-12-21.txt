 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that it may be in  order at any time today, for the Speaker to declare a recess, subject  to the call of the Chair, for the purpose of receiving in joint meeting  His Excellency Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today for two important reasons;  first, in support of the bipartisan Equal Pay for Team USA Act to  ensure that female athletes on Team USA may finally receive the equal  compensation and benefits they have long deserved.   Earlier this year, we saw the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team  successfully fight for equal pay between the men's and women's teams.  It is now time for Congress to act and provide this same level of  equality for all women competing on behalf of the United States  globally.   That is why my colleague and I, Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South  Carolina, led a bipartisan group of Members sending a letter to House  leadership urging them to bring this bill to the House floor for a vote  before the end of the 117th Congress.   I thank Senators Capito and Cantwell for introducing this important  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on Equal Pay for  Team USA Act.   It is truly appropriate that when talking about strong, impressive  women, I stand here to deliver a tribute to a dear friend of mine,  Congresswoman Elaine Luria.   We entered Congress as the first two women from the United States  Naval Academy to serve in the House, and she has been a constant and  resolute champion of all things of the United States Navy. I have been  proud to serve with her and will miss her in my time in Congress.                            ____________________
