 Madam President, like the Senator from Texas, I wish to  speak about the so-called chips bill, but my perspective is, to say the  least, a little bit different.   To my mind, what the chips bill represents is the question of whether  or not we will have priorities in this country that represent the needs  of working families and the middle class or whether this institution,  the entire Congress, is totally beholden to wealthy and powerful  corporate interests.   I do not argue with anyone who makes the point that there is a global  shortage in microchips and semiconductors, which is making it harder  for manufacturers to produce the cars, the cell phones, the household  appliances, and the electronic equipment that we need. This shortage  is, in fact, costing American workers good-paying jobs and raising  prices for families. And that is why I personally strongly support the  need to expand U.S. microchip production.   But the question that we should be asking is this: Should American  taxpayers provide the microchip industry with a blank check--blank  check--of over $76 billion at the same exact time when semiconductor  companies are making tens of billions of dollars in profits and paying  their CEOs exorbitant compensation packages?   That really is one of the questions that we should be asking, and I  think the answer to that is a resounding no. This is an enormously  profitable industry.   According to an Associated Press article that I read today, Senator  Romney, reflecting the views, I think, of many--I think Senator Cornyn  made the same point--but Senator Romney was quoted as saying that when  other countries subsidize the manufacturing of high technology chips,  the United States must join the club--must join the club.   ``If you don't play like they play, then you are not going to be  manufacturing high technology chips, and they are essential for our  national defense as well as our economy,'' Senator Romney said.    Now, I find the position of Senator Romney and others to be really  quite interesting because I personally have been on this floor many,  many times urging the Senate to look to other countries around the  world and learn from those countries. And what I have said is that it  is a bit absurd that here in the United States we are the only major  country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all of their people.  And Senator Romney says ``join the club,'' and I agree. Let's join the  club and not spend twice as much per capita on healthcare as the  Canadians, as the British, as the French. Let's join that club and  guarantee healthcare to all people, rather than making the insurance  companies billions in profits every single year.   Senator Romney says ``join the club,'' and I agree. We should join  the club in terms of higher education. Germany today, and other  countries around the world, make sure that their young people can go to  their colleges and universities tuition-free so that they don't have to  leave school 40, 50, or $100,000 in debt. Let's join the club. Let's do  what Germany and other countries are doing, which makes eminent sense  in every sense of the word. Let's guarantee the right of all of our  kids, regardless of their income, to get a higher education. Let's join  the club.   And there is another club that I think we might want to join, among  many others. We are the only major country--virtually the only country  on Earth--that does not guarantee paid family and medical leave. There  are women today in the United States of America having a baby, and they  will be back at work in a week because they need the income--no  guaranteed paid family medical leave. There are people getting fired  today because their kids are sick. They have to make the choice whether  they hang on to their jobs or take care of their sick kids.   Let's join the club. Let's do what not only every major country on  Earth does in terms of guaranteed paid family and medical, but what  virtually all countries, including some of the poorest, in the world  do.   But I gather the problem is that to join those clubs in terms of  universal healthcare, in terms of paid family and medical leave, in  terms of free tuition and public colleges and universities, we are  going to have to take on powerful special interests, and they make  campaign contributions. And that is not what the Senate does.   When it comes to joining the club with other countries giving blank  checks to large corporations, that is a club that, unfortunately, many  of my colleagues here feel comfortable in joining.   So, apparently, when corporate America needs a blank check of $76  billion, we do what other countries are doing.   There is a lot of talk about the microchip crisis facing this country  but, amazingly enough, very little discussion about how we got to where  we are today. One might ask: OK, if there is a crisis, how did it  happen? Well, let's review some recent history. This is really quite  amazing.   Over the last 20 years, the microchip industry has shut down over 780  manufacturing plants and other establishments in the United States and  eliminated 150,000 American jobs while moving most of its production  overseas. And, by the way, they did that after they received a Federal  grant and loans much smaller than what we are talking about today.   So here is the absurd situation that we are in. The crisis is caused  by the industry shutting down in America and moving abroad. And today,  what we are doing is saying: We are going to give you a blank check to  undo the damage that you did.   Let me just give you a few examples. We don't have a whole lot of  information on this. Between 2010 and 2014, Intel laid off  approximately 1,400 workers from the Rio Rancho, NM, chip facility and  offshored 1,000 jobs to Israel. According to the Oregon Bureau of Labor  and Industry, Intel laid off more than 1,000 workers in Oregon between  2015 and 2016. Texas Instruments outsourced 400 jobs from their Houston  manufacturing facility to the Philippines in 2013. Micron Technology  has repeatedly cut jobs in Boise, ID, including 1,100 in 2003 and  another 1,100 in  [[Page S3626]]  2007; 1,500 in 2008; and in 2009, the company stopped manufacturing  some types of chips entirely and laid off 2,000 workers.   In other words, in order to make more profits, these companies took  government money and used it to ship good-paying jobs abroad. Now as  their reward for causing the crisis that we are in, these same  companies are in line to receive a massive taxpayer handout to undo the  damage they did.   Wow, that is a heck of a policy. You bribe companies to undo the  damage that they caused.   It is estimated in total that five major semiconductor companies will  receive the lion's share of this taxpayer handout: Intel, Texas  Instruments, Micron Technology, Global Boundaries, and Samsung. These  five companies alone made $70 billion in profits.   You know, I find it interesting. I have heard Senators here on the  floor talk about entitlements. When we help working people, when we  help poor people, there are all kinds of requirements--work  requirements, reporting requirements, drug testing requirements, you  name the requirements when the Federal Government helps working people  or low-income people.   Well, what are the requirements attached to this handout for large  profitable corporations? The answer is zero.   The company that will likely benefit the most from this taxpayer  assistance is Intel. In 2021, last year, Intel made nearly $20 billion  in profits.   You know, it just does astound me. You have heard people come to the  floor and say: We can't help working parents with their kids. We don't  believe in those entitlement programs. We can't guarantee healthcare to  all people. We are not an ``entitlement society.'' But a company that,  last year, made $20 billion in profits, they are entitled to what we  estimate will be between $20 and $30 billion in Federal funding. During  the pandemic and during the last several years, Intel had enough money  to spend $16.6 billion not on research and development, not on building  new plants in America but on buying back its own stock to reward its  executives and wealthy shareholders. So here is the absurd moment that  we are in. As I mentioned a moment ago, it is estimated that Intel will  receive between $20 and $30 billion in Federal funding. Yet, within the  last several years, the same company spent over $16 billion on stock  buybacks, and there is no guarantee in this bill that they and other  companies that receive these grants will not continue to do stock  buybacks.    This is the way a corrupt political system works, and I hope  everybody understands it.   Over the past 20 years, Intel has spent over $100 million on lobbying  and campaign contributions. That is a lot of money, $100 million, but  this is what a corrupt political system is about. For $100 million in  lobbying and campaign contributions, they are going to get at least $20  billion in corporate welfare. That, I would argue, is a pretty good  investment. That is what goes on here not only with the microchip  industry but with the pharmaceutical industry, the fossil fuel  industry, the insurance industry--huge amounts of money in lobbying and  campaign contributions. The pharmaceutical industry has 1,500 paid  lobbyists right now, right here in Washington, DC, which is why we pay  the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.   I find this extraordinary. Maybe I am the only person here who does,  but, to me, it is rather amazing.   A little over a week ago, the CEO of Intel, a gentleman named Pat  Gelsinger, who earns something like $179 million a year in  compensation--not a bad salary--did an interview on CNBC's ``Squawk  Box'' program. I think to listen to that interview tells us everything  we need to know about oligarchy and arrogance and the state of American  politics.   This is what Mr. Gelsinger said on TV. I love this.         My message--    Mr. Gelsinger's message--       to congressional leaders is ``Hey, if I'm not done with the       job, I don't get to go home. Neither should you. Do not go       home for August recess until you have passed the CHIPS Act.       Because--    Now listen to this--         ``I and others in the industry will make investment       decisions. And do you want those investments in the U.S. or       are we simply not competitive enough to do them here and       we''--    The industry--       ``need to go to Europe or Asia for those? Get the job done.       Do not go home for August recess without getting these bills       passed.''    In other words, what he is telling you is, point blank, who is the  puppet and who is the puppeteer. Don't go home this August until you  give us $76 billion because, if you don't do that, we are going to go  to Asia, and we are going to go to Europe.   That is the state of American politics--and not only of American  politics, I would say. It is equally true in other countries that are  also held hostage by large, multinational corporations.   Let us be clear. The CEO of Intel is saying, if you don't give his  industry a $76 billion blank check and his particular company up to $30  billion, that despite, no doubt, their profound love for America--I am  sure they have got big American flags all over the place and their  patriotism and their concern for the needs of the military and the  healthcare industry, which, in fact, need these sophisticated chips. If  we do not give them this bribe despite their love of America and their  concern about our national defense--you heard Senator Cornyn talking  about national defense, and he is right in that this is a national  defense issue. Despite all of that and all of their love for America,  they are willing to go to Asia and go to Europe in order to make even  more money.   As I said last week, I am, thankfully, not a lawyer, but that sure  sounds like extortion to me. Mr. Gelsinger's words sure sound like  extortion. What he is saying is, if you don't give his industry $76  billion, they are out. They are not going to build in the United  States, and they are going to go abroad.   So I have a few questions for Mr. Gelsinger and the other microchip  CEOs.   If Intel and the others receive a corporate welfare check from the  taxpayers of America, are they willing to commit today that they will  not outsource American jobs overseas? Yes or no?   If this legislation passes, will Intel and the others commit today  that they will not spend another penny on stock buybacks to enrich  wealthy shareholders but will, instead, spend that money to create jobs  in the United States?   If this legislation goes into effect, will Intel and the others  commit today that they will stay neutral in any union organizing  campaign, like the one being waged at Intel's microchip plant in  Hillsboro, OR?   If this legislation goes into effect, will Intel and the others  commit today that they are prepared to issue warrants for the Federal  Government so that the taxpayers of America get a reasonable return on  their investments?   These grants are going to provide a whole lot of profit for these  companies. It seems to me the taxpayers should benefit as well.   If Intel and the others were prepared to say yes to any of these  questions, I don't think that they would be lobbying against my  amendment to impose these very same conditions to this legislation.   Let me simply conclude by saying this: I worry not only about this  bill; I worry about the precedent that it states, that it allows. What  the precedent is, is that any company that is prepared to go abroad and  that has ignored the needs of the American people will then say to the  Congress: Hey, if you want us to stay here, you had better give us a  handout.   We manufacture virtually all of our laptop computers in China. We  manufacture virtually all of our cell phones in China. Pass this  legislation, and I expect all of these guys and others will be back  here, saying: We want for our industry what you did for the microchip  industry.   So the bottom line is here: Yes, we need to rebuild the microchip  industry in the United States but not as a handout. Let us sit down and  work on intelligent industrial policy. Let us work on a series of  agreements that protect the American taxpayer and American workers and  not just wealthy stockholders.   I yield the floor.
