 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  5075, the Ashanti Alert Act, named for Ashanti Billie, who was  tragically taken from this world too soon last September at the hands  of a violent criminal. And so now we have undertaken this action with  this bill, a bipartisan one, because this is not a partisan issue.   The United States does not currently have an alert system for missing  adults. If a child or a senior citizen goes missing, law enforcement is  authorized to broadcast alerts on major channels or radio stations, and  participating citizens share alerts across social media platforms,  bringing much-needed attention and resources to bear. But still, no  such alert exists for missing adults ages 18 to 65.    History shows that programs like the AMBER Alert are successful and  help save lives. In 2016 alone, there were 179 AMBER Alerts issued in  the United States. Over 85 of those cases resulted in recovery, and 43  of them were the direct result of an AMBER Alert. These programs are  proven to work, and with the Ashanti Alert, we can close the gap,  better protect our family, friends, and neighbors, and save lives with  a legacy given to us by Ashanti Billie's sacrifice.   Like other alert systems, the Ashanti Alert lets law enforcement use  the tools at their disposal to broadcast information about missing  adults on such things as TV, radio, and social media. It also sets a  minimum standard for issuing alerts: one, the person suffers from a  proven mental or physical disability; two, if law enforcement believes  their physical safety is in danger; or three, if they believe their  disappearance may not have been voluntary.   The Ashanti Alert also integrates with the Blue Alert Network instead  of AMBER so that information about missing adults and children are kept  separate. This ensures that law enforcement efforts are not duplicated,  which could mean the difference between locating a person and saving  them.   The Commonwealth of Virginia, has already taken steps to address this  issue. Last April, the Governor signed a bill into law in honor of  Ashanti that establishes a statewide alert system for missing adults.  But in order to save lives, the search for missing adults cannot end at  a State line.   Indeed, according to the FBI's National Crime Information Center,  there are still over 55,000 missing adults in this country. This is a  national challenge, and it most definitely demands a national response.   Mr. Speaker, Ashanti Billie was a beautiful, young Black woman with a  beaming smile. She was a hard worker. She would wake up before sunrise  and head to the naval base and start her job. At night, she attended  culinary classes at the Virginia Beach Art Institute. She had hopes and  dreams and aspirations, and she was passionate about life and brought  that positive energy to everyone who met her.   Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago today, early in the morning, I met with local  constituents, Kimberly Wimbush and Michael Muhammad; the Billie  family--parents, Tony and Brandy; and Dyotha Sweat from the NAACP.  Being military veterans themselves, the Billie family didn't understand  how this could happen. They were confused and very much worried.                                time  1830    Their young daughter, Ashanti, was missing, abducted from the Little  Creek naval base.   Mr. Speaker, I knew right then that fateful morning, in my gut and in  my heart, that this family would soon receive some tragic news. I knew  this family and these friends needed my help. My heart and my team's  hearts were with them.   Mr. Speaker, there are no words, no wishes, or no whispers that can  bring back or ease the Billie family burden. But make no mistake about  it, no amount of darkness can ever keep out a bright light.   I may have met with a shaken family that day, but on this day, they  sit before us today, in this Chamber, strong, determined, and ready to  solidify Ashanti's legacy.   Today's vote on Ashanti's legacy will give law enforcement all across  our great Nation a new tool to bring resources to bear to locate  missing adults who may be in danger, and will, no doubt, save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues' support.
