 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida,  Representative Val Demings. First of all, I thank her for her service  in law enforcement and also for her husband, Jerry Demings' service in  law enforcement and to remember the 1-year mark of the Pulse nightclub  shooting.                                time  2030    I wrote a poem entitled: ``Our Pulse Still Beats.''       Inspiration from a brother lost too soon      A place for his memory to play the tune      Alas his pulse ceased      A safe place for a rainbow of people      Full expression was presented throughout this steeple      They all danced to the pulsating sounds      Then came a night of celebration      For many friends from many nations      On the move to impulsive grooves      In the midst of the night a dark figure entered      Hate-filled heart and soul a splintered      His guns pulsating death.      Horrors, and cries, as bullets fly      Some they ran and some they died      Their pulses ceased to be      Brave officers infiltrated the scene      A melee ensued amidst the smoke and gleam      And in the end terror was silenced, the repulsive vanquished      Medics and firefighters quickly came to the rescue      Seeking out those who cried out with fading hues      Come quick he is still breathing, wait she has a pulse      In makeshift ambulances staining ER floors in red      One by one saved from the dead      On the monitor, pulses finally steady beep, beep, beep      In the morn Orlando awakes in sadness      But comes together as One above the madness      The pulse of the city is unspeakable grief and unbreakable             love      From everywhere we came to the Center, the Bloodbank, the             Lake, and the Streets      We gave our time, our pennies, our blood, our hugs, and our             eats      Donors with a strong pulse are needed to replenish our stock      Makeshift monuments grew before our eyes      We gathered at Dr. Phillips for those we lost and those still             alive      As the bell rang 49 times, sorrow became the natural impulse,             but so was unity      This emotion, this grief, this love was felt around the world      By mothers and fathers, boys and girls      A community pulsating with sadness and defiant hope      Our happy little tourist town known for magic      Became the site of history's most violent shooting, tragic      But our community's pulse still beats      One year later one community stronger      Our pulse still beats      For those who survived  [[Page H4846]]       Our pulse still beats      And for those we lost      Our love still remains      For the 49 angels our love still remains      Though pain will ever be in our hearts      Our love still remains.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Demings for sharing  Chris' story.   A coworker of mine, Ramses Tinoco, who survived the Pulse Nightclub  shooting, sent me this letter entitled ``Everlasting Unity.''   ``My name is Ramses Tinoco, and I am a Pulse Nightclub shooting  survivor. I thank God for giving me the opportunity to continue with my  life so that I can spread empowerment, compassion, love, and unity.   ``I want to express my feelings and point of view. Realistically, as  a community and nation, we all suffered a tragic attack of terror on  this one-year remembrance of June 12, 2016. Today, this is known as the  biggest mass shooting in American history. Here at the doorsteps of  Pulse Nightclub, let's take in consistent consideration of the ones who  ultimately suffered the most: the victims, families of the deceased,  the injured survivors, the other survivors who were there and escaped  by God's grace, and the community who stood by, grieved in the  aftermath.   ``As a community, we have been given an opportunity to rebuild  ourselves as stronger individuals and help those that are falling  behind in depression, anguish, lament, and grief. As a community, we  must show that constantly we are not alone, we are united more than  ever, and, above all, that we are better than yesterday.   ``This attack was a terrible and unfortunate tragedy to live through.  It was an ultimate reminder that there is still a lot of discrimination  and hate in this world. However, we must engage, learn from it, and  utilize it to confront and prevent future fear in our community and  ultimately the rest of the world. We can't be stronger if we fuel hate  and negativity. We can't be stronger by pointing fingers and censoring  others based on their race, financial status, sexual orientation, and  religious beliefs.   ``Our world is facing some hard times. Everyone is becoming a victim.  How can we stop this and end the fear? We must stand up and speak out  for our rights, for our peace and protection, and for the safety of our  country. Above all, we need to engage solidarity and equality for the  love of humanity. We can begin to make this world a better place, right  here, right now. It starts with you going out and doing something nice  for someone. We need to live in a world free of fear. That time begins  now.   ``Ramses Tinoco'' of Orlando, Florida.    I thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings) for  sharing Brandon's story.   Next we have a story from a friend.   ``My name is Jim McDermott, and I am a good friend of Chris Brodman  who was the first survivor of the Pulse massacre to pass away of a rare  brain aneurysm on September 11 of last year. Chris came to Orlando and  made it his home in the fall of 2007. His outgoing, natural interest in  other people and their stories made him quite popular in our  community--and we are still grieving his loss to this day. It is hard  to imagine that his constant, wonderful smile is not around anymore to  brighten our days.   ``He was and is the best friend one could ever have.   ``Chris was celebrating at Pulse a few days late because he had to  work on the actual day of his birthday itself. He was lingering with  friends, enjoying the festive atmosphere of the club that was one of  his favorites, when the attack began. In what I find to be an example  of his character, Chris pushed his friends to safety over the back  fence first before escaping himself. Not one person who knows him finds  this to be a surprise, as Chris was always our protector, our  confidante, and our hero.   ``As we come upon the one-year mark of the assault on Pulse, we  wanted to remind the world of his heroism and his day-to-day loving  example of how a great person can affect your life for the better.  Chris loved people that were utterly themselves and unique. He prized  authenticity and loyalty wherever he went. He had high standards, and  he lived by them, and it made us want to live up to them as well.   ``I know in my heart that he would want us to bridge the divides that  separate us. He believed strongly in forgiveness and kindness. He was  open to new ideas and new ways of thinking if it would lead people to a  better life. My favorite recent picture of him was after the shooting  where he proudly held up  [[Page H4847]]  a sign at the LGBT Center downtown saying: `Love always wins.'   ``In his memory, let us strive to remember not just the victims of  this tragedy but the survivors as well. Let us ensure that they are  getting the counseling and medical care that they continue to need. We  should strive to maintain the loving bubble of hope that has surrounded  our city, because of this event, despite all of the strife and division  elsewhere in this country. We need to tell, preserve, and remember  their stories, for they are worth hearing.''                                time  2045    ``They have important lessons to teach all of us. Orlando is known as  being the premier destination in the world for families of all kinds--a  rainbow of diversity that is infused in every aspect of our city  beautiful. So today let us protect the loving vision Orlando has become  around the world in the face of this tragedy. Let us stay Orlando  Strong. And in so doing, we remain the beautiful haven that drew Chris  to us.   ``And let us never forget the red-haired boy from Shirley, New York,  who taught us about unconditional love and friendship from the day he  arrived.   ``We love you forever, Chris.   ``Sincerely,   ``Jim McDermott.''    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida,  Congresswoman Demings, my colleague, for reading the letter of Joshua.  How inspiring it really was.   Next we have a statement from our dear friend, Eric Rollings, who is  one of our supervisors of the Orange County Soil and Water Board, and  who also is one of our only openly gay elected officials.   ``As an openly gay elected official and Orlando resident for 27  years, I know the city and Orange County very well. We are a loving,  caring community that supports the rights and pursuit of happiness for  all of our residents. One year ago this very day, we were devastated to  feel the loss of so many lives from every part of all of Orlando. Yes,  Pulse by name was a gay nightclub, but it was attended by everyone and  all walks of life felt safe dancing and having a good time for more  than a decade.   ``As the night became dawn and the horror of the extent of what  happened became painfully available by every media outlet, I didn't  need to listen to news reports because I live right across the street  from Pulse. The sound of the blades from the helicopters above my house  cut through June air, day after day, looking for a better camera angle.  Out of so much pain came so much love.   ``Immediately Orlando went into action. The outpouring of love from  everywhere in the world is still so incredible. The help came from  faith-based organizations, the small stores, corporate America. Most of  all, it came out of love and our neighbors. I hope this never happens  to your community or any community, but it most likely will. Let me  offer some advice.   ``Love thy neighbor, know your neighbor, and take care of your  neighbor. Do not wait until another tragedy. Talk to your children  about violence. Let's help the persons that suffer from mental  illnesses.   ``There is a significance and real difference between a city that is  tolerant, a city accepting, and a city that embraces the LGBTQ and all  its communities and individuals within those communities. I am proud to  live in a city and a county that embraces! We are Orlando Strong and we  are Orlando United.''    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of the names of  those who perished in the Pulse Nightclub shooting.
