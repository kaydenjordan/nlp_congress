 Mr. Speaker, we have had a lot of talk on this floor about  this bill and people pointing fingers and saying: It doesn't do this.   What it does do, though, is to provide real support for American  heroes: our cops, our teachers, our firemen, our first responders, our  State and local governments.   And this is not a Democratic effort. This is an effort that is  supported by Republicans, and somebody needs to say that: Republican  Governors, Republican mayors, and there will be Republican Members on  that side of the aisle who vote for this bill because it is the right  thing. It provides testing, and it provides a way out for our heroes.
