 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Oklahoma, the current  Republican leader of the Rules Committee, for yielding.   We are in unprecedented times, and unprecedented times do call for  unprecedented actions. But using these times to smash a wrecking ball  into the foundation of democratic lawmaking by making government more  remote, more isolated from the people by dramatically centralizing even  more power with those few at the top in the majority while giving the  range of the House to fewer than 25 Members who show up with votes,  with proxies, seems like a return to boss politics.   This is not to say there is never room for improvement in the way the  House conducts its business.   Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago, I led the transition effort for House  Republicans, and we looked at ways that we could modernize Congress and  improve its operations.   But I knew these were matters not to be taken lightly and we needed  an inclusive, bipartisan approach, and I took great care to solicit  input from Democrats and Republicans alike. We even put up a suggestion  box.   What we did was good work. The changes were relatively small, but the  process was robust. Unfortunately, the reverse is true of this  proposal.   ``Regular order,'' ``accountability,'' ``transparency''--for the most  part--``bipartisanship,'' these are words that govern the Energy and  Commerce Committee, the Republicans and Democrats. As the Republican  leader of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I am concerned what this  proposal means for the committees.   How do we preserve the rights of all Members on both sides of the  dais from top to bottom as we Zoom through hearings and markups?   How do we preserve the integrity of the proceedings?   What if there is a technology failure?   What if somebody makes a mistake using the technology, like  accidentally muting another Member or themselves? Haven't we all, by  now, experienced the inadequacies of video conferencing?   No serious legislator can believe that remote hearings, remote  meetings, and remote markups are improved by these changes.   Moreover, this rules change further dehumanizes our processes. We all  know social media has become a cancer on civility. Further distancing  Members will not improve our relationships.  [[Page H2035]]  Think of what gets worked out between Members here on the floor or in  the committees.   We need more bipartisan dialogue in this country, not less, so I urge  my Democratic colleagues to withdraw this proposal and work with us to  preserve the great democratic traditions of the U.S. House that will  work in this challenging time.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Oklahoma, who  has done such a good job.   I rise today in opposition to this bill.   It is deeply troubling to me that during the worst pandemic in modern  history and amidst a deep economic crisis, Democrats in the House  continue to take a partisan path.    As Republicans and the Trump administration moved to respond quickly,  it was congressional Democrats who needlessly delayed the initial  passage of the CARES Act and later caused a pointless week-long  shuttering of the Paycheck Protection Program. How many jobs were lost  because of that delay?   And here we go again. According to Politico, ``Democrats acknowledge  that their behemoth proposal, whose summary alone is 90 pages, is more  of a talking point than legislation that they expect to become law.''   Well, just from the Energy and Commerce Committee perspective alone,  you have policies that amount to Federal Government takeovers of entire  sectors of the economy, Mr. Speaker.   There is a sweetheart deal for Medicaid compliance carved out only  for the State of New York and no one else.   The bill throws more good money after bad to the failing enrollment  programs in ObamaCare and it violates years of bipartisan agreement to  maintain Hyde protections on Federal healthcare spending.   Why would Democrats spend weeks crafting what amounts to an 1,800- page progressive manifesto that is dead on arrival in the Senate? Why?   Mr. Speaker, I again implore my friends across the aisle to please  drop the partisan, petty politics. Let's move forward in a united way  for the country. That is what the people across America are doing, and  that is what they expect us to do here in Congress.
