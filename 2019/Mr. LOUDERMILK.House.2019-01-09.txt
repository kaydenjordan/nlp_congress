 Madam Speaker, on any given morning, except for  Sundays, the Chick-fil-A in my hometown of Cartersville, Georgia, is  buzzing with activity. In the past few years, among its host of  customers, a young man could often be found at a corner table, watching  videos of high school football games on his laptop.   That young man, Trevor Lawrence, was the quarterback for the  Cartersville High School football team who led the Purple Hurricanes to  two State championships and, along the way, broke Georgia State high  school records for passing yards and touchdowns.   Today, that young man, who often retreated to Chick-fil-A to prepare  for Friday night football, has been catapulted from a hometown star to  a national football phenomenon.   Monday night, the Nation witnessed this young man, who just a year  ago was playing high school football at Weinman Stadium in  Cartersville, Georgia, lead the Clemson Tigers to a national  championship.   The strength of Trevor Lawrence isn't just his playing ability,  although he is truly talented; neither is it his size, strength, or his  athleticism. Trevor's strength is his faith and strong character, which  has been shaped by his family and a community that still promotes the  values of integrity, community service, patriotism, and good morals.  [[Page H296]]    Quick to give God the glory and praise to his teammates, Trevor's  humility speaks louder than his long list of athletic accomplishments.  In a recent interview, Trevor said: ``Football is important to me,  obviously, but it is not . . . the biggest thing in my life. I would  say my faith is.''   From billboards along Joe Frank Harris Parkway, to the marquis  outside the Cartersville Chick-fil-A, our community is expressing pride  in their hometown football star, not only for what he has accomplished,  but more so for who he is.   On behalf of the people of Georgia's 11th Congressional District, I  congratulate Trevor Lawrence on his exceptional performance in the NCAA  National Championship game, and I commend his parents for instilling in  him a strong set of values and the encouragement and motivation to work  hard to achieve success.   I applaud the Cartersville High School coach, Joey King, for  recognizing Trevor's potential and helping to develop this champion of  the gridiron.   I also congratulate the Clemson Tigers and head coach Dabo Swinney on  an exceptional season and a well-earned national championship.                            ____________________
