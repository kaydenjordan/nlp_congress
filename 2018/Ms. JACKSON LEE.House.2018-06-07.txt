 Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I am opposing all of the bills under this rule,  including the underlying bill, but in particular H.R. 3, which is a  danger to childcare development, Pell grants, and election security,  meaning, Mr. Speaker, they are cutting those dollars.   But the main element of my opposition is the crisis on the border. I  want this House to recognize that you have individuals who have crossed  for humanitarian reasons who are being treated and violated like in a  third-world country that would be inhumane.   You have Guatemalans, some of whom now are facing the tragedy of the  volcano, coming who speak an indigenous language, and they are lumped  together 50, 100 at a time.   Their children are snatched away from them. This is a policy that is  going to be further funded by the rescissions in this bill. It is  imperative that anyone who has a humane bone in their body stand up  against ripping children away from individuals.   As a member of the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee  on the Judiciary, that was not the policy. The policy was for children  who came unaccompanied, not children with their parents.   In addition, you have children who have not seen their mothers--who  are 4 years old, who are infants--for weeks at a time and cannot speak  English.   Again, you have Guatemalans who are not speaking Spanish, English, or  a language that is interpreted in the courts. It is an indigenous  language. They do not know that you are ruling against them, as it  relates to their plea for asylum.   This bill and the rescissions will give more funding for those kinds  of inhumane deportation and more dollars to separate children from  their parents.   For God's sake, this is not America. We must stop it now. Oppose the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, as the founder and chair of the  Congressional Children's Caucus and as a mother, I rise in strong  opposition to H.R. 3, the ``Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary  Programs Act.''   I oppose this legislation because it would eliminate $7 billion for  children's health insurance without allowing for Congress to reinvest  the funds into healthcare services for families and children.   I also oppose this bill because it undermines the Bipartisan Budget  Agreement we only just passed last year.   Instead of wasting time on their partisan agenda, House Republicans  should be bringing to the floor legislation that addresses the real  challenges facing the American people such as: (1) tax reform; (2) DACA  and immigration; (3) restoring the Voting Rights Act; (4) healthcare;  (5) and education.   Yet here we are rushing through another piece of legislation that  will do harm to millions of Americans, mostly children and working  families, without proper discussion or deliberation.   It is very clear that H.R. 3 has been pushed to the floor today  without debate in the Appropriations Committee because of all the harm  it will inflict on the American people.   H.R. 3 undermines our nation's ability to improve and promote health,  safety and environmental standards and provide much-needed protections  for the American people.   But perhaps most deceitful of all are the cuts in funding for the  Children's Health Insurance Program, a program which plays such a  critical role in our nation's health care system.   Together, CHIP and Medicaid cover 39 percent of children in the  United States.   This is over 9 billion children, whose lives the opposition has  decided to quit investing in.   When CHIP was first passed in Congress over two decades ago, this was  a bipartisan movement that not only strengthened the ties between the  parties, but also ensured coverage for so many lower income families  who do not qualify for Medicaid.   Without such a vital program, the number of children covered, and the  number of treatments they would be covered for, would vastly decrease,  in a most harmful and debilitating way.   Not only this, but if the funds were to be rescinded, Congress could  be prevented from reallocating those funds into early childhood  education, health-related research, and other initiatives that only  improve the quality of life for our constituents.   Given that we have experienced multiple health and safety disasters  in communities across the country in recent years, it is the wrong time  to thwart the progress of programs that are beneficial to so many  Americans.   It is no wonder that leading children's organizations such as First  Focus, along with 500 national, state, and local organizations across  the country, are urging Congress to reject any cuts to the Children's  Health Insurance Program.   The value of the contingent funding is in its ability to protect  children's health coverage in the event of unforeseen circumstances or  unexpected disasters, such as Hawaii's overwhelming volcano eruption or  Hurricane Harvey, which devastated the state of Texas just last year.   The Administration and CBO cannot guarantee that there will not be an  economic recession or health epidemic for which contingency funding  would be necessary and yet they are still willing to gamble with our  children's lives.   It is time for the Trump Administration and House Republicans to  abandon their crusade to balance the budget on the backs of the poor  and vulnerable.   We should be investing in our children's futures, not risking their  chances of having one at all.   I urge my colleagues to vote NO on this reckless, irresponsible, and  cruel measure.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Simpson and Ms. Kaptur for  working to try to put forward a bill and to recognize the unfortunate  addition of riders, which we would hope that we could pass these kinds  of bills in the appropriate manner. But I thank them for their work,  and I thank the Rules Committee for making this amendment in order.   This is an important part of the Energy and Water legislation in  Appropriations, and that is the Department of Energy's departmental  work that it does with environmental justice.   My amendment would ask for an additional $1 million to be placed in  that program under the administrative office's responsibilities, and to  do so because it is an essential tool in the effort to improve the  lives of low-income and minority communities as well as the environment  at large.   Many of my Members here have worked on this issue, in particular, Jim  Clyburn and the Congressional Black Caucus, over the years. I add to  their work by making sure that this is a focus of the Department of  Energy.   Maintaining funds for environmental justice that go to Historically  Black Colleges and Universities, minority-serving institutions, Tribal  colleges, and other organizations is imperative to protecting  sustainability and growth of the community and environment. In  particular, those individuals who study this issue in those particular  institutions of higher learning go out to communities and are a source  of research and aid to communities that suffer from the lack of  environmental justice, for example, in Flint, Michigan. It is clear  that that is a place where there was an infusion of experts on how to  deal with unclean water.   I worked with Dr. Hotez, one of the renown infectious disease  physicians in Houston, Texas, when the Zika virus began to take over in  the summer in, particularly, minority communities.   DOE's Environmental Justice Program provides dollars to be awarded to  an important cause of increasing youth involvement in STEM and  promoting clean energy, weatherization, cleanup, and asset  revitalization.   Weatherization is extremely important. The housing stock in my  congressional district, as in rural communities, is extremely old and  sometimes weak and subjected to the whims of bad winter weather and the  whims of very hot summers. These dollars can assist in these kinds of  programs.   The Community Leadership Institute is another vital component of the  Environmental Justice Program, and it promotes environmental  sustainability. It brings important factors, including public health  and economic development. It is an important program that helps Native  Americans and Alaskan Natives.   So I hope that my colleagues can support the Jackson Lee amendment  because it deals with an expanse and an emphasis on the importance of a  quality of life that can deal with a good environment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, with that in mind, what we are glad to  say is that we emphasize and ask for that amount of dollars within the  administrative account to be increased on the Environmental Justice  Program.   We are grateful for the statement of the chairman, and with that in  mind, we want to remind our colleagues that STEM programs, the program  that helps in leadership, in particular, that will help young people  learn more about environmental justice, the issues that we see in  communities with clean water, clean air, the Zika virus, and other  elements that impact on minority communities, the Environmental Justice  Program can be very helpful and very useful. I would ask my colleagues  to support the Jackson Lee amendment  [[Page H4941]]    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk; No. 25.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur  for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment  to preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   My amendment increases funding for DOE departmental administration by  $1,000,000 which should be used to enhance the Department's  Environmental Justice program activities.   Mr. Chair, the Environmental Justice Program is an essential tool in  the effort to improve the lives of low income and minority communities  as well as the environment at large.   Twenty-four years ago, on February 11, 1994, President Clinton issued  Executive Order 12898, directing federal agencies to identify and  address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or  environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income  populations.   A healthy environment sustains a productive and healthy community  which fosters personal and economic growth.   Maintaining funds for environmental justice that go to Historically  Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Serving Institutions, Tribal  Colleges, and other organizations is imperative to protecting  sustainability and growth of the community and environment.   The funding of these programs is vital to ensuring that minority  groups are not placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the  environment and the continued preservation of their homes.   The crisis in Flint, Michigan teaches us how important it is that  minority groups and low-income communities are not placed at a  disadvantage when it comes to environment threats and hazards like lead  in drinking water or nesting areas for mosquitos carrying the Zika  virus.   Through education about the importance of environmental  sustainability, we can promote a broader understanding of science and  how citizens can improve their surroundings.   Funds that would be awarded to this important cause would increase  youth involvement in STEM fields and also promote clean energy,  weatherization, clean-up, and asset revitalization. These improvements  would provide protection to our most vulnerable groups.   This program provides better access to technology for underserved  communities.   Together, the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture have  distributed over 5,000 computers to low income populations.   The Community Leaders Institute is another vital component of the  Environmental Justice Program. It ensures that those in leadership  positions understand what is happening in their communities and can  therefore make informed decisions in reards to their communities.   In addition to promoting environmental sustainability, CLI also  brings important factors including public health and economic  development into the discussion for community leaders.   The CLI program has been expanded to better serve Native Americans  and Alaska Natives, which is a prime example of how various other  minority groups can be assisted as well.   Through community education efforts, teachers and students have also  benefitted by learning about radiation, radioactive waste management,  and other related subjects.   The Department of Energy places interns and volunteers from minority  institutions into energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.   The DOE also works to increase low income and minority access to STEM  fields and help students attain graduate degrees as well as find  employment.   Since 2002, the Tribal Energy Program has also funded 175 energy  projects amounting to over $41.8 million in order to help tribes invest  in renewable sources of energy.   With the continuation of this kind of funding, we can provide clean  energy options to our most underserved communities and help improve  their environments, which will yield better health outcomes and greater  public awareness.   We must help our low income and minority communities and ensure  equality for those who are most vulnerable in our country.   I ask my colleagues to join me and support the Jackson Lee Amendment  for the Environmental Justice Program.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, all over the Nation, we face a series  of disasters that come in many different forms: fires, volcanoes, and  heavy rain.   My amendment deals with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the  important aspect of its investigatory work by redirecting $3 million  for increased funding for postdisaster watershed assessment studies  that are typical across the Gulf region and even up the East Coast,  where we know Hurricane Sandy was devastating just a few years ago.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plays a critical role in the  building, maintaining, and expanding of the most critical of the  Nation's infrastructure.                                time  2015    My amendment would address the question of pre-preparedness. As we  were facing the disaster of Hurricane Harvey, so many wondered how much  more we should have pre-prepared.   Many were aware of the fact that we flooded in 500-year and 1,000- year flood areas. We are aware of the devastation in Puerto Rico and  the U.S. Virgin Islands.   The Army Corps of Engineers can be very instrumental in assessing  ahead of time the potential impact of flood and storm damage and,  through the investigations, can reduce this and create savings.   I am optimistic, as we go forward, and hopeful that we will receive  in the Gulf region a regional watershed assessment flood risk  management feasibility study.   But I think it is important to note that we are probably not out from  under the weather of future disasters. On April 15, 2016, 240 billion  gallons of water fell in the Houston area over a 12-hour period and, as  well, 2016, another major flood causing major damage.   And, finally, this is not atypical, it seems, as we watched the  hurricane season of last year all over the Gulf region and we found  Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons and 300,000 homes were  lost.   So the investigatory part of the Army Corps of Engineers is an  important tool for the whole Nation when it comes to dealing with pre- preparedness and assessing how we can do better in natural disasters.   Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk; it is number 35 on the  roster.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur  for shepherding this legislation to floor and for their commitment to  preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers ``Investigations'' account by redirecting $3 million  for increased funding for post-disaster watershed assessment studies,  like the one that is being contemplated for the Houston/Harris County  metropolitan area.   As the federal agency that collects and studies basic information  pertaining to river and harbor, flood and storm damage reduction, shore  protection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and conducts detailed  studies, plans, and specifications for river and harbor, and flood and  storm damage reduction, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plays a  critical role in the building, maintaining, and expanding the most  critical of the nation's infrastructure.   We understand this very well in my home state of Texas and the  Eighteenth Congressional District that I represent.   The Army Corps of Engineers has been working with the Harris County  Flood Control District since 1937 to reduce the risk of flooding within  Harris County.   Current projects include 6 federal flood risk management projects:   1. Sims Bayou   2. Greens Bayou   3. Brays Bayou   4. White Oak Bayou   5. Hunting Bayou, and   6. Clear Creek   In addition to these ongoing projects, the Army Corps of Engineers  operates and maintains the Addicks and Barker (A&B) Detention Dams in  northwest Harris County.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased that the bill provides that the Secretary of  the Army may initiate up to six new study starts during fiscal year  2018, and that five of those studies are to consist studies where the  majority of the benefits are derived from flood and storm damage  reduction or from navigation transportation savings.   I am optimistic that one of those new study starts will be the  Houston Regional Watershed Assessment Flood Risk Management Feasibility  study.   Such a study is certainly needed given the frequency and severity of  historic-level flood events in recent years in and around the Houston  metropolitan area.   On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in  the Houston area over a 12 hour period, which resulted in several areas  exceeding the 100 to 500 year flood event record.   Some of the areas that experienced these historic rain falls were  west of I-45, north of I-10, and Greens Bayou.   Additionally, an estimated 140 billion gallons of water fell over the  Cypress Creek, Spring Creek, and Addicks watershed in just 14 hours.   The purpose of the Houston Regional Watershed Assessment is to  identify risk reduction measures and optimize performance from a multi- objective systems performance perspective of the regional network of  nested and intermingled watersheds, reservoir dams, flood flow  conveyance channels, storm water detention basins, and related Flood  Risk Management (FRM) infrastructure.    Special emphasis of the study, which covers 22 primary watersheds  within Harris County's 1,735 square miles, will be placed on extreme  flood events that exceed the system capacity resulting in impacts to  asset conditions/functions and loss of life.   Mr. Chair, during the May 2015 Houston flood, 3,015 homes were  flooded and 8 persons died; during the April 2016 Houston flood, 5,400  homes were flooded and 8 deaths recorded.   The economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated at  $3 billion; the 2016 estimate is being compiled and is estimated to be  well above $2 billion.   Mr. Chair, minimizing the risk of flood damage to the Houston and  Harris County metropolitan area, the nation's 4th largest, is a matter  of national significance because the region is one of the nation's  major technology, energy, finance, export and medical centers:   1. The Port of Houston is the largest bulk port in the world;   2. Texas Medical Center is a world renowned teaching, research and  treatment center;   3. Houston is home to the largest conglomeration of foreign bank  representation and second only to New York City as home to the most  Fortune 500 companies; and   4. The Houston Watershed Assessment study area sits within major  Hurricane Evacuation arteries for the larger Galveston Gulf Coast  region.  [[Page H4953]]    The Jackson Lee Amendment No. 35 is particularly important in light  of the devastation of Hurricane Harvey and its aftermath.   At its peak on September 1, 2017, one-third of Houston was underwater  due to Hurricane Harvey flooding.   There was over 41,500 square miles of land mass impacted by Hurricane  Harvey and the subsequent flooding that covered an area larger than the  States of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and  Vermont combined.   Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons of rainfall on Texas and  Louisiana, most of it on the Houston Metroplex.   In September 2017, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported that  Hurricane Harvey's rainfall created 275 trillion pounds of water, which  caused the crust in and around Houston to deform and sink nearly 1 inch  because of the weight.   Over 300,000 structures flooded in southeastern Texas, where extreme  rainfall hit many areas that are densely populated.   Hurricane Harvey is the largest housing disaster to strike the U.S.  in our nation's history.   Hurricane Harvey damaged 203,000 homes, of which 12,700 were  destroyed.   Texas flood control districts are still struggling to recover from  this record breaking flood event.   Nineteen trillion gallons of flood waters poured into the Houston  Ship Channel from area rivers and bayous on the way to the Gulf of  Mexico.   As a consequence, tens of millions of tons of sediment and debris  flowed through the biggest waterway in the nation.   Today, the Port of Houston is operating with draft restrictions that  may last a year or longer.   Draft restrictions are adding costs to oil and gas and Petrochemical  operations, which are passed on to wholesalers, who pass these costs to  consumers at the pump.   The Port of Houston produces 27 percent of the nation's gasoline and  about 60 percent of the U.S. aviation fuel.   Investments in all aspects of our nation's water infrastructure pays  dividends in the form of economic activity.   The Houston Ship Channel generates $617 billion in the U.S. with $265  billion of that in Texas representing 16 percent of the state of  Texas's GDP.   The Port of Houston sustains 2.7 million jobs nationally with 1.2  million of them within the state of Texas.   I ask my colleagues to join me and support Jackson Lee Amendment No.  35.   I thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur for their work in  shepherding this bill to the floor.   I am asking my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First of all, let me thank the chairman of the committee for what has  been ongoing support of our efforts. And I hope he sees that these are  efforts for across the Nation as well.   To be clear, I am glad that we do not alter the account but we  redirect and focus moneys on this important investigatory area. I thank  him for his support.   I would be happy to yield to the ranking member, who, likewise, has  helped me over the years to address this question of flooding.   But I want to make the point that what we saw in the last hurricane  season is that it reaches across the Gulf region, including the U.S.  Virgin Islands and, of course, Puerto Rico.   I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Ms. Kaptur), the distinguished ranking member.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me take this moment again to acknowledge the funds that have been  put into this bill that focuses on what we experienced in the last  year. And I would indicate that the investigatory account, which will  see this focus, is important. The dollars that we have received from  this Congress I do appreciate.   And the final word I would say in closing is that we work and hope to  work with the administration for those funds to get to the local  jurisdictions. We are right in the middle of trying to get those  dollars down from Washington into our local jurisdictions.   With that, I thank the manager and the chairman and the manager who  is ranking member again and ask my colleagues to support the Jackson  Lee amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this is an educational amendment, if  you will. It is to emphasize the importance of the Department of  Energy's program that deals with the emphasizing of educating minority  students across America with STEM. Now we have moved and advanced to  STEAM. That includes arts.   But the Office of Minority Impact that is in the DOE has as its major  focus--and we are still behind in the numbers--to ramp up the numbers  of men and women and minorities in the STEM effort. Women and  minorities make up 70 percent of college students but only 45 percent  of undergraduate STEM degree holders.   If we are to be a 21st century and 22nd century country--and as I was  sitting in some meetings today--competing with countries on the  question of cybersecurity--I know that we are in the Energy and Water  approps, but if we are to reach beyond the boundaries of research that  help in energy and water, I think it is important that we continue to  try and do outreach to increase the numbers of women and minorities to  go into the STEM fields.   The energy and science education programs funded in part by this bill  [[Page H4954]]  will help ensure that members of underrepresented communities are not  placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the environmental  sustainability, preservation, and health. The larger point is that we  need more STEM educators and more minorities to qualify for those  positions.   Mr. Chairman, there are still a great many scientific riddles left to  be solved, and perhaps one of these days a minority engineer or  biologist will add to the others and will come up with some of the  major solutions in our time.   I would offer to say that education efforts with teachers and  students under this program are extremely important because the  students of today, teachers who are teaching the students of today, are  the scientists and problem-solvers of tomorrow.   So I again want to emphasize to my fellow Texan, Secretary Perry, who  is Secretary of the Department of Energy, to focus and to grow the  department that deals with educating young people in the science,  technology, engineering, and math. We are waiting for them. We need  them, and the Nation needs them.   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, and I  conclude by saying: Let's provide more opportunity for these students.   I want to emphasize the Energy Institute High School in Houston and,  as well, to cite high schools across the Nation that are working to  provide these students with this kind of training. And I hope these  dollars will help them do so.   I ask for the support of my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 36.   I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur for  shepherding this legislation to the floor and for it commitment to  preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 36 simply provides that:   ``None of the funds made available by this Act for `Department of  Energy--Energy Programs--Science' may be used in contravention of the  Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.).''   This amendment was approved and adopted in identical form on April  29, 2015, during the 114th Congress as an amendment to H.R. 2028, the  Energy and Water Resources Appropriations Act of 2016 and on July 7,  2017, during this Congress as an amendment to H.R. 3219, the Energy and  Water Resources Appropriations Act of 2018.   Mr. Chair, twenty years ago, on February 11, 1994, President Clinton  issued Executive Order 12898, directing federal agencies to identify  and address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or  environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income  populations.   The Department of Energy seeks to provide equal access in these  opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM, including  minorities, Native Americans, and women.   Mr. Chair, women and minorities make up 70 percent of college  students, but only 45 percent of undergraduate STEM degree holders.   This large pool of untapped talent is a great potential source of  STEM professionals.   As the nation's demographics are shifting and now most children under  the age of one are minorities, it is critical that we close the gap in  the number of minorities who seek STEM opportunities.   I encourage Energy Secretary Perry to surpass the commitment of his  predecessors' toward increasing the nation's economic competitiveness  and enabling more of our people to realize their full potential.   Mr. Chair, there are still a great many scientific riddles left to be  solved--and perhaps one of these days a minority engineer or biologist  will come-up with some of the solutions.   The larger point is that we need more STEM educators and more  minorities to qualify for them.   The energy and science education programs funded in part by this bill  will help ensure that members of underrepresented communities are not  placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the environmental  sustainability, preservation, and health.   Through education about the importance of environmental  sustainability, we can promote a broader understanding of science and  how citizens can improve their surroundings.   Through community education efforts, teachers and students have also  benefitted by learning about radiation, radioactive waste management,  and other related subjects.   The Department of Energy places interns and volunteers from minority  institutions into energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.   The DOE also works to increase low income and minority access to STEM  fields and help students attain graduate degrees as well as find  employment.   With the continuation of this kind of funding, we can increase  diversity, provide clean energy options to our most underserved  communities, and help improve their environments, which will yield  better health outcomes and greater public awareness.   But most importantly businesses will have more consumers to whom they  may engage in related commercial activities.   My amendment will help ensure that underrepresented communities are  able to participate and contribute equitably in the energy and  scientific future.   I ask my colleagues to join me and support Jackson Lee Amendment No.  36.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, again, I offer my appreciation both to  the Rules Committee and to the chairman and ranking member.   This is to emphasize the need for funding in the Army Corps of  Engineers. It is an amendment that increases and decreases by $100  million, with the focus on the construction account.   I hold up examples of construction projects that are necessary, not  only in the Gulf region, but projects that are necessary across the  Nation.                                time  2215    That is, of course, dams, reservoirs, reservoir pools, and other  areas that can be devastated by disaster. And so this amendment is to  emphasize the Army Corps of Engineers construction account,  particularly dealing with the need for repair to river and harbor,  flood and storm damage, shore protection, aquatic ecosystem restoration  and, as well, to include the need to deal with our ports.   So my amendment is, again, to reflect on the devastation of the storm  that occurred over the last year. With the prediction of 14 storms  coming in 2018, approximately five or so to be of monumental impact and  hitting the Gulf Region, it is imperative that the Army Corps of  Engineers move on their construction account and move on their  construction projects to avoid some of the disaster that we have  already experienced.   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   In concluding, let me emphasize the Port of Houston, which truly  needs the Army Corps of Engineers' efforts, particularly in dredging.  We are a manmade port. That is a very important aspect of our work, and  that is construction work.   The Port of Houston today is operating with draft restrictions that  may last a year or longer. Draft restrictions are adding costs to oil  and gas and petrochemical operations, which are passed on to  wholesalers, who pass these costs to consumers at the pump.   It is also well known that the work that the Army Corps of Engineers  does in respect to repair helps the environment. So again, I ask my  colleagues to support the amendment, what is a focus on the Army Corps  of Engineers' construction account, but I would like to make the  additional point that we, in the region, need an expedited utilization  of those dollars to fix the repairs, prepare us for oncoming potential  disasters not only in my particular State, but across the region.   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
