 Mr. Speaker, last week, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue  announced another round of market facilitation payments to help farmers  and ranchers deal with the continued impacts of ongoing trade  disruptions.   President Trump is delivering on his promise to help agriculture  producers while he works to open new markets and deliver free, fair,  and reciprocal trade agreements for farmers and ranchers. While these  payments serve only as a short-term solution, a Band-Aid, President  Trump and USTR continue to fight, both day and night, to secure a deal  with China.   I also want to give a special shout-out and thanks to Farm Service  Agency State Executive Director for Kansas David Schemm, my good  friend. David and the men and women of Kansas' 105 FSA county offices  work tirelessly to process tens of thousands of MFP applications for  Kansas farmers.   Thank you, David, and your team, for all you do for Kansas  agriculture.           Impeachment Evidence Shows No High Crime or Misdemeanor     Mr. Speaker, this week, House Democrats began the  public hearing phase of their partisan impeachment sham, which  continues in a completely unfair, unjust, and unprecedented manner.   There are at least four indisputable pieces of evidence showing no  high crime or misdemeanor committed by the President.   Number one, the July 25 call summary, the best evidence of the  conversation, shows no evidence of pressure or conditions.   Number two, President Zelensky and President Trump have both said  there was no pressure on the call.   Number three, the Ukrainian Government was not aware of a hold on  U.S. assistance at the time of the July 25 call.  [[Page H8834]]    Number four, President Trump met with President Zelensky, and the  U.S. assistance flowed to Ukraine in September 2019, without Ukraine  investigating President Trump's concern for corruption.   Mr. Speaker, there is no objective evidence to undo the votes of 63  million Americans.   Not only do the Democrats and their leadership ignore the facts in  order to impeach President Trump, but they are also ignoring the  American people by failing to get anything done.   Republicans stand at the ready to pass USMCA, secure our border, and  create a bipartisan plan to lower prescription drug costs. Sadly,  Democrats intend to deny the American people such progress.                  Commemorating Service During Military Week     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Veterans Day, this week is  Military Week for our office. This week, we will honor the sacrifices  of those who have and are currently serving in America's armed forces.   This year, our office took part in the 2019 Veteran History Project  to give our Nation's heroes a platform to tell their stories. This  project will allow future generations to hear directly from veterans to  better understand their realities, the personal sacrifices of war, and  the importance of public service.   For this project, our office interviewed three constituents from the  Big First District about their military service. All three gentlemen  not only served their country overseas but returned home to make  lasting impacts on their communities and create a better Kansas for all  of us.   Listening to these veterans' stories of sacrifice and bravery is  quite inspiring. Thank you to each of these fine gentlemen for your  service, for your families' sacrifices, and for sharing your stories  for future generations.                     Fighting Northwest Kansas Wildfires     Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday, a disaster declaration  was issued for Cheyenne County in northwest Kansas after a series of  grass fires broke out between St. Francis and Wheeler.   Thanks to fast-acting volunteers and the National Guard, many homes,  farms, and, most importantly, families were kept safe. Even pheasant  hunters out on opening day pitched in to help fight the fires.   Time and time again, rural Kansans rise to the occasion and the  challenges to provide for their communities' needs without a moment's  notice. That is what Kansans do. These are Kansas values.   Thank you to all the first responders, the troops, and the citizen  volunteers who bravely responded to put out these fires in Cheyenne  County. Thank you for helping take care of your neighbors.                                time  1045              Highlighting Improvements to VA Healthcare System     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Military Week in my office, I  would like to take a moment to highlight improvements made to our VA  healthcare system by the VA MISSION Act. This week, our office  partnered with Newman Regional Health Center in Emporia to host a  community forum to share information about healthcare options available  to veterans through the VA MISSION Act, which went into effect June 6.   Since being implemented, the VA MISSION Act has benefited thousands  of veterans in Kansas greatly, allowing them the option to get care at  home. In rural Kansas, it can be costly and burdensome for many  veterans to travel to a nearby VA facility which might be as many as 2  to 3 hours away. The MISSION Act enables them to seek the care they  want from a provider closer to home.   We must continue to empower our veterans, providing them with the  choice they need to receive the care they deserve, the care we promised  them all. Thanks to Congress and the work of the Trump administration,  we are taking steps to provide our veterans the very best of care  because they deserve nothing less.                            ____________________
