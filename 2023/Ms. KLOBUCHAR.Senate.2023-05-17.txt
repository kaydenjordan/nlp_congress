 Madam President, I rise to celebrate the  incredible life and storied career of Minnesota's dear coach Bud Grant.  A legendary Vikings, head coach, NFL Hall of Famer, Gopher player, and  Minneapolis Laker, Bud gave us so many Minnesota memories. I will  always remember when, at age 88, Bud took to the field in a short- sleeved polo shirt in subzero temperatures for the coin toss in the  2016 Vikings/Seahawks playoff game.   My dad and Bud were friends to the end of my dad's life. I grew up  knowing everything about the Vikings, and no name loomed larger in my  house than ``Bud Grant.'' I remember answering the phone as a young kid  to silence on the other line, save for maybe the grunted word ``Jim.''  That meant it was Bud calling my dad back for the postgame story,  regardless of the outcome. The first few times it happened, I would  earnestly explain that my name wasn't ``Jim,'' but after a while, I got  the drill, and I would just run to get my dad.   Bud gave so much to his players, but he gave even more to the fans.  Those Bud Grant years were an exhilarating time in Minnesota--158  victories and four Super Bowl appearances--but through it all, Bud  remained steady and stoic, win or lose.   Bud was a beloved coach and a dedicated outdoorsman. But above all,  Bud was devoted to his family. Today, my heart is with all those who  knew and loved Bud.                            ____________________
