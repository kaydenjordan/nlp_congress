 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the need for a  backup system to GPS, which is critical to our economy, our national  security and is integrated into nearly every aspect of all Americans  lives. We greatly appreciate the foresight of the Appropriations  Committee for providing $5,000,000 in funding to begin the  implementation of the National Timing Resilience and Security Act under  the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology at  the Department of Transportation.   The need for a backup system to GPS has been recognized by this  government for over 15 years and a terrestrial based system has been  recommended nearly 18 times by different US government agencies and  bodies in the last decade alone. Because of this is, in  [[Page H4124]]  2018 Congress acted in a fully bipartisan manner to finally protect GPS  by passing the National Timing Resilience and Security Act of 2018.  Unanimously approved in the House, and by 96 to 4 in the Senate, it was  signed into law on December 4, 2018. This law calls for, at a minimum,  the deployment of a terrestrial based backup system for GPS with the  Department of Transportation as the lead for execution. This Jaw  ensures the implementation of a nationwide, fully complementary, and  resilient backup timing system within two years, and thereafter with  the expansion to position and navigation.   As strong of an advocate for GPS as I know we all are, we must now  also be stronger advocates for protecting it. And that comes through  this funding for the deployment of the National Timing Resilience and  Security Act under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research  and Technology at the Department of Transportation.                                time  1200
