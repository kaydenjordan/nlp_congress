 Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to proudly announce  that today marks the start of the 2020 Strawberry Festival in Plant  City, Florida, which celebrates the strawberry harvest of eastern  Hillsborough County. This community-oriented event began back in 1930  and has become one of the top 40 fairs in North America.   My district has grown to be one of the largest agricultural districts  in the Nation with Plant City known as the winter strawberry capital of  the world.   As a near billion-dollar industry, we love our strawberries, we love  those who grow and pick them, and we love the culture surrounding them.   The festival has a wide range of entertainment, including livestock  shows, rides, live music, and the Florida Strawberry Festival Queens  Pageant that collectively bring in over one-half million attendees  annually and serves to unite our community.   The festival also has strawberry shortcake, and lots of it. This is  the Strawberry Festival's 85th year, and we anticipate many more to  come. I can't wait to be back home this weekend to enjoy the festival  with my family and the families of District 15.                            ____________________
