 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support and endorse  the FAIR Act, of which there will be a vigorous debate on the floor of  the House tomorrow.   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I was very pleased to be a  cosponsor of that legislation and to explain to Americans what forced  dispute arbitration is. It is arbitration almost without your  knowledge.   This bill will provide the opportunity for individuals who are forced  into arbitration to be able to waive that particular provision.   In fact, one of the saddest cases is that of someone who utilized  Massage Envy, a company where this person was trying to relieve their  pain and, unfortunately, was assaulted on the massage table. All they  wanted to do was to get out of their contract, but when they checked  the little box to get out of their contract, they checked the box to  say that you must go into forced arbitration. You must wait weeks and  months and days and years.   I want to take note of the fact that this is not about trial lawyers.  It is about justice. I am glad that the Nation has lawyers who can  stand before the bar and in the courts to defend those who cannot  defend themselves.   Forced arbitration is an injustice. This repeals that injustice.   I am a strong supporter of the FAIR Act, and the fact is that it  gives justice to those who have no other remedy. Let's pass the FAIR  Act.                            ____________________
