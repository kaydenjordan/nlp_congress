 Madam Speaker, PFAS water contamination continues to  threaten the purity of our drinking water and the health of our  communities, including my own.   FAS contaminants exist on more than 400 military bases nationwide and  threaten the health and safety of those who live nearby. This public  health crisis demands our full attention and requires a national  solution.   This 116th Congress has proposed and passed more PFAS legislation  than any previous Congress in history, including the PFAS Action Act,  which would require the EPA to enforce cleanup of contaminated sites  and require a nationwide PFAS drinking water standard.   Still much work remains to be done. We must stand up for stronger  regulations, cleaner water, and healthier communities.   Clean drinking water cannot be another issue that the Senate majority  continues to ignore and add to their graveyard. We have an obligation  to address this national health crisis.   Madam Speaker, I urge the Senate, including my own Senators, to  prioritize the well-being of our communities and to act swiftly on the  passage of the PFAS Action Act.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for bringing this  resolution to a vote and thank Representative Speier and Representative  Maloney for their work on this legislation.   This is a historic day. It has been nearly a century since the first  constitutional amendment to guarantee  [[Page H1137]]  equal treatment for women was introduced in 1923. Since then, 37 States  have ratified the equal rights amendment, including my home State of  Pennsylvania in 1972.   Virginia's ratification of the ERA this past January brought us one  step closer to this basic right that we will be held equal in the eyes  of the Constitution. The motto of Susan B. Anthony's newspaper was:  ``Men their rights and nothing more; women their rights and nothing  less.'' Today, we again say women will accept nothing less than  equality.   ERA builds on the work of Anthony and others like Jeannette Rankin,  Alice Paul, Ida B. Wells, and this diverse Congress.   I am filled with joy today because I am looking forward to going home  and telling my granddaughters, Aubrey and Ella, that we are one step  closer to a more perfect Union.                                time  1015
