 Madam Speaker, I thank our distinguished chairman of  the Committee on the Judiciary, and I thank and applaud the gentlewoman  from New York for her outstanding leadership and championing the rights  of all Americans.   Madam Speaker, from the unwarranted, unwanted allegations of  hysterectomies in immigrant women around the Nation in detention  centers, to the President of the United States taking to the bully pit  to be able to call COVID-19 and the coronavirus the ``China virus,'' we  are finding ourselves in the midst of confusion that is hurting the  American people--hurting them in two ways:   One, over 6 million COVID-19 infections in the United States, and  now, predictions of upwards of 250,000 dead.  [[Page H4505]]  Every one of them we, as Members of the United States Congress, should  mourn because families, sadly, are having to bury family members having  not seen them in their last days.   What good is it to use that word--the ``Wuhan'' virus? That is not  the scientific term. And out of that, we have created a hostile  situation for our Asian-American friends, for Asian Americans who have  been at the front lines fighting on behalf of this Nation.   The use of anti-Asian terminology and rhetoric related to COVID-19,  such as the Chinese virus, Wuhan virus, kung flu have perpetrated anti- Asian stigma and is reminiscent of dark and shameful chapters in  America's past where Asian Americans were labeled as the ``yellow  peril'' and interned in relocation camps.   Madam Speaker, more than 23 million Asian American and Pacific  Islanders account for 7 percent of the Nation's population in the  United States, but over 2 million Asian American and Pacific Islanders  are working on the front lines of this COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare,  law enforcement, first responders, transportation, supermarkets, and  other service industries. They feel threatened.   For example, in March 2020, an Asian woman wearing a mask was kicked  and punched at a New York City subway station by individuals; two  children and two adults were stabbed at a wholesale grocery store. This  was anti-Asian rhetoric. Finally, let me say, my own constituent, Coco  Ma, in Houston, was afraid to go into a grocery store.   Madam Speaker, include an article describing her concern.                 [From houstonchronical.com, Apr. 17, 2020]    In Houston's New Normal, a Different Curve Emerges: Outward Racism                           Toward Asian Americans                           (By Olivia P. Tallet)         Coco Ma knows it's risky to leave her house amid the       coronavirus pandemic, as the number of Houston area confirmed       cases increases and the peak is yet to come.        The Rice University MBA student, however, doesn't even do       the occasional run to the supermarket because, for her, the       risk comes not only with battling against the virus but also       against the vitriol aimed at Asian Americans like her,       stereotyped as culprits of the pandemic.        ``I have that fear . . . I ask my husband, who is white, to       pick up the food we order. I'm afraid to go inside myself,''       said Ma, aware of the scapegoating impacting Chinese       Americans and Asians in general who are mistaken as people       from China, where the COVID-19 pandemic was first detected.        Almost 1,500 hate incidents against Asian American and       Pacific Islanders in the U.S. have been reported to the STOP       AAPI HATE initiative since it began tracking incidents March       19.        ``We know that (that) number is only a drop in the bucket.       We know that this is really ubiquitous now,'' said lawyer       Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific       Policy and Planning Council and founder of the tracking hate       initiative, headquartered in California.        Although the tracking isn't well known around the country,       it has already received reports of incidents in 46 states,       including Texas, said Kulkarni. The majority of the attacks       are verbal, but some are also physical.

In West Texas, a man stabbed and cut members of a family       from Burma, at a supermarket in Midland on March 14. The       father and one of his two small children were severely       wounded before a store employee subdued the attacker. The man       allegedly said he did it because he thought the family was       from China and infecting people with the virus. Local media       outlets reported that the FBI is investigating the case as a       hate crime.        In Houston, a city known for its diversity and tolerance, a       woman verbally attacked the owner of the Vietnamese       restaurant Vietopia earlier this month in a parking lot in       front of the business, screaming expletives and, ``You, get       out of our country.''        ``I felt unwanted here. We were very offended,'' said Sammi       Tran, co-owner and wife of the victim, who videotaped the       incident. ``My husband was born here in America. We don't       harm anybody, but this is happening now. I've never felt like       this before.''        ``We go to the supermarket and they look at us as if we       were ugly people,'' Tran said.        `Racism Is Contagious'        At over half a million people, Asians make up 8 percent of       the population in the Houston metro area. Residents with       Chinese heritage represent the third largest subgroup after       Indian and Vietnamese. Roughly 70 percent of Asians in the       city are U.S. born or naturalized citizens, according to the       U.S. Census Bureau.        Statewide, about 1.5 million residents identify as Asians,       or 5.2 percent of the population.        In Houston's Chinatown, the novel coronavirus hit       businesses hard in January, well before residents were       ordered to stay at home. Rumors spread on social media       falsely claiming that an Asian supermarket in the area was       shut down by the government due to coronavirus infections.        Although there wasn't a single COVID-19 case in the state       at the time, the rumors quickly propelled a fear of contagion       and customers avoided the area, driving losses that reached       70 percent overnight for many Asian American businesses.        Not long afterward, President Donald Trump called the agent       of the pandemic ``the Chinese virus,'' stirring outrage and       concern among Asian Americans.        ``The community feels under siege. There is a genuine,       palpable sense of fear in the Asian American community, they       feel that they're being targeted,'' said Texas Representative       Gene Wu, a Democrat from Houston. ``And this is not a       Democratic or Republican issue. I've heard this from       Democratic and Republican'' Asians.        Trump recently said he was not going to use ``Chinese       virus'' anymore, but some of his supporters do.        ``China poisoned our people. President Trump has the       courage to call it as it is: The Chinese Virus,'' the       narrator's voice says over a sinister music clip in a       campaign ad currently running on local television stations       for Kathaleen Wall, who is in the GOP runoff for the 22nd       District of Texas, representing the Sugar Land area.        Asked if she didn't consider that her ad could negatively       impact Asian Americans, she answered in an email: ``Leave it       to Texas Democrats like Sri Preston Kulkarni to defend the       Chinese Communist Party while ten thousand Americans have       died because of the Coronavirus.'' Kulkarni is the Democratic       candidate running in the November general election for       District 22.        Wea H. Lee, chairman of the Asian Southern News Group and       the business organization International Trade Center in       Houston, said attempts to diminish Asian people and their       cultures overlook their success and integration in the       country, such as having higher levels of income and education       than the U.S. population overall.        ``These politicians, the people making this kind of       statement, it's so stupid, they are so nave that they don't       see really what our community looks like,' said Lee.        The Anti Defamation League warns that online forums and       posts, some from white supremacist groups, are ridiculing       Chinese people in relation to COVID-19 and portraying them as       a dirty culture.        A national campaign called ``Racism Is Contagious'' is       using data to raise awareness about the issue and collect       reports of abuses. It shows photos of Asians wearing a mask       with the message ``I am not a Virus,'' which has become a       viral hashtag.                              Invisible stories         For many Chinese Americans, the real story buried under the       vitriolic noise is that their network of connections with       China, Asian doctors and business people is precisely what       has helped them help others during the coronavirus crisis.        The North Houston Chinese American community, for example,       acquired part of its donation of masks and medical supplies       to local healthcare providers via their connections in China,       said Yanbo Wang, one of the organizers. They raised over       $14,000 in donations from 98 families and have helped seven       nonprofit health providers and organizations.        ``We paid for shipments to bring masks that people in China       donated to us,'' said Wang. The shipment arrived right when       those supplies were difficult to find.        Similarly, The Pearland Chinese Association collected and       donated masks and other products from many Asian Americans       who bought them earlier in the year. Hearing from their       families in China about the epidemic gave them an edge to       prepare and acquire products before the pandemic was well       known in America.        Jie Wu, a board member of the association, said many Asian       Americans who work in the Texas Medical Center also let them       know early about concerns with medical supplies. She said       they mobilized and raised thousands of dollars plus masks,       gloves and protective gowns, in what the organization calls       ``The Love for the Community Initiative.''        Masks were collected among school parents, many of whom       worry that the stigma can hurt Asian American children born       in the U.S. Some reports nationwide have already pointed to       hateful incidents against minors.        Coco Ma, the co-founder of #SnacksForMedStaff initiative,       is also concerned about the stereotyping.        ``But I also want people to understand that I wanted to       start the campaign not to prove who I am (and that) people       should not get mad at me'' as an Asian person, said Ma. ``We       Asians are doing this because we care.''        The idea of sending food to medical teams working in       hospitals with COVID-19 cases came to Ma while talking on the       phone with her mother, who is an administrator at a hospital       in China dealing with the pandemic. Initially, she sent       snacks to a few healthcare providers, but the initiative grew       with people sending her money for a GoFundMe campaign.        Ma, a Houston resident, and her classmate and program       partner Kathleen Harcourt,  [[Page H4506]]       who is Asian American, have now created a website to make all       the #SnacksForMedStaff activities transparent to donors. They       have raised around $12,000 of a $20,000 goal and have sent       food packages to hospital teams in Texas and other four       states among the hardest hit by the pandemic.        ``We are getting very good feedback from doctors,'' Ma       said. ``They feel appreciated.''        As the coronavirus is soon expected to peak locally, adding       pressure to medical teams, Ma said her initiative will raise       the funding goal and provide more packages.        ``People are so polarized,'' said Ma. ``Forget about       politics, especially during this pandemic. Forget about race.       Focus on what is the problem and coming up with a solution.       This is about humanity first.''     Madam Speaker, I support this legislation because we  have to stand to cure, to fix COVID-19, not to stigmatize and destroy  the opportunity of saving America and doing the right thing by science.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary and Homeland  Security Committees, and the Budget Committee, I rise in strong support  of H. Res. 908, which condemns anti-Asian sentiment in all its forms  and manifestations, from whatever quarter, and from whomever, from the  ordinary citizen up to and including the President of the United  States.   Since January 2020, there has been a dramatic increase in reports of  hate crimes and incidents against those of Asian descent and the danger  accelerates as the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19, which  currently stands at 197,000, continues to increase and is expected to  exceed 250,000 by Election Day on November 3, 2020. The use of anti- Asian terminology and rhetoric related to COVID-19, such as the  ``Chinese Virus'', ``Wuhan Virus'', and ``Kung-flu'' have perpetuated  anti-Asian stigma and is reminiscent of dark and shameful chapters in  America's past where Asian-Americans were escaped as the ``yellow  peril'' and interned in relocation camps.   Madam Speaker, more than 23,000,000 Asian Americans and Pacific  Islanders account for 7 percent of the Nation's population in the  United States and over 2,000,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders  are working on the frontlines of this COVID-19 pandemic in health care,  law enforcement, first responders, transportation, supermarkets, and  other service industries. Madam Speaker, there are approximately 2  million Asian American owned businesses that generate over $700 billion  in annual revenue and employ nearly 4.5 million workers.   According to a recent study, there were over 400 cases related to  COVID-19 anti-Asian discrimination just between February 9, 2020, and  March 7, 2020 with Asian Americans being harassed, assaulted, and  scapegoated for the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in March 2020,  anti-Asian woman wearing a mask was kicked and punched at a New York  City subway station; two children and two adults were stabbed at a  wholesale grocery in Midland, Texas; a couple was assaulted and robbed  by a group of attackers in Philadelphia; and a 16-year-old boy was sent  to the hospital after being attacked by bullies in Los Angeles,  California.   According to a report in the Houston Chronicle, during this pandemic  a different curve has emerged in the Harris County metroplex, one of  outward racism toward Asian Americans, where the increased use of anti- Asian rhetoric has also resulted in Asian-American businesses being  targeted for vandalism.   Madam Speaker, the Secretary General of the United Nations called for  international solidarity and an end to any ill-founded discrimination  of the outbreak's victims. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) counsels against that  naming COVID-19 by its geographic location or linking it to a specific  ethnicity because such linkage perpetuates stigma. For this reason, in  2015, the WHO issued guidance calling on media outlets, scientists, and  national authorities to avoid naming infectious diseases for locations.   On February 27, 2020, the Secretary of Health and Human Services  stated ``ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus'' and that  it is inappropriate and inaccurate to call COVID-19 the ``Chinese  virus.'' On February 28, 2020, Dr. Mitch Wolfe, the Chief Medical  Officer of the CDC said, ``Stigma is the enemy of public health'' and  on March 10, 2020, Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the CDC,  testified that use of the term ``Chinese coronavirus'' is wrong and  inappropriate.   So, I am proud to be an original cosponsor and to strongly support H.  Res. 908 introduced by my friend, the gentlelady from New York,  Congresswoman Meng. The resolution calls on all public officials to  condemn and denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form and  recognizes that the health and safety of all Americans, no matter their  background, must be of utmost priority. The resolution condemns all  manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination,  anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or religious intolerance  and calls on Federal law enforcement officials, working with State and  local officials to expeditiously investigate and document all credible  reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian- American community in the United States.   The resolution also calls upon federal, state, and local authorities  to so, collect data to document the rise of incidences of hate crimes  due to COVID-19; and to take action whenever appropriate to hold the  perpetrators of those crimes, incidents, or threats accountable and  bring such perpetrators to justice. Finally, and importantly, H. Res.  908 recommits United States leadership in building more inclusive,  diverse, and tolerant communities and combatting misinformation and  discrimination that put Asian Americans at risk.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H. Res. 908 and I thank  Congresswoman Meng for introducing this important resolution.    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary,  Homeland Security, and Budget Committees, the Democratic Working Women  Task Force, and as cosponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2694,  the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), which would ensure that  pregnant workers can continue to do their jobs and support their  families by requiring employers to make workplace adjustments for those  workers who need them due to pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical  conditions, like breastfeeding.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would establish that private sector  employers with more than 15 employees and public sector employers must  make reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees, job applicants,  and individuals with known limitations related to pregnancy,  childbirth, or related medical conditions.   Similar to the Americans with Disabilities Act, employers are not  required to make an accommodation if it imposes an undue hardship on an  employer's business.   Pregnant workers and individuals with known limitations related to  pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions cannot be denied  employment opportunities, retaliated against for requesting a  reasonable accommodation, or forced take paid or unpaid leave if  [[Page H4524]]  another reasonable accommodation is available.   Workers denied a reasonable accommodation under the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act will have the same rights and remedies as those  established under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, including  recovery of lost pay, compensatory damages, and reasonable attorneys'  fees.   While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) and the Americans with  Disabilities Act (ADA) provide some protections for pregnant workers,  there is currently no federal law that explicitly and affirmatively  guarantees all pregnant workers the right to a reasonable accommodation  so they can continue working without jeopardizing their pregnancy.   The Supreme Court's landmark decision in Young v. United Parcel  Service, 575 U.S. __, No. 12-1226, 135 S.Ct. 1338 (2015) allowed  pregnant workers to bring reasonable accommodation discrimination  claims under the PDA.   But pregnant workers are still being denied accommodations because  the Young decision set an unreasonably high standard for proving  discrimination, requiring workers to prove that their employers  accommodated non-pregnant workers with similar limitations.   As a result, in two-thirds of cases after Young, courts ruled against  pregnant workers who were seeking accommodations under the PDA.   Providing accommodations ensures that women can work safely while  pregnant instead of getting pushed out of work at a time when they may  need their income the most.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is especially important considering  that many pregnant workers hold physically demanding or hazardous jobs,  and thus may be especially likely to need reasonable accommodations at  some point during their pregnancy.   Madam Speaker, research shows that pregnant workers are likely to  hold jobs that involve standing and making continuous movements, which  can raise specific challenges during pregnancy.   Such physically demanding work--including jobs that require prolonged  standing, long work hours, irregular work schedules, heavy lifting, or  high physical activity--carries an increased risk of pre-term delivery  and low birth weight.   Twenty-one (20.9) percent of pregnant workers are employed in low- wage jobs, which are particularly likely to be physically demanding.   Pregnant black and Latina women are disproportionately represented in  low-wage jobs, which means as a result, these workers are especially  likely to stand, walk or run continuously during work, and therefore  may be more likely to need an accommodation at some point during  pregnancy to continue to work safely.   Three in ten pregnant workers are employed in four of the occupations  that make up the backbone of our communities: elementary school  teachers, nurses and home health aides.   Employers can accommodate pregnant workers because pregnant women  make up a small share of the workforce, even in the occupations where  they are most likely to work, which means that only a very small share  of an employer's workforce is likely to require pregnancy  accommodations in any given year since less than two percent of all  workers in the U.S. are pregnant each year.   Not all pregnant workers require any form of accommodation at work,  so only a fraction of that small fraction will need accommodations.   For example, pregnant women are most likely to work as elementary and  middle school teachers but only three percent (3.2 percent) of all  elementary and middle school teachers are pregnant women.   But workers employed in four of the ten most common occupations for  pregnant workers--retail salesperson; waiter or waitress; nursing,  psychiatric and home health aide; and cashier--who report continuously  standing on the job would particularly benefit from this legislation.   Madam Speaker, prolonged standing at work has been shown to more than  triple the odds of pregnant women taking leave during pregnancy or  becoming unemployed.   Another four of the ten most common occupations for pregnant  workers--waiter or waitress; nursing, psychiatric and home health aide;  cashier; and secretaries and administrative assistants--involve making  repetitive motions continuously on the job which have been shown to  increase the likelihood of pregnant women taking sick leave.   Pregnant workers in low-wage jobs are particularly in need of this  legislation granting them the clear legal right to receive  accommodations because, in addition to the physically demanding nature  of their jobs, they often face inflexible workplace cultures that make  it difficult to informally address pregnancy-related needs.   For instance, workplace flexibility--such as the ability to alter  start and end times or take time off for a doctor's appointment--is  extremely limited for workers in low-wage jobs.   Over 40 percent of full-time workers in low-wage jobs report that  their employers do not permit them to decide when to take breaks;  between two-thirds and three-quarters of full-time workers in low-wage  jobs report that they are unable to choose their start and quit times;  and roughly half report having very little or no control over the  scheduling of hours more generally.   The second most common occupation for pregnant Latinas--maids and  housekeeping cleaners--is especially physically demanding because,  according to the data, 80 percent of maids and housekeeping cleaners  stood continuously, 38 percent were exposed to disease daily, and 70  percent walked or ran continuously on the job.   Occupations that have seen the most growth among pregnant women in  the past decade expose many workers to disease or infection daily;  depending on the disease, this can pose particular challenges to some  pregnant workers at some points during pregnancy.   When pregnant workers are exposed to some diseases, they face  particular risks; pregnant women with rubella are at risk for  miscarriage or stillbirth and their developing fetuses are at risk for  severe birth defects.   Madam Speaker, no one should have to choose between a paycheck and a  healthy pregnancy, which is why they should have clear rights to  reasonable accommodations on the job to ensure they are not forced off  the job at the moment they can least afford it.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 2694, the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act.
