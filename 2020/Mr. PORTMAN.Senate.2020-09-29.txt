 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the senior  Senator from North Dakota and the majority leader be authorized to sign  duly enrolled bills or joint resolutions on Wednesday, September 30.    Mr. President, I would like to talk tonight about the  nomination of Amy Coney Barrett for the vacant Supreme Court Associate  Justice seat.   I think the President made a great pick. From all indications, she is  an impressive lawyer, judge, and person. We have already begun the  process of looking at Judge Barrett. She has been meeting with Members  of the Senate, and I look forward to my meeting with her.   The precedent for moving forward with this nomination at this time is  crystal clear. During an election year, when one party holds the  Presidency and the Senate, in the entire history of our country, the  Senate has confirmed the nominee in every single case except one. That  one exception, by the way, was somebody who withdrew because of ethics  concerns that both Republicans and Democrats had. So the precedent is  very clear. When you have the President and the Senate of the same  party, we confirm.   In contrast, when power is divided and a Supreme Court vacancy arises  during an election year, Senate precedent is not to confirm the  nominee. In fact, the last time a confirmation occurred with the  President and the Senate of different parties was in the 1880s. That  distinction is what separates now from 2016.   Back then, I wrote an op-ed:         Some argue that the American people have already spoken.       And I agree they have. Both the president and the Senate       majority were fairly and legitimately elected. The last time       we spoke as a nation, two years ago, the American people       elected a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate in an       election that was widely viewed as an expression that people       wanted a check on the power of the president. The president       has every right to nominate a Supreme Court Justice. . . .       But the founders also gave the Senate the exclusive right to       decide whether to move forward on that nominee.    In other words, in keeping with the precedent that I laid out  earlier, the Republican Senate did what Democratic Senates had  traditionally done with a Republican President's nominee. The comments  I made in 2016 were all in that context of divided government.   In fact, in that same op-ed, I warned that divided government is not  ``the time to go through what would be a highly contentious process  with a very high likelihood the nominee would not be confirmed.'' I did  not believe that Judge Garland would have been confirmed. I thought it  was not a good result to have that kind of highly contentious process  for the institution of the Supreme Court or for the Senate.   Now, of course, we have a very different situation. We have a  President and a Senate of the same party. In fact, we have a Republican  Senate that was elected in 2016 and reelected in 2018, in part, to  support well-qualified judges nominated by the President.   No one can disagree that Judge Barrett has an impressive legal  background. As I have looked into her background both as a law  professor at Notre Dame, where three times she won the Distinguished  Teaching Award and, of course, in her record as a judge on the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Judge Barrett has been highly  regarded for her work in the legal world.   By the way, she has been highly regarded from folks across a wide  variety of legal philosophies. They say she is smart. They say she  understands the law. They say she is well qualified. In fact, the  American Bar Association said that about her when she was nominated and  successfully confirmed here in the U.S. Senate to the circuit court,  which, of course, is the second level, right below the Supreme Court.  So she has already gone through the process here. She has been  confirmed here. The American Bar Association looked at her and said she  is well qualified, which is their highest rating. So my hope is that  there will not be any argument about whether she is well qualified or  not, because she clearly is. She has an impressive legal background.   To me, though, her personal story is as impressive as her legal  career. After earning a full ride to Notre Dame Law and graduating  first in her class, she earned a prestigious clerkship on the Supreme  Court for Justice Antonin Scalia. She then married Jesse Barrett, a  classmate of hers at Notre Dame, and is raising seven wonderful  children--two adopted from Haiti--all while advancing her own  extraordinary career in the law. Frankly, I think she is a great model  for working parents everywhere.   As we heard during her last confirmation to the circuit court, when  we talked about her right here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, she was  admired as a good person. Colleagues at Notre Dame, her students at  Notre Dame, and others from across the political spectrum have called  her fair. They have called her compassionate. They have said she is a  good person.   Apart from those legal qualifications and the character, I think it  is fair for the Senate to insist on knowing a judge's judicial  philosophy. My view is that it is the role of Supreme Court Justices to  fairly and impartially apply the law and protect our rights guaranteed  by the Constitution but not to advance their personal preferences or  even their policy goals. That is not the job of judges. They are not  supposed to be like us, legislators. They are not supposed to legislate  from the bench. They are supposed to follow the Constitution, follow  precedent.   It is no understatement to say that Judge Barrett is being  interviewed for one of the most important jobs in the country. That is  why it is important we do get a fair and accurate picture of her  judicial philosophy. Do you know what? Her judicial philosophy lines up  with what I think is right for the Court but, more importantly, what  most Americans think is right for the Court.   As an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal put it recently, Judge  Barrett's body of work puts her ``at the center of the mainstream  consensus on the judge's role as an arbiter, not a lawmaker, who abides  by the duty to enforce the law as written.'' That is her record. That  is the philosophy she talked about as she was confirmed by this body  just a couple of years ago.   While I know that judicial nominations have become incredibly  partisan around here, my hope is that Judge Barrett will be given a  thorough and a fair evaluation from both sides of the aisle. To that  end, I hope my Democratic colleagues will at least meet with Judge  Barrett and engage with her on any concerns they might have rather than  dismiss her nomination out of hand, and I hope that those who end up  opposing her will be able to do so without resorting to the kind of  character assassination we saw with Judge Kavanaugh.   I look forward to the 4 days of Judiciary Committee hearings that  have already been announced by Chairman Graham. This will give all  members of the committee plenty of time to ask questions, to express  their views, and to have the dialogue that they are looking for. I will  be joining millions of Americans in watching those proceedings.   I will also look forward to my one-on-one meeting with her. This will  give me a chance to further assess Judge Barrett's character,  temperament, and legal philosophy.   My hope is that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will also  take the opportunity to fairly review her character, her judicial  temperament, and her legal qualifications, which are so impressive, and  do so in a respectful manner.
