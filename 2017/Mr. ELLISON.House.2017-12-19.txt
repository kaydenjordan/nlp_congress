 Mr. Speaker, in a few hours from now, the Republican  Conference is going to bring forth a tax bill. This bill will  redistribute wealth from working Americans up to the very richest  people in our country. It will result in massive deficits. It will  result in a starvation of the government to stop it from doing critical  things that it needs to do to afford the expenses of our country and to  help Americans lead better lives.   But after it is all said and done, after that is done, Mr. Speaker,  it is going to do at least three more things that are very, very bad.   One of them is that the corporations that get all this money and the  wealthy individuals will, one, do stock buybacks and promote their  personal wealth. They will give each other bonuses to give each other  greater personal wealth.   They will have more money to do more mergers to concentrate markets  even more so that we have more monopoly and oligopoly around, and they  will buy political influence to further corrupt our democratic  government.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bad thing, and I am looking forward to a big,  strong ``no.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask the American people to ask  themselves: Have they ever seen a Republican big-time tax cut for the  wealthy and big companies ever trickle down to them?   If you look over the course of these things that they do every few  years, all they do is concentrate wealth at the very top and take money  out of the hands of working people. They starve government and make it  more difficult for your government--which is of, by, and for the  people--to help you with  [[Page H10194]]  disaster, with Social Security, with Medicaid, with Medicare, or with  any kind of program that you need. It just starves the government of  its ability to make your life better.   But, do you know what, Mr. Speaker?   There is another thing about this particular tax bill. They have been  studying it, and there is going to be one tremendous beneficiary of  this tax bill. It is going to be Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo, which will  see its corporate tax rate drop down to 21 percent from the 35 percent  it is now is going to make, on average, a 13 percent increase in  earnings per share.   Do you remember that big company that opened up a bunch of accounts  people didn't need and sold people insurance they didn't need?   They will be doing better. American families will be doing worse.   Vote ``no'' on this rule and vote ``no'' on this tax bill.
