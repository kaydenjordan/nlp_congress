 Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I do want  to respond to my colleague and his comments about the For the People  Act, which the Democratic Party is continuing to push.   Now, I will say that I am pleased to learn that many of my Democratic  colleagues are standing up against the Jim Crow-era policies that their  party put in place, the work that their party did with the KKK and  other entities to block and obstruct access to the voting booth. And I  will remind him also that the 1965 Voting Rights Act was a very solidly  bipartisan effort that took place here in this Chamber.   And in regard to their S. 1, H.R. 1, For The People Act, it is  anything but the For the People Act. What this would do is make it  easier to cheat and harder to vote. We should be working to make it  easier to vote and harder to cheat. That is what election integrity is  all about, and that is what the American people would like to see.   What this bill would do, their S. 1, H.R. 1, would federalize  elections. Now, many in this Chamber may have served on an election  commission or been the secretary of state in their State, and they  fully appreciate and understand it is the constitutional duty--the  constitutional duty--of the States to set the time, place, and manner  of elections, and that the voter rolls are maintained there in your  local county by citizens who serve on the election commission and who  work those polls. But this bill that the Democrats are wanting to pass  would, in essence, do away with voter ID.   Do you know what? Recent polling of various and different groups,  numerous groups, have shown 80 percent of the American people really  support showing a voter ID, showing an ID in order to cast that ballot.  Prove that you are who you are. Their legislation would also  institutionalize ballot harvesting, something that really offended so  many thousands of citizens this year because with mail-out ballots,  which they want to institutionalize, some people got three, four, five  ballots. You can go online on social media, see pictures or videos of  people holding up multiple ballots. That is not election integrity.  That is not something that will ensure trust in the system. That would  cause more doubt.   We should agree--we should agree, as Members of this Chamber, that we  will work together to ensure that our local and State officials can  carry forward with their elections                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, one of the most important duties  we take on as Members of this Chamber is the confirmation of the  President's Cabinet and other top executive branch issues.    Not until I finish my remarks, but I thank the  gentleman.   A Senate confirmation hearing is probably the world's worst job  interview, but there is a good reason for that. The various candidates  who come before our committees are asking to take on some of the most  important challenges that we face as a country. And so when the  President sends us these nominees for consideration, it is our job to  vet their resumes, to vet their records. To go through the motions is  not enough. We need to meet with them and review their history.   So imagine our shock when the Biden administration began to send us  candidates that made it clear the President expects the Senate to act  as a rubberstamp for some of the most controversial and unqualified  nominees in recent memory.   His choice for Health and Human Services, Secretary Xavier Becerra,  had no meaningful experience in healthcare before his very first day  serving as the country's chief healthcare officer. He did, however,  have quite a long history of weaponizing the full force of government  against people whose views differ from his own.   Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's choice to lead the Department of Homeland  Security, boasted a proven record of corruption from his time serving  in the Obama administration. An investigation by the inspector general  for the Department of Homeland Security revealed that Mayorkas abused  his position as the Director of USCIS to help politically powerful  friends violate immigration laws.   Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta's record as a radical,  liberal activist was so diametrically opposed to the beliefs of most  Americans that she tried to ``evolve'' her positions on drug crime and  defunding the police just to avoid scrutiny during her confirmation  hearing. Of course, by ``evolve,'' I mean she outright lied about her  position. And there have been many, many, who have stood on this floor  and have challenged her nomination.   Another, David Chipman--this is Biden's pick to lead the Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He is so anti-Second  Amendment, he has endorsed policies that would effectively ban all  sporting rifles in the United States. He has no respect for the  constitutional right to bear arms, no respect for the nearly 20 million  Americans who hold a concealed carry permit, or the 15.5 million  Americans who hold hunting licenses. President Biden chose the anti-gun  lobby over the American people when he nominated Chipman for this post.   President Biden's parade of genuinely unacceptable nominees continued  this week. Today, the majority leader has decided to move forward with  the nomination of Donald Remy to be Deputy Secretary of Veterans  Affairs. If that name sounds familiar to you, it is because you have  heard about Mr. Remy's work in other controversial context. He served  as the NCAA's COO and chief legal officer and was the architect of that  organization's restrictive policy against name, image, and likeness  compensation.   Between September 2018 and August 2019, the NCAA spent more than $26  million defending an NIL business model that the Supreme Court recently  described as ``patently and inexplicably stricter than . . .  necessary.'' It was a 9-to-0 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.   The $26 million, where does the NCAA get that money? From colleges,  from universities, from student athletes. That is where the money came  from, and it was used to defend this lawsuit.   But let's not focus on this one policy governing the NIL  compensation. We need to keep in mind that Mr. Remy was comfortable  using his training as a lawyer and his considerable power as a top NCAA  official to maintain the culture of exploitation that defines modern  college athletics. I am not sure what led President Biden to believe  that Mr. Remy could help lead an agency notorious for its own brand of  careless exploitation, but whatever the reason, we have a duty to get  in his way.   For our veterans, decisions can be life or death. I have objected to  his nomination since I came through the committee. And, quite frankly,  I think it is a shame that President Biden refused to nominate someone  who could demonstrate an ability to earn back the trust so many  veterans have lost in the VA system.   Our veterans who have served this Nation honorably deserve better  choices. They deserve at least that much from their Commander in Chief.   This nomination is just one more unserious shot in the dark from an  administration that is yet to focus its energy on any one of the long  list of problems they say they came to Washington to solve.   A quick scan of the morning newsletters on any given day show a  complete lack of direction on the part of the White House and the  Senate majority. Will we be working on infrastructure in the next few  weeks or are we just going to be handling nominations? Are the most  radical elements of the American Families Plan on the table or are we  going to pivot to election law? Well, we won't have to flip a coin on  that last one.  [[Page S4910]]    We know that over the next few weeks, we will waste time and energy  resurrecting the Democrats' failed election takeover bill. As most  everyone has seen, this week, Washington is playing host to a  delegation of Texas Democrats' intent on holding election integrity  legislation hostage in their very own State. They have come all the way  to Capitol Hill to try and convince their Federal counterparts to go  nuclear on behalf of a bill that has failed in various forms so many  times that the objections write themselves. This political stunt is  part of a larger movement within the radical American left to destroy  the concept of one person, one vote and replace it with an  unconstitutional, centralized election system that invites fraud and  encourages donor intimidation. This foolish attack on ballot integrity  has seized hold in Texas, Georgia, and other States attempting to  protect the vote for all eligible voters.   Ballot integrity is a foundational concept in our Republic. It should  be easy to vote. It should be hard to cheat. State and local officials  should feel empowered to grow and tailor elections in a way that meets  the needs of the community, not the demands of power-seeking  politicians.   I think I speak for all of my Republican colleagues when I say that  we will not legitimize this hysteria that has gripped the Democratic  Party. Instead, we will defend the constitutional prerogative of one  person, one vote through however many objections it takes to relegate  this scheme that the Democrats have been trying for 20 years to  relegate this to the dustbin of history   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
