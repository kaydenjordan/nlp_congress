 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on  this essential question of public integrity. I also want to salute my  colleague from California (Mr. Ted Lieu), who has been a leading voice  in demanding real financial accountability in the administration.   I want to underscore some of the things that my colleagues have said,  Mr. Speaker. If there are any Americans out there who love to fly  wherever  [[Page H7623]]  they want, whenever they want, at taxpayer expense, then we have got  the perfect job for you in President Trump's Cabinet. Now, of course,  only billionaires and millionaires need apply for these jobs, but if  you have a taste for fancy chartered air travel, paid for by  hardworking Americans across the country, this is undoubtedly the job  for you.   My friends, while millions of desperate Americans are suffering in  the sweltering posthurricane conditions of Puerto Rico, the Virgin  Islands, Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, we have got Cabinet Secretaries  who should be doing everything in their power to save our people but  are, instead, looking out for something far more important, apparently,  than other Americans' mere survival. They are focused on their own  first class, private charter, airplane flights to cushy destinations,  paid for by hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money. We kid  you not.   This comes out this week. It comes out that Health and Human Services  Secretary Tom Price is less interested in health and human services  than he is in wealth and valet services. Despite the fact that he  blasted the use of government-paid jet travel on CNBC just a few short  years ago, he seems to have come down with a severe and chronic case of  swamp fever, billing you and me and millions of other Americans for 26  customized, deluxe, premier, first class, private charter, plane  flights at taxpayer expense, at an extraordinary estimated cost of more  than $400,000. That is just one Cabinet Secretary.   Now, I can't blame him for one of the trips that he took in August to  the beautiful and secluded St. Simons Island in southern Georgia, and  another trip that enabled him to get to his condo in Nashville and to  have lunch with his son. You can hardly blame him for wanting to get  out of town and to see the family. After all, it was hot here in  Washington, D.C., as climate change sets in across America and the  world. But as we say on Capitol Hill: ``It's not the heat, it's the  stupidity.''   And look at what our Secretary of Health and Human Services did, and  here I will read from Politico, September 26, an article entitled  ``Price's private-jet travels included visits with colleagues, lunch  with son.''   ``The HHS Secretary sometimes combined official travel and meetings  with friends and family. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price  took a government-funded private jet in August to get to St. Simons  Island, an exclusive Georgia resort where he and his wife own land, a  day and a half before he addressed a group of local doctors at a  medical conference that he and his wife have long attended.   ``The St. Simons Island trip was one of two taxpayer-funded flights  on private jets in which Price traveled to places where he owns  property, and paired official visits with meetings with longtime  colleagues and family members. On June 6, HHS chartered a jet to fly  Price to Nashville, Tennessee, where he owns a condominium and where  his son resides. Price toured a medicine dispensary and spoke to a  local health summit organized by a longtime friend. He also had lunch  with his son. . . .    ``An HHS official said both the Georgia and Tennessee trips were for  official government business and were paid for by the Department.''   It is no problem getting out of town and going to see your family  but, really, do the taxpayers have to pay for it?   If the taxpayers have to pay for trips like this, couldn't Secretary  Price at least fly on first class commercial airplanes, rather than  jacking up the taxpayers for tens of thousands of dollars to book a  private airplane to do it?   Politico asked the same question. Here they said:   ``Like some of the other 26 flights that Price took on corporate jets  since May identified by a Politico review, the trip to Tennessee  appears to have occurred despite the existence of multiple commercial  flight options. The trip to Georgia, while less direct, also could have  been accomplished with a routine connecting flight through Atlanta's  busy international airport.   ``On August 4, Price flew a Dassault Falcon 2000 twin jet from  Raleigh, North Carolina, where he had given a speech to a flu vaccine  manufacturer, to Brunswick Golden Isles Airport, which is about a half- hour drive from St. Simons Island. It was the same plane that had  shuttled him between five States in four days, one that HHS had  chartered through Classic Air Charter for more than $86,000, according  to Federal contracts.   ``The plane arrived in Brunswick at 4:02 p.m. the afternoon before  the start of the two-day Medical Association of Georgia retreat and  roughly 40 hours before Price addressed the group, according to airport  records. . . .''                                time  1300    ``At about the same time, there were connecting commercial flights  from Raleigh to Brunswick via Atlanta that would have gotten Price to  St. Simons Island that evening.''   My friends, you can go back and you can look. In all of these cases,  for example, Secretary Price chartered a plane for $25,000 of  government money from Dulles Airport to Philadelphia, a distance of a  mere 135 miles. That charter flight left 5 minutes after a regular  flight flew, commercial flight flew, from Dulles for a few hundred  dollars. So he paid $25,000 and left several minutes later than he  would have left had he just taken the commercial flight.   He also could have taken, of course, the Amtrak, which is what most  people do when they are going to Philadelphia from the Washington area,  for a mere $72. Even the first class Acela would have been around $200.  He could have taken the British Airways--they go there--whose slogan  is: ``To Fly. To Serve.'' I guess that is not quite right. Or he could  have taken Southwest Airlines. Their slogan is: ``Low fares. Nothing to  hide.'' I see that wouldn't have fit. Maybe JetBlue, ``You Above All.''  That could have worked.   But no, instead, he had to book the private jet and fly for $25,000  from here to Philadelphia.   Mr. Speaker, this is an old Washington story. The people who say they  are coming to drain the swamp have become the swamp. And this is not  something that affects just one Cabinet Secretary. Several Cabinet  Secretaries are doing this, as my colleagues have pointed out.   With Secretary Price, who seems to be the captain of the swamp  flyers; Secretary Pruitt, who is a frequent swamp flyer himself; and  Secretary Mnuchin, another swamp flyer, we have a serious staph  infection spreading throughout the Trump administration.   And why not, the President seems to have evolved a whole new model of  government in the 21st century. Government is a money-making operation  for specific families and specific tiny groups in the society. And that  is the message that pervades the Trump administration today.   Mr. Speaker, we need to pass the SWAMP FLYERS Act, which is very  simple. It says that those of us who have the honor and the privilege  of coming to serve the American people here in Washington, D.C., should  use regular commercial air flights unless it is a matter of national  security, or unless there is not a commercial flight that will get them  to where they need to go.   But the idea that you have Cabinet Secretaries who have already taken  dozens of flights, paid for with hundreds of thousands, or millions of  dollars, of taxpayer money when a commercial flight would have done is  an absolute scandal. Now, it hasn't gotten much attention yet because  on the scale of the scandals we have seen in this administration, I  agree, it is a relatively small one. But it is a dramatic and vivid  illustration of what is going on here.   The people who said they were going to drain the swamp became the  swamp. And now, the swamp pervades everything. Every Cabinet member,  all of the Secretaries, the entire government is engulfed in this kind  of corruption.   It begins right at the top, where President Trump has continued to  collect hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars in foreign  payments at the Trump Hotels, at the Trump office tower, and the Trump  golf courses around the world from foreign governments, and has not  once come to the U.S. Congress to ask for our permission and consent as  is required by Article I, section 9, clause 8 of the Constitution,  which forbids the collection of presents, emoluments, offices, and  titles from foreign governments by anybody who serves under the United  States, who holds an office under the United States.  [[Page H7624]]    This President is not only collecting rampant, extreme amounts of  money through his businesses from foreign governments, he is not even  asking us for our permission or our consent. We have got to pass the  SWAMP FLYERS Act.   I commend Mr. Lieu for writing this immediately when the news broke  about this rampant abuse of current regulations. We need to take a  stand as a Congress on a bipartisan level. Unanimously, we can pass  this to say that government officials should not be flying at taxpayer  expense for dubious reasons. We should be using coach like everybody  else, flying commercial like everybody else.   If you have got to fly first class, fine, fly first class, but fly  commercial unless it is a matter of national security, or unless there  is not a commercial flight that will get you there. Is that something  that we can agree on, on a bipartisan basis?   I just want to say, earlier today we saw a magnificent example of  real public service and public dedication by our distinguished  colleague, Mr. Scalise, who has returned, thankfully, to this body. He  demonstrates and embodies what is best in terms of public service.  Unfortunately, we have also seen in Washington this week the  personification of what is the worst in public service. We have got to  stop taking the American taxpayers for a ride.   Let's pass the SWAMP FLYERS Act immediately.
