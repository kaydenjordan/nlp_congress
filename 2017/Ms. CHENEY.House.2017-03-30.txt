 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Barb Lutz. Barb has  spent her entire adult life faithfully serving our military as a  Federal civil service employee, primarily at F.E. Warren Air Force Base  in Cheyenne, as well as in Europe.   Barb has held numerous positions at the base and is currently the  executive assistant to the commander of the 20th Air Force and Task  Force 214 at F.E. Warren. She is responsible for providing the  commander and vice commander with executive support, as well as serving  as protocol specialist for the headquarters staff.   After a distinguished 43-year career, Barb is retiring this week.  When Barb's current and former coworkers at F.E. Warren reached out to  me about recognizing her, General Cotton best summed up how her  colleagues feel about her when he said: ``We all know Barb is a  national treasure.''   I want to thank Barb for all she has done for Wyoming and for the  country over her 43-year career, and I wish Barb and her family the  best in retirement.                            ____________________
