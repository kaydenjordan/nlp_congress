 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Raskin of  Maryland, for his incredible leadership and for the opportunity to  continue to lead the Special Order hour for the Progressive Caucus here  every week. And every week we do try to pick a different topic.   For those of you in the audience, we pick a different topic, and this  evening that topic is the ties to Russia of this administration.   Yesterday, Sean Spicer told veteran White House correspondent April  Ryan that she was ``going to have to take `no' for an answer'' when she  asked him about the President's collusion with Russia.   Well, Mr. Spicer, we are here to tell you that we will not just take  ``no'' for an answer. We are not going to sit back and believe  everything that is coming out from the White House when there is  mounting evidence that President Trump's campaign may have colluded  with Russia to tip the election in his favor.   And for those of you who saw the Judiciary Committee today, we had a  resolution of inquiry from Representative Hakeem Jeffries and Ted Lieu  about this very issue in relation to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and  his ties to Russia.   Let's not forget that President Trump's former national security  adviser and campaign adviser only lasted a record-setting 24 days in  the role because he blatantly lied about meeting with Russia's  Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, during the campaign.   So what other ties to Russia have been confirmed?   There are so many of these ties that I thought it might be helpful to  have a diagram and to really show exactly what the connections have  been between top Trump officials during the campaign who are now the  same officials that are serving in the White House and are the  President's close and personal confidants. The fact that a diagram is  even necessary tells us something.   Let's start at the top with the President himself.   President Trump has a long history with Russia. His first trip to  Moscow was actually 30 years ago. He went to explore potential real  estate opportunities. His relationship with the country has clearly  grown.   In the late 1990s, Trump started banking with Deutsche Bank, which  has since been investigated for funneling Russian money offshore.   Soon after that, he linked up with a Russian company called the  Bayrock Group, which has ties to the Mafia and to criminal interests in  Russia. Their partnership was integral to helping to  [[Page H2553]]  expand The Trump Organization to new heights, with properties springing  up across the country.   His ties to Russia only grew deeper. In the late 2000s, several  Russian businessmen bought properties from The Trump Organization,  netting them hundreds of millions of dollars in profit.   Now, let's fast-forward to 2016 when then-candidate Trump was  building his team. He brought on Carter Page, who is now under  investigation for communicating with Russian officials. And, in fact,  it was the Trump campaign's former manager, Corey Lewandowski, who gave  Carter Page the green light to visit Moscow just last July. A couple of  weeks later, Mr. Page met with Sergey Kislyak, but he said that he will  not reveal the details of that conversation to the public.   This is a very important, consistent fact that we see. Our resolution  of inquiry today that we debated in the Judiciary Committee was about  the release of information so that we understand what is going on.  Without any accusations, what we are trying to say is let us  investigate what these ties are, what the conversations were, and let  us determine, in an independent, bipartisan way, let us determine that  there has not been collusion, and let us make sure that there is no  foreign government that is affecting our democracy.   So various members of Trump's team met with Russian officials during  the campaign. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions didn't just meet with  officials, he lied about meeting with officials during his confirmation  hearing.   And again, the top prosecutor in the United States of America lied  under oath during a confirmation hearing. This cannot be ignored.   Once again, we are not saying don't have conversations, but don't lie  about them. Don't make us wonder what happened during those  conversations. How do we trust the Attorney General of the United  States of America to fairly and impartially preside if he has shown  that he is willing to make false statements just to get the job?   He is not the only high-level Trump official who has been blatantly  dishonest with the American people. Michael Flynn, the former national  security adviser, was put in place by President Trump and resigned due  to the shady backdoor dealings that put him in the pocket of Russian  officials. He was paid $45,000 to attend a state-sponsored gala dinner  and sit at the table of Vladimir Putin.   These connections are more than just mere coincidence.   And in addition to Flynn, Page, and Sessions, there are several  others who have been implicated: Trump's former campaign manager, Paul  Manafort; former campaign adviser, Roger Stone; his personal lawyer-- all of these folks are up here--his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, are  all under investigation for their connections to Russia. And now  President Trump's son-in-law, who has become one of his top advisers,  is under investigation as well for his actions during the campaign.   Not only did Jared Kushner meet with Ambassador Kislyak, he met with  the Russian bankers as well. And the White House has claimed that the  meetings were ``diplomatic,'' but it is deeply troubling that one of  the bankers that he met with was Sergey Gorkov.   I want to be clear about who this person is. He is a graduate of the  Russian Academy of the Federal Security Service, which is an academy  that is tasked with training individuals to become members of Russia's  security and intelligence forces. He is now the chairman of the  Vnesheconombank, and he was appointed by Putin, himself. This is not a  mom-and-pop bank. This is a state-owned corporation that has been under  sanctions by the United States for the past 3 years. And that is a big  deal.   Jared Kushner, whose family is worth nearly $2 billion, has real  estate interests around the world, sat down, allegedly under the  auspices of his role with the President, to chat with this owner of the  bank. A spokesperson for the Kremlin has alleged that this meeting was  ``absolutely the bank's prerogative'' and that the Russian Government  was unaware of the meeting.   We need more information to know what happened in that meeting  because, otherwise, where there is smoke, we think there is fire. So we  need to have the information so that we can actually determine what is  happening with these connections because, if somebody from the Trump  campaign and the Trump administration is meeting with Russian officials  and they don't want to tell us why or what is discussed, then we have  to start wondering whether the conversations are in the interest of the  American people or in the interest of the Russian Government.   We also have Rex Tillerson, President Trump's Secretary of State, who  has strong business ties to Russia and was awarded the Order of  Friendship from Vladimir Putin in 2013. This is the highest honor that  Russia can bestow on noncitizens. Just 2 years prior, Tillerson had  struck a massive $500 billion oil deal with the Russian Government.   Now, we could go on and on with this, but what is important for the  American people to understand is that we have expectations that the  President of the United States and that his Cabinet are working in the  interests of the American people.   We have expectations that, if a deal is struck, it is not for the  benefit of some other country or for the personal benefit of any  individual in office, but that it is for the public's benefit. And if a  deal is struck that takes benefit away from the public in order to give  it to a foreign government or to an individual personal interest of our  government, then that is an enormous disservice to our democracy, and,  of course, there are constitutional ramifications for all of this.   This administration has tried to tell us that the conversations  between Trump's advisers and high-level Russian businessmen and  officials were about diplomacy. Yet this shroud of secrecy that  continues every time we try to get information, every time we try to  make sure that there is an independent, bipartisan investigation, the  shroud of secrecy continues, and it begs the question: If this is  really about advocating for the interests of the American people and  not the Russian Government or the pocketbooks of Cabinet members,  then why the secrecy? What is there to hide?    We don't understand that. If there is nothing to hide, then let us  have the information. There have been plenty of requests to do that in  a classified way in case there is some information that is classified.   But why are the President's campaign advisers and officials denying  under oath that they have communicated with Russia only then to be  forced to walk back their statements or recuse themselves, as Jeff  Sessions had to do, or to even resign?   Foreign policy is key to American interests, but these backroom  conversations and subsequent lies are doing nothing to make the  American people feel confident in an administration that is supposed to  represent them. It is clear that there is a strong tie here that was  only strengthened during the campaign.   But let's be very clear about what is the connective tissue in all of  this, in all of these lines that go back and forth. What is the  connective tissue that connects all of this? It is money.   How did we get to this point?   Of course, we remember the hacking of the election that occurred last  year. It is in the process of being investigated, even though the  chairman of the Intelligence Committee feels that his first duty is to  the President and not to the members of the committee.   But last year, President Trump defended Vladimir Putin by placing the  blame on the Democratic National Committee to distract the American  people; and then, in July, he outright urged Russia to hack Hillary  Clinton's emails, saying: ``Russia, if you are listening, I hope you  are able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.''   In December, a CIA assessment concluded that Russia was trying to  help then-candidate Trump win the election. Why? Because they know that  they have an ally in President Trump. They have someone who is willing  to do business with them, even if it may not be in the best interests  of the American people. They know that they are well connected at every  level of his administration.   And let's be clear about who we are talking about with Mr. Putin.  This is a  [[Page H2554]]  dictator, a human rights abuser, somebody whom Republicans and  Democrats, alike, have said we cannot be associated with.                                time  1745    You have heard of ``The Manchurian Candidate.'' In the most recent  election, we may have ended up with the Kremlin candidate, and the  script truly writes itself.   We were hoping to have a chance to get to the bottom of this, as I  said. We were hoping to have a chance to get to the bottom of this in a  hearing in the House Intelligence Committee, but we never got the  chance.   Last Tuesday, Representative Nunes went to the secret briefing in a  National Security Council facility, and what he found apparently wasn't  good for the President because he ran over there to tell the President.  Instead of doing his duty and reporting the information to the House  Intelligence Committee, he went straight to the White House with his  findings. And he is supposed to be chairing an investigation into what  happened, not being the runner for information to the President.   After briefing President Trump, Representative Nunes canceled the  hearing, denying Americans the opportunity to hear from former Acting  Attorney General Sally Yates. And Ranking Member Jim Himes was right  when he said that ``the Monday hearing last week was, I'm sure, not to  the White House's liking.''   He went on to say: ``Since Monday, I'm sorry to say, the chairman,''  Chairman Nunes, ``has ceased to be the chairman of an investigative  committee and has been running interference for the Trump White  House.''   This is absolutely unacceptable. The fact that we are questioning  whether or not several members of the President's Cabinet--not just  one, not even just two, but several members of the President's Cabinet,  including the President, himself--are guilty of collusion with a  foreign government is a downright outrage.   In my home district, the Seventh District of Washington State, I have  been receiving numerous calls, hundreds of calls from constituents  since day one, saying: How can this be happening in this democracy? How  is this possible in America? How do we make sure that our government is  representing us and not a foreign entity?   Why is it that somebody would lie about whether or not they had a  conversation with the Russian Government if there was nothing to hide?   People are losing faith in the United States Government. It is a  crisis of democracy when people can't trust that their government is  actually trying to get to the bottom of what is going on and actually  representing the interests of the American people.   The White House may have a friend in Representative Nunes, but I want  the American people to know that they have a friend in us. We won't  back down on our demands. Representative Nunes should recuse himself  from this investigation. There is no way we can expect a full and  impartial investigation after what has just occurred.   This should not be a partisan issue. Every Member of Congress,  Republican and Democrat, should be demanding to know the facts. We are  not making judgments. We want to know the facts. If there are facts  that we don't know that say, no, there were very legitimate  conversations, there was no collusion, then we are done. Why tie up the  airwaves with this?   So tonight, as we think about where we are in this debate and we  think about the fact that, for 3 months, this administration has been  under the shadow of secrecy, under the shadow of mistrust from the  American people, there is a very easy way to clear all of the names of  the people who are on this list, including the President of the United  States, and that is to ensure that we have an independent  investigation; to ensure that Representative Nunes recuses himself and  steps down as the chair of the Intelligence Committee, given what has  happened; and to ensure that, at the end of the day, we remember that  the Government of the United States of America, the President of the  United States of America, the Congress of the United States of America,  our one duty is to represent the people of the United States of  America.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) for his  leadership.
