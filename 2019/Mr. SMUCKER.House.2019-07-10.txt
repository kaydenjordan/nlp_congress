 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Anthony Cicero  IV and Dakota Snyder of Elizabethtown High School in Lancaster County  for their remarkable achievement on winning the Student Angler  Federation High School Fishing World Championship last month.   Their partnership led them to victory over 389 high school teams from  around the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, these two young gentlemen are no strangers to the water.  At their young age, they have been tournament fishing for years and  practicing all year round.   Dakota said: ``As long as there is no ice, I am out there fishing.''   It is a trait that runs in the family, as Anthony and Dakota's  fathers fished together as a team as well.   Mr. Speaker, we are blessed with beautiful and great natural  resources in York and Lancaster Counties, which will be celebrated and  protected through the passage of my legislation to create the  Susquehanna National Heritage Area.   I am very thankful that these two young men enjoy spending time in  nature while using their talents. I wish them both continued success  and congratulate them on their championship victory.      Honoring Community Leaders Making an Impact Combating the Opioid                                  Epidemic     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and give thanks to  community leaders who are making an impact on the communities I  represent in combating the opioid epidemic.   York and Lancaster County are leading the Nation in their community- wide, collaborative approach to help neighbors who are struggling with  addiction.   York County District Attorney David Sunday and coroner Pam Gay are  leaders in our community. They have brought together community  organizations in York County, creating an organization that is now  known as the York Opioid Collaborative, assisting in coordination of  services and raising awareness about the opioid crisis in our  communities and across the Nation.   Similarly, in Lancaster County, Alice Yoder, the director of  community health with Penn Medicine, and Lancaster County Commissioner  Josh Parsons have led an organization called Joining Forces, another  community-wide effort, this one in Lancaster County.   Mr. Speaker, while Congress continues to address this critical issue,  we are fortunate in Pennsylvania's 11th District to have public  servants leading on the effort to address this horrific epidemic. I  thank them and many others across our community who are working  together to make a difference.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   I rise today in opposition, as well, to this amendment which seeks to  limit education choices for our Nation's servicemembers. Under current  law, institutions receiving Federal funding must meet the financial  responsibility standards under the Higher Education Act. That is why  the Department of Defense and the Department of Education are already  required to oversee and evaluate an educational institution's fiscal  health and academic programming. Let me repeat, they are already  required to do that.   This amendment is not only unnecessary, but it is also misleading.  Let's be honest about what this amendment is really about. It is just  another effort at eliminating all for-profit higher education  institutions.   Just a few weeks ago, I met with a group of veterans from my district  who are attending or recently graduated from YTI Career Institute in  Lancaster. They each shared similar stories about how traditional  institutions of higher education--and I have a lot of good ones in my  district--but in this particular instance they did not meet their  needs.   YTI Career Institute in Lancaster, a for-profit institution, did meet  their needs and offered them a pathway to fast-track them into the  workforce.   Why should we take this option away?   These veterans were very concerned that the programs which have  worked so well for them and many others may be eliminated by this  overregulation.    Madam Chair, if my colleagues truly were interested in  improving accountability, then they would apply these standards to all  institutions of higher learning, not just the ones they dislike.   I strongly oppose this unneeded amendment.
