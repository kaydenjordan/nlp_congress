 Madam Speaker, I had a saying when I was chair  of New Jersey's appropriations committee: Show me your budget, and I  will show you your priorities.   So let's take a look at what the President's budget prioritizes:   An additional $8.6 billion for his misguided, hate-fueled wasteful  wall;   A 5 percent increase in the already bloated Pentagon budget,  including money for his childish space force; and   Making tax cuts for the rich permanent, the same cuts that exploded  the deficit.   Now let's look at what he apparently does not value:   Medicare, $845 billion in cuts;   Medicaid, $241 billion in cuts; and   SNAP--that is meals for families that have fallen on hard times--$220  billion in cuts.   He also clearly doesn't prioritize:   The environment, 31 percent cut from the EPA;   Education, $207 billion cut from student loan programs; or   Infrastructure, 22 percent cut from the Department of Transportation.   Madam Speaker, any way you look at the budget, it is clear: This  President needs to get his priorities in order.                            ____________________
