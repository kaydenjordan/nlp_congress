 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a truly dedicated  township official from Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District,  which I am honored to represent.   Mr. Les Houck, of Salisbury Township, in eastern Lancaster County, is  retiring as a member of the Salisbury Township Board of Supervisors  after 48 years of dedicated service in that body; almost a half a  century.   In fact, his service to the township began 2 years prior to his 48  years as a supervisor, in 1972, when he was appointed to the township's  planning commission.   Les is a wonderful husband and father as well, but as I said, he has  dedicated half a century working to improve his community. Over the  years, Les has become a trusted voice who is sought out for counsel in  Lancaster County and across the Commonwealth as well.   Beyond his service to the residents of Salisbury Township, Les served  on several boards for Lancaster County, on advisory committees to the  Governor and other State departments, and in leadership roles with both  the county and State associations of township supervisors.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Les Houck  for 50 years of service to the residents of Salisbury Township and for  being an outstanding and true example of servant leadership.                       Congratulating EHD of Lancaster     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate EHD of  Lancaster as they celebrate their business' 125th anniversary; truly an  impressive milestone.   The business, Engle-Hambright & Davies, now known as EHD, dates back  to 1896 and has grown over the years, from previously working in real  estate to now being a respected full-service insurance agency which  employs 120 individuals with offices in Lancaster, Reading, Exton, and  Pittsburgh.   They are one of only a few independent insurance agencies who  achieved the Best Practices distinction for 6 consecutive years from  the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America.   They continue to work to give back to the community they have called  home for over a century, supporting a number of local nonprofit  organizations through their many charitable efforts.   Mr. Speaker, the American entrepreneurial spirit has led to the  founding of many businesses. Some do well, some fail, but not many have  lasted for 125 years. That is rare.   Today, I want to mention EHD. We celebrate with them. We congratulate  them on achieving this milestone, and we wish them continued success.                            ____________________
