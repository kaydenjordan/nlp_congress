 Madam President, I want to commend my good friend from  the great State of Utah, Senator Mike Lee, for his work on putting this  bill together and pulling the people together to support this bill.   I support this bill. We have some language that needs to be  clarified, and I still have some concerns about the impact this  legislation would have on  [[Page S5592]]  some specific industries in not only my State but in the country. I  want to work with Senator Lee in addressing these concerns and come to  a resolution on this very quickly. I commit to working with him and his  team to make sure we get to a resolution because we want the exact same  thing, and this is totally consistent with what President Trump is  trying to do in his long-term work to fix our broken immigration  system.   With that, I object.
