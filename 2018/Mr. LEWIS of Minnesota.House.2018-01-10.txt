 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Indiana (Mr. Rokita) for introducing this very important legislation  that restores a simple promise: the sovereign rights of Native  Americans will be protected.   For almost 70 years following the passage of the National Labor  Relations Act, Tribal sovereignty was upheld and Tribes were given the  equal right to self-governance enjoyed by our State and local  governments. For the Tribes in my district, sovereignty meant the  freedom to advance their own economic development and provide critical  government services to their Tribal members.   With the NLRB's San Manuel decision, unelected bureaucrats tossed  aside this longstanding precedent and began to assert themselves in  Tribal matters on an arbitrary, case-by-case basis. The agency granted  itself the right to navigate Tribal law and decide when a Tribal  enterprise is for commercial purposes, a requirement that would never  be imposed on revenue-generating activities of State and local  governments.   As the Federal bureaucracy expands its own power, Tribes face legal  confusion and uncertainty, hindering their self-sufficiency and the  ability to provide for their members.   The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act restores the well-established legal  standard of Tribal sovereignty. As State and local governments are  excluded from the Federal requirements of the NLRA, this bill simply  ensures Tribal governments receive equal treatment, not lesser status.  It provides our Tribes with needed clarity that, when an enterprise is  owned and operated by the Indian Tribe and located on Tribal land,  Tribal sovereignty will be protected.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation, and I am  glad it was included in this package, which I urge my colleagues to  support.    Mr. Speaker, it has only been a few weeks  since Congress passed the historic tax reform bill, but I am afraid it  has got to be very tough for the opponents and our friends across the  aisle because, well, you have to wonder: At some point, don't they tire  of being wrong so often?   You might recall some claim before we passed the bill that it would  raise taxes on the middle class, yet a majority of Americans will now  see a tax decrease. In fact, the average family of four in Minnesota's  Second District, which I am proud to represent, will see a tax cut of  $3,154.   Then they claim that reducing taxes on businesses would never benefit  Americans, but employers have already responded by giving a combined  total of $1 billion in bonuses and wage increases to their employees.  That equates to over 1 million Americans and counting getting a bonus.   Finally, they said the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would never jump-start  economic growth. Well, now, after two quarters of well over 3 percent  growth, approaching 4 percent, it is as if the opponents of the tax  reform bill are left telling the American people: Are you going to  believe me or your own eyes?   The fact of the matter is our opponents rely on hyperbole, but the  facts speak for themselves.                            ____________________
