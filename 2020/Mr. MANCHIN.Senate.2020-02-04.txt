 Madam President, it is my distinct honor to  recognize a beloved member of my hometown of Farmington, WV, as well as  a very dear lifelong friend to me and my family: Alice Priester, who  celebrated her 100th birthday on February 2, 2020.   Particularly what comes to mind when I think of Alice is our bond  with the coal miners of our great State. She and I have both lost loved  ones to accidents in the coal mines. Every day, as I fight for these  brave souls who perform this dangerous work, I am also thinking of the  family members like Alice, who also depend on safety standards, fair  wages, and precautions. She and her late husband Paul have one son,  Fred, who is also involved in the coal industry. I carry this heritage  with me no matter where I am but especially when I am in Washington.   The women in my life who raised me are the most important people in  the world to me. Even those not related by blood are considered as good  as family in tight-knit communities like Farmington, and Alice is an  inspiration to me and so many others. Having defeated cancer twice,  Alice is one of the strongest, most inspirational people I have ever  had the pleasure of calling a dear friend. When she is not cheering on  the WVU Mountaineers, Alice is very involved with our church, helping  with funeral dinners and driving her neighbors and friends to town and  church functions. She also has had a history of involvement with the  volunteer fire department and fundraising, and she treats her neighbors  as family.   From her days working at the local mine's company store to her  retirement from the dining hall at Fairmont State University, Alice has  showcased an unparalleled work ethic and zest for life that truly  represents the very best of what it means to be a West Virginian.   Alice while you weren't born here, you certainly are a West Virginian  in your heart and soul. In West Virginia, if you are hungry, you will  be fed. If you are lost, someone will not only give you directions but  will offer to drive you to your destination. I am so deeply proud of  the people of my home State and the values that make us stand out from  the rest of the Nation. Gayle and I are so deeply appreciative of your  very dear friendship, your generosity to the Farmington community, and  your warm, welcoming hospitality.   Alice, as your family and friends honor you, please know that you  have provided so much happiness and wisdom to the lives of those around  you throughout the years. It is my wish that the memory of your special  100th birthday remains with you just as your guidance and influence  will remain in all the lives you have touched. Again, it is with the  greatest admiration that I send to you my best wishes.                            ____________________
