 Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the Central  Methodist University Eagles men's soccer team of Fayette, Missouri, in  Missouri's Fourth Congressional District, winner of the NAIA men's  national soccer championship.   Head coach Alex Nichols and the Eagles capped off a superb 22-2-2  season with a penalty shootout victory over Missouri Valley in the  championship finale in Irvine, California.   This national soccer championship is the first ever for any team  sport for Central Methodist University. It is the culmination of steady  progress that saw the Eagles move from a top 30 ranking three seasons  ago, to a top 20 ranking two seasons ago, to a top 12 ranking last  season, and, finally, to the number one spot this past season.   I congratulate the Central Methodist University Eagles on winning the  national championship. Your hard work, dedication, and determination  paid off and left an example future teams will strive to follow.   Well done.                            ____________________
