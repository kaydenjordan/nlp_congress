 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a  colloquy with my colleagues, the Senators from Washington and  Connecticut. I also ask to be notified when we have used 45 minutes of  the Democrats' time.    Mr. President, given the serious and troubling  allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, I am deeply disturbed that  the Senate is moving forward with this nomination.   When it was announced that the FBI could investigate these serious  and credible allegations, I had hoped there would be a legitimate  investigation. As the former Attorney General of California, I have  tremendous, tremendous respect for the sworn law enforcement officers  at the FBI. This should have been a search for the truth. They should  have been allowed to do their full job, but instead, the White House  did not allow it. This was not a search for the truth. Instead, this  was about politics and raw power to push through an unfit nominee.   I am a former prosecutor. I have led investigations, and I have  prosecuted all types of crime--particularly violent crimes, including a  specialization in sexual assault cases--as a prosecutor. I have tried  these cases in a courtroom. I have spent hours--hours--with assault  victims, and I can tell you that when we look at what happened during  the course of these days--these few days--in reviewing and giving  regard and respect to Dr. Ford, we have fallen short. We have fallen  short.   Sixty-three percent of sexual assaults are not reported to the police  in our country. Delayed reporting is normal. I will tell you that when  I was personally prosecuting sexual assault cases, we would be in a  courtroom. I would be there as the prosecutor, with the accused, the  accused's attorney, a judge, and a courtroom full of prospective  jurors, and we would engage in a process called voir dire, where we  would talk with prospective jurors to determine if they would be able  to sit as a juror and, without bias, listen to the case and then make a  determination about the facts and the law.   I cannot tell you the number of times, colleagues, that a prospective  juror would raise their hand and ask could they quietly speak with me  and the defense attorney and the judge in the judge's chambers outside  of the courtroom and outside of the sight and the ability for anyone  else in the courtroom to hear. We would go into the judge's chambers,  and I cannot tell you the number of people who would sit in a chair,  and, with tears in their eyes, tell us that they had been a victim of  sexual assault and had never told anyone, not even their spouse, but  because of what they had experienced, they knew they could not possibly  sit in a courtroom and hear the testimony they knew would come related  to the charges they knew the case was about.   This is an issue that impacts so many Americans, most of whom don't  report it and don't tell anyone, and usually when they do, it is  because something precipitated the telling of their story that was  beyond the time during which they endured the assault itself.   Dr. Ford's experience in this regard is no different from the  majority of sexual assault victims, and she should be believed. I know  what it means to engage in an investigation and a search for the truth,  having been a part of investigations to determine what has happened  and, in particular, if a crime has occurred.   Now, let's be clear about one thing. There has been a lot of  conflation around here about the subject and the need for an  investigation into Dr. Ford's allegations. Ours was not a search to  determine whether a crime occurred. Ours was not a search to determine  whether we had enough facts to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a  crime had occurred. No. Ours was an investigation to figure out enough  about what happened to determine if Brett Kavanaugh is fit to serve on  the highest Court in our land. Is he fit to be a jurist in the place  where we have said justice in our country occurs, in the house where we  listen to evidence and truth and make determinations based on the  veracity and truthfulness of what has occurred? That is our role when  it comes to Dr. Ford's allegations, and we fell short. We fell short.  We did not do her justice, and we did not do the American people  justice.   We were given 1 week to investigate. The Republicans said: You will  get 1 week. They threw out 1 week--an arbitrary amount of time--and in  less than 1 week we were presented with paltry documents. Clearly, when  the White House directed the FBI to do its work, it appears from  everything I have seen, the FBI was not permitted to look at all of the  allegations. That is clear to me. It is clear the White House did not  permit the FBI to request Mark Judge's Safeway employment records. It  is clear, from everything I have seen, the White House did not permit  the FBI to investigate the dishonest testimony of Brett Kavanaugh or to  examine and listen to the evidence that would have been provided by a  list of over two dozen witnesses who would have been, at the very  least, able to corroborate or deny the allegations that were made. This  was not a meaningful investigation into the allegations that are before  us, and this, most importantly, was not a search for the truth.   Media outlets have reported that there are more than 40 people with  potential relevant information who are willing to share their  information but only 9 people were interviewed. This is a travesty.  They did not interview the Georgetown Prep alumni or others from that  era who contradict Kavanaugh's testimony. They did not interview Dr.  Ford's husband or a number of her friends who she told of the assault  before--before--Kavanaugh's nomination. They did not interview the  former FBI special agent who conducted Dr. Ford's polygraph. They did  not interview Kavanaugh's roommate at Yale who has contradicted  Kavanaugh's testimony. They did not  [[Page S6582]]  interview another one of Kavanaugh's neighbors in the dorm at Yale.  They did not interview three of Kavanaugh's friends from Yale who wrote  in the Washington Post just last night:         Brett also belonged to a Yale senior secret society called       Truth and Courage. We believe that Brett neither tells the       former nor embodies the latter.    They did not interview Dr. Ford at all--they did not interview Dr.  Ford at all. They did not give her the ability to speak her truth  during the so-called investigation, and they did not interview Judge  Kavanaugh about these allegations.   This was not a search for the truth. This was not an investigation.  This was an abdication of responsibility and duty. This is on the heels  of a process that began with hiding more than 90 percent of Judge  Kavanaugh's record. We only received approximately 400,000 pages out of  an estimated 6.9 million pages of documents. The Republicans have been  saying: You should be happy you received thousands of pages of  documents because they want us to treat crumbs on the table like it is  a feast. These were crumbs on the table compared to the vast amount of  information that is available to some about his background.   This process has left the American people with more questions than  answers. This has not been a search for the truth.   The minimum standard for a Supreme Court nominee should be someone  who we are confident will demonstrate impartiality, integrity, and  truthfulness, but the nominee we are voting on has not demonstrated  those qualities.   Every American is entitled to the benefit of the doubt, but nobody is  entitled to a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.   I yield to my colleague Senator Murray.    Senator Murray, you and I have talked about it. We all  talked about it. Part of the pain of this process is a real concern  that sexual assault victims and survivors may take away from this  process that their stories will not be heard or believed. Part of the  pain I am taking away from this process is those who have a story to  tell or might have been prepared to have the courage to report may  decide: Look what happened to Dr. Ford. It doesn't matter. No one will  believe me, and why should I go through that?   I have to say this. You and I have discussed it, and Senator  Blumenthal and I have discussed it together. Part of what we must  message--even if our Republican colleagues will not--is to all of the  women and men out there who have experienced this: We will hear you. We  will see you. We will respect you. We will give you dignity. Speak your  truth. Do not be afraid. Do not let this system or any aspect of it  bully you into silence.   It is critical we talk about this issue. I believe this is an issue  right now that is where the issue of domestic violence was about 30  years ago. There was a perception about domestic violence I hope we  have gotten beyond. There was a perception about domestic violence: Oh,  you know, what happens in the King's castle is the King's business.  That is private business. That is not our business.   Then we evolved as a society and realized, no, she is walking around  with a black eye or a busted lip; that is everybody's business. She  deserves to be safe, and we must stand up for her. I believe this is an  inflection moment on the issue of sexual assault, and I hope and pray  this is a moment where everyone will agree, no one should silently  suffer. Let's talk about this. Let's talk about the fact that every 98  seconds in the United States of America, someone is sexually assaulted.  Let's talk about the fact that 63 percent of sexual assaults are not  reported to the police. Let's talk about the fact, since Dr. Ford had  the courage to speak out, one of the biggest national organizations  that addresses sexual assault saw a 738-percent increase in the calls  they received from survivors of these cases.    I say to Senator Blumenthal, my response would be no. My  response is no, and I will tell you why--because one of the most  important qualities of a juror in our system of justice is that they  have the ability to receive information without bias, without any  interest in the outcome, and Judge Kavanaugh has made it very clear to  the American public that he is biased, that he is perceiving  information and perceives it through the lens of a partisan and through  the lens of the person he has been his entire career, which is a  partisan operative.   There were moments, perhaps during his initial testimony, where he  may have distracted us from that part of his  [[Page S6584]]  history, where he talked in a calm voice about certain things. He  certainly knows case law and talked about it. But when the issues got  hot, when it became about fundamental issues, the veneer was stripped  away, and Brett Kavanaugh showed us who he really is.   On the point of temperament, I think it is important for a number of  reasons that the American people really review his testimony during  those hearings these last days of this process because what he showed  us also are two things in the way that he responded to our colleagues  and approached the issue.   One, he showed us that he lacks credibility, and I will tell you why  I say that. When I was trying cases, I recall an instruction the jury  would receive at the close of a case; the judge would give the jury  instructions about how they could evaluate--it was a tool to help them  evaluate the credibility of a witness, and one of the instructions was  that it is relevant and significant for you to analyze the demeanor of  this witness toward the proceedings. On this point, let's recall Dr.  Ford's demeanor and Judge Kavanaugh's demeanor.   Dr. Ford went out of her way to be helpful and truthful. She  corrected herself when she thought there was more to offer. She  yielded: Would the committee like a break? If so, I will take one. If  not, I can keep going.    By contrast, Judge Kavanaugh was arrogant, he was aggressive, he was  accusatory, and, clearly, he was not in control of himself. But I have  to believe he was in control of his words because, as the Senator has  pointed out, he told us he wrote his speech the night before. He said:  I didn't show my staff. I just wrote these.   Well, you know, we often advise people when you are feeling hot about  something, write it all out and then sleep on it. Then look at those  words the next day, and see if you really want to stand by them.   This is a judge who is meticulous, he says, in everything he does. I  believe that he wrote those words the night before. I am sure he slept  on it. I am sure he looked at those notes again, and he decided that is  what he was going with because it wasn't just about the heat of that  moment. These are the things he really believes. That is why he said  it, so let's believe him at his word. He is a partisan.   For that reason, I answer the Senator's question by saying, no, I  would not select him to be on a jury.    I thank my colleagues from Washington and from  Connecticut. I agree, we can find a better nominee, and I yield to the  Senator from the great State of Virginia.
