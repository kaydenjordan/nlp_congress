 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and  legacy of a good friend and brilliant attorney and someone who is a  staunch advocate for voting rights all across our great land in the  State of Texas, Gerry Hebert.   Originally from Worcester, Massachusetts, Gerry earned his law degree  from Suffolk University. Upon graduating, he began his career as an  attorney practicing voting rights.   From 1973 to 1994, Gerry served in the Department of Justice, where  he worked as lead attorney in numerous voting rights and redistricting  lawsuits. He also served as a chief trial counsel in over 100 voting  rights cases. In his 20-year tenure at the DOJ, he received numerous  commendations, including an award for his work in connection with the  Boston school desegregation case in 1975, which received much national  attention.   I had the privilege of knowing Gerry very well through his times as  cocounsel with the Legal Defense Fund, the Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale  and Dorr LLP firm, where he partnered to successfully challenge  racially discriminatory voting ID laws in Texas.   I will always remember Gerry's hard work, his dedication. Gerry was  someone that just understood the Constitution and the laws of our land  so well and could have chosen a different career in law that would have  earned him millions and millions of dollars, but Gerry truly wanted to  help the people, especially people that were disenfranchised and had  been wronged, particularly people that had been historically wronged.   Gerry will always be remembered as a great guy. Gerry leaves behind a  wonderful family, some of whom I have gotten to know. I express  condolences from the bottom of my heart. We will all miss Gerry, in  particular, the people and the communities that Gerry defended to make  sure that they had equal rights in this country.                            ____________________
