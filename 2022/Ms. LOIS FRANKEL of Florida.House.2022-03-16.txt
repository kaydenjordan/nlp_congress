 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, this month is Women's  History Month. I think you are making history, Madam Speaker, today,  one of the youngest women ever to be elected from California and,  actually, in the country. Women are making history.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be here. Hopefully, we are going to  have a few more speakers here today, but I do want to start.   I am going to take a page out of the book of our great First Lady,  Jill Biden. I attended a ceremony over at the White House where she and  the President celebrated Women's History Month. And she started out  with a salute, I think, to--if you could think of anybody who you want  to give a shout out to, she gave it to her own mother. And I am going  to start with that too because, you know, most of our mothers, they are  not very famous, and it is not like they made history.   But the fact of the matter is, moms are probably the most influential  people in the world. In fact, if you ever go to an event where someone  is being honored, who is the first person they thank? It is their  mother.   So I am going to start this Women's History Month with my remarks by  thanking my mother, Dorothy Frankel--and let me just say this--who has  inspired me in every way, and now, at 96 years old, with--I would say  with a mind better than mine--maybe that is not saying much, but with  her full faculties and the energy to live.   I want to say thank you, mom, like all the other moms who give us the  unconditional love and the support, whether the sun is shining or the  rain is raining.   So today, I think we have some other people here. Before I continue  my remarks, I want to yield to a very special friend.   We talk about making history. I am going to yield to one of the most  dynamic Members of the House of Representatives. She is from Texas. She  has got her hands full. I mean, I will tell you what: I don't know  whether it is more difficult today being from Texas or from Florida, I  think our Governors are in some kind of contest with each other. But I  am going to yield to the amazing gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee).    Madam Speaker, I would just say that it  is a joy to be on the floor with Representative Jackson Lee. I thank  the gentlewoman very, very much. She makes my job very easy.   Madam Speaker, I yield again to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Speier).    I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership. She will be missed. I know she will go on to bigger and  better things. She has made her mark in the history of this country for  sure.   I want to thank my colleagues, Sheila Jackson Lee and Jackie Speier,  for coming to the floor. They gave us a great education tonight, and I  appreciate that.   I will conclude, Madam Speaker, the way I started, which is I thank  all those millions and millions of unknown women who lift us up every  day, who dry our tears, and who share our happiness with that  unconditional love, and those are our mothers who are probably, as I  said, the most influential part of the history of the world.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
