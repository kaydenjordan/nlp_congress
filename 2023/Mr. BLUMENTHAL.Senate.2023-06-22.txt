 Mr. President, in just a very short time, we will be  voting in this body on whether to take a step backward in our efforts  to stop gun violence.   Let's be very clear: The vote in just about half an hour will be to  overturn a regulation that was final at the beginning of this year and  went into effect at the end of May--just weeks ago. Yet our Republican  colleagues are all too ready to take that step backward on a regulation  that would help prevent the kinds of tragedies that we have seen again  and again and again in this great country. In a short time, this  regulation will be before us in a way that, I hope, we will defeat  soundly.   Just last week, we held a summit in Hartford, CT, bringing together  all of the major groups involved in trying to prevent gun violence and  addressed by the President of the United States, who has promulgated  this regulation that requires the registration of pistol braces. It is,  perhaps, seemingly, a small matter to the vast majority of Americans,  but the fact is that, in the past 4 years alone, pistol-stabilizing  braces have been used in a number of mass tragedies.   Just to give you an example, 10 people were killed and 3 injured at a  grocery store in Boulder, CO; 9 people were killed and 27 injured  outside a bar in Dayton, OH; 5 people were killed and 25 injured at a  club in Colorado Springs, CO; 6 people were killed at a church school  in Nashville, TN.   In each of these instances, people were killed by someone using a  pistol brace. They are so dangerous because they can convert pistols  into short-barreled rifles, and they do it by providing stability. A  brace attaches a pistol to a shooter's arm, stabilizing the gun and  allowing it to be fired from the shoulder. The shooter thereby acquires  the power and accuracy of a rifle with an easily concealed pistol.   So, today, we are here to decide whether that ATF rule, supported by  the President--to his credit--and designed to keep Americans safe from  these makeshift rifles, will stand.   What was so apparent in Hartford when the President spoke to us there  was the energy and spirit reflecting America's support for these kinds  of commonsense gun violence prevention measures. All of those groups  that attended, representing the American people, were, in fact,  energized by a growing consensus in America: that the majority of  Americans support these kinds of commonsense measures.   More and more, the gun violence prevention movement is led--not just  supported but led--by young people who see our future as stopping gun  violence on our streets that continues to take more than 100 lives  every day. These young people--some of them were actually in Sandy Hook  and were 6 years old at the time that their fellow elementary school  students were taken from us--are now graduating from high school. They  are voting. They are supporting candidates. They are running for  office. This new generation is going to say ``enough is enough'' just  as they did in Hartford at this summit and just as the President said,  in effect, when he addressed them.   So the President is taking action under his present authority, even  without new legislation, to try to confront and contain and stop gun  violence.   We need to be committed to new legislation. I have urged background  checks to be applied universally, ghost gun bans, assault weapon bans,  large-capacity magazine bans, and perhaps, very feasibly and achievably  in this Congress, a requirement for safe storage.   Much more is necessary as a matter of legislation, but the President  is committed to taking action under his present executive authority to  require commonsense measures, and this registration requirement is one  of them.   Let's be very clear: It doesn't ban pistol-bracing; it simply  requires that gun owners register them. The rule amends ATF's  regulation to require and clarify, when someone uses a pistol- stabilizing brace to convert a pistol into a short-barreled rifle, that  that person needs to register the gun as a short-barreled rifle. If  somebody is going to convert a pistol into a short-barreled rifle, it  needs to be explicitly registered.   Today, we have a choice. Either we allow shooters to turn pistols  into powerful, accurate, easily hidden rifles, with total impunity, or  we have the courage to protect our communities. That is a choice that  we have right here on the floor of the U.S. Senate by every single one  of us--whether to save lives or continue to enable those pistols to be  more lethal, more deadly, and more intolerable.   I have been working on this issue for a long time. When I first  became Attorney General of the State of Connecticut in the early 1990s,  I championed a ban on assault weapons. I defended it in our State  courts against many of the arguments made here. At that point, the  number of advocates was a handful on our side. This movement has grown,  and it has been fueled by the tragedies that we confront--the ones that  I mentioned--where short-barreled rifles had been used with a pistol  brace and lives had been lost because of this contraption that makes  guns more lethal, more deadly.    We don't need pistol braces for legitimate uses of guns; and if they  have legitimate uses, they can simply be registered.   The movement that has built over these years since the early 1990s  and,  [[Page S2202]]  most directly, since Sandy Hook, has been fueled by these tragedies  that we can help prevent going forward. That is our obligation today.  The summit that came together just last week in Hartford, where the  President committed himself unequivocally and dramatically to these  kinds of commonsense measures, can be advanced if we permit this kind  of executive action to be taken.   Now is no time for a step backward. Now is no time to say to the  President: You can't take this kind of commonsense action under  existing authority.   Now is the time to move forward with stronger legislation--all of  those measures that I mentioned and more--that will make America safer  and that will help prevent the kinds of tragedies that these pistol  braces simply aggravate and fuel.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  Westport Library as it celebrates the release of its first vinyl  record.   Public libraries serve vital roles in our communities, providing no- fee access to collections of books, films, and other media, as well as  to computers and the internet. They are hubs of community interaction,  and now, in Westport, CT, a creative outlet for local musicians.   Founded in 1886, the Westport Library has been enriching the  community for almost a century and a half. In addition to its full  collection of books for readers of all ages, the library is  [[Page S2220]]  home to a MakerSpace, a Library of Things, a seed library, a cafe and  store, and a collection of professional artwork. These resources make  the Westport Library one of the best libraries in all of America--a  ``noisy library,'' as its supporters say, and a true jewel of the  community.   Over the past year, Westport Library has added a new innovation to  their impressive collection: Verso Studios, a state-of-the-art  recording studio based in the library itself. On June 3, 2023, I was  proud to join the library in celebrating the release of its first  record: ``Verso Records: Volume One'' on vinyl. This record is the  product of collaboration among local artists and is the first of its  kind issued by a public library.   This endeavor is an example of Westport at its best, the vision and  vibrancy of the community and its commitment to artistic achievement,  powering culture throughout the State of Connecticut.   I applaud the innovative and important work done by the Westport  Library and hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating all of  the staff and supporters of the library on this impressive  achievement.                            ____________________
