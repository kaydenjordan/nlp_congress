 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  thank the gentleman for conducting this Special Order. I appreciate the  gentleman inviting me to come down here.   Just a few observations, if you will.   As I have watched the speeches tonight, there has been a litany of  concerns about China's aggression, China's positioning, China's covert  activities, China's willingness to engage in intellectual theft,  China's pervasive influence all around the world.   I have been to China once. I found it to be highly engaging. I found  the people that we were with to be very welcoming and warm. I am very  grateful and try to be attentive to China's long-suffering and rich  cultural history. And as China tells us, there is room enough in the  Pacific for two superpowers, and I want to return to that point.   When I looked out of the window of the place where I was staying in  Beijing, it looked as though fog had set in. But it wasn't fog; it was  pollution. The air was so thick, you could hardly see maybe 20 feet. If  you live in Beijing, it takes 5 years off your life because of the  pollution.   In fact, I had one Chinese person whisper to me: ``What is the point  of all this economic development if it kills you?'' And I really wanted  to tell him: ``Please, don't say that too loudly.''   The point is that China has engaged in a series of unfair subsidies  that create an unlevel playing field for trade. China's very system, a  capitalistic-communist hybrid system is very different than ours. They  are state players that receive direct subsidies that we don't have. The  indirect cost of not having environmental regulation is a form of  subsidy to industry. Low labor standards, the exploitation of persons,  is another, and on and on.   So we can walk through the financial balance sheet as to who has what  tariff and who doesn't, and who subsidized this and who doesn't, but,  fundamentally, there are things in that equation that we, perhaps,  haven't counted.   Another reality here is China has as their reason for being, it seems  now, an economic nationalism. Now, we do, too, in America. Economics is  important to us, but it stands alongside a spectrum of values of  personal liberty, the exercise of opportunity, and the ability to  engage in communal activity, free associations. We don't even think  about these things.    These are very, very different propositions in China. One places  himself at the service of the larger idea of the state. The person is  subservient to the larger idea of the state.    And the person can operate within a certain band of  liberties.   I saw it. People can move around. People can visit things.  [[Page H3779]]    But it is a certain band of liberties that, if you violate that, step  beyond it, you contradict the nature of the system and could pay a very  heavy price.   We see this in human rights violations, the lack of certain freedoms  that we enjoy that we think are consistent with human dignity. And this  is how it manifests itself.   I know you, Mr. Yoho, are very attentive to the issue of development,  sustainable economic development, particularly for the world's poor, to  conserve our resources, to use the best of the market systems for  empowerment of space, for the flourishing of the individual. That then  creates the opportunity for just governance and a healthy nationalism,  and that is our ideal.   So, before the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, recently, Secretary  Pompeo appeared, and I asked him a question. I said: Mr. Secretary, how  much does China give in foreign assistance?   He had one of those moments where he didn't exactly know how to  answer. I wasn't asking a question in order for him to give an answer,  because we all know the answer: It is pretty minimal.    The United States gives away about $25 billion a  year, and that is in non-security assistance alone: trying to help the  poor, to feed the poor, trying to create a space for food security,  sustainable agriculture, conservation, medical care for the sickest  around the world.   We do this because it is our impulse, our humanitarian impulse. We  just don't sit around while other people die. We also do it because it  facilitates relationships, economical and cultural. And, finally, when  you have the factors that lead to stable societies, it is in our own  security interest and the security of the world. So, for these reasons,  we do these things.   So I asked the Secretary: How much does China give? It might be a  sprinkling here or there. I don't exactly know the number. But for a  country with this size of an economy, with this amount of power, with  this amount of growth, with this amount of pervasive activity all  around the world, particularly in the developing nations, there comes a  set of responsibilities along with that.   I think that is really part of the attention here, underlying this  current trade dispute. What are we both vying for?   I agree with the Chinese that there should be room enough for two  superpowers in the Pacific, but you have got to come to some alignment  about what it means to be in a fair, reciprocal relationship.   We have to do a better job of respecting the space of other people's  history and tradition in the way they want to organize themselves  around governance while, at the same time, upholding this fundamental  principle of human dignity, without which things just collapse into  transactional relations that can come and go, or worse, when they are  gone, lead to potential conflict.   We need a healthy relationship with China. We have gone through a  litany of complaints about China tonight, but there are a couple other  complaints I want to have, and it is looking inward at ourselves.   I think it is time for American businesses to do business in America.    There is a small manufacturing facility in my  district. They make a fairly generic, standardized product. I was a  little surprised that they didn't have a relationship with the Chinese,  and they said: ``Oh, no. That R&D is rip-off and duplicate.''    ``That is why we won't deal with them.''   That is a sad reality, because we ought to be able to deal, using a  fair set of rules, with people who may be doing something better than  we are and we do something better than they do, and we can benefit in  reciprocal fashion.   But it has gotten so disordered because we shifted manufacturing  there, and a lot of big businesses around this country make a lot of  money off of poor environmental standards and poor labor standards  imposed on other people.    Sure.    So ask ourselves why. What are the incentives around  here to change this?    Well, why do we allow this to continue?    Well, could it be that there are a lot of big-time  transactions going on in our system itself that benefit a few big  multinationals that have taken their manufacturing and planted it over  there? They make the stuff, and we buy the stuff.   And this is the third point I want to make to you, which is, again, a  little bit of self-reflection on our own role in this.    They make the stuff; we buy the stuff. We run up debt; they have the  cash; they buy the debt.   So here we find ourselves in this very dysfunctional marriage of  having shifted vast amounts of productive resources there because,  supposedly, we can't make this more efficiently--supposedly. Really?    So we run up the debt, and they hold the debt.   And what is debt? Well, none of us around here really wants to face  it--on our side of the aisle either, Republicans. It is a form of  taxation.    It is just hidden from everyone. And the  manifestation of it is a wealth shift of our country's assets into the  hands of other people.   So we are talking about the military buildup. We are talking about  the exploitation of resources, particularly in Africa, with no  consideration of the environmental impact and no attacking of the  subsequent problem of structural poverty that existed in a lot of  places.                                time  2015    It is just taking things out and leaving not much behind, and that is  not fair to the world's poor. The problem, again, is one of self- reflection that we have to have both in terms of the responsibility  that America's business has because we have provided the infrastructure  and the systems, through very large public subsidies, so they can  thrive. It is incumbent upon them to take responsibility. Maybe it is  time for American businesses to do business in America.   Secondly, is this issue of debt. Now, if this tension prolongs and  the reality that China has a stick, and they start to refuse or dump  treasuries, what is that going to do? Interest rates will go up.    Mr. Speaker, that is an impact on us, but it is one  we are going to have to live with because we have done it to ourselves.  There are a couple of lessons here: fair trade, mutual respect, smart  trade, both people benefit.   Secondly, America's businesses will not get this public subsidy from  us any longer through unfair trade practices that we allow.   The third lesson is: an honest confrontation about what debt really  is. It is a hidden form of taxes, shifting the wealth assets of this  country elsewhere into places like China, which we are complaining  about are not using those assets in a way that we would like to see in  a productive manner.   There is lots of blame to go around here, but I want to thank the  gentleman for the opportunity to at least start to unpack this in an  honest way.    Mr. Speaker, the reckoning is here.    It has been hidden, but the consequences have been  real. It is now on the surface. The day of reckoning is here.    Mr. Speaker, to elaborate on a concept that I talked  about earlier is this idea of human dignity, and where does culture,  ideals, learning, and the pursuit of truth come from?   It comes from this sacred space, if you will. And when that is  subsumed to the larger interest of the state where you are compelled to  act only within certain parameters, where you have to submit yourself  to this bigger idea of economic nationalism, it can't define itself  because it doesn't know where it is going, so it just churns and  churns. It has to be more and more and more with environmental effects,  effects on culture, and effects on relationships around the world.   One final point before I leave you. The head of the United States  Agency for International Development, Mark Green, a former Member of  Congress, former Ambassador to Tanzania, had this to say before us  recently: China, they are predatory lenders.    They are acting, again, with their superpower status  around the world, basically convicting leaders in tougher places around  the world that are desperate for the right types of build-out and  infrastructure to attack structural poverty and to help stop the types  of injustice that are there when people simply do not have a system  that allows them to reach their full potentiality.    They are being forced to mortgage off various assets they have,  rather than being in a robust partnership and alignment with a  superpower who is interested in perhaps the right type of development,  sustainability and conservation, and to build out a just governance.   So countries are having to mortgage off ports and other pieces of  infrastructure in order to get Chinese money. Again, there is a  resource movement out of these places into the Chinese hands in order  to feed, just continue to feed this economic nationalism which has no  broader purpose.    And that is the issue. So China, maybe they will see  this. Our charge here is to try to do some self-reflection ourselves  about the nature of our system and what we have done.   But also, with the hand of friendship extended, say to the Chinese: A  transactional relationship is not an architecture for the 21st century,  for the thriving of civilization as the world gets smaller and smaller  and more and more integrated.   This predatory lending in the world's toughest places is a disastrous  policy and completely inconsistent and contradictory to what a leader  in the world, because of superpower status and economic power status,  ought to be pursuing.
