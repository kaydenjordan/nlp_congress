 Mr. Speaker, I watched this debate. I have to say, we have  an old saying: ``How do you eat an elephant? A bite at a time.'' We  have had two bites today.   Mr. Speaker, this is not about what everybody is talking about. It is  about the Second Amendment and--I won't call you Democrats. A lot of  you are. Some of you are socialists that believe in taking the right to  protect away--the Second Amendment--from the law-abiding citizens.   This is just a little step forward, the 10-day waiting period instead  of the 3-day waiting period.   The FBI is controlled by the President. He, in fact, can say take 6  months or 6 years for a legal purchase of a weapon. That is what you  are really saying.   Taking away the right to protect your home and your liberty, not just  from criminals but those who would take away your rights as a  government, the Second Amendment is what it is all about, to protect  from the tyranny that could occur by the wrong leaders taking rights  and freedoms away from you.   That is why I, as a board member, support this idea of the Second  Amendment and ask for a ``no'' vote on both of these bills.
