 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize this past Saturday, March 13, as K9 Veterans Day, an  opportunity to commemorate the working dogs that support our men and  women in uniform.   This year marks the 79th anniversary of the establishment of the K9  Corps. In 1942, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Army began  training for the K9 Corps, originally known as the War Dog Program. In  the years that passed, the K9 Corps has become a vital part of our  Armed Forces operations.   Perhaps one of the well-known military K9s is Conan, whose efforts  led to the success of the 2019 al-Baghdadi raid.   Following their service, these retired dogs often serve as support  animals to servicemembers who may be suffering from PTSD and other  disabilities, both mental and physical.   Madam Speaker, our veterans can greatly benefit from the assistance  and companionship that a dog provides, and our K9 veterans benefit from  their newfound forever homes. Our K9 veterans have served our country,  and they, too, deserve to be honored for their service.                            ____________________
