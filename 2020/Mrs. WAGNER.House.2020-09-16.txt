 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for very graciously  allowing me to speak and for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Police Officer Tamarris L.  Bohannon, who gave his life and service to his city on August 30 of  2020. His untimely and tragic killing is a profound loss to the people  of St. Louis.   Mr. Speaker, according to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police  Department, there have been nine--nine--St. Louis police officers shot  since June 1 of 2020. We grieve Officer Bohannon's sacrifice, and we  honor him for his sense of duty, his dedication, his generosity, and  his heroism.   Known as ``T'' by his family and ``Bo'' by his squad, Officer  Bohannon was a loyal St. Louisan and a hard worker who inspired  admiration for his diligent service. With his wife, Alexis, he lived  and raised his three wonderful children--Tamara, Ayden, and Tylor--in  the city that he protected as a police officer of the St. Louis  Metropolitan Police Department. He was a veteran of the force, serving  with distinction for more than 3 years.   Officer Bohannon's heroic actions to keep the citizens of St. Louis  safe are the truest example of selfless service. I extend my deepest  condolences to his fellow officers, his many friends, his loving wife  and parents, and the rest of his family. We cannot repay him for his  sacrifice, but we will always remember his love for our city and the  people who live there.
