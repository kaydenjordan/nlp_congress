 Madam Speaker, in honor of Veterans Day, I would like to  take the time to recognize one of our very own veterans from the Fifth  District of Louisiana.   Mr. Gerald McClellan, a resident of Pineville, Louisiana, is a  retired Master Sergeant E-8 of the United States Army. He joined the  Army straight out of high school in 1973, went through vigorous  training, and spent his deployment in the demilitarized zone between  North and South Korea.   He distinguished himself with outstanding achievements, going on to  receive the Meritorious Service Medal upon retirement for impeccable  service to the military.   On Veterans Day, we reflect on the service and sacrifice of our  Nation's veterans like Gerald. They are responsible for protecting and  ensuring that our freedoms continue to last from generation to  generation.   We must never forget that we are the land of the free because of the  brave.   Today we give our most sincere gratitude to our veterans. Their duty  and fidelity to the cause of freedom is something for which they will  forever be honored. Today and every day we thank them for their  service.                            ____________________
