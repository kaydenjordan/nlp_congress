 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the incredible life  and legacy of Walter F. Ulloa, a friend and trailblazer who helped  transform Spanish language media.   Walter was a visionary. He was also a beloved husband, father,  brother, and my dear friend.   From B-Town, known as Brawley, to a global powerhouse, Walter got his  start with humble beginnings in the Imperial Valley.   He was born in the impoverished farmworker city of Brawley in 1949,  back when it was still a segregated community. His family lived on B  Street on the east side of the tracks.   Like my parents and many others in the Imperial Valley, Walter's  father, Walter Sr., and mother, Margaret, worked hard to give Walter  and his brothers, Roland and Ronald, better opportunities for their  futures.   Every day for 4 years, his father would drive from Brawley to San  Diego to attend law school, instilling in Walter and his brothers the  values of honesty, integrity, and a strong work ethic.   His mother provided for the family at home, building a strong  foundation for Walter and his brothers and instilling in them the  values of kindness and compassion.   Walter Sr. and Margaret's hard work helped move the family from the  east side to the west side, and their guidance, support, and love  helped Walter, Roland, and Ronald achieve great success.   Walter's skill as a young tennis champion catapulted him from  tournaments in Indio and Palm Springs, California, all the way to the  University of Southern California, where he earned his bachelor's  degree.   He went on to attend Loyola Law School before briefly serving in the  district attorney's office and working with the L.A. city youth  employment summer program.   It wasn't until Walter began working at KMEX-TV in L.A., though, that  his career in Spanish broadcast media began. At KMEX, he learned the  business from the ground up, first working as a writer and eventually  becoming the station's news director.   Walter's empire began to take shape when he joined forces with his  business partners to acquire nearby stations, ultimately culminating in  Entravision's founding. Under his watch, Entravision grew into a  driving force in the media, delivering vital news to millions across  the country.   The thing is, Walter was more than just a great entrepreneur and  businessman. He was also an exceptional leader who inspired his  employees and increased representation across the board.   As Entravision grew, Walter made it a point to get to know everyone  at his company, from the service workers to the news crews to the  office staff. Everyone mattered to Walter, and they knew it.   Many looked to him as a father, a brother, and a mentor who inspired  others with his integrity and authentic leadership. Through it all, he  maintained his commitment to his roots, to diversity and inclusion, and  to social justice. His mantra was: ``We, as Latinos, need to see  ourselves reflected in the media, and we have the numbers to do it.''   I can't tell you how much that means to me and how much it means for  Latinos and Latinas from the Imperial Valley to the Coachella Valley  and all across our Nation.   Walter is an inspiration to us all. Born and bred in Brawley, he rose  to the top. When it came to creating opportunities for others, he  refused to take no for an answer.    Being born in a segregated community, he fought for Latino and Latina  representation at every turn. Whether with Entravision, the L.A. Music  Center board, LA84 Foundation, or the board of trustees for the Kennedy  Center, Walter's legacy can be seen on screens all across America.   While we recognize the road ahead for equal representation is long, I  have no doubt that future generations will carry the torch of his work  to ensure we see the faces of Latinos and Latinas on our screens, that  we hear the voices of Latinos and Latinas on the radio, and that we  share the stories of Latinos and Latinas which are woven into the  fabric of our Nation.   I will miss him dearly, and I know that countless others will, too. I  respect him and admire him greatly. He was a true, loyal friend. He  also had a genuine interest in me, believed in me, encouraged me, and  supported me through thick and thin.   To his wife, Alexandra; son, Bruno; brothers, Roland and Ronald; and  all his loved ones and to the entire Entravision family, know that you  are in my heart and in my prayers.   Together, as we mourn his passing, let us celebrate the blessing he  was in all of our lives, the impact he had on our community, and the  mark he has left on our Nation's history.                            ____________________
