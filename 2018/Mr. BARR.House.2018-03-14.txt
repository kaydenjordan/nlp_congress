 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life  and legacy of Dr. Pearse Lyons of Lexington, Kentucky, who passed away  on Thursday of last week at the age of 73.   Dr. Lyons was a pioneer, the ultimate dreamer and innovator, a  larger-than-life contributor to human progress, and his legacy will  forever be remembered. Dr. Lyons, originally from Ireland, is truly the  embodiment of the American Dream. He came to the United States in the  late 1970s and launched his own business in Lexington in 1980, named  after the initials of his daughter, Aoife. Alltech was founded with an  initial investment of just $10,000.   Today, Alltech is a multibillion-dollar international business with  operations in animal feed, meat, brewing, and distilling with more than  5,000 employees worldwide. Dr. Lyons was honored as the Business Person  of the Year by Business and Finance magazine. He received the Ireland- U.S. Council Award for Outstanding Achievement, and Irish Prime  Minister Enda Kenny recognized him with a St. Patrick's Day Science  Medal in recognition of creating a global business based on scientific  research.   As impressive if not more so is the impact Dr. Lyons and Alltech have  had on Kentucky and, in particular, central Kentucky. Dr. Lyons was the  driving force behind bringing the Alltech 2010 World Equestrian Games  to Lexington, the first time the games had been held  [[Page H1549]]  outside of Europe. Due to Dr. Lyons' vision and drive, the 2010  Lexington Games were considered to be the most successful in the  event's history.   Dr. Lyons also established ONE: the Alltech Ideas Conference, which  has been held in Lexington for more than three decades. The conference  is now the city's largest annual room booking, attracting nearly 4,000  attendees from over 70 countries to the bluegrass. It is often said  that through the World Equestrian Games and the Alltech Ideas  Conference that Dr. Lyons brought the world to Lexington. This is  undeniably true, but it is also true that he brought Kentucky to the  world.   In addition to its animal feed and agricultural products, Alltech  reopened the Lexington Brewing Company in 1999 and launched Kentucky  Ale, which can now be purchased across the United States and in many  countries across the world. Alltech also opened the Town Branch  Distillery in Lexington, which produces a line of spirits including its  signature Town Branch Kentucky Bourbon.   He and his beloved wife, Deirdre, have also given back directly to  many causes. Dr. and Mrs. Lyons built more than a dozen state-of-the- art science labs in primary schools in Kentucky and in Ireland. They  also established the Alltech Young Scientist program, the largest  global agriscience competition for university students, and the Alltech  Vocal Scholarship Competition awards for more than half a million  dollars in scholarships annually to promising young vocalists.   On a personal note, I will miss Pearse's friendship; his kindness to  me and my family; and his extraordinary ideas, passion, and vision. I  will never forget the time that I went to the Nicholasville  headquarters of Alltech, where Dr. Lyons educated me about how world  population growth would put immense pressure on food production  requirements and how Alltech scientists were investigating and  developing nutritional and agricultural products and techniques to meet  the future food needs of the human race.   The problem and challenge he described was daunting, but with that  infectious smile and with a sparkle in his eye, this innovator told me  that there was no limit to what we could do and no limit to what  Alltech could do. Pearse was a dreamer, and he also lived life to the  fullest. I will always cherish and remember those Alltech ONE  conferences where he stood in front of 4,000 people from 70 different  countries in Kentucky with the Kentucky Bourbon and the Kentucky Ale  and he sang ``Molly Malone'' in honor of his home country.   My wife, Carol, and I extend our deepest condolences to Deirdre;  their two children, Aoife and Mark, with whom I grew up; the extended  Lyons family; Alltech and its many employees; and all those touched by  Dr. Lyons.   Pearse Lyons loved his family, both his own family and his Alltech  family. He loved music. He loved science and innovation. He loved his  native home of Ireland. He loved America. And he loved Kentucky.   And for all of his achievements, for his contributions to science and  human progress, his philanthropy, and the mark he left on Kentucky, I  hope all of my colleagues will join me in honoring the extraordinary  life and work of Dr. Pearse Lyons.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1116, the  Taking Account of Institutions with Low Operation Risk Act of 2017,  which directs the Federal financial regulatory agencies to tailor their  rulemakings in consideration of the risk profiles and business models  of the financial institutions that are subject to such rules.   It also directs the agencies to annually report to Congress regarding  the specific actions that those agencies have taken to tailor their  regulatory actions.   I would just like to thank the ranking member of our committee for  actually making the argument in favor of this legislation. She is  concerned about big banks, or big banks getting benefits, or big banks  not getting enough scrutiny. This bill makes sure that regulatory  agencies are focused on the systemic institutions and not overwhelmed  by responsibilities of regulating nonsystemically important  institutions, our community banks, our regulatory-challenged  institutions in our communities; not focus so much attention on  imposing compliance burdens on small credit unions.   That is why I support my good friend from Colorado, Representative  Tipton's bill, because it gives the regulators more focus on what they  should be doing instead of heaping an avalanche of red tape on  nonsystemic, small community banks, which are withering on the vine  under Dodd-Frank.   Mr. Speaker, since 2010, the Dodd-Frank financial control law has  been a disaster for small institutions, those small community banks and  credit unions across our country. That law generally applied one-size- fits-all rules and regulations on financial institutions, regardless of  the fact that many businesses in the same industry are substantially  different.   This is in recognition of the ranking member's argument that big  banks are different than small banks. For the life of me, I don't know  why she wouldn't be fully supportive of the bill.   As a direct result of Dodd-Frank, which applies this one-size-fits- all approach, the Commonwealth of Kentucky has lost about 20 percent of  its banks and credit unions, with more bank closures anticipated in the  future.    This is particularly concerning because our State-chartered  banks provide about 75 percent of the lending in rural America and  about half of all the U.S. lending nationwide. As you can see, with  fewer community financial institutions due to Dodd-Frank's 28,000 new  restrictions, Americans will have less access to the capital they need  to buy a home, purchase a car, and start a business.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr. Tipton, for his leadership on  the TAILOR Act. I urge my colleagues, especially the ranking member, to  vote in favor of the TAILOR Act, to do exactly what she has been  urging, which is allow regulators to focus on big banks, not small  community banks. I applaud Mr. Tipton for fulfilling that objective.
