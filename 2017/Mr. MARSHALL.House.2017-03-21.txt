 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize and celebrate  National Agriculture Day.   I proudly represent the largest agriculture-producing district in the  country, the big First District of Kansas. In my home State, it is  Kansas Agriculture Month, a month to celebrate our State's largest  economy.   Today is an opportunity to remind my colleagues of the hardworking  Americans who produce the bounty of American harvest and livestock. The  food that sustains them doesn't originate in a grocery store.   Let us remember as we move forward with regulations and with trade  policy that there are families with generations of history on their  farm or ranch who face the consequences of every decision. They feed  America and our economy.   This day and every day, we are grateful that God made a farmer.                            ____________________
