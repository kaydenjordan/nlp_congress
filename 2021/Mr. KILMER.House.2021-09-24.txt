 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Meredith McGehee,  the executive director of Issue One, who is leaving her post at the end  of this month.   Meredith is one of the Nation's most knowledgeable and dedicated  experts on Congress and ethics in politics. She is a true public  servant and has devoted her career to making Congress and the Federal  Government more transparent, more effective, and to making it work  better for the American people.   In fact, she is among the leading advocates for many of the key laws  that shape the way that Congress operates today, contributing to the  formulation of the Gift Ban, the Lobbying Disclosure Act, the  Congressional Accountability Act, the Bipartisan Campaign Finance  Reform Act, the STOCK Act, and the establishment of the bipartisan  Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, which I now have the  honor of chairing.   Of all of the ways that Meredith has had an impact, she is first and  foremost, a devoted daughter of Albuquerque, a wife, and mom to Timo  who, himself, is now pursuing a career in service to our country.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Meredith for her service and wish her  all the best in the days ahead.                            ____________________
