 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.  [[Page H2334]]     Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we will be voting on the American  Health Care Act. We are doing this in spite of the fact that we just  found out that there is an even more dire and harsh plan. We still have  not received the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of what that  plan will do, but we do know that TrumpCare will throw at least 24  million people off of their health care.   Tonight, for the next hour, I am proud to help lead our Congressional  Progressive Caucus Special Order hour with my distinguished members  from the caucus.   I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Watson Coleman for her  excellent statement.   Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to yield to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Rhode Island  for his incredible leadership on so many issues and for reminding us  again that 24 million is just a number, but behind that number are all  of the people and all of the stories that will be impacted.   Mr. Speaker, now it is my great honor to yield to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Judy Chu), my good friend, the chair of the Asian  Pacific American Caucus here in the House.    I thank the gentlewoman from California.   Now it is my tremendous honor to introduce and yield to the co-chair  of the Progressive Caucus, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), a  dear friend and somebody that has been on the streets and been a leader  on so many issues, from immigration reform to healthcare.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Grijalva.   I am so proud to introduce my colleague from Massachusetts,  Representative Joe Kennedy.   Two weeks ago, during the Energy and Commerce markup on TrumpCare,  the gentleman actually forced Republican lawmakers to admit that the  bill--their bill, the TrumpCare bill--would not guarantee essential  healthcare benefits for the millions who are covered under Medicaid  expansion, and, later, the gentleman went on to give an incredibly  compelling speech about this bill not being an act of mercy but being  an act of malice. I hope that the gentleman is now going to tell the  American people exactly why he said what he did.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of Massachusetts  (Mr. Kennedy).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Kennedy so much. As  the gentleman was talking, I was thinking about the simple rule that we  are all better off when we are all better off. I appreciate everything  that you just said.   Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to yield to the gentleman  from the great State of Minnesota (Mr. Nolan).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Minnesota  for his tremendous work and for his words. As the gentleman spoke, I  think about all the names that we could call this bill that is before  us. We can call it TrumpCare, we can call it the pay more get less  bill, and we can call it the broken promises bill. But I think what the  gentleman's words have shown us is that this is a bill that is going to  deeply affect 24 million Americans across the country and tear them off  of their health care, and that is just not acceptable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Brownley). It is a great honor to introduce my colleague who is a  champion for so many issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), my colleague on both the Judiciary Committee and Budget  Committee and a champion for people of color and folks across this  country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, Ms. Norton is right: the uninsured rate in  my home State of Washington got cut more than half. So we are down to  not quite as low as you, but 5.6, I think now, compared to over 13  percent before the Affordable Care Act.   I often get to co-chair this Special Order hour with my good friend,  a brilliant colleague. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from great  State of Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, once again, it looks like we need to school  our colleagues on the Constitution. I thank Mr. Raskin for consistently  doing that.   Now it is a great honor to yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro), the dean of the congressional delegation, a champion for  women and families, paid leave, and health care across our country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Connecticut  so much for that incredibly compelling testimony of why we cannot let  this bill pass.   Let me summarize what you heard in this last hour from Members across  our country who are terrified. Frankly, this plan--TrumpCare, the pay  more get less plan, the broken promises plan--might actually pass. We  have to make sure that it does not pass.   So, in summary, TrumpCare strips healthcare coverage from 24 million  Americans. It cuts $880 billion--that is almost a trillion dollars-- from Medicaid expansion, and it gives $600 billion in tax breaks to the  wealthiest Americans and corporations while cutting benefits for  seniors, working families, and the most vulnerable among us.    Frankly, we don't know everything it does because there have been  amendments after amendments that have been passed today. We still don't  know what the full impact of this bill is, yet they are pushing through  a vote tomorrow if they can get enough votes to pass it.   TrumpCare is going to raise the cost of health care by about $14,000  for those between the ages of 50 and 64. That is the age tax you have  heard about on the floor tonight. And it is going to raise premiums for  almost everyone. It puts a 30 percent penalty for getting health care  to anyone who suffers any kind of a catastrophic event that throws you  off of health care. If you lose your job and somehow you end up without  health care for a couple months, you are going to have to pay 30  percent more in order to get your health care back.   You heard from Representative Kennedy about mental health, you heard  from Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton about work requirements, and  that is just a piece of what this TrumpCare bill does.   Tomorrow I will join my Democratic colleagues and hopefully enough  Republican colleagues who know that our job is to make sure we provide  health care for everyone across this country. Tomorrow I will vote  ``no'' for the 24 million people who will lose their coverage. I will  vote ``no'' for the almost 15 million people who will lose their  coverage under Medicaid expansion alone. I will vote ``no'' for the  millions of low-income women who rely on services from Planned  Parenthood. I will vote ``no'' for the tens of thousands of people who  will literally die each year if the Republicans succeed in repealing  the health care that we have now.   Let's be clear that the Republican majority has been passing  legislation and voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act for 7 years,  yet they could not come up with a plan that would, in fact, do what  they promised, which is to make sure that we are covering more  Americans at lower prices. As my friend, Representative Raskin, said,  this is not a healthcare plan. A  [[Page H2340]]  healthcare plan would cover more people. This is a tax plan to take the  benefits that working families were receiving on healthcare coverage  across the country and convert it into tax benefits for the wealthiest,  $600 billion in tax benefits.   People around the country are calling in to say if you care about the  American people and if you care about providing health care for all of  us, this is a bad plan, you should not vote for it. And Republicans are  hopefully listening to constituents across the country, to their  Governors in Republican States, Republican Governors who have said how  much Medicaid expansion has helped their States. They have asked and  pleaded for people to keep what we have; to make it better, yes, but  not to strip $880 billion away.   Just recently, Paul Ryan, the Speaker of our House, was quoted as  saying that he has been dreaming about yanking health care away from  the people who need it the most since he was ``drinking at a keg.''   This is what he said: ``So Medicaid, sending it back to the states,  capping its growth rate, we've been dreaming of this since I have been  around--since you and I were drinking at the keg. . . .''   Well, I don't know what he was thinking about when he was drinking at  the keg, but I can tell you that what we have been dreaming about as  Democrats, as people who care about the health care of people across  this country is that we cover people, that we don't put anyone in a  position where they are one healthcare crisis away from bankruptcy,  that we make sure that kids can get asthma inhalers, that we make sure  that grandma and grandpa can go into the nursing home and get the care  that they need. If we pass this bill tomorrow, those grandparents are  not going to have the care that they need. Nursing homes are going to  shut down. We are going to take away jobs from rural areas, rural  hospitals across this country.   Mr. Speaker, today, as we close this Progressive Caucus Special Order  hour, I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that I  believe we all have the interests of the American people at heart, and  if we do, then I hope we will stop this TrumpCare bill from moving  forward tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
