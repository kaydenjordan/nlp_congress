 Mr. Speaker, I am happy to rise in  support of this legislation, H.R. 5037, supporting the designation of  the Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office in his hometown of Farmville,  North Carolina.   The late Walter Jones was a treasured colleague and a personal  friend, and I am glad to join others in the North Carolina delegation  and in this Chamber in this fitting tribute.   Walter, I think we would all agree, charted a path uniquely his own.  His warmth and sincerity earned him respect and affection on both sides  of the aisle and across the entire spectrum of political attitudes and  beliefs. The same was true in North Carolina among his constituents.   Walter was perhaps best known for his devotion to our men and women  in uniform and their families. He was attentive, of course, to the  needs of our military bases in North Carolina, but for Walter, this was  very personal. He sent more than 10,000 letters to the families of  fallen troops, and he memorialized those who died from North Carolina's  Camp Lejeune with photos outside his office, all of this demonstrating  his genuine dedication to those who serve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join in support of this  resolution so that Walter's memory can be honored in Farmville, a  community he loved dearly and served tirelessly.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, urge passage of  H.R. 4279, and I yield back the balance of my time.
