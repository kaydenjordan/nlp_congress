 Madam President, in the words of entrepreneur  Henry Ford, ``coming together is a beginning, staying together is  progress, and working together is success.'' As you and I know all too  well, the role of a mediator presents unique challenges. From  negotiating contracts to facilitating dialogue among parties, very few  have the skillset and dedication to produce favorable results.   Today, I am here to honor a man who exemplifies the qualities of a  true leader and innovator: James ``Rusty'' Mitchell, the director of  the Community Initiatives Team at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. Mr.  Mitchell will be retiring this month after over 39 years of government  service to our country.   Upon completion of his undergraduate degree at the University of  Southern California as an ROTC cadet, Mr. Mitchell was commissioned in  1976 to attend pilot training at the old Williams Air Force Base, which  has a near and dear place to my heart, as I also attended it.   The culmination of an impressive 22-year USAF career as the commander  of the 21st Squadron, 56th Fighter Wing at Luke, he retired in 1998 as  a lieutenant colonel with multiple honors, including the Defense  Meritorious Service Medal; the USAF Meritorious Service Medal, with  three oakleaf clusters; and the Air Force Commendation Medal.   After 3 years as a pilot with United Airlines, Mr. Mitchell returned  to Luke to take the lead as the director of the newly created Community  Initiatives Team, CIT. Working with all 14 jurisdictions around the air  base, as well as the State of Arizona, Mr. Mitchell and his team took  into account the interests of various stakeholders in the State, the  Federal Government, and the local community. The results were beyond  favorable. His team's efforts transformed the entire community.   CIT's first-class work on the Strategic Basing process led to the  USAF selecting Luke to serve as the F-35A training site, which brought  144 F-35s and significant investments to the base. Through initiatives  such as the FAA's approval of a Special Air Traffic Rule, which  enhanced safety and reduced flying hour costs, Mr. Mitchell and his  team have truly shown how essential their role has been. There is no  question that this work strengthened the Maricopa Area's ties to Luke  AFB.   Under Mr. Mitchell's leadership, CIT is now one of the country's best  examples of how to bring community leaders, military families, and base  leadership together. The outcome has all three of these groups rallying  around one shared mission: to support the base's military personnel and  readiness. As a Valley resident for more than 25 years himself, Mr.  Mitchell's firsthand understanding has allowed him to personally  address key issues at the base and in his community. His frequent  appearances at city council meetings and active involvement in the  broader community truly highlight his unwavering dedication to building  bridges between Luke AFB and the public.   I would like to thank Lt. Col. (ret.) James ``Rusty'' Mitchell for  his many years of service to our Nation, Luke AFB, and the Arizonans  who call his community home. I have personally witnessed the many  tremendous changes Rusty has made for Luke Air Force Base and the  surrounding community. We will all be better off because of his  selfless and tireless efforts. He will be sorely missed, and I wish him  all the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
