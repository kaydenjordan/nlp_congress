 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Montana's brave  men and women in uniform and honor those who have fallen in the line of  duty. This National Police Week, I recognize a law enforcement officer  who has gone above and beyond the call of duty.   Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter has been an outspoken advocate  for the safety of our students and teachers. Instead of being a  bystander to the tragedies occurring at schools across the Nation,  Sheriff Slaughter took action to prevent this in a community he swore  to protect and serve.   Last year, he laid out a plan to hire and train special service  officers to defend our schools and protect our children.                                time  1015    Sheriff Slaughter's plan may soon serve as a blueprint to secure  schools across the country, and his leadership is absolutely a model  for those in law enforcement.   As the brother-in-law of three former Baltimore City police officers,  my family and I know the sacrifices that come with that job.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Sheriff Slaughter for his dedication, and I  thank law enforcement officers across the country who put their lives  on the line every day.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, in its current state, H.R. 3091 allows  Federal law enforcement to purchase retired handguns from their agency,  allowing the agency to recover some of the original costs of those  handguns. However, handguns are not the only weapons in our Federal  officers' arsenal.   In recent years, about 30 percent of new firearm purchases by Federal  agencies were rifles and shotguns. Current surpluses also show that  there are similar numbers of pistols and rifles in agency stockpiles.   My amendment would allow for our law enforcement officers to purchase  these weapons, as well, so long as the rifle or shotgun is allowed  legally for civilian use.  [[Page H2394]]    The current practice of destroying retired firearms costs taxpayers  money when they could be providing a service to their Federal law  enforcement and creating some revenue in the process.   Many of our Nation's law enforcement are avid recreation and sports  shooters in their free time, and they deserve the added benefit of  being allowed to purchase high-quality firearms at a reduced cost.   Americans trust police to protect them with these very firearms every  single day. Why should these well-trained officers not have the right  to defend their own family with these same weapons.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Chair, I point to the amendment where it refers to  section 921(a)(24) of the title, which is going to keep weapons that  are currently not allowed in civilian hands out of civilian hands.   Our law enforcement officials are highly trained. Whether they are  using an AR-15 or whether they are using a similar high-powered rifle  with a high-intensity scope, they are trained to do such.   I have lots of friends and family who use these weapons on a daily  basis for sport shooting and other purposes.   If our law enforcement officers, if they have served their time and  are retiring from that duty of protecting the civilians across this  Nation, want to purchase a weapon that they have been utilizing for who  knows how much time, they should be able to do so.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, I refuse to accept the premise that  a grenade launcher is going to be purchased and allowed to be purchased  by a former law enforcement official. That is just not realistic. It is  not true, and it is very misleading to this body.   When we have people who have risked their lives to defend folks  across this country in our communities, then they should be able to  purchase these retired weapons.   We have heard them called retired weapons. Because the value has been  dramatically reduced, they are going to be put into a stockpile. They  are going to be salvaged. They are going to be destroyed.   Allow us to generate some revenue, and allow the people who have used  them the longest and the safest to continue their use.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, I refuse to accept the premise that  you are going to have grenade launchers that are going to be purchased  by Federal law enforcement. They are not utilizing those, and they are  not going to be purchased by them.   We are talking about the handguns and the rifles that are currently  allowed to be possessed by civilians. Those are the only ones that are  going to be able to be purchased.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
