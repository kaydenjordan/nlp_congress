 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the 118th  Congress and its newly elected Republican majority, led by Kevin  McCarthy, began the session by voting to pass the Family and Small  Business Taxpayer Protection Act.   This important legislation will give money back to the American  people by rescinding billions of dollars in funding for 87,000 new IRS  agents put in place by the duplicitous Democrat-led inflation expansion  act. This is just the first example of promises made, promises kept.   Among the commitments to America by House Republicans:   Fight inflation and support working families.   Reduce gas prices and restore energy independence.   Secure the supply chain and restock our shelves.   Secure the southern border.   Defend America with peace through strength.  [[Page H165]]    Ensure faith in free and fair elections.   Reclaim oversight and hold the Biden administration accountable.   Protect American rights and serve the people.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the safe haven of Afghanistan to America.                            ____________________
