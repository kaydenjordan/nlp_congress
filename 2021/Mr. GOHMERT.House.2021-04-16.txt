 Madam Speaker, I saw one study that indicated that these  masks are very helpful; that, by wearing a mask, you have two-tenths of  1 percent less chance of getting COVID. So hurray for that two-tenths  of 1 percent, especially for those of us who have had it or have had  vaccinations. But I look forward to getting our freedom back at some  point.   But you can't have a free society if the media is dishonest. When the  Founders fought for the right to have free media, they anticipated that  there should always be a majority of the media who would be willing to  expose media who were dishonest.   But we are living in a dangerous time, when what used to be called  the mainstream media is anything but honest; and that was played out  before our very eyes and ears as Project Veritas had a CNN--well, as  this article says--a CNN head, but he had leadership, and he admitted  quite a great deal about the abuses of CNN, the manipulativeness of  CNN.   This article from The Epoch Times--which, by the way, is under fire  from the Chinese Communist Party, so since this administration seems to  side with the Chinese Communist Party a great deal, they may be coming  after The Epoch Times the way the Chinese Communist Party is. But we  will wait and see if that happens.   But this story, dated April 14, says a CNN head has personally  intervened to order the cable network staff to display the number of  people who have died from COVID-19 in the broadcast, according to a CNN  technical director who was caught on hidden camera making the comments.  The goal was to boost ratings, the director said, explaining fear  really drives numbers and is the thing that keeps you tuned in.   That is rather tragic.   A former segregationist President, Democrat, named Franklin D.  Roosevelt, had said, quite eloquently: ``The only thing we have to fear  is fear itself.'' And he was right that that should be a big concern.   But what we are hearing from the undercover tape is that CNN sees  fear as the best way to increase ratings.   So another article from The Gateway Pundit: ``CNN director caught on  hidden camera saying the network is `trying to help' BLM by only  pushing stories that implicate White people.''   Well, that is unfortunate. What that shows is that CNN doesn't mind  being racist. It is very unfortunate that we would stir up that kind of  animosity; have a major news network, or what used to be a major news  network, CNN, pushing racist divides.   Madam Speaker, I have been joined by a friend--hopefully, she doesn't  mind me calling her a friend because that is the way I see her--from  New York, an extraordinary Member of Congress. I am thrilled she is  back.   I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).  [[Page H1881]]         Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's efforts,  and I would be thrilled to join that caucus. That is absolutely  meritorious, and it should be something that all of us work to support  together.   Yet, we get cast, as Republicans, as wanting to limit the number of  voters, when actually, we want more voters; but we need to have people  vote legally, not multiple times, not voting after you no longer have a  pulse, but voting as citizens. So I am thrilled. I yield to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Madam Speaker, it brings to mind being in Iraq back in  2005. Iraq had just had its first true fair election, and people stood  in line for hours and hours.   In talking to a police chief, he pointed out one place where there  was a very long line. We knew that radical Islamists were going to try  to disrupt the election. There was a suicide bomber who was found in  the line, and a policeman grabbed him, threw himself on top of the  suicide bomber. The bomb was set off, and the policeman and the radical  Islamist were both killed.   I said: Wow. Did the voters come back?   He looked a little surprised and said: They never left the line. They  knew if they got out of the line and did not vote, that the policeman  would have given his life for nothing. They wanted the policeman's life  to count, and they were not going to be intimidated by a suicide bomber  trying to prevent them from voting, so they stayed in line to vote.   Too many Americans have come to think of voting as too onerous, that  they don't really have time to do it, that it doesn't really matter,  when, actually, as we hear and find over and over, elections do have  consequences.   It is important that if you are legally allowed to vote, you should  vote. It is unfortunate that there is a push to have people who don't  understand--they are not citizens. They haven't been educated yet to  understand what it takes to preserve a republic, which has allowed us  to drift toward a more Orwellian-style government, a totalitarian, more  socialist government.   Yes, you have to have a totalitarian government in order for  socialism to succeed. Khrushchev finally came to grips with that. True  communism is where everybody shares and shares alike, and there is no  government.   I remember doing a report in college about a commission that  Khrushchev set up to figure out a plan to move to where there was no  government and just pure communism, pure sharing. Ultimately, they  disbanded the commission because they realized there is no way to have  no totalitarian government.   If you are going to have communism or socialism, the government has  to be big, powerful, and totalitarian enough to take from those who  earn and give to those who don't.  [[Page H1882]]    Anyway, elections are important. The next national election, of  course, will be in 2022. That is something we need to be working toward  making sure is fair. But it is difficult when you have entities like  CNN that are more interested in ratings, scaring people, and supporting  the Democratic Party than they are in reporting the news. It really  makes it difficult to have free and fair elections when people are  being deceived.   It was also interesting that since James O'Keefe, who founded Project  Veritas, getting the truth out, he had the video of a leader at CNN  exposing exactly what CNN was about: helping the Democratic Party and  scaring Americans.   Twitter, being part of the high-tech oligarchy, has banned Project  Veritas. O'Keefe, the founder, was first banned, and then, later, it  was indicated he was banned permanently for violating the Twitter rules  on platform manipulation and spam.   So, according to Twitter, if you expose the truth about somebody or  some entity that Twitter is figuratively in bed with, then Twitter will  ban you because they don't want the truth out there. They don't want  the truth about Americans being manipulated by entities like CNN,  Twitter, Facebook, or Google. They don't want the American people  finding that out, so they will ban you.   When any entity is powerful enough that it can prevent people from,  say, learning about the Vice President's family member, who may have  engaged in an impropriety, or from finding out that, actually, when the  current President, at that time a candidate for President, was saying  that Russia was paying bounties to kill American soldiers, which people  promoting the story, at least some of them, knew was not true, knew was  not likely true, that they want that falsity out there. They want to  hurt a candidate with false news.   I don't know what the Supreme Court will end up doing, but the  Sullivan case is there, requiring malice to be shown by a public figure  in order to prevail in a lawsuit. But it ought to be clear, especially  with things like this video exposing that CNN is out to destroy Matt  Gaetz, out to deceive the American public, out to fearmonger to  increase ratings even though it hurts America. They don't care. It is  okay, in CNN's leadership mind, to harm America if it helps their  ratings.   We have seen the same thing from Major League Baseball and some  international corporations. They are okay with doing business with the  Chinese Communist Party and benefiting them, helping them, making money  for them, if it makes money for the corporation or the sport, even  though it is greatly to the detriment of millions or, in the case of  the Chinese Communist Party, hundreds of millions or a billion people.   It is okay, in the minds of some of these people. It is okay to be  totally hypocritical and hurt Black-owned businesses in Atlanta, where  they are so prevalent, and move the All-Star Game to a place that is  substantially White if it makes you appear woke, even though you are  hurting African-American businesses and helping White businesses.   It is okay to help the Chinese Communist Party, which is trying to  destroy America. They are trying to get to a place where the American  economy could collapse, and China would survive that economically. If  they get to that place, then you will see them taking additional  actions, rather profoundly, to bring down our economy and leave them  remaining as the only, at that point, superpower.    We have to be more wise than we have been. We need to call out  corporations or entities in the United States that are out to help the  enemies of the United States and stir up divisiveness within the United  States if they think it creates a profit.   We are seeing that with CNN. We are seeing that with Major League  Baseball. It is just a sad time in America.   This article from Epoch Times says: ``Twitter pointed to a section in  the company's rules, which states: `You can't mislead others on Twitter  by operating fake accounts,' and `you can't artificially amplify or  disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts.' ''   Well, Twitter really has to stretch in order to come up with a basis  for banning someone who is promoting truth and is exposing truth that  CNN did not want exposed and, obviously, Twitter did not want exposed.   This is a story by Allum Bokhari, ``Twitter Permanently Blacklists  James O'Keefe After CNN Expose.'' This article also mentions: ``In the  first video, Chester admits that CNN's negative coverage of unproven  allegations against Representative Matt Gaetz is `propaganda' because  Gaetz is a `problem for the Democrats.' ''   Yes, I am told, he is nice-looking. I don't see it, but I am told he  is nice-looking. He comes across well. I do hear that. I see him come  across well. He is quite smart, quite clever, and insightful.   The CNN leader says: ``It would be great for the Democratic Party to  get him out. So we are going to keep running those stories to keep  hurting him.''   ``In further undercover footage posted today, Chester can be heard  admitting that CNN is unlikely to give a great deal of attention to the  race of a mass shooter in its coverage if they `aren't White.' ''   ``Chester also admits that `a bunch of Black men' have been  responsible for recent violent attacks against Asian Americans and that  this is a problem because `the optics of that are not good' and CNN is  `trying to help BLM.' ''   BLM, let's be fair, they are trying to establish socialism and get  rid of the constitutional government we have and move to a more  Orwellian, socialist type of government.   ``This is pure censorship for political reasons because he has  successfully exposed CNN,'' talking about Twitter banning O'Keefe. That  is a comment from Robby Starbuck on Twitter.   My friend Matt Gaetz says: ``O'Keefe exposes CNN for lying about me  and Donald Trump for propaganda. Then Twitter suspends him.''   Conservative commentator John Cardillo says: ``If the left weren't  terrified, they wouldn't be banning people.''                                time  1345    So, anyway, it is rather tragic that Twitter has joined in to become  a part of, figuratively, the ministry of truth that Orwell talked about  in his novel ``1984.'' I mean, Orwell was apparently in a great deal of  pain, dying of cancer, had been through brutal cancer treatments. Some  think that is where he came up with the idea of some of the torture  that was utilized by the ministry of love, which would arrest people  with whom they disagreed and would torture them for hours, days, weeks,  months, or many years, whatever was necessary to finally get them to  change their story.   But the ministry of truth were the ones that were constantly  rewriting history to serve the interests of this totalitarian  government, and that appears to be exactly what we are beginning to see  from many in our own media in the United States.   I was struck the summer that I was an exchange student to the Soviet  Union, how Pravda always--it was like the ministry of truth that Orwell  wrote about. They would change any story in order to make the Soviet  Government the prime player, the prime interested party. They would lie  about anything.   In the summer of 1973, I was intrigued by what they were saying about  this Watergate thing, that that was clearly stirred up by the Democrats  against Richard Nixon because Nixon had had the courage to be the first  U.S. President to go to the Soviet Union and to reach out to create a  viable relationship with the Soviet Union. So the Democrats were  totally manufacturing Watergate just because Nixon had dared to be  friendly toward the Soviet Union.   Well, we know that was not the case, but that is the way the Soviet  Union would use the media, Pravda, to lie about what was going on to  make them the central players in everything.   Obviously, Watergate was real. There was a manipulation of the law.  If you listen to some of the tapes or read some of the transcripts of  the Nixon tapes, you are struck by the inconsistency and the ability of  a President of the United States to be two-faced in talking to  different people and the manipulative approach to being President.   So, hopefully, the truth will all come out. Apparently, unless  Twitter and CNN change their approach to news,  [[Page H1883]]  the truth will not come from Twitter, will not come from CNN. But,  hopefully, emerging news sources will take the place of the once great  CNN, unless CNN begins to report more truthfully. That would be a  welcome change.   And we can all hold onto that hope that springs eternal in the human  breast, that maybe someday somebody will take over at CNN that will see  CNN's viewership surge because they have decided finally to be going  after real news and truth instead of manipulating things for the  Democratic National Committee or an entity like Black Lives Matter.   Of course, they matter. But that is not what BLM is about. They are  about moving America toward socialism. They are about destroying the  nuclear family, which the War on Poverty helped do for Black families,  and now it is all families. We have seen that happen, and Thomas Sowell  and Candace Owens have both covered that very effectively in their  recent books.   This article from Joel Pollak, April 16: ``Patrisse Cullors, a co- founder of Black Lives Matter, told interviewer Marc Lamont Hill on  Thursday that there is no contradiction between her radical left-wing  politics and owning four homes because she is providing for extended  family.   ``In the interview on `Black News Tonight,' Hill asked Cullors, also  known as Khan-Cullors after spouse Janaya Khan, about the truth of  reports that she had bought four homes since 2016--including a $1.4  million compound in the remote Topanga Canyon neighborhood of L.A. and  a vacation home with an airplane hangar in Georgia--and that she and  her spouse had considered buying exclusive property in the Bahamas  also.   ``The reports prompted criticism from within the Black Lives Matter  movement''--and I would hope that it would--``and questions about her  source of funds.   ``She replied that `never taken a salary from Black Lives Matter  Global Network Foundation,' and that she had other sources of income  from her work as a college professor, as a TV producer, an author, and  a YouTube content creator.   ``In a statement, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation  said she had not received any compensation from the group since 2019,  though she had received $120,000 from the group since 2013 for  performing specific duties.   ``She added: `Organizers should get paid for the work that they do.'  ''   But, now, having spent a summer in the Soviet Union, I know how  socialism is supposed to go, and there were Soviet friends that were  somewhat disenfranchised with the Socialist way of doing things. They  said, yeah, we all receive about the same amount of money, but those  who have leadership positions or political power, they get to buy  things the rest of us don't buy. We have all got about the same money  to spend, but we don't have access to the things that they do.   So in a true Socialist country, people that want power, if you have a  shoe store, then we saw it back then, they would take the best shoes  and save them for people in political positions of power. So when those  power brokers come in, then they get to pick from the best shoes while  all the rest are told, well, you either take these or you don't get  any; there just are no others.   If you were a power broker, yeah, you had about the same amount to  spend as everybody else. But everybody else was told there is no toilet  paper, whereas the power brokers would be taken to the back and allowed  to buy toilet paper. Those were the days, and that is normally the way  it works.   On one occasion I was surprised because a cleaning lady appeared that  she was going to be running and telling on this Soviet citizen.   And I said: Why would she go tell on you?   And he said: Look, in your country, you can get ahead by working  harder and making more money. In our country, we all make about the  same. So the only way you can get ahead is if you step on other people.  So, yes, she will go tell on me, and she will go up a little bit in  power because that is how you get ahead here in the Soviet Union. You  step on other people, and that elevates you.   So that is where some are wanting to take the United States, where  everybody is getting about the same amount of money, except that,  apparently, we have leaders like this in the BLM movement who think-- and she said she is ``a trained Marxist''--``and your lived practice.''   Those are her words. But she is not--well, she says: ``The way that I  live my life is a direct support to Black people, including my Black  family members, first and foremost. . . . I see my money as not my own.  I see it as my family's money as well.''   But a true Socialist would not say that because a true Socialist says  everybody shares and shares alike, from those according to their  ability to those according to their needs. So your family can't be  foremost if you are a true Socialist. So there is some confusion here  on what is true socialism, and Ms. Cullors does not have that down very  well.   According to the article, she is buying a $1.4 million compound in an  exclusive part of Los Angeles and a vacation home with an airplane  hangar in Georgia.   No, no, no, that is not supposed to happen. If you are a true  Socialist, you share and share alike. You may think you have earned all  this money, as she said she had, doing all these different things, but  a true Socialist would say: No, but we are going to share that with  everybody.   Apparently she would appropriately think: I have all this additional  ability that others don't have, so you should take my money away from  me, from those according to their ability, and give it to those  according to their needs.   So she has got a ways to go before she understands the socialism that  she is trying to force on the United States.   The article goes on to read: ``The point of the criticisms, she said,  was `to discredit me, but also to discredit the movement.' She added:  `We have to stay focused on white supremacy.'''   Yeah, don't look behind the curtains at the guy that is manipulating  things, as we saw in the ``Wizard of Oz.'' No, no, keep looking over  here at what we will call white supremacy.   Anyway, ``She responded to claims that Black Lives Matter should  distribute funds to the Black community by noting that while she was  sympathetic, the organization was not a `charity' and was not the  government.''   So she has got a ways to go before she really understands the  socialism she is trying to force on everybody else.   She says: ``Our target should be calling on Congress to pass  reparations.''   Well, she doesn't understand that true reparations in a Socialist  society would take from somebody that had $1.4 million to spend on a  home and spread it out to everybody else. So she could never own a $1.4  million home. But, anyway, hopefully others will help her and any other  leaders with Black Lives Matter who don't understand what they are  trying to force on America, and we will see if that actually happens.   Now, I heard our majority leader in what some call a colloquy or  soliloquy, whatever you want to call it, talking about compassion for  those who are foreigners. It strikes me, there are so many people  across America in the lamestream media and even on this floor who think  it is compassionate to lure people across miles, hundreds or thousands  of miles even, across horrendous terrain; have them pay drug cartels,  which thoroughly oppress a country like Mexico; have as much, maybe, as  25, 30 percent of young women raped, we are told, often repeatedly on  that journey; have many girls subjected to a life of sex trafficking in  order to pay back the money they owe to the drug cartels. Others  subjected to human trafficking and drug trafficking in order to pay  back the money they owe to the drug cartels. Creating a life as a  servant, as a bondsman to the drug cartels, where people have no  hesitation to cut off fingers, hands, arms, or heads and put on pikes,  like some honest policemen have had happen, as a message from the drug  cartels that: You don't mess with us.   Somehow that is compassionate to add to the billions of dollars the  drug cartels have to terrorize a country or hemisphere. But if you  really look closely enough at this problem on our southern border, you  will find that is not compassionate at all.  [[Page H1884]]                                     time  1400    The most compassionate, caring, neighborly, Christian thing we could  do for the people of Mexico would be to secure our southern border, cut  the billions of dollars going to the drug cartels that they use to  terrorize a continent, just cut that down to a trickle. They may always  make some, but you can cut it to a trickle if we secure our southern  border.   And then Mexico, because of the incredible people in Mexico, some of  the hardest workers in the world and with natural resources in excess  of most of the countries in the world--and actually a better location  between the Atlantic and Pacific; yes, we are between the Atlantic and  Pacific in the United States, but it is closer across Mexico from one  ocean to the other. They are in a prime location. They ought to be a  top economy in the world. And the only thing that appears to be holding  them back, the one thing is the corruption from the drug cartels that  has greatly increased under this new administration. It is a boon to  the drug cartels that President Biden is helping their human  trafficking business as he is.   Now, he doesn't look at it, I am sure, as helping the drug cartels.  He is looking at it as helping the Democratic National Committee down  the road when they can give amnesty and make them voters, but that is  so hurtful to Mexico.   How about cutting the power of the drug cartels and allowing Mexico  to keep its own citizens and central American countries that are being  depleted of good, hardworking people, letting them keep their citizens,  getting rid of the corruption. We are the main source of the funding  for the corruption south of our border.   Compassion would dictate that we stop funding the corruption instead  of turning a blind eye to that corruption that we are funding through  the drugs, sex trafficking, human trafficking, cut that down to nothing  or very little and watch how our good neighbors will explode with a  vibrant economy, not with terrorism the drug cartels use.   Chip Roy has a bill to name the two main drug cartels as terrorist  organizations, and I think that is exactly what we should do. That  would allow more resources to go towards stopping the terrorism and the  corruption within Mexico and within Central America. That is what a  good neighbor would do. That is what real compassion is. Compassion is  not luring people to situations that destroy their lives.   The indentured servitude that the drug cartels subject these people  to is just unfathomable, and it is unfathomable that educated people,  including here in Washington, D.C., would say, oh, yes, that is a good  thing that we lure people here, even though they become indentured to  the drug cartels.   I have mentioned before, I have been there all hours of the day and  night, but especially at night because it is easier to get drugs  across--in the dark, that is. So the drug cartels totally control who  comes across, when they come across, and in what numbers they come  across.   And as the Border Patrol, when they are down there and they don't  have supervisors watching over them every moment, they will tell you,  we know when we have a big group come across and we are all having to  come together to get them in process, that that is when they are  bringing in large amounts of drugs or some high-value customer perhaps  from a Middle Eastern country; a place like Yemen, where two terrorists  were picked up on the terrorist watch list. But, of course, if they are  not going to be able to get through customs because they are on the  terrorist watch list, well, for goodness' sake, all they have to do is  come to Mexico. The drug cartels will charge them extra money,  somewhere north of $35,000 or so, maybe much more than that, but they  make a lot of money if somebody wants to come and is on the terrorist  watch list.   I was told down there, if you are coming from China, you are probably  going to pay $35,000 or more; but some of the Middle Easterners, they  will pay a lot more than that to avoid being detected coming in.   So let's be compassionate. Let's allow countries south of our border  to keep their citizens and grow a vibrant economy where people won't  have to come begging to the United States. They will have their own  vibrant economy, and they will be blessed immeasurably because of it.                     A Tribute to Former Speaker Boehner     Madam Speaker, I do want to say a special word of  tribute. I know our former Speaker Boehner has been in the media  recently, and I have been asked about comments he has made about some  of us.   Speaker Boehner was an interesting Speaker. I don't know if he knows  who Machiavelli was, but he employed some of those tactics. I remember  July, I believe it was, of 2011, when he was pushing a big sequester  deal. I got up at conference and said--I haven't seen it, but I read  that he apparently said that I didn't make sense. But I stood up at  conference. And I can understand sometimes his mind was a little  clouded. I might not seem to make sense, but I pointed out this  sequester deal is a mistake. It is a terrible mistake because you are  going to cost billions of dollars for the military, to our own defense.  That is our own security.   I actually said in front of the whole conference, when I was in high  school, a friend's father was in a poker game, and he thought he had a  hand that nobody could beat. He was out of money, so he put his home on  the table, and somebody had a hand that beat him, and he lost his home  in a card game. And I have known since that time that you never gamble  with your own security, your family's security, your country's  security.   Speaker Boehner said: Louie, listen, those sequesters will never  happen.   And I said: Of course they are going to happen.   And he said: No, because we have the super committee that will reach  an agreement; because, if they don't, cuts to Medicare will happen.   I forget if it was $200 billion or $300 billion.   And I said: Of course there will be no agreement, because ObamaCare  cut $716 billion from Medicare, from our seniors' coverage for  healthcare. And they did it without a single Republican House vote. So  the only way in 2012 the Democrats will be able to run a commercial  that says Republicans cut Medicare is for the Democrats to prevent an  agreement by the super committee. So the cuts will take place to  Medicare, and the defense and the Democrats will get a twofer, I  explained to Speaker Boehner. They will be able to cut the defense,  which they have been wanting to do, and there will be a cut to Medicare  that they will blame on Republicans' unwillingness to compromise.    As I recall, there were a couple of Senators that even proposed a way  to raise fees that wouldn't be called taxes, and there was an article  that said Democrats thought that was going to get a deal worked out.  Then they met with Democratic leaders and they had to come back and  say: You really made a good-faith offer, but we are told there won't be  a deal.   Well, I tried to explain that that is what would be coming just as it  happened, but as the Speaker has now admitted, I didn't make sense to  him because he had said those sequesters will never happen. That was in  July. Before the end of the year, he had to come before the Republican  conference and explain why the sequesters were going to happen, but we  are going try to minimize the damage.   I also remember another summer when there was a short, funds were  running out for a particular area of our budget of our appropriations,  and we were going to have to do something before we went out on August  break. I asked my dear friend Thomas Massie: Have you talked to  McConnell? Are we going to get a deal on this?   And he said: Yes, I was at breakfast with him this morning, and he  said he and Boehner had an agreement, and we are going to extend the  funds for a couple of months, and they are going to throw in some  additional money to help veterans. They have got it all worked out.   So we are listening as Speaker Boehner gets up, and he says: ``You  know, what often happens is the Senate passes something and leaves town  and they jam us, and then we have to pass what the Senate passed. But  here is what we are going to do''--he even put his finger in the air-- ``we are going to pass a bill, and we are going to extend this a couple  months''--the funding--``we are going put some money in there  [[Page H1885]]  for veterans, and then we are going to pass it, and we are going to  leave town, and we are going to jam the Senate.''   And most of the House Republicans jumped to their feet and were  giving him a standing ovation because the Speaker just told us we were  going to jam the Senate, even though, according to what Senator  McConnell told another Kentuckian, he and Boehner had a deal worked  out. But it got Speaker Boehner a standing ovation and big loud cheers,  not from my friend, Representative Massie, and myself because we knew  what the truth was.   But, anyway, some people, I hear, miss those days where he was  Speaker and did things like that, or totally missed an opportunity on  Cut, Cap, and Balance Act. Speaker Boehner said that could never pass  the House of Representatives. We assured him it could, and it would if  he would just bring it to the floor.   So Speaker Boehner finally agreed, and he brought it to the floor,  and it passed and it was a huge victory, a huge day. But by that very  afternoon, he was already talking about scrapping that and working a  deal with the Senate. In other words, he had no intention of carrying  out the will of the House as we had just passed it, which would have  been great for lowering the indebtedness and getting America on a  financially secure path. He was already scrapping the big victory we  had before it even had a chance to be discussed in the Senate                                time  1415    So I know there is some that miss those days, but if God grants us  the chance to be in the majority again, we can't go back to those days  of manipulation. We have got to be straightforward with the American  people. We have got to have leaders that will do that. And we have got  to be about the business of turning this country back to where freedom  is the watchword for the day, not government oppression, not government  putting businesses out of business, but letting freedom reign for real  once again.   Madam Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.
