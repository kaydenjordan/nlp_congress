 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of a true  American, Frederick Del Buono, who  [[Page H2425]]  was born on July 4, 1940, in Springfield, Massachusetts.   Fred attended trade school, and after completing his education, he  entered the United States Navy in 1961. After boot camp, Fred was  assigned to the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS  Enterprise, where it was ultimately deployed to Vietnam. During  Frederick's time aboard the carrier, the ship crossed the equator,  where he joined King Neptune's motley crew, making him an official  Shellback.   Fred was honorably discharged in 1965 and continued to serve his  country by joining the Navy Reserves. After 30 years of service in the  United States Navy, Fred retired from the Navy Reserve Readiness  Command on March 1, 1994.   Fred's work career as a civilian began with being hired by the U.S.  Post Office, where he was a tractor-trailer operator for over 21 years.  Fred and his family moved to Rock Hill, South Carolina, in 2007, where  he joined the esteemed group of patriots known as the Rolling Thunder  Chapter 1, where he served as chairman of the board for over 10 years.  This group of men and women offer comfort and aid to local veterans and  their families as they become integrated into their respective  communities.   Fred has continued his service by becoming a member of the American  Legion Post 34, where he has served as chairman of the board for the  last 10 years.   Fred Del Buono is a shining example of the motto ``Service Above  Self,'' and his willingness to help others will long be remembered for  many years to come.                            ____________________
