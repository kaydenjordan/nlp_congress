 Mr. Chair, I regret that I was not able to be present for  rollcall Nos. 298, 299, and 308 on the Blumenauer, Tlaib, and Roy  amendments to H.R. 2670. Had I been present, I would have voted ``aye''  on rollcall No. 298, ``no'' on rollcall No. 299, and ``no'' on rollcall  No. 308.                     Amendment No. 31 Offered by Mr. Roy
