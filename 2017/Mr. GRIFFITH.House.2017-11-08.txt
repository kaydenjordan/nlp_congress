 Mr. Chairman, hydropower is an essential component of  an all-of-the-above energy strategy.   We have a tremendous opportunity to expand renewable hydropower  production. However, without some much-needed licensing improvements,  we risk losing investment opportunities in new hydropower  infrastructure. In particular, closed-loop pumped storage hydro  projects offer the opportunity to store energy for use when it is  needed.   I have introduced separate legislation, H.R. 2880, with the goal of  making the review process of these projects as efficient as possible.  Both H.R. 3043 and H.R. 2880 will allow the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission to impose licensing conditions only as necessary to protect  public safety, or that are reasonable, economically feasible, and  essential to protect fish and wildlife resources.   I am excited about the possibility some are exploring to build these  facilities in abandoned mine lands. This renewable energy solution for  power could be a real benefit to our coal field regions in central  Appalachia in the form of jobs, economic development, and energy  security. I am proud of what we are doing here in an effort to make  this happen.   Industry and labor groups alike support H.R. 3043 because a modern  regulatory framework for hydro is good for jobs and good for consumers.  The following groups have written in support of the bill:   The American Council on Renewable Energy, the International  Brotherhood of Boilermakers, the International Brotherhood of  Electrical Workers, the International Federation of Professional and  Technical Engineers, and many others.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the letter containing the names  of supporters.                                                   November 6, 2017.        The undersigned groups are writing to express strong       support for H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization       Act of 2017, and to request your vote as it is considered on       the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives this week.        Hydropower is America's single largest provider of       renewable electricity, making up almost one-half of all       generation from renewable resources. Given that hydropower is       an important source of domestic, emissions-free, flexible       power needed to ensure consistent and reliable electric       service, we must  [[Page H8618]]       look to preserve and protect our existing hydropower system       and promote new expansion opportunities.        H.R. 3043 provides a framework that adds accountability and       transparency, eliminates inefficiencies and redundancies, and       unlocks innovation and advancements in technology and       operations, while protecting environmental values, public       participation, and all existing authorities of federal and       state decision-makers in the licensing process        The current regulatory environment is placing hydropower at       risk. The licensing process can result in both new and       existing projects taking up to ten years or longer to receive       their approvals. This not only creates uncertainty for       project owners and developers alike, but burdens electricity       customers with additional unnecessary costs and only delays       important environmental measures that the industry, resource       agencies, and the environmental community agreed upon during       the licensing process and want to see deployed.        Additionally, the fleet of almost 2,200 hydropower projects       across the country supports approximately 118,000 ongoing       full-time equivalent jobs in operations and maintenance and       25,000 jobs in construction and upgrades. By maintaining our       existing fleet and supporting growth in the sector, the       hydropower industry could support close to 200,000 jobs.       Further local economic development in other industries is       also spurred due to access to affordable electricity from       hydropower projects. However, we will not realize the full       measure of these jobs and economic opportunities without       improvements to the licensing process.        We believe H.R. 3043 is a moderate proposal developed with       bipartisan input and, as such, deserves strong support by       both Republicans and Democrats. Please contact any of our       organizations for additional information or assistance on       this bill.
