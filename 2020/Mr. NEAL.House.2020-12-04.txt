 Mr. Speaker, today's House Consideration of the MORE Act  marks an important step in mitigating the impacts of the historically  racist war on drugs. This legislation will reform our federal criminal  laws while also making investments in and empowering communities of  color and those adversely affected by current unjust policies.   The MORE Act makes important changes to federal law by removing  marijuana, or cannabis, from the list of federally controlled  substances. This change to federal law does not undermine the ability  of states to apply their criminal laws as they see fit. Instead it  makes marijuana a federally regulated substance that is subject to the  FDA's regulatory authority and federal taxation. The excise tax that is  established by the bill is similar to those for alcohol and tobacco.   By creating a legal marijuana market that is subject to federal  taxation, this legislation also creates an opportunity trust fund that  will increase opportunities or individuals and communities affected by  the war on drugs. The opportunity trust fund will fund programs such as  job training, reentry services, and substance abuse disorder services,  as well as assistance to small businesses owned by socially and  economically disadvantaged individuals.   I thank my colleague, Representative Blumenauer, for his tireless  leadership on this issue. As this bill continues through the  legislative process, I look forward to continuing to work with the  measure's sponsors and the other committees of jurisdiction to achieve  an effective tax regime that supports a vibrant legal market and  provides individuals most affected by the war on drugs the opportunity  to fully participate in this emerging economy.
