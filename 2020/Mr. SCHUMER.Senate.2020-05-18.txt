 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, now, for the third week in a row, the  Republican majority in the Senate has no COVID-related business on the  agenda. For the third week in a row, Leader McConnell has scheduled  zero votes on legislation having to do with the crisis.   Senate Democrats have had to relentlessly pressure our Republican  colleagues to secure even the most routine oversight hearings on the  pandemic. If we had not pressured them, I doubt there would be any  hearings at all, and they are few and far between. The hearings will be  the only work we will have done in the Senate on COVID-19 in the entire  month of May, and the Republican majority has had to be pressured into  doing even those. There are now more than 35 million Americans out of  work through no fault of their own. Almost 1.5 million Americans are  sick, and nearly 90,000 have died. Yet Senate Republicans have decided  to take the month off from the coronavirus.   The American people may be wondering: What is the Republican-led  Senate doing instead of addressing this urgent national crisis? What  could be more pressing? What is the Republican Senate doing in the  midst of the crisis?   Well, Leader McConnell has scheduled five rightwing judges for the  floor of the Senate, and the Republican chairman of the Homeland  Security Committee will be holding a hearing designed to slander the  family of the President's political opponent. Is the chairman of  Homeland Security calling in FEMA to find out if our hospitals have  enough PPE? No. He wants to echo Kremlin-backed conspiracy theories in  order to go on a fishing expedition to smear Joe Biden's son.   We all know this is what the President focuses on instead of the  COVID crisis, but must our Republican colleagues gamely follow such an  absurd, diversionary, and untruthful agenda? I guess so. It is a shame.   Even more shameful, the company that the Senator from Wisconsin wants  to issue a subpoena for is voluntarily cooperating and providing  relevant documents to the committee. Did you hear that? They want to  make a big show of subpoenaing, but the company says it will cooperate.  It is a show. It is a sham. It has nothing to do with COVID and  everything to do with Kremlin-backed rumors that they want to use to  divert attention from the President's poor showing on COVID. The  subpoena is just for show. It is not necessary because the company will  cooperate. It is a way to kick up dirt for exclusively partisan  purposes.   It would be bad enough if they were doing this when COVID-19 wasn't  raging, but with COVID-19 raging, to spend time doing this instead of  focusing on the way to get relief to people--unbelievable. It is a low  point for that committee, a low point for the Senate.   This is what is on the Senate Republicans' agenda in the midst of  historic unemployment and a national crisis: five rightwing judges and  the exploitation--a show, mock hearing for partisan mudslinging.  America is in crisis, and Senate Republicans are rearranging the  Nation's deck chairs and trying to put them in a political assembly.   The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, appointed by  President Trump, said last week that we are looking at the worst  recession since World War II. Yesterday, Mr. Powell warned that layoffs  would continue for several months and that unemployment could reach 20  or even 25 percent. He said:         If we let people be out of work for long periods of time,       if we let businesses fail unnecessarily, waves of them,       there'll be longer term damage to the economy. The recovery       will be slower. The good news is we can avoid that by       providing more support now.   [[Page S2471]]     Mr. Powell went on to encourage policymakers to provide greater  assistance to families and implement measures to keep workers in their  homes. He also pointed out if State and local governments don't receive  additional aid, they will be forced to lay off public employees and cut  back on public services at the worst possible time.   Mr. Powell is spot-on, and tomorrow, in the Senate Banking Committee,  my Republican colleagues will have a chance to hear this critical  message straight from the horse's mouth, with Mr. Mnuchin and Mr.  Powell set to testify only after Senate Democrats had to push and push  and push for such a hearing. We asked for it 3 weeks ago. It should  have happened 2 weeks ago because the country is calling out for  action. Trump appointees are calling out for action. Governors across  the country--Democratic and Republican Governors--are calling out for  action. When will my Republican colleagues hear the message? After all,  there is no shortage of action the Senate could take.   Millions of Americans are having difficulty receiving the expanded  unemployment insurance benefits that Congress recently passed. Why  aren't Senate Republicans holding a hearing on why millions of our  citizens aren't getting the aid we intended to provide instead of these  sham political show trial ``gotcha'' hearings?   Testing continues to be a major problem. A blockbuster report in the  Washington Post last night says we are ``far short of the [testing]  number that most independent analysts say will be needed to avoid  another wave of death and illness.'' The report described a concerning  shortage of PPE, nasal swabs, and reagents in nursing homes and other  frontline settings. The report outlined another problem: There is a  startling lack of awareness in many communities about the need to get  tested.   Why aren't Senate Republicans focusing on these issues? These are  life-and-death issues. They relate to people's health and people's  lives, and they relate to our economy getting well. Why isn't President  Trump leading a nationwide push to increase testing capacity and  frequency and awareness?   President Trump is so desperate to reopen the country as quickly as  possible, but he refuses to roll up his sleeves and do the work that  would allow us to do it safely. There is an anomaly here. He demands  that people get back to work but doesn't do his work to make sure we  have testing, to make sure there are guidelines, to make sure this  works correctly so that we don't have a crisis a few months from now.   House Democrats have put together a major bill that would provide  urgent and necessary relief to the American people. My colleagues on  the Republican side don't have to like everything in it. They could  easily say: Let's sit down and negotiate. Let's find some common  ground.   Instead, Leader McConnell has said that Republicans have yet to feel  ``the urgency of acting immediately''--Herbert Hoover redux. Instead,  his party is slowly preparing legislation to give legal immunity to big  corporations that put workers in dangerous situations. Is that the No.  1 problem on every American's mind? Is that the No. 1 problem of people  who are losing their jobs, people who have small businesses that are  going bankrupt, people who can't feed their kids--protecting  corporations from liability?   This Republican Party is so, so out of touch with America. It is so  off-kilter, so in obeisance to the hard right that they can't even  focus on a crisis when it is right before their eyes.   We are confronted with a period of prolonged economic misery for  millions of American workers and families--Americans who, for the first  time, are waiting in staggering lines at food banks, Americans who, for  the first time, don't know if they will be able to keep a roof over  their heads, put food on the table or pay the rent. How long will it  take--how long? How much economic hardship--how much before Republicans  feel the urgency to act
