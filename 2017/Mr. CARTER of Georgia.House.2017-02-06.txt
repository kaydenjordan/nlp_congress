 I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the First Congressional District of Georgia includes all  100 miles of Georgia's coastline and barrier islands. It was on one of  these islands that the founder of Georgia, General James Oglethorpe,  built a fort in 1736 to protect the new British Colony from the  Spaniards. He named the fort and nearby town ``Frederica'' in honor of  the Prince of Wales. In 1742, Fort Frederica's strategic location  helped the British win a decisive victory against the Spanish in the  Battle of Bloody Marsh. After this battle, the Spanish abandoned their  attempts to take over the territory, and Georgia was fully secured as a  British Colony. Today, Fort Frederica National Monument is a popular  destination in Glynn County, featuring portions of the original fort, a  museum, and extensive hiking trails.   H.R. 494 would allow for a small addition of adjacent land that  contains artifacts from prehistoric human settlements. With this  addition, visitors will be able to see a more complete story of the  history of Georgia--from its earliest human residents, to colonial  times, to modern day.   I thank the chairman for his consideration of this bill, and I thank  the Natural Resources Committee's staff for its efforts. I also thank  the entire Georgia delegation for supporting and cosponsoring this  legislation.
