 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1140, the Rights  for Transportation Security Officers Act of 2020.   For well over a decade, Chairwoman Nita Lowey and I have championed  this legislation to provide TSA frontline security workers the basic  rights and benefits they deserve.   Today, H.R. 1140 has 242 bipartisan cosponsors and is strongly  supported by the American Federation of Government Employees and the  Transport Workers Union of America.   When TSA was stood up after the September 11 attacks, Congress gave  the agency broad authority to develop a new, more nimble personnel  system to address national security issues that threatened our  transportation system.   Over the years, TSA's security policies, technologies, and  capabilities have evolved to provide a formidable defense against  potential terrorist attacks.   Unfortunately, TSA's personnel management system has not evolved with  the rest of the agency. The modern, nimble system Congress envisioned  was never realized.   Instead, Transportation Security officers, or TSOs, are subject to an  antiquated system that does not provide appropriate pay, regular salary  increases, or basic civil service protections.   Further, an employee subject to a disciplinary action does not have  the right to appeal to an independent third party, such as the Merit  Systems Protection Board. Today, the TSA Administrator serves as judge,  jury, and executioner for disciplinary proceedings.   According to a former TSA Deputy Administrator, the lack of due  process protections within TSA has bred a culture of retribution and  arbitrary personnel practices, leading to misbehavior and a reluctance  to report security vulnerabilities.   When TSA leadership has used its special personnel authorities, it  has been mostly to benefit senior management, not the frontline  workforce.   In one instance, a senior manager received $90,000 in bonuses in a  single year, yet the men and women in the screening workforce make  starting salaries of just $29,000 and are among the lowest paid Federal  workers. They are forced to live paycheck to paycheck even as their job  responsibilities have grown increasingly complex with changes in  threats and technologies.   Today, few TSOs have advanced beyond the bottom levels of TSA's pay  bands, even after years of service.   Under the Obama administration, the frontline TSA workforce was, for  the first time, granted the ability to unionize. Many of us hoped that  this change would lead to TSA abandoning unfair practices.   Disappointingly, TSA limited the range of issues subject to  collective bargaining to a narrow set of issues that, over time, have  been repeatedly scaled back.    TSA struggles with low morale and high attrition, consistently  ranking near the bottom of the annual ``Best Places to Work'' survey.  In fact, this year, TSA ranked 415th out of 415 agency components--dead  last--on pay satisfaction.   Low morale and high attrition have had an adverse impact on the  agency, crippling TSA's ability to develop a mature workforce.  According to the DHS inspector general, over a 2-year span in 2016 and  2017, one in three Transportation Security officers quit.   As Members of Congress, many of us fly two or three times a week. We  probably see and interact with Transportation Security officers more  than any other Federal employees. We know them.   How can we ask these brave men and women to protect us from terrorist  attacks, yet not provide them with the basic protections most Federal  employees receive?   This bill will place TSA under title 5 like most other Federal  agencies, granting the workforce better pay and regular salary  increases.   Employees would have robust collective bargaining rights like other  Federal employees, such as Customs and Border Protection officers in  the Department of Homeland Security. And  [[Page H1486]]  in instances when an employee feels they have been unfairly  disciplined, they could have their case considered by an independent  party like other Federal employees.   Importantly, TSA's management would still be able to remove screeners  from duty if their presence jeopardizes the mission of the agency, and  security procedures would not be subject to collective bargaining.   While investing in the workforce will have an up-front cost, it will  pay off in the long run. The DHS inspector general found that, in 2017  alone, TSA spent approximately $16 million to hire and train nearly  2,000 people who left within months of being hired. That level of  turnover is not sustainable.   Enactment of H.R. 1140 will reduce attrition, improve morale, and  position TSA to have a more experienced workforce with the proficiency  needed to execute TSA's national security mission.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for their support on this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1400     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), who has championed this issue  from day one.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the chair of the House  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Correa), chair of the House Homeland  Security Committee's Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime  Security.    Mr. Chairman, just for the record,  nothing in H.R. 1140 restricts the workforce's ability to elect union  representation. I want to be very clear on that.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume to say that I appreciate my colleague next door to me  citing the section about Federal Labor Relations Authority because that  is my reference.   It says, ``or successor labor organization.'' And it says in the  ``Sunset Provision--The provisions of this section  [[Page H1488]]  shall cease to be effective as of the conversion date.''   So there are options available. It is not a closed-door process, and  we wouldn't have it that way anyway.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms.  Titus).    Mr. Chairman, I think, for the record,  we want our TSOs to be treated just like all other Federal employees.  If it is good enough for everybody else except TSA, then it should be  good for TSA too.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs.  Watson Coleman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Chairman, I have no more speakers,  and I am prepared to close after the gentleman from Alabama closes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the arguments my colleagues have made in  favor of this bill as well as the amendments offered to improve it.  This is ultimately a simple bill with a simple but critical goal.   Following the September 11 attack, Congress determined that the need  to ensure the security of our Nation's transportation systems required  the creation of a new Federal agency, the TSA.   Yet, in standing up this critical national security agency, Congress  mistakenly gave TSA broad personnel authority that has resulted in the  workforce lagging far behind other Federal workers with respect to pay,  benefits, and rights. By passing this bill, we will finish the job we  started and make TSA a Federal agency that follows the laws Congress  had constructed over many decades to govern treatment of Federal  employees.   This is the right thing to do for the frontline workers, the right  thing to do for the traveling public, and the right thing to do for our  national security.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for their support, I urge passage of  H.R. 1140, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do  now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Payne) having assumed the chair, Mr. Cuellar, Chair of the Committee of  the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that  Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1140) to  enhance the security operations of the Transportation Security  Administration and stability of the transportation security workforce  by applying the personnel system under title 5, United States Code, to  employees of the Transportation Security Administration who provide  screening of all passengers and property, and for other purposes, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
