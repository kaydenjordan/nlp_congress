 Madam President, I want to recognize Kathleen ``Kathy''  Ott, who recently retired from her role as the Director of the Library  of Congress' Congressional Relations Office after 11 years of dedicated  service to the Library and to Congress.   Appointed in 2008 by former Librarian of Congress, Dr. James  Billington, Kathy was sought after by the Library for her extensive  experience interfacing with Congress from both the public and private  sectors. As the director of the Library's Congressional Relations  Office, she spent more than a decade of her career building strong  bipartisan relationships between the Library, Congress, and  congressional staff.   Kathy has had the privilege of serving two Librarians of Congress,  Dr. James Billington and Dr. Carla D. Hayden. Kathy was instrumental in  supporting Dr. Hayden's confirmation process. With the help of Kathy's  tireless effort throughout the nomination process, Dr. Hayden was  overwhelmingly confirmed in a bipartisan fashion by the Senate during  the 114th Congress.   In her time at the Library, Kathy has shaped the Library's  relationship with Congress through 3 Presidential administrations, 6  Congresses, and 11 budget and appropriations cycles, building  bipartisan support for Library of Congress initiatives along the way.  Additionally, she worked with 10 different chairs of the Senate Rules  and Administration Committee and House Administration Committee. As a  member of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, I always  appreciated Kathy's thorough and dutiful commitment to her role, the  Library, and Congress.   During her tenure, Kathy has welcomed nearly 500 new Members of  Congress during their freshman orientation activities hosted at the  Library. She also created the bipartisan Library of Congress Caucus in  the 111th Congress, which currently has 84 Representatives. Moreover,  she helped to coordinate the congressional participation in the award  of the Library's Gershwin Prize for Popular Song to the likes of Sir  Paul McCartney, Billy Joel, Smokey Robinson, as well as other  noteworthy musical artists.   In her position, Kathy also played an integral role in the launch of  the Library's popular Congressional Dialogue Dinner Series in 2013,  which has just concluded its 45th dinner. Marcelle and I have had the  pleasure of enjoying many wonderful nights at the Library attending  these delightful dinners and discussions.   Marcelle and I have had so many wonderful experiences with Kathy. I  have to mention one especially. When Pope Francis came to speak to a  joint meeting of Congress, Kathy had arranged to have a special Bible  from the Library's collection available to be blessed by the Pope. She  knew the Pope would bless it, so she arranged to have with it several  religious medals and other things important to her and her family  available to be a part of the blessing. I know the Pope didn't mind,  and those of us there thought, ``This is why we think the world of  her.''   Kathy has always been known as a reliable and trusted source for  Library of Congress information. She will be greatly missed by Members  of Congress and congressional staff alike. Marcelle and I wish Kathy  the best in retirement.                            ____________________     Madam President, in the midst of fall celebrations such as  Halloween or, for fans in Washington and Houston, the World Series, I  want to take a moment to highlight another important annual celebration  that occurred last week: Bat Week.   It is fitting that last week, the Senate approved an appropriations  bill to fund the Fish and Wildlife Service. At this time each year, we  join our friends at the Fish and Wildlife Service, conservation groups  around the world, and bat enthusiasts to recognize the irreplaceable  role of bats and to highlight our urgent fight to protect them.   Many do not know the profound impact that bats have on our  environment and our economy. For an agricultural state like Vermont,  bats are vital to both our ecosystem and our economy. They control  pests, pollinate crops, and even spread seeds. Some farmers would  consider bats among their best friends. For years, I have worked on the  Appropriations Committee to prioritize funding for habitat conservation  and to stop the spread of white-nose syndrome. I am proud that the  fiscal year 2020 Interior bill once again responds to the call of the  bat signal and provides more than $7 million to combat white-nose, a  disease that has devastated bat communities across the country.   So once again I hope Senators will join me in recognizing the  importance of bat and keep the advocacy behind Bat Week going  throughout the year.                            ____________________     Madam President, Vermont sets the gold standard for the  maple industry, and maple is integral to our State's economy and to our  State's identity. The Vermont families and businesses that keep this  sector vibrant and viable are also an essential part of the fabric of  our State. I am proud to recognize one of those businesses today.  Nestled along the western slopes of Vermont's highest peak, Mount  Mansfield, Runamok Maple is one of the roughly 1500 sugar producers in  Vermont that produce nearly half of the Nation's maple syrup. Owned and  operated by Laura and Eric Sorkin, Runamok Maple exemplifies the  innovation and entrepreneurship that is revitalizing communities across  Vermont.   Maple sugaring is a tradition carried forward and refined by each new  generation of Vermonters. The Sorkins themselves benefited from the  mentorship of nearby sugar producers before launching their own  business a decade ago. In 2016, recognizing an opportunity, they pumped  money and energy into a diversification effort that included a retail  line of flavor-infused and barrel-aged syrups, all packaged and branded  for the direct sales market. Two years later, I was proud to support  funding for the Northern Border Regional Commission that in turn  allowed Fairfax, VT, to expand wastewater infrastructure to Runamok's  new manufacturing home, an old facility that once manufactured Scrabble  game tiles. The improvements enabled Runamok's expansion from 45 to 100  employees and revitalized a part of the historic town.   Through their products, writings, and creativity, the Sorkins and  their outstanding staff are not only producing world-class value-added  products, they are changing how people think about maple syrup. Long  gone are the days when it was considered a mere condiment for pancakes.  I was not surprised, then, to see Runamok Maple featured in a recent  Washington Post article about the many possibilities of Vermont's  sweetest export.   In recognition of the families across our State who continue to keep  this bedrock Vermont sector thriving, I ask  [[Page S6387]]  unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Sept. 2, 2019]  Before You Pour All That Maple Syrup on Your Pancakes, Here's What You                            Should Know About It                             (By Becky Krystal)         It's fall, so you can take your pumpkin spice and . . .       enjoy it in your deodorant, candles, lattes and, well,       seemingly everything. Me? When I think of fall flavors, I       think about maple syrup. It is actually a bit odd when you       consider that spring is the season when producers collect and       cook down the sap from the maple trees. Still, I'm going to       stick with my convictions, because maple syrup to me evokes       New England and flannel and colorful foliage, all of which       are the essence of fall.        And no, it's not just sweet. ``Maple syrup is a lot more       complex than sugar,'' says Laura Sorkin, who owns Vermont-      based Runamok Maple with her husband, Eric. ``There's a lot       more nuance than what you would get with granulated sugar.''       The flavor can vary depending on the time of year, but Sorkin       says toffee, caramel, honey and apple are among the notes she       can pick out. There's also a balance of sweetness and       acidity.        We've all poured maple syrup over our pancakes and waffles.       Maybe even a little too much--that stuff is $$$! Here's what       you need to know about how to better understand, appreciate       and use that liquid gold. (Sorry, Mimi.)        The grades. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture       updated its maple grades to come into line with standards       already adopted by several states and Canada. One of the       goals with the new grades was to give consumers better       descriptors of flavor and color, as well as allow some of the       very dark syrup previously classified as B grade to be folded       into the A grade, providing easier access for home cooks.       Sorkin says it's worth keeping in mind that the strength of       flavor does not always occur in a smooth progression along       with color, as you can get a lighter-colored syrup with an       intense taste and a darker that's milder.        Still, here is the rundown of how the government describes       the grades aimed at individual buyers (there is a processing       grade that can be used by manufacturers making other       products), ordered from least to most intense, as well as       early to late season:        Grade A, golden color/delicate flavor: ``Mild maple       taste,'' according to the USDA. You might know this from its       previous grade, Fancy. The Vermont Maple Sugar Makers'       Association suggests serving this grade with the expected       breakfast fare or rich dairy, such as ice cream or yogurt.        Grade A, amber color/rich flavor: ``A full-bodied maple       taste of medium intensity,'' the USDA says. If you choose       only one grade, Sorkin says, it should be this one. It's       great on waffles and pancakes, but the Vermont association       also recommends it for salad dressings, cocktails and       barbecue sauce.        Grade A, dark color/robust flavor: The USDA is less helpful       on the last two grades, explaining that this grade has a       stronger taste than the lighter colors. You don't say.       Anyway, our friends from Vermont like to take advantage of       its hearty flavor by pouring it over baked fruit and       vegetables and using it as a glaze for meat and vegetables.       It can also shine in baking.        Grade A, very dark/strong flavor: You guessed it--``a maple       taste that is stronger than robust.'' Okay then! What say       you, Vermont? ``When you need a strong maple flavor in a       bread or cookie, ice cream, or barbecue sauce, this is the       grade of choice.''        Storage. Keep unopened maple syrup in a cool, dry spot, out       of direct light. The Vermont Maple Sugar Makers' Association       recommends storing opened maple syrup in the refrigerator. Or       to keep it in very good shape, you can freeze it, going       through as many freezing and thawing cycles as you want, the       group says, as long as you let it thaw completely and stir in       any condensation that forms on the top of the syrup.        Even when properly stored, maple syrup can crystallize. In       ``The Clever Cook's Kitchen Handbook: 5,037 Ingenious Hints,       Secrets, Shortcuts, and Solutions,'' author David Joachim       suggests heating the jar of syrup in a pan of hot water over       low heat until the crystals dissolve. (Move the syrup to a       glass jar or heatproof bowl if it's in plastic.) Or, try       microwaving it for 10 to 15 seconds on medium power. Of       course, you can consider it candy and just eat the crystals,       too. Joachim says you can salvage moldy maple syrup by       scraping or straining out the mold and bringing the syrup to       a full boil and returning it to a clean jar or bottle.        Substituting. ``Maple syrup is about as sweet as sugar, so       you can replace it using an equal amount of syrup,''       according to the Vermont-based experts at King Arthur Flour.       ``Decrease the liquid by 3 to 4 tablespoons per 1 cup       substitution.'' If you're adding maple syrup to a recipe that       doesn't call for liquid, you need to increase the flour by 1       tablespoon for every \1/4\ cup maple syrup used. KAF       emphasizes using room temperature maple syrup, because if       it's cold, it can cause other ingredients, including butter,       to clump. If you use a darker grade, expect a ``delightfully       caramelly'' flavor.        Flavoring your own. Runamok's eclectic infused syrups       include such flavors as hibiscus, makrut lime-leaf, smoked       chile pepper and ginger. (Here's a link to a coffee syrup in       our archives.) If you're interested in creating your own       infusions, especially with whole spices, Sorkin suggests       gently heating the syrup and letting the ingredients steep       for a few hours. Taste every so often to see whether you've       achieved the right level of flavor. Keep in mind that it's       better to be conservative than add too much or steep too       long.        Uses. ``I would just love it if people would start thinking       beyond pancakes,'' Sorkin says. She notes that honey has       really come into its own as an ingredient to be appreciated       and used in a variety of ways and hopes the time will come       soon for maple syrup. Maple syrup on a cheese board? Go for       it! In Vermont, people have been putting maple syrup in their       coffee for a long time, and Sorkin says it works in tea, too,       particularly a black variety (try it in chai). She is, as you       would expect, a proponent of maple syrup in cocktails.        Sorkin says maple syrup can be lost in flour-heavy baked       goods, so she prefers to save it for situations when it can       really shine, such as in frostings (buttercream or cream       cheese), glazes and a simple syrup applied to a cake. It can       be used in a wide variety of savory applications, too, adding       just the right balance when played against other flavors.       Sorkin, who trained at the French Culinary Institute in New       York (now the International Culinary Center), likes to add a       drizzle on top of a sweet potato and tahini dip. Her other       recipes include maple vinaigrettes, roasted cabbage and       crispy tofu. Always worth considering: Maple butter.        Need some more ideas? Here are a few contenders from our       archives:        Frozen Maple Mousse. This is very much like a no-chum ice       cream, which you can drizzle with a bit more maple syrup,       naturally.        Maple Olive Oil Pecan Granola. Here's another way to       incorporate maple syrup into your breakfast that does not       involve pancakes or waffles.        Maple Spiced Glazed Nuts. These are definitely worth adding       to your party food repertoire--they make an ideal game-day       snack.        Grilled Maple-Marinated Portobello Mushrooms. Maple syrup       is paired with soy sauce and earthy mushrooms for an umami-      rich meatless main.        Maple-Chipotle Basting Sauce. Consider using a darker grade       for this sauce, which is right at home on pork or any other       grilled meat.                            ____________________     Madam President. earlier this year, Vermonters who are  expanding and elevating one of Vermont's most honored products-- cheese--were recognized with a record number of ribbons at the American  Cheese Society's 36th Annual Awards competition in Richmond, VA. I am  delighted, though not surprised, that a total of 44 Vermont cheeses won  awards, including 5 that were finalists for Best of Show. Many of these  cheeses are featured every year at our annual Taste of Vermont, held  here on Capitol Hill each May.   Vermont's talented Vermont cheesemakers have brought home top awards  from this competition each year, but never before has the State been a  winner across so many categories. Despite its small size, Vermont was  in the top three States for the number of awards earned--a significant  accomplishment for this bedrock sector in our State.   The winners came from every corner of Vermont, every scale of  production, and for many varieties of cheese. Large producers, like the  Cabot Creamery Cooperative, which represents hundreds of farm families,  came home as winners. So, too, did small operations like Barn First  Creamery, which is home to just 32 goats and 2 farmer-cheesemakers.  This contrast and diverse success is a fitting illustration of  Vermont's agricultural landscape.   The Vermont Cheese Council helped to support the Vermont cheesemakers  involved in the American Cheese Society's competition by providing  technical assistance and marketing support. This council's foundational  role is to help produce and advance Vermont-made cheese. The success of  Vermont cheesemakers at this year's American Cheese Society's Annual  Awards is just the latest testament to its effectiveness. Similar to  the American Cheese Society, the Vermont Cheese Council provides the  public and food professionals with educational events to learn more  about cheese and cheese making throughout the State.   Cheese is a staple for Vermont agriculture and value added  production, with over 45 cheesemakers--the most per capita of any  State--throughout Vermont working with sheep, goats, and multiple cow  breeds, to produce world-class artisanal cheese. The State's Department  of Tourism and  [[Page S6388]]  Marketing provides visitors with a map of the Vermont Cheese Trail  created by the Vermont Cheese Council. It features locations where  visitors can experience over 150 varieties of cheeses. Great cheese  requires great dairy farmers, and both are fundamental to our State's  economy and tradition.   I am proud to celebrate the success of all the cheese producers  throughout my home State of Vermont and want now to recognize the  Vermont cheesemakers receiving awards from this year's American Cheese  Council. They include Barn First Creamery, Westfield; Boston Post  Dairy, Enosburg Falls; Cabot Creamery Cooperative, Cabot; Fairy Tale  Farm, Bridport; Grafton Village Cheese Company, Grafton; Jasper Hill  Farm, Greensboro; Maplebrook Farm, Bennington; Mt. Mansfield Creamery,  Morrisville; Parish Hill Creamery, West Westminster; Sage Farm Goat  Dairy, Stowe; Spring Brook Farm/Farms for City Kids Foundation,  Reading; Vermont Creamery, Websterville; Vermont Farmstead Cheese  Company, Woodstock; Vermont Shepherd, Putney; and Von Trapp Farmstead,  Waitsfield.                            ____________________
