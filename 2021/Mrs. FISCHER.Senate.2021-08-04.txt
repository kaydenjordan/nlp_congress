 Mr. President, I thank Senator Carper and Senator  Capito for the work they have been doing here on the floor. I  appreciate their diligence in trying to get amendments up.   I am glad to offer this bipartisan amendment with my colleague from  Nevada. It would promote transparency among all Federal funding avenues  for broadband infrastructure deployment.   Right now, funding is divided among several Agencies: FCC, NTIA,  USDA, HHS, Treasury, and many others. Some of these programs have  detailed maps of where funding is going, but some do not. Even when  there are maps, it still requires searching through several web pages  and sources to find out what you are looking for, if you can find it at  all.   Without a clear picture of where the funding is going, it will be  increasingly difficult to avoid duplication and distribute resources  where they are needed the most. So our amendment would create an online  mapping tool through an interagency process so we can view the latest  progress of all of these deployment projects in one place. I would urge  adoption of the amendment.   Thank you.    A recorded vote would be fine.
