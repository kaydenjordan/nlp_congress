 Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the  Johnson amendment.   The amendment would force the continued payment of government  contractors to build an ill-conceived border wall.   Most of these funds were never intended for this purpose. More than  $10 billion was redirected from the Department of Defense. These funds  were intended for military missions and functions, such as schools for  military families and National Guard equipment.   The Biden administration is conducting a comprehensive review of  these contracts, led by the Departments of Defense and Homeland  Security. These decisions will be guided by what is best for our  national security, not well-connected government contractors profiting  off of hard-earned taxpayer dollars.   We need to move forward with smart, bipartisan investments to improve  border security that secure both our southern and our northern borders,  not look backwards at the former administration's boondoggle.  [[Page S3183]]    I urge a ``no'' vote.
