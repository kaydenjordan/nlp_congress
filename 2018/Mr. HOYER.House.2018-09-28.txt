 Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I will ask the majority leader a question,  just to make sure we all understand the schedule. But before I do that,  I want to join the majority leader in saying how pleased we are that   Steve Scalise not only came back, but is making such a positive  contribution to the Congress of the United States.   I say to Steve that, when he came back, he gave one of those talks  that I will always remember: his gratitude for the care of so many  people around the world for a Member of our body.   I thank him for his friendship and working together. Hopefully we  will continue to do so, hopefully in a very constructive way for the  American people.   Welcome back, and God bless him, and we wish him a full, full  recovery. We don't want him to be too strong on this side, but we want  him strong.   And with that, we were talking on this side, and it appeared that the  majority leader said we weren't going to be here next week.    Or the week after.   Is there a possibility, from that, that we may be here during the  month of October?    Thank you.   We look forward to being back on November 13.   I thank the majority leader.                            ____________________
