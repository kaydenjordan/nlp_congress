 Madam Speaker, tomorrow, tens of thousands  of Americans will rally in favor of life, because we have a moral duty  to defend the weakest and most vulnerable. I will have a little more to  say later on in the Special Order. But it is my distinct privilege to  yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), a great leader  and a compassionate leader as well.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  her very eloquent remarks.   I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Marshall very  much for his comments and, again, for his leadership. I am so glad to  have him here.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), a member of the Appropriations Committee  from Nebraska One who has been outspoken for the entirety of his career  in defense of human life, as well as religious freedom.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Fortenberry for  those very eloquent comments. To our colleagues and to those watching  this at home, I think he really has touched a chord.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).   Madam Speaker, Mr. Chabot is the prime author of the Partial-Birth  Abortion Ban, a hideous method of abortion where the baby is half born  and then is snuffed out when his or her brains are literally drawn from  the baby's brain area. I thank the gentleman for authoring that  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Weber very much  for his very strong comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman),  my good friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Bergman for being  here on the Special Order. We are so proud to have him on the Pro-Life  Caucus. I thank him for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson),  from Ohio's Eighth Congressional District.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I will just say a couple of  words, and then I will yield to my good friend, Dr. Harris.   Madam Speaker, doctors today routinely diagnose and treat a myriad of  conditions, illnesses, and diseases suffered by society's littlest  patients--unborn babies--significantly enhancing their health and  chances to survive and to thrive. Comprehensive maternal and prenatal  care is critical and ensures that both mother and baby are as healthy  as possible during pregnancy and childbirth and in the weeks that  follow.   Yet, tragically, in the United States, we have one of the highest  maternal mortality rates in the developed world. While unborn children  are killed at an unconscionable rate, nearly 2,500 children's lives are  destroyed each and every day, about 906,000 in 2018 and more than 62  million dead babies since 1973. That shocking loss of children's lives  equates with the entire population of England, more than 62 million  kids who have been lost.   This stunning loss of children's lives has occurred during a time  when science has made it absolutely clear that birth is an important  event in the life of a child. It is an event. It is not the beginning  of life; it is an event. And the miracle of life before birth is  nothing short of breathtaking.   The first baby pictures today, proudly shared and displayed, are,  most often, ultrasound photos, showing the baby alive and growing in  the womb. They are not of newborns--them, too, later. But the first  shot that we get to see of our kids and grandkids are while they are  still in utero.   The humanity of these children is beyond doubt, yet the pro-abortion  movement, like some kind of modern-day flat Earth society, continues to  cling to outdated, indefensible arguments cloaked in euphemism.  [[Page H708]]    Even the seemingly benign word ``choice'' withers under scrutiny.  Choice to do what? Dismember a baby, starve a child to death like RU486  does, and then forcibly expel her or him from the womb?   In order to facilitate the baby's extermination, the pro-abortionists  aggressively deny, and they profoundly disrespect, the unborn child.  They loudly mock and belittle those who defend a child's right to life.   Anybody in the pro-life movement knows what that mocking is like.  Frankly, that harsh criticism causes us to work even harder and,  hopefully, more effectively to try to protect these weakest and most  vulnerable among us.    Someday, I truly believe Americans will look back at America's  abortion culture, which has, again, killed, to date, about 62 million  babies, and wonder how such a seemingly compassionate and enlightened  society could have had that blind spot that could not see the innate  goodness and value, pricelessness, of that unborn child.   As   Steve Chabot said earlier today, we know that the women are the  co-victims. I and my wife and those of us in the pro-life movement do  work with postabortive women. We love them. We care for them.   Just yesterday, I met with two more women who are postabortive and  talked about the agony that they quietly dealt with for so long. There  are now many ministries that try to try to reach out to them to say: We  want you to have a better life, a life of reconciliation and hope. You  do not have to suffer alone. There are people who care for you.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris)  the cochairman of the Pro-Life Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Harris for his  extraordinarily eloquent remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the remainder of my time.                            ____________________
