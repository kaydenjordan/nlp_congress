 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.  Res. 1154 and call on all of my colleagues to denounce the dangerous  QAnon conspiracy theories.   Mr. Speaker, QAnon is a new front in an old war and relies on anti- Semitic tropes in order to spread the message. QAnon followers actually  believe that the world is controlled by a secret cabal of child  abusers, who will drink the blood of their victims. The FBI has linked  the group to domestic terror and considers it a continuing terrorist  threat.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Tom Malinowski for leading this. The kind of  messages that he is getting--very, very frightening. And I also thank  Denver Riggleman and all of the bipartisan sponsors of this  legislation.                                time  1030    Just last week, my subcommittee held a hearing on how social media  mainstreams extremism. When we heard from our witnesses, it was really  terrifying.   QAnon and other extremist groups have thrived for years on the  internet, recruiting members, promoting racism, dividing our  communities, and plotting actions of violence.   As people have suffered, Big Tech has prospered and profited.  Algorithms that amplify profits for platforms like Facebook, YouTube,  and Twitter also amplify extremism.   This week, Facebook announced a ban on ads that support QAnon. Good,  but it is far too little and far too late. Facebook users who are in  QAnon-associated groups will still be able to see extremist content,  just further down in their news feeds.   Moreover, Facebook groups promoting anti-Semitism have grown by 27  percent in the past week.  [[Page H5656]]    Congress needs to denounce right now this kind of hate rhetoric, and  Big Tech must be held accountable for profiting on this hate.   Before I close, I would like to also state my support for H. Res.  1153 and thank Pramila Jayapal for leading the effort and Speaker  Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer for their help on this resolution as  well.
