 Mr. Speaker, 242 years ago, our Founders gathered in  Philadelphia to launch an experiment in self-rule that has led to the  greatest country the Earth has ever seen. Our founding happened in the  time of history in which the understanding of the nature of the human  person and the source of the human person's rights reached a new level.   ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created  equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable  rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness''--God-given rights that no one can take away.   This is a transcendent principle that applies to all people for all  time. It is the fundamental principle on which Abraham Lincoln relied  as he fought to end slavery. The notion of God-given, unalienable  rights that no government or majority can take away is as true today as  it was in 1776 and 1861.   This Fourth of July, let us recommit to the principles of our  founding and continue to work to ensure that all Americans realize the  vision of our Founders. That, Mr. Speaker, is an idea that can lead to  greater unity in our country.                            ____________________
