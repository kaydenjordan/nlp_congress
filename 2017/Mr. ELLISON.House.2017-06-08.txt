 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Since Dodd-Frank's passage, the economy has created over 16 million  jobs over 85 consecutive months. Business lending has increased 75  percent. Banks, large and small, are posting all-time record profits,  community banks are outperforming larger banks, and credit unions are  expanding their membership. And because of the work of the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, 29 million people have seen $12 billion  back into their pocket and not into those of improper and illegal  practicing financial services firms.   Do you want to know why we have the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act before us  today?   Because they want the money. Not the $12 billion that went back to  the 29 million veterans and farmers and students and citizens and  people who need that kind of help for their families. They want that  money going back to the big financial interests.   And that is the purpose of the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act. It is between  the many and the money, and the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act stands firmly on  the side of those who would line their pockets in the top 1 percent.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   One of the elements of the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act that is particularly  troublesome to me--and there are many--has to do with the ``Wrong''  CHOICE Act repealing section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street  Reform and Consumer Protection Act.   Now, people watching this debate, Mr. Chair, might find that to be  just legislative talk, but it is substantively, really important.  Section 953(b) was a hard-fought victory for investors, consumers,  workers, and the general public. Mr. Chair, the law requires that  publicly traded firms disclose the ratio between what they pay their  CEO and what they pay their median worker.   I think this is important information. A CEO of an S&P 500 company  makes, on average, about $331 for every $1 a typical rank-and-file  worker makes. In some companies, this ratio can reach as high as  $1,000-to-$1. Investors should be able to consider if a CEO provides  hundreds of times more value to their employees before investing in a  firm. Actually, exorbitant CEO pay, excessive CEO pay, can impact  dividends. It can impact all kinds of decisions, lead to risk taking,  and it is a good idea for investors and the general public to know that  information.   So while executives are making critical decisions about the direction  of their companies, quality employees ensure those decisions are being  properly implemented.   This pay ratio information benefits investors by giving them valuable  information for ascertaining whether or not a company's employees are  being treated fairly and, therefore, able to retain employees; whether  or not it is a stable company, and a company that values its people.   The ratio helps them to decide how to cast their say-on-pay advisory  votes on executive compensation. And research shows that the higher the  CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio, the more likely the CEO is to pursue  the kind of risky investments that brought the global financial crisis  to bear.   Institute for Policy Studies found that nearly 40 percent of the CEOs  on their top 25 highest paid list over a 20-year period wound up being  fired, sought a bailout, or were forced to pay fraud-related fines.   Moreover, a lower ratio of CEO-to-median-worker pay, implies more  investment in human capital, and a longer-term outlook on the  corporation.   According to the Center for Audit Quality's annual investor survey,  46 percent of investors say they consider CEO compensation in their  decisionmaking.   The current culture of paying CEOs hundreds of times--and even  thousands in some limited cases--more than typical employees hurts  working families, is detrimental to employee morale, and goes against  the research which shows us what is best practice.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, does it make sense that, after 8 years of a piece of  regulation, Dodd-Frank, that has brought us increases in GDP, increases  in jobs, and stability in financial markets, that we would now repeal  that piece of legislation to go back to a time when we saw that  deregulation strategy bring us the Great Recession?   It just doesn't make any sense to take the position that what we need  is more wide open, Wild West, you are on your own kind of financial  rules and laws in our country.   The fact is, before Dodd-Frank was passed, we had an abysmal consumer  protection system. We really had seven or eight different agencies that  were sort of responsible, but not really. Consumer protection was not a  priority of the Federal Government. And as a result of it, we saw a  proliferation of mortgages that got people who really couldn't handle  that particular mortgage that they got, or the products were just  fraudulent, get into a situation where they ended up going into  foreclosure.   We saw the secondary market package up some of these bad mortgages.  We saw rating agencies say that these were good equity products, and  when these products started to fail, what we saw is that those big  banks that trafficked in those equities get bailed out, and we saw  citizens lose their homes.   The fact is, going back to those bad old days is just a bad idea--to  bring us back to a time when we didn't have any consumer protection,  when we didn't have any responsibility placed on the shoulders of  management, when we didn't say that we were going to look after these  rating agencies, and we didn't say that these systemically important  large institutions were going to get a little bit more scrutiny.   Before the time that we did that, we saw ruin in the economy. Let me  just remind the American people: we had many States with unemployment  above 10 percent because of the deregulation, laissez-faire attitude  that prevailed in the American financial services legal system.   Those bad old days nearly ruined so many families, and they are just  now starting to recover. But under Dodd-Frank, we have seen month after  month of private sector job growth. We have seen economic activity  increase. Fast enough for me? No. I think we need much more.   But with over $170 billion in record profits from 2016, I can tell  you one thing: this claim on the other side that the banks and  financial services sector is being crushed simply isn't a true  statement. It is just not right.   Business lending is up 75 percent since Dodd-Frank. Data from the  Federal Reserve shows aggregate bank lending has increased from about  $1.2 trillion, in 2010, to $2 trillion in outstanding business loans.  Vote ``no'' on the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment, which was filed late,  should be viewed as the first admission by the Republicans that H.R. 10  would be bad for our financial markets and our economy.   The amendment recognizes that it would be inappropriate for Members  of Congress to attend nonpublic meetings of the council charged with  reviewing sensitive financial information and discussing potential  threats to our economy.   I agree with the sponsor that this was one of many harmful provisions  in the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act.   Here are a few more: the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act eliminates the Office  of Financial Research, which is tasked with studying emerging risks to  our economy and informing the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  The ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act stops the council from taking actions to  prevent firms like AIG from threatening our economy. The ``Wrong''  CHOICE Act allows banks to choose the regulatory system that best suits  their bottom line, even if doing so is bad for the economy and  taxpayers.   Mr. Chairman, the amendment also recognizes the dangers of subjecting  our independent financial regulators to the partisan appropriations  process, by restoring the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's and  the National Credit Union Administration's independent funding when it  comes to their responsibilities for unwinding failed banks and credit  unions.   I agree, this is important, but do you know what is also important  and needing to be independent?   The authority to supervise those entities before they fail.   The bank and credit union regulators, including the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, have important yet sensitive  responsibilities to make sure that financial institutions follow rules  that are good for the economy, good for consumers, but which some  institutions would rather ignore.   Subjecting these decisions to the appropriations process will result  in fewer cops on the beat, weaker guardrails, and a greater likelihood  of financial catastrophe.   We have seen this happen before. One of the reasons for the failure  of the housing giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, was that they had a  woefully underfunded regulator without independent funding.   Democrats fixed this when we created the independently funded Federal  Housing Finance Agency in 2008. Since then, this agency has  successfully made tough decisions to right both GSEs by putting them  into conservatorship and cleaning up their businesses.   Ignoring this success and history, H.R. 10 would once again strip  away the independent funding of the GSE's regulator, as it would for  all of the financial regulators.   I am pleased that this amendment has recognized the problems taking  away independent funding for our regulators, but, unfortunately, it  doesn't go far enough. I oppose this amendment and I urge my colleagues  to reject it and the entire ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the late poet Maya Angelou had a saying:  ``When people show you who they really are, believe them.''    So when the chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association leads  a pep rally before 1,500 bankers, we should pay attention. He probably  means what he is saying.   In March, he told ABA members about all the opportunities for banking  with a Republican Congress, he crowed: ``I don't want a seat at the  table. I want the table.''   If we read this bill, we know what it looks like to give the  financial services sector the whole table. We know they want the whole  table.   H.R. 10 is clever at undermining financial regulators, emboldening  Wall Street, and making it incredibly easy to delay regulators at every  step of the rulemaking process.   It is important for the people of America to understand that when  Republicans say they want to kill regulations, usually what they are  talking about is safety regulations, regulations that make the water  clean, the meat safe, and that financial product that you just bought  not blow up in your face. They don't like regulations because  regulations mean that the people who control some of these products  can't just do whatever they want to do.   But for the people in the United States, you should know that  financial regulators are going to keep money in your pocket, they are  going to stop people with way more resources than you have from picking  your pocket.   That is why we oppose this amendment. I think it is particularly  important for people to realize that the rhetoric that we use  denigrating regulation all the time is the same regulation that  protects us, and that includes in the financial services sector.   Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition.    Mr. Chair, the Hollingsworth amendment seeks to insert a  totally new and unvetted set of exemptions from the security laws for  closed-end funds. These are the type of pooled investment vehicles that  typically issue a fixed number of shares that, unlike mutual funds, are  not redeemable on a daily basis by the fund, making them harder for  investors to sell.   The Financial Services Committee has had no hearings, no markups, no  debate on these issues until now. Perhaps that is why the amendment has  been mislabeled as only benefiting closed-end funds traded on an  exchange with well-known seasoned issuer status.   In fact, the amendment is much broader, as it would allow even  illiquid, nontraded funds to claim multiple exemptions. This effort  would make it harder for the Securities and Exchange Commission, or  SEC, to police these products for investors.   This last-minute, partisan approach is not the way that Congress  should proceed in making laws, but it is consistent with this bill.  Although Democrats conducted 41 hearings to develop Dodd-Frank,  Republicans planned only 1 hearing on this bill. It is not surprising,  then, that the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act is a 600-page bill chock-full of  bad partisan ideas and special interest wish lists that will harm our  Nation's investors, consumers, and taxpayers.   For example, the bill would severely undermine the ability of the  SEC, our Wall Street cop on the beat, to protect investors and hold bad  actors accountable. Specifically, it would remove valuable law  enforcement tools, burden the SEC with onerous cost-benefit analysis,  and generate more and more endless litigation, tying the agency up.   Worse, the bill repeals the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule and  effectively prevents the DOL or the SEC from ever moving forward to  protect our Nation's investors and seniors from conflicted advice by  unscrupulous financial advisers.   I will say, most financial advisers are not unscrupulous, but for the  ones that are, there needs to be authority in the law to stop them. We  need the fiduciary rule. The ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act takes it away.   But this should come as no surprise, since the Republicans in  Congress have been relentless in their opposition to the DOL's  commonsense requirement that financial advisers put their clients'  interests ahead of their own when providing investment advice about  retirement products.   Their extreme partisan efforts to kill the fiduciary rule ignore the  facts that 9 in 10 Americans reportedly agree with the rule. An  overwhelming majority--65 percent--of Americans who voted for President  Trump appear to support the regulation.   Tellingly, just last week, after robust bipartisan debate, the  Republican Governor of Nevada signed into law a bill requiring  financial advisers to act in their clients' best interests.   The ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act continues this partisan slant by also  rolling back bipartisan efforts from this and past Congresses to craft  legislation that helps grow small business and protect investors.   Mr. Chair, we owe it to our constituents and the American people to  work together to address real problems with real solutions that are  thoroughly vetted. For that reason, I must oppose this bill and this  amendment.   I will add, my colleague on other side of the aisle, Mr. Chairman,  said: Where is our bill? That would be Dodd-Frank.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we have discussed business development  [[Page H4793]]  funds. We have not talked about closed-end funds in committee. This  amendment introduces a new idea which has not been debated. For that  reason alone, we should vote it down.   We have got to have regular order around here. This is a complicated  issue. All the avenues and all the different perspectives that need to  be brought to bear should be done in committee, not right here.   Mr. Chairman, for those reasons alone, I would ask for a strong  ``no'' vote on this particular amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I believe that there might be some merit  to this amendment, but I still claim time in opposition.   Because it wasn't brought up in committee, I think that there is a  lot of hashing out of this particular amendment that could have  happened and we might have been able to agree, but at this point in the  process I have to claim time in opposition and I will explain why. I  will say that, if we can work on it later, we will see what happens,  but as now for now, we are urging a strong ``no.''   I think the amendment is well-intentioned because it purports to  address the growing problem of identity theft, something we all need to  be concerned about. However, I am concerned that it may make it harder  for some consumers who want to obtain their own reports, particularly  those using the website annualcreditreport.com, to access their free  annual consumer reports from nationwide credit reporting agencies, or  CRAs.   Also, the amendment purports to combat identity theft, but solely  focuses on tougher authentication requirements for consumers who want  to access their own files, not on all users who have access to consumer  reports like landlords or employers. I think that is a weakness.   The website annualcreditreport.com and reports maintained by the big  three require consumers to provide personally identifiable information  and to successfully answer several questions about information on the  consumer files before giving them access to reports online.   In a 2017 report, the Consumer Bureau noted that credit reporting  complaints are consistently among the top three types of consumer  complaints it handles. When consumers are denied online access, they  have to mail copies of sensitive identifying documents in order to  obtain their reports, which consumers note is time consuming as well as  potentially not secure. This amendment could make that situation even  worse.    I also find it a little confusing that the House is considering this  amendment to a bill that will hamstring the only Federal agency, the  Consumer Bureau, that has rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement  authority over most consumer reporting agencies and has actually  addressed many credit reporting problems.   If Members support this amendment, then it simply does not make sense  to me for the same Members to support H.R. 10, which will gut the  Consumer Bureau's capacity to effectively address problems like  identity theft.   Before Dodd-Frank, the Federal Trade Commission was the only Federal  agency with enforcement authority over the CRAs, but there was no  entity with supervising authority. Dodd-Frank closed that gap by giving  the Consumer Bureau the supervisory power to monitor CRAs' operations.   Just this year, through the good work of the Consumer Bureau's  examiners, the Consumer Bureau issued enforcement orders against all of  the big three CRAs for misleading practices that harm consumers.   I urge colleagues to oppose the amendment and reject the ``Wrong''  [[Page H4794]]  CHOICE Act. I hope next time we can talk about this legislation before  it gets to the floor. That would be better and more proper.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to talk about an issue  somewhat related that is critical in this debate and would go a long  way toward improving our economy and the chances of consumers.   I have a bill, H.R. 435, the Credit Access and Inclusion Act. My  amendment would help solve problems the Financial Services Committee  has been discussing for more than a decade. This is not an amendment  that I have submitted for disposition today, but I would like to bring  to the attention of the body that this Credit Access and Inclusion Act  was good legislation and should be taken up. It would address a problem  of access to credit that the leader of this bill says he wants to  solve.   My bill would allow utility, telecom, public and Section 8 housing  residents to build a credit score without debt. It provides affirmative  permission for utility, telecom, and housing providers to report on- time payment information to credit reporting agencies.   I have introduced this bill in four consecutive Congresses. I  introduced this bill with Mr. Pittenger as a lead. It has the support  of many members of the committee, including Representatives Maloney,  Duffy, Green, Stivers, Meeks, Love, Capuano, and more, a truly  bipartisan piece of legislation.   Why am I committed to passing the bill? Because 1 in 10 Americans do  not have a credit score. These 26 million people are credit invisible,  and they can have trouble getting an apartment and might pay more for  insurance, and they will have a very hard time qualifying for a loan to  buy a car or a home. Another 19 million are not scorable because there  is too little information in their files. One in four African Americans  and one in four Latinos are credit invisible and not scorable.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is another example of  Republicans choosing to prioritize the interests of corporate insiders  over consumers, which is what the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act really  symbolizes. We should not prevent regulators from addressing potential  conflicts of interest but, instead, let all shareholders have their  voice be heard.   While Democrats stand ready to work on targeted reforms to help  responsible community banks and credit unions, we will reject any  ideological legislation that puts our financial system and economy at  risk of another crash and that gives a leg up to Wall Street and  predatory lenders to rip off consumers all over again.   Republicans like to pretend that Wall Street reform destroyed our  financial system and economy, but the alternative facts have no basis  in reality. Thanks to Wall Street reform and other Democratic policies,  our economy has made significant gains since the depths of the  financial crisis.   Since Dodd-Frank became law, we have set a record, with 86  consecutive months of private sector job growth, during which the  economy created more than 16 million private sector jobs. Let me assure  you, much more work needs to be done, but this record is important and  must be noted.   Financial institutions are thriving since the passage of Dodd-Frank.  According to the FDIC, banks are posting record profits since the  crisis. Profits for community banks increased more than 10 percent in  the past year. In 2010, the banking industry set an all-time record  with $171 billion in profits. Business lending has increased 75 percent  since Dodd-Frank became law. Credit union membership has expanded by  more than 16 million members since 2010, an increase of 18 percent.   This has happened in part because we have a system that is fairer,  because bad actors are held accountable. The highly successful Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau was established and has returned nearly $12  billion to 29 million consumers who were ripped off by unfair,  deceptive, and abusive practices of bad actors. This tough consumer  enforcement approach has put the entire financial industry on notice to  follow the law and treat their consumers fairly or suffer the  consequences.   So the economy is doing well, financial institutions are doing well,  and consumers are finally being protected. The last thing we should do  is go back to a failed, weak regulatory model that gave us bank  bailouts and the Great Recession. But that is what the Republicans are  offering the American people with this bill.   I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and the ``Wrong''  CHOICE Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the minority leader.    Mr. Chair, I don't know if it was the last time, but one  of the many times that we listened to Nancy Pelosi, we passed the Dodd- Frank Act, which protected consumers to the tune of 29 million of them  to return $11.5 billion to $12 billion back to their families. I think  that Nancy Pelosi has a pretty good record of helping out consumers. I  think consumers of America would appreciate $11.5 billion returned to  their family budgets.    The last time we listened to Nancy Pelosi, we saw a Dodd-Frank which  has stabilized markets, which gave us 85 consecutive months of private  sector job growth.   But the last time we heard from these free-market, Ayn Randian  conservatives, oh, boy, these guys ran the economy straight into the  ditch with their deregulatory schemes and their hostility to any kind  of regulation on Big Business.   We saw unemployment rates well north of 10 percent in many parts of  this country; we saw home values plummet; and we saw mass foreclosures,  all because of the failed Ayn Randian, free-market fundamentalist  attitudes that we see so often on the other side of the aisle.   I will just note to my freshman friend that the minority leader can  talk as long as she wants. You might want to check the rules on that  one.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, let me recognize that the problem that  Representative McSally is trying to address here is a legitimate  problem that we think needs to be focused on.   I must oppose it because it is inadequate and simply not enough. It  would be good if we could get together and try to come up with a  bipartisan solution to this problem that she has, I think, identified  as a legitimate issue.   But ensuring that legitimate financial transactions move freely and  globally, particularly key remittance channels for vulnerable  populations, is a subject of great importance and one on which I and my  Democratic colleagues remain focused.   Many of us represent districts with significant immigrant populations  from Central and South America, the Caribbean, Africa, all across the  globe. We have heard just how critical it is for immigrants here in the  United States to be able to send money that sustain their loved ones  back home.   While I am pleased that there is a bipartisan recognition about the  need to preserve critical remittance channels for legitimate  transactions, I must say that I am deeply concerned by some of the  rhetoric and proposals that we have seen from the Trump administration,  which make me fear that access to remittances, particularly for  vulnerable populations, may be in jeopardy.   Not only has the President been overtly anti-immigrant in his  rhetoric during the 2016 campaign and since, he put out an alarming  proposal about how he would force Mexico to pay for a wall on our  Southern border. He proposed cutting off access to remittance transfers  for anyone who couldn't document their immigration status until Mexico  agreed to pay an extortion payment of between $5 billion and $10  billion.   I also note that while it is essential that legitimate financial  transactions move freely and globally, it is equally important that  illegitimate and illicit transactions do not.   For this reason, I am concerned that the amendment before us falls  short in that it fails to call the administration to disclose how it  plans to curtail the flow of illicit funds, particularly funds which  may be coming from key adversaries like the Russian Federation.   One doesn't have to look far to see that, despite record fines and  numerous enforcement actions, global megabanks have continued to  facilitate shady transactions even when such transactions are highly  suspicious, have no economic rationale, and even likely involve money  laundering and tax evasion.   One example of concern, Deutsche Bank, which operates in the U.S. and  around the globe, was found by the Federal Reserve, New York State, and  the United Kingdom to have facilitated a massive fraudulent trading  scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia to unknown  locales.                                time  1545    In order to better understand the scheme, I recently joined with a  number of my colleagues in writing to the Treasury Secretary to ask for  any and all records of suspicious activity related to Deutsche Bank's  2011 scheme in the Department's possession, including the names and  identities of all parties who participated in, or benefited from, the  scheme.   But, like much of the oversight Democrats are conducting on this  administration, this request has apparently fallen on deaf ears.   So, again, I do appreciate the intent of the amendment--I even  commend Representative McSally for identifying this is an important  issue--it should have gone further in demanding that this  administration disclose how it will curtail well-known schemes being  used to facilitate fraud. So I must urge a ``no'' vote, but I look  forward to working with Representative McSally on this important issue.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, as if the CHOICE Act was not bad enough,  this amendment piles on to the Republicans' misguided attacks on the  highly successful Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   I don't understand why my Republican friends don't get--29 million  people got $11.5 billion of their money back because unscrupulous  financial services firms unlawfully took their money. I would think we  could get together on that. I would think we could agree that that is  an important thing to work on. And now we are trying to mess with their  building, for the sake of the children, no less.   The Bureau's inspector general conducted a thorough investigation of  the Republican's made-up suggestion that the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau's building renovations were inappropriate.   The inspector general released an audit back in 2015, that stated:         We determined that construction costs appear reasonable       based on comparisons to an independent cost estimate and the       costs of two comparable building renovations identified by       the U.S. General Services Administration. We also determined       that potential renovation costs are below the amount       previously budgeted and obligated for the renovation. . . .       Current controls for approving, managing, and documenting       renovation costs and project decisions are designed       appropriately. . . .    May we put this issue to bed that there is some nefarious plot going  on with the building? It wasn't legitimate when they first raised it.  It is not legitimate now. And trying to bring a big deal up about their  building, which is an issue that has been resolved, is not going to  benefit the children of tomorrow. I think it will benefit the children  for those 29 million families to get $12 billion back. Now, that might  help some kids. That might pay for some lunches, some school fees, and  a whole bunch of other things to help families. But just messing with  the CFPB over their building will not help anyone.   Even if the House Republicans are not willing to thank the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau for all it has done, I am.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been a tough independent  watchdog, has done a great job on behalf of American consumers, and has  done a great job for American financial firms which do honest work.  Imagine, Mr. Chairman, being a financial services firm that is actually  selling a good product at a fair price and you have somebody down the  street cutting corners, ripping off consumers, and you are losing your  competitive advantage because you are honest. The Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau helps keep good financial firms good and not create  this pervasive sentence to drag them in the wrong direction.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau maintains a transparent  database that has collected over 1.1 million consumer complaints about  financial institutions, and 97 percent of those have received a timely  response.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has demystified financial  transactions by requiring simple know-before-you-owe disclosures, and  providing educational and comparison shopping tools so that consumers  are empowered to make the right choice for them and their families.   Perhaps one of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's most  notable accomplishments to date was its investigation of Wells Fargo's  fraudulent account scandal. Let me tell you, Wells Fargo's fraudulent  account scandal definitely hurt families and kids in those families,  and the CFPB's good work helped those families.   Last September, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Wells  Fargo $100 million for secretly opening up 2 million unauthorized  accounts on behalf of its consumers and ordered the bank to compensate  customers it harmed. This marks the largest penalty the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau has imposed to date. And that, Mr.  Chairman, has helped families and children.   I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, to stop the petty  stuff about the building. This has been reviewed by independent people.  It is really just a waste of time.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
