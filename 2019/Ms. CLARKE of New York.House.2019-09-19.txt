 Mr. Speaker, I hold in my hand several  letters received from my constituents in Brooklyn, New York, New York  teens who, like me, are disgusted by the ongoing injustice and inhumane  treatment of Brown and Black children who are being held in detention  centers at the southern border of our Nation.   I will read one letter from Charlee, who is 16 years old, living in  New York City:   ``To my fellow teens,   ``After hearing about your situation, I am sorry our country doesn't  welcome you with open arms.   ``Trust that not everywhere is like this . . . America can be  accepting and supportive.   ``I hope you'll be released and allowed to become part of a family.   ``I hope you'll get to see the better places of this country.   ``You deserve to live freely and safely. I wish you luck.   ``Believe that your future will be better and someday these detention  centers will be shut down.''   She is right. We must shut down these inhumane detention centers. We  must put an end to the irreparable mental and physical damage being  done to our most vulnerable in the United States. We must reunite these  families, and we must stand on the right side of history.                            ____________________
