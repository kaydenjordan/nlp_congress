 Mr. Speaker, the latest proposal offered by my Democrat  colleagues to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour  nationally is going to be devastating to small businesses and  especially to jobs. A 107 percent increase is not going to create more  jobs. It might sound nice on the surface, but it will be very harmful.   There is this myth that a large segment of Americans earn at or below  the minimum wage, but, in reality, it is only 2.3 percent; and half of  them are below the age of 25 who need these entry-level jobs to learn a  skill, to learn to show up every day, to be on time, and to grow from  there. Increasing it to $15 an hour nationally would cause small  companies to pass on higher prices to consumers, likely driving  consumers away, and for a small business' little profit margin already,  potentially forcing them to close their doors.   I visited a restaurant in my district that had two locations, and  they have already closed one. They are afraid, as California is already  on the track at $12 and higher, how much longer they can keep their  businesses open because of the huge cost of labor as a percentage of  their business.   So let's get on the right track and do the things that support job  growth and the success we have had the last couple of years after the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and not go down this path.                            ____________________
