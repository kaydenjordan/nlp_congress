 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 5, I call up  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 3) expressing the sense of  Congress condemning the recent attacks on pro-life facilities, groups,  and churches, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 3.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the FACE Act prohibits threats of force, obstruction,  and property damage intended to interfere with reproductive healthcare  services. Let me just go over that again. It prohibits threats of  force, obstruction, and property damage intended to interfere with  reproductive healthcare services.   The Justice Department has said that this act is not just about  abortions but applies, as well, as to ``pro-life pregnancy counseling  services and other pregnancy support facilities providing reproductive  healthcare.''   So it applies across the board.   Here is the problem. On May 8, 2022, Mother's Day, activists targeted  a pro-life, nonprofit center in Madison, Wisconsin, setting it ablaze  and vandalizing it with the words, ``If abortions aren't safe then you  aren't either.''   On June 3, 2022, leftwing anti-life activists targeted the Capitol  Hill Crisis Pregnancy Center throwing red paint on the door, eggs at  the window, and spray painting the window with, ``Jane says revenge.''   On June 25, 2022, in Longmont, Colorado, vandals graffitied and set  fire--set fire--to the Life Choices free pregnancy center.   This has happened dozens and dozens and dozens of times all across  the country.   What has the Justice Department done?   To my knowledge, no one has been prosecuted on the FACE Act--not one  single person, to my knowledge.   But, oh, Madam Speaker, if you are a pro-life activist and you are  praying outside an abortion clinic, like Mark Houck, then guess what  happens to you?   The FBI kicks in your door, arrests you, puts you in handcuffs, and  does it in front of your wife and seven children. That is what happens.   Madam Speaker, we don't want violence anywhere. As Mr. Cicilline said  in his 1-minute speech, we don't want any violence anywhere. But let's  not have this double standard.   Not to mention this: Think about what happened after the Dobbs  decision was leaked, the leak draft of that opinion; we had activists  protesting at every Supreme--well, not every one because only the  conservative Justices' names were doxed, and information put out there.  We had protests at their homes. In direct violation of the statute 18  U.S.C. 1507: You are not supposed to be protesting and interfering when  a decision is pending in front of a Supreme Court Justice's home.   This was a direct violation of the statute, and, again, nothing  happened.   That situation, as we all know, got real serious. It got real serious  with the assassination attempt on Justice Kavanaugh.   So this resolution is straightforward.   What has happened literally now at hundreds of crisis pregnancy  centers and churches around the country this past year is just flat-out  wrong. This is a resolution that says that we appreciate the good work  that happens at crisis pregnancy centers where they take in women and  where they help them and help that unborn child and make sure that that  unborn child gets to experience the gift of life.   The sanctity of life is what this is all about.   I commend my colleague and friend, Mr. Johnson, from the great State  of Louisiana for this resolution and the people across the country who  volunteer and who work every day at these centers to help these ladies  who are in a tough situation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   What purpose? It says it right in the title: ``Expressing the sense  of Congress condemning the recent attacks on pro-life facilities,  groups, and churches.''   Over 100 churches and pro-life facilities have been attacked in the  last 7 months. That is all this resolution does.   Republicans condemn violence every time it happens. We condemn it  when it happens to abortion clinics. We condemn it when it happens to  churches. We condemn it when it happens to pro-life centers. We  condemned it when it happened in the summer of 2020 all over the  country. We condemned it when it happened on January 6. We condemn it  every single time.   This is just highlighting what has happened in the last 7 months with  churches and pro-life centers around the country. It is that simple.  This should be unanimous.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson), my friend and the sponsor of this great legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I point out to my friend from Tennessee that it is not that I believe  the DOJ has the ability to use the FACE Act to prosecute people who  vandalize and attack crisis pregnancy centers; they have said it. The  Department of Justice says they can do that. I am just asking why they  haven't.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Carl), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Guest).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  great State of Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), a pro-life leader and good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. Greene).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Buck).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Madam Speaker, I just want to read what the resolution says: That  Congress condemns recent attacks, over 100 of them in the last 7  months, on pro-life pregnancy centers and churches; condemns recent  attacks of vandalism, violence, and destruction against pro-life  facilities, groups, and churches.   Second, it recognizes the sanctity of life, the important role pro- life facilities, groups, and churches play in supporting pregnant  women, infants, and families.   Three, it calls upon the Biden administration to use all appropriate  law enforcement authorities to uphold public safety and protect the  rights of pro-life facilities, groups, and churches.   That is all it says. This is as apple pie as it gets. The hundreds of  churches and crisis pregnancy centers that have been attacked in the  last 7 months, this resolution says: Biden administration, use the FACE  Act, which you have said applies not just to pro-abortion clinics but  also to pro-life crisis pregnancy centers, use that to make sure we can  stop this stuff from happening in the future.   We condemn all violence every time it happens. Here is what is  interesting: The violence that has been cited by the other side against  abortion clinics and people associated with them, guess what? Those  individuals were prosecuted, and we support that.   What we want to know is why. With over 100 attacks, why hasn't the  Justice Department, to my knowledge, used the FACE Act to prosecute  anybody? Why?   They say there is no political nature at the Justice Department now;  there is no weaponization. Really? Because it sure looks like there is  a conflict here. Sure looks like there is a double standard here. This  resolution is as basic as it gets.   Madam Speaker, I urge support, hope this thing passes unanimously,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 5, I call up  the bill (H.R. 26) to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit a  health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of  care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted  abortion, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to enter extraneous materials on H.R. 26.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 26, the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act. In simple terms: Life is precious, life is  sacred, all life, including unborn children, but that is not what this  legislation is about.   This legislation is about those kids who are born alive making sure  they get protected. For over 40 years, the decision in Roe v. Wade, as  Justice Alito has stated, inflamed debate and deepened division over  the issue of abortion in this country.   We have seen that play out over the last year, but what should be  undisputed is the care of a child who is born alive after an attempted  abortion.   Unfortunately, as evidenced by comments from prominent Democrats, not  everyone believes that a child born alive should be protected.   We all know in 2019, then-Governor Northam of the State of Virginia  stated this: The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept  comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that is what the  mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue  between the physicians and the mother.   Think about that. It is not just anybody saying that. It is the  Governor of one of our largest States. The cavalier  [[Page H179]]  attitude he displayed toward human life is just wrong.   H.R. 26 would require healthcare practitioners to give the same level  of care to a child born alive after an abortion or an attempted  abortion as the child at that same gestational age. Work to save the  kid's life, work to help that newborn. It would also require the  immediate transfer of the surviving infant to a hospital.   This legislation requires healthcare practitioners or other employees  to report any violations of this provision to State or Federal law  enforcement for criminal prosecution.   In addition, H.R. 26 provides the mother of an abortion survivor with  a civil right of action against the healthcare practitioner who fails  to provide the required level of care.   It is simple. Infants born alive following an abortion are kids. They  are children. All newborns deserve the same level of care.   In the Declaration of Independence, our Founding Fathers declared  that it was life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that are the  unalienable rights bestowed on us by our Creator.   Congress has a duty to protect these fundamental rights. This should  be an easy vote for all Members.   I thank my colleagues, Representatives Ann Wagner and Kat Cammack,  for their diligent work on this legislation, and I urge all Members to  support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Madam Speaker, I point out this bill has passed multiple  times in previous Congresses, the exact same language, and it has  passed with bipartisan support.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from the State of  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the sponsor of the legislation who has worked  tirelessly on this good piece of legislation.    Madam Speaker, I would point out, the minority leader  said their position is Roe v. Wade. Their position is real simple and  it is real radical. Their position is you should be able to take the  life of an unborn child right up until their birthday, and then as  Governor Northam has said, even after their birthday. That is what this  bill seeks to stop and to make sure that it doesn't happen.   That is as radical as you can get, taking the life of unborn children  right up to their birth day. And then, as Governor Northam pointed out,  even after that. We want to make sure that ``even after that'' part  never happens because we believe life is precious and life is sacred.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Cammack), one of the cosponsors of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Van Orden).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Houchin) for her first speech on the House floor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith) a longtime champion of the pro-life cause.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  the great State of Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I will say that the document that launched this experiment in freedom  we call America, the Declaration of Independence, talks about all are  created equal, endowed by our creator with life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness. I think it is interesting the order in which the  Founders placed the rights they chose to mention: life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness.   You can't pursue happiness; you can't chase down your goals and  dreams if you first don't have freedom. You don't have freedom and true  liberty unless government protects your most fundamental right: your  right to live, your right to breathe, your right to life.   That is what this legislation is about, protecting the most innocent,  the most vulnerable's right to life.   I urge a ``yes'' vote and hope this thing passes unanimously. Madam  Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
