 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  724, which would rescind President Trump's unconstitutional Muslim ban  that led to a Stanford University graduate student who has lived in the  United States since 1993 getting handcuffed and then detained at JFK  airport for 5 hours.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
