 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Jeffries for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we have long encountered excuses as to why we can't  tackle bias, discrimination, and racism in America, excuses that have  prevented equality in healthcare, in the classroom, housing, in the  workplace, and, yes, in the way police interact with communities they  have sworn to protect.  [[Page H2485]]    That approach has led to a deadly reality where Black lives are equal  on paper, but not in real life.   We know this because the data show it. The data show that Black  Americans are more likely to die during a trip to the hospital and more  likely to be killed, while unarmed, by the police.   We know this because George Floyd should be alive today; so should  Breonna Taylor, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, and so many others.   The Justice in Policing Act would have prevented their deaths, and it  is long overdue. We owe it to them and to every Black American to make  this bill law. Then we must get to work fixing the injustice that has  persisted in our country for centuries so that we can create a more  inclusive, truly equal, and just America for everyone to call home.
