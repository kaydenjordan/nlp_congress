 Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the lifetime of  public service of Meredith ``Merrie'' Roosa Inderfurth.   After graduating from Brown University, Merrie came to Washington to  earn an MPA at George Washington University, and she never left.   Merrie joined the congressional staff of Representative Lindy Boggs,  whose late husband, then-Majority Leader Hale Boggs, led the creation  of the National Flood Insurance Program, cementing Merrie's interest in  flood management.   During her 15 years with Representative Boggs, Merrie took time to  have two extraordinary daughters, one of whom is my deputy chief of  staff and essential to my office. Her sister is a respected prosecutor  in nearby Montgomery County. Her stepdaughter is a highly qualified  medical professional.   Merrie then returned to public life and made use of her flood  pedigree, serving for almost 30 years as the Washington liaison for the  Association of State Floodplain Managers and the National Flood  Association.   In 2007, she was the recipient of the association's highest honor,  the Goddard-White Award for outstanding leadership and guidance on  flood policy issues.   I express my sincere appreciation for the career in public service of  my friend, Merrie Inderfurth.                            ____________________
