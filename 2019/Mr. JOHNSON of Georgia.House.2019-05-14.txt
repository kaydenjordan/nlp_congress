 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2379) to reauthorize the Bulletproof Vest  Partnership Grant Program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2379         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT PROGRAM                     REAUTHORIZATION.         (a) In General.--Section 1001(a)(23) of title I of the       Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C.       10261(a)(23)) is amended by striking ``part Y'' and all that       follows and inserting ``part Y, $30,000,000 for fiscal year       2020, and each fiscal year thereafter.''.        (b) Program Name.--Part Y of title I of the Omnibus Crime       Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10531 et       seq.) is amended by inserting before section 2501 the       following:       ``SEC. 2500. PATRICK LEAHY BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT                     PROGRAM.         ``The program under this part shall be known as the       `Patrick Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant       Program'.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program stands as a shining  example of the public safety collaboration between Congress and local  governments to improve public safety and protect the officers who  protect us.   In the 20 years that the program has been in existence, Congress has  allocated funds that have enabled local law enforcement agencies to  purchase more than 1.3 million bulletproof vests. Through this program,  thousands of officers have survived what would otherwise have been  deadly shootings.   Without the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program, local  jurisdictions that lack the financial means to purchase vests would  simply be unable to do so.   As reauthorized under H.R. 2379, the program would give priority to  small jurisdictions that apply for assistance. Those that most need the  Federal support will continue to have priority.   An often-overlooked element of the program is the supporting role the  National Institute of Justice plays in providing expert analysis on the  quality and life expectancy of bulletproof vests, ensuring that  officers who patrol our streets every day and every night wear vests  that will give them the measure of safety that they deserve.  Importantly, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program has worked  in recent years to ensure the vests that female officers are issued fit  properly and provide the same protection as the vests that male  officers are issued.   With H.R. 2379, the House today takes a crucial step toward ending an  uncertainty concerning the future of the program by permanently  authorizing its funding at $30 million per year.   It is fitting that we consider this important legislation at the  start of National Police Week, which honors those who serve and have  paid the ultimate price and sacrifice in protecting our communities.   Since President John F. Kennedy first signed the proclamation  designating National Peace Officers Memorial Day in 1962, officers and  citizens assemble in our Nation's Capital during Police Week to thank  law enforcement officers for their service, dedication, and commitment.   It is in that spirit that we seek to reauthorize the Bulletproof Vest  Partnership Grant Program. It is also fitting that this bill names the  program in honor of the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Patrick  Leahy, who played a critical role in conceiving it and who has been a  consistent champion of its continuation and, now, its permanent  reauthorization.   I thank Senator Leahy for his leadership.   I would be remiss if I were not to recognize the tireless efforts of  the author of H.R. 2379, my good friend Congressman Bill Pascrell, who  has worked diligently to bring this bipartisan bill to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill that will help protect those  who put their lives on the line to protect us. I urge my colleagues to  support it today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New  Jersey an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   This could not be a more solemn moment than what my friend from  Georgia just expressed to the Nation about our State and local law  enforcement personnel, male, female, Black, White, Latino, Asian, this  legislation is an effort to protect them.   And I will note that there have not been just one, but actually three  deaths of law enforcement officers already this year in the State of  Georgia. The numbers are up. It is very concerning, and this is  something that we can do to help protect the lives of our law  enforcement officers.   I know that my friend from Georgia, Representative Collins, has a  long and storied history of support for State and local law  enforcement, and I stand with him in his concern, and I stand with him  in his support for this very important legislation that my friend, Bill  Pascrell, has introduced.   I will note that a lot of little boys and girls who first go into law  enforcement, they go into local and State law enforcement, and then  they are able to attain their ultimate dream, which is to become an FBI  agent.   FBI agents are Federal law enforcement agents. They are sworn to  protect and serve; they wear a gun, and they wake up every morning not  knowing what they will face during that day. Some have given their  lives in the ultimate sacrifice for this Nation.   So, in addition to our State and local law enforcement agents, we,  today, uphold our Federal law enforcement agents who work for the  various Federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, with its  storied history of integrity.   So, it is not about what we say; it is about what we do. It is about  what we say also, because what we say has an impact on those who serve  us. And we cannot, because of one or two outliers, indict the entire  State or local law enforcement agency for the imperfections of the few;  nor can we do so with our Federal law enforcement agencies,  particularly our premier Federal law enforcement agency, the FBI.   I support the FBI. I support our State and local law enforcement  agencies.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Visclosky).    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining for  both sides?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   The top law enforcement individual in the country is the Attorney  General, and our Attorney General has declared war on the FBI by  ordering a third investigation into the origins of the Mueller  investigation. This is nothing more than an attack on our own premier  law enforcement agency. It is politics reduced to its lowest level at  the same time as Police Week is occurring.   What does it say to those down the line, to those aspiring boys and  girls who aspire to be FBI agents?   What does it say to the men and women who are currently in law  enforcement and looking to move into Federal law enforcement?   Well, it doesn't tell them to not aspire to that height. I think most  look beyond the politics of the day, and when they consider the  legislation that is at hand, they support it without regard to  political persuasion. They support the fact that H.R. 2379, introduced  by my friend Bill Pascrell, is a testament to the important role that  Congress plays in promoting officer safety today and for decades to  come.   In passing this bill during Police Week, we acknowledge the many  contributions that law enforcement officers make to public safety, and  we thank them for their service. We also recognize that there are  challenges within law enforcement that we must weed out and that are an  affront to the ideals that law enforcement officers are taught to  adhere to, and we must do that, as well.   But today it is not about that. Today it is about bulletproof vests  for our law enforcement officers on the State and local level. We will  make sure that our Federal officers are always protected, but today it  is about State and local law enforcement agents and agencies,  particularly those that cannot afford to purchase these bulletproof  vests or to keep current in terms of these vests when they wear out.   They do wear out, and they have to be replaced, and they have to have  money to do that. This bill will enable $30 million per year to be  permanently authorized. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
