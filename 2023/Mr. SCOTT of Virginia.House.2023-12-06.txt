 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5933,  and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, the Defending Education Transparency and Ending Rogue  Regimes Engaging in Nefarious Transactions, or DETERRENT Act, is before  us today.   Historically, collaborations with global partners--and careful  Federal investments in research--have enabled our colleges and  universities to make bold, forward-thinking strides in health, science,  and technology for people around the world.   Additionally, institutions have collaborated with the U.S. Government  to enhance our research by attracting and retaining researchers and  scholars from across the world.   These partnerships help drive intellectual and campus diversity,  strengthen inner workings of our economy, and give us an undeniable  competitive edge.   Institutions, however, must be transparent about the resources they  receive from foreign entities, particularly as the Federal Government  invests nearly $30 billion annually in our higher education research  and development efforts.    Some colleges and universities, unfortunately, have not complied with  all of their responsibilities in those disclosures. Regrettably, H.R.  5933 does nothing to meaningfully protect research security at colleges  and universities.   For example, colleges must report any gift from a representative of a  ``country of concern'' no matter the value--even a cup of coffee.   The faculty's information is then shared in a publicly searchable  database, regardless of whether the action was nefarious or not.   This is excessive and burdensome--to say nothing about the potential  discriminatory effect--and would disincentivize universities from  conducting critical research using collaborative partners from around  the world.   It would force them to deviate from established compliance and  reporting guidelines under section 117 of the Higher Education Act.   Schools are already grappling with recruiting and retaining students  and scholars. If passed, H.R. 5933 will stall decades of innovative  progress and jeopardize global research initiatives.   Students and faculties are already calling on Congress to improve our  higher education system and address discrimination on campus.   However, certain provisions of this bill would only exacerbate the  ongoing culture wars that have consumed our colleagues in Congress.   For example, the legislation singles out partnerships with certain  countries, targeting researchers based solely on their nationality.   As I have said before, we can achieve accountability and compliance  without contributing to anti-Asian, anti-Semitic, or Islamophobic  animosity.   I have offered a thoughtful alternative to improve section 117  compliance and support institutions as they evaluate and implement  their research integrity and foreign influence policies, and that  alternative will be offered during the amendment process.   This amendment builds on the Chips and Science Act and the  Presidential Memorandum on government-supported research and  development national security policy guidelines.   Specifically, it aligns reporting requirements with those of Federal  agencies and requires the Secretary of Education to go through  negotiated rulemaking to address key implementation aspects of section  117.   We must take targeted and thoughtful steps to protect our research  and development initiatives without jeopardizing our global  partnerships that will benefit us all.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I will quote from a letter we received from the Asian  American Scholar Forum in terms of the effect this bill would have on  Asian-American researchers. It is a long letter, but I will read one  paragraph.   ``The DETERRENT Act would further chill participation in research by  signaling to researchers and institutions that scientific collaboration  is discouraged and effectively deter economic institutions and scholars  from engaging with Chinese-American and immigrant colleagues and peers  out of fear of punishment or heightened scrutiny. The DETERRENT Act's  definition of a `foreign source' includes not just individuals overseas  but those with lawful immigration status in the United States who are  not U.S. citizens or nationals. As a practical matter, the DETERRENT  Act would force scholars and researchers to scrutinize the immigration  status of potential collaborators and would deter them from  collaboration with individuals who may be perceived to be immigrants.  Moreover, many scholars would not have access to private information,  such as the immigration status of their peers, making this practically  a difficult or impossible requirement for faculty, scholars, and  researchers to meet. Additionally, the reporting requirement for  contracts of no monetary value as it pertains to foreign entities and  countries of concern as defined by the DETERRENT Act would  significantly chill even normal, everyday communications, as it may be  perceived as an agreement.''   This would obviously have a chilling effect, and that is one of the  reasons we are opposing the DETERRENT Act.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the  letter from the Asian American Scholars Forum from which I quoted be  entered into the Record.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chair, despite my colleagues' claims, the DETERRENT Act would  only burden colleges and universities and jeopardize global  partnerships while doing nothing to help them comply with existing  compliance and reporting guidelines.   House Democrats tried several times to ensure that the legislation  included attainable, commonsense provisions for these institutions. For  example, in committee, I offered an amendment to build on the Chips and  Science Act and the ``Presidential Memorandum on United States  Government-Supported Research and Development National Security  Guidelines,'' aligning reporting requirements precisely to those  Federal agencies that are already reporting with the Department of  Education and requiring the Department of Education to go through  negotiated rulemaking to conform those reporting requirements.  Unfortunately, the Republican majority did not agree to it.   Mr. Chairman, Democrats are committed to helping institutions comply  with the law, but we must always strike a balance between enforcing the  law and fostering safe campuses for students, scholars, and faculty.   Regrettably, the legislation before us does nothing to achieve that  goal. It would only drive deeper wedges into higher education systems  at the expense of students, faculty, and our country's global  innovative efforts.   Mr. Chair, as I indicated, in that letter from the Asian American  Scholar Forum, they said: ``As a practical matter, the DETERRENT Act  would force scholars and researchers to scrutinize the immigration  status of potential collaborators and would deter them from  collaboration with individuals who may be perceived to be immigrants,''  and the zero limit on monetary value for gifts ``would significantly  chill even normal, everyday communications.''   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 5933, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim  the time in opposition, although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, this appears to be technical and  clarifying. That is always a good thing, and I hope that we will adopt  the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim  the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this  amendment. I still have deep concerns about section 117 of the bill,  because it places a target on the backs of researchers who work with  foreign collaborators and would create a chilling effect for both  international research and retention of international faculty and  scholars, but this amendment would take the identifying information out  and remove that target. I think that is a good direction.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, while I certainly want to ensure  that institutions remain compliant with section 117, many compliance  problems can be minimal or unintentional. Colleges and universities  will obviously be held accountable for those problems and subsequent  violations can be punished more severely, but a permanent ban seems  very excessive as a mandatory penalty in all cases.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim  the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, this is not an unreasonable  requirement. To have the information that is stored for 4 years, an  additional year is not unreasonable. Therefore, I do not oppose the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Chu).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.  [[Page H6178]]     Mr. Chair, this is an amendment that we should  be able to accept. The problem is that it is hard to imagine how the  college could actually comply with it.   Any association with a terrorist organization obviously should be  avoided. You are not dealing with the terrorist organization; you are  dealing with an organization who then has an affiliation or some  support from the organization. There is no way for the college to know.   I would hope that we would not force the college into complying with  something they would have no way to comply with.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time  and have the right to close.    Mr. Chairman, I will read the short amendment.  It says: ``Any affiliation of the foreign source to an organization  that is designated as a foreign terrorist organization pursuant to  section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.''   It is hard to imagine how a college could always know exactly who has  an affiliation with what.   Mr. Chair, for that reason, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this lowers the threshold to $1.  Any gift from any source, every gift or contract from any country--if  you have some Canadian collaborators or somebody from Great Britain  offering you coffee and donuts, you have to report it on a searchable  database. I think that is an absurd amount of reporting that would have  to be done.   This would create backlogs at the Department of Education and take  time away from the scrutiny of the reports that really need to be  looked at.   Mr. Chair, I hope we do not pass this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I  have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from Texas.                                time  1445     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Tennessee mentioned billions of  dollars from countries, and he mentioned some countries of concern.  Countries of concern already have to report zero-dollar and up gifts.  This just adds all other countries.   There is no need for the bill to go from the present law of $250,000  and up reports down to $50,000 for countries that are not countries of  concern down to $1 to scrutinize billion-dollar gifts from countries of  concern.   These reports are not free to comply with. The estimated costs of  compliance are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars under the bill  already.   Mr. Chairman, if you were to explode the number of reports that would  have to be made if this amendment is adopted, there is no telling what  the costs will be to the colleges and universities.   Mr. Chairman, I hope that we defeat the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would add all  international organizations as foreign sources that universities must  report funding from under section 117. It would include the United  Nations, UNESCO, the World Health Organization, and the World Trade  Organization. These multinational organizations, many of which have  significant participation by the United States, should not be deemed as  necessarily national security threats.   This amendment would expand the burdensome section 117 compliance  without giving any clear reason of how it would protect national  security.   For that reason, I oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6180]]         Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to  include in the Record a letter from the American Council on Education  signed by 18 national higher education organizations.    Mr. Chairman, part of the letter reads:  ``While we understand the concern regarding foreign funding to U.S.  institutions in higher education is bipartisan, we believe the  DETERRENT Act is duplicative of existing interagency efforts,  unnecessary, and puts in place a problematic expansion of the data  collection by the U.S. Department of Education that will broadly  curtail important needed international research collaboration and  academic and cultural exchanges.''   Mr. Chairman, I think that applies to this amendment, too.   Mr. Chairman, I hope Members vote ``no'' on the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to offer this  Democratic amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 5933.   My Democratic colleagues and I remain committed to ensuring  institutions have sufficient resources to safeguard their work from  undue foreign influence. Nevertheless, while I appreciate the  majority's interest in addressing this important issue, I fear that  their proposal is far too extreme and does not actually promote  institutional compliance.   Specifically, with such harsh fines and limited opportunities for  institutions to seek guidance, I am concerned that these changes to  section 117 of the Higher Education Act will discourage institutions  from collaborating with international entities that are essential in  solving important global issues.   It is also very concerning to see language that targets individual  faculty members for their collaboration with foreign entities. We have  seen, in cases such as the wrongfully accused MIT faculty member, that  this sort of targeting can easily lead to harmful consequences rooted  in xenophobia for innocent scholars. We must always strive to strike a  balance between enforcing the law and fostering safe campuses for  students, scholars, and faculty.   Through its overlapping and overly burdensome requirements, harsh  penalties, and duplicities to current foreign influence requirements  across Federal agencies, the DETERRENT Act takes a sledgehammer to a  problem that needs to be addressed with a scalpel.   The Democratic substitute makes a thoughtful approach to section 117  compliance to support institutions as they evaluate and implement their  research integrity and foreign influence policies.   In addition to requiring the filing of annual reports for gifts and  contracts from foreign entities, our bill would create a robust  database at the Department of Education to hold these reports. It  establishes commonsense sanctions for noncompliance that allow for room  to help institutions that need support scaling up their compliance  work. Moreover, it establishes a single point of contact at the  Department to coordinate section 117 compliance.   It also builds on the work being done through the implementation of  the Chips and Science Act and the ``Presidential Memorandum on United  States Government-Supported Research and Development National Security  Guidelines'' by aligning important requirements to those of other  Federal agencies and requiring the Secretary of Education to go through  negotiated rulemaking to address key implementation aspects of section  117.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the Democratic substitute,  rather than the underlying bill, to enhance institutions' real ability  to protect against foreign influence.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the time  remaining.  [[Page H6184]]     Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to  the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chair, in the committee chair's remarks, she mentioned that there  is a difference between countries of concern and other countries. I  remind her that we just passed an amendment that essentially eliminated  that difference. A recorded vote was requested, and perhaps she could  join me in trying to defeat that amendment to the bill.   This amendment in the nature of a substitute significantly increases  the gifts and contracts that need to be reported compared to present  law. It takes a more moderate approach to national security than the  underlying bill, which I think is an extreme approach.    It will be very difficult for colleges to comply with. For that  reason, I hope that we adopt the Democratic amendment in the nature of  a substitute and, if not, defeat the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
