 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  achievements and retirement of Maureen ``Mo'' Brown.   Coach Brown was recognized as the Southeast Georgia Middle School  Athletic Association Athletic Director of the Year. It is a little  bittersweet, as at the end of this year, she will be retiring from  Pierce County Schools after 38 years of distinguished service. However,  I am happy to hear that Coach Brown will be the director of the Pierce  County Recreation Department.   Coach Mo was a standout athlete in her own right at Blackshear High  School in the late 1970s. She has served head coaching stints as the  girls' basketball, softball, and golf coach at Pierce County High  School. She led the girls' golf team to two State championships while  at the helm. She has been in her current role as Pierce County Middle  School athletic director for 29 years.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Coach Mo for her years of success and the impact  she has made on the students of Pierce County, and I look forward to  what the future holds for her.                           Celebrating Dave Reilly     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Mr.  Dave Reilly receiving the Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award.   On May 5, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro presented Dave with  this year's award for distinguished public service.   Dave served for 38 years in the United States Navy on assignments  from submarines to his final post as commander of the Strategic Weapons  Facility, Atlantic on Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base. He retired out of  Kings Bay and decided to live his post-retirement years in St. Marys,  Georgia, where he is also currently a city councilman.   In 1998, Dave became a lifetime member of the Camden-Kings Bay Navy  League. He served in various local and national leadership positions  before becoming national president of the Navy League of the United  States in June 2021. As president, Dave has transformed the current  governance structure and maintained his promise to keep the Navy League  as the premier sea service support organization in the country.   His time as president may be up in June, but I have no doubt that  Dave will continue to serve the Navy and his community long, long after  his term is up.    Expressing Gratitude to Matt Campbell, Buck Holly, and Patrick Kisgen     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to thank Matt  Campbell, Buck Holly, and Patrick Kisgen for their work on the Coastal  Georgia Honor Flight. On May 13, they had the honor of being the  guardians on the annual Coastal Georgia Honor Flight.   Coastal Georgia Honor Flight takes groups of veterans annually up  from Glynn, Camden, McIntosh, and other  [[Page H2551]]  surrounding counties. They leave in the early morning hours for a  whirlwind tour of the monuments for our servicemembers all day before  returning that very same night.   The trip includes stops at Arlington National Cemetery, the United  States Marine Corps War Memorial, and the Korean War Veterans Memorial,  just to name a few.   Matt, who travels a lot for work, saw other regions' honor flight  shirts in the airport and decided to look further into volunteering.  After learning of his community's honor flight, he asked his two  friends, Patrick and Buck, to join him. It did not take much  convincing.   Reflecting on his trip, Patrick said: ``Having the opportunity to  experience our Nation's Capital with the multiple generations of men  and women who put themselves in harm's way to protect it was something  that I will cherish forever.''   I thank all our veterans who have served our country, and I thank the  great volunteers who make these special experiences happen.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise today in strong support of the HALT Fentanyl Act,  which would permanently schedule fentanyl analogues as schedule I.   Madam Chair, the United States is facing a poisoning epidemic. It is  caused by illicit fentanyl and its related substances that are pouring  over our southern border. Almost 200 people are dying every day  from fentanyl poisoning--200.    Included in that number is a family from my district who lost their  son, Wesley, to the drug at the age of 22 years. His mother writes:  ``My son was a victim of drug-induced homicide. He took one pill that  ended up being pure fentanyl and died. He was poisoned because he  trusted the wrong person and paid for it with his life.''   We cannot allow the lawlessness and tragedy to continue to tear our  communities apart. That is why we must pass the HALT Fentanyl Act that  is before us today.   Opponents of this legislation are choosing to side with criminals  over the safety and well-being of our children. That is despicable.   Madam Chair, let's pass this bill, secure the border, stem the tide  of the growing fentanyl crisis, and save lives.
