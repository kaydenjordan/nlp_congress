 Mr. President, a little over 10 years ago, BJ Westlund  made his way from Bend, OR, here to our Nation's Capital to serve his  fellow Oregonians as a correspondence assistant in my office.   Over the last decade, BJ moved up the ranks to legislative  correspondent and legislative aide and then had the opportunity to move  back to Oregon, move back to Bend, as my field representative.   He has done an incredible job in that capacity, but he is now, after  a number of years in that key role, ready to start a new chapter in his  career.   I know that I speak for everyone on my team, whether in Washington,  DC, or in Oregon, when I say that we are thrilled to see BJ continue to  grow and thrive in his career, but we are also very saddened to see him  go.   Ask anyone on the team, past or present, about BJ, and there are a  couple of things that might jump to mind: his signature sense of style  for one. He loves to wear a good vest. Whether here in DC or in Oregon,  it is hard for anyone to picture BJ without a good vest. And wherever  BJ is, you can bet there is a tasty cold mix of iced tea and lemonade  not far away.   And BJ has taken on the role of overseeing the Team Merkley candy  desk while he was here in Washington, DC, making sure it was always  stashed with really good candy.   Before we changed offices in Hart, the legislative team was split  between two floors. BJ was upstairs working on environmental and energy  issues and referred to that area as ``Eastern Oregon.'' But without  fail, you could find a steady stream of folks going up the staircase to  stop by BJ's desk and grab a piece of candy and chat. It was our  version of the office water cooler and a way for BJ to help build a  sense of community between all the team members.   That is the fourth thing that comes to mind when people think about  BJ, is his sense of community, his welcoming presence, his ability to  connect. It is what made him such an effective legislative staffer,  working with groups on their priorities, advocating for critical  appropriations funding. And for the  [[Page S2146]]  last 4 years, it is what made him such an incredible representative for  our office throughout Central Oregon.   When asked to share her thoughts about BJ, one of our former team  members who worked very closely with him over many years had this to  say:         BJ is the calm in the storm. He is a steady, intelligent,       caring, supportive teammate who cares beyond measure for his       constituents. He has worked tirelessly to solve problems and       bring Oregon tax dollars home to Central Oregon.    She continued:         Moving to his home office during COVID while continuing to       be responsive to both teammates and constituents was a smooth       transition because BJ handles challenges with aplomb.    And she closed by saying:         He is a treasure and just a wonderful human being.    And I couldn't say it any better.   BJ is the calm in the storm. BJ is a wonderful human being. BJ does  work tirelessly to solve problems.   That is why, when the Bootleg fire struck Oregon last year, the third  largest fire in our State's history, it was BJ who took charge of  reaching out to and connecting with the communities impacted by the  devastation. And it is a good thing he was, because community members,  Tribal leaders, landowners, business owners, local electeds, agency  leaders, relief agencies, and conservationists all looked to BJ to be  there for them.   They knew that he would reach out. They knew he would listen to what  they needed. They knew that he would do whatever it took to be there to  respond to those challenges.   BJ has been the central driver on many major projects. One was  getting funding for irrigation piping projects to help Oregon farmers  get more water, while simultaneously putting more water back in our  rivers, a positive environmental effect.   A second was helping an Oregonian Tribe find justice by finally  repealing the fraudulent 1865 treaty that robbed them of their hunting  and fishing rights.   A third was almost doubling the size of the Cascade-Siskiyou National  Monument for future generations of Oregonians to enjoy, a monument that  comes at the intersection of three critical mountain ranges and has  flora and fauna found nowhere else in the world.   BJ is the kind of person who takes extra pride in drafting a  customized letter to a student or making a one-off phone call to a  constituent looking for help or advice because taking that small extra  step can restore their faith and their trust in government.   But anyone who knows BJ wouldn't be surprised by any of this because  they know how intensely he believes in public service. It is how he was  raised. It is what he saw and learned growing up from his father, who  was a good friend of mine, Ben Westlund, whom I had the privilege of  serving with in the Oregon statehouse before he went on to serve as an  Oregon senator and Oregon treasurer.   We lost Ben about 12 years ago, before BJ came to work on my team,  but I know how proud he would be if here with us today to see all the  great things that his son has done and will continue to do in service  to the people of Oregon.   So, BJ, thank you for all you have done throughout your time on Team  Merkley to help build a better world. The team and I wish you well as  you begin the next chapter of your life, and we can't wait to see all  of the great things that you will continue to do and to achieve in the  years to come.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
