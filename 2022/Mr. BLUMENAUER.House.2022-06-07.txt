 The avalanche of horrible news about mass shootings,  especially at schools, has been painful but instructive.   America is not unique. But what is unique is that America has  accepted the slaughter, unlike Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,  and Norway, who have acted decisively to reduce gun violence and proven  that it works.   We have stood by allowing the carnage to continue to our shame.  America should not be the only rich country that cannot protect its  children.   This should be one of the defining issues of this election cycle. If  candidates can't support simple, commonsense, and proven steps to  reduce gun violence, then what is their answer?   It is no longer acceptable for gun violence enablers to hide behind  thoughts and prayers.  [[Page H5240]]    If other countries can protect their families, then why can't we?   American families deserve to know where each politician stands.                            ____________________
