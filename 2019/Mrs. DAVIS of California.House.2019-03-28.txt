 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity  with our transgender servicemembers and to stand against President  Trump's proposed ban of transgender people serving in the military.   Transgender troops have been serving openly since 2016--at home,  overseas, and in combat zones--without incident.                                time  0945    When I met with transgender servicemembers last month, I was  impressed to learn that by serving openly--I want to make a note of  that--by serving openly, the quality of their service improved, and, in  fact, the obstacles--and there are many obstacles, Mr. Speaker--the  obstacles they have overcome informed their greater ability to do their  job. Their impressive records speak for themselves, and there is no  doubt that each of the servicemembers I met with have served their  country with distinction.   As already stated, this ban is blatant discrimination poorly  disguised as concerns over readiness, unit cohesion, and medical costs  associated with transitioning. We already know that there have been  zero reports of issues regarding unit morale or cohesion since the ban  was lifted in 2016, a fact that has been supported by the chief of  staff of every service. The cost of medically transitioning has also  been proven to have minimal impact on the military's healthcare budget.   This administration is resorting to misinformation; misinformation to  exclude capable, qualified people from service to their country.   At a time when the Army is failing to meet recruitment goals, and the  Navy and Air Force opted to lower their quota in order to reach their  own recruitment goals, we cannot be turning away dedicated, able-bodied  recruits simply because they happen to be transgender.
