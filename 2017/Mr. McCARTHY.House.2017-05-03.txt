 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House will vote on H.R. 1644,  our North Korean sanctions bill. I do believe it is important that the  House speak with one voice against the recent actions of the Kim  regime.   Next, as I said in our colloquy on Friday, additional legislative  items are possible. As soon as any items are added to our schedule, I  will be sure to notify Members. However, Members should be prepared to  be here and voting tomorrow.    I thank my friend for yielding. I appreciate his  questions.   As has been reported in the press, we have made significant progress  on our healthcare bill. When we are ready to bring the bill to the  floor, I will make an announcement and relay scheduling information to  all Members.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   As the gentleman clearly knows, there is a CBO score out there right  now on the bill. As the gentleman knows, we are making progress; and as  soon as we designate that, yes, we will move the bill, and I will  notify the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
