 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Joe Braman, a Refugio  rancher who is recognized internationally for his commitment to  protecting endangered animals from poachers, as well as aiding law  enforcement officers in protecting our border.   Thanks to meticulous training, Mr. Braman's free-running pack dogs  assisted with protecting South Africa's endangered black and white  rhinos, ultimately leading to the arrest of 27 poachers and also  beginning the recovery of the species.   His dogs can track human scent several hours old and take down  hunters more than 20 miles away. They have proved immensely valuable in  Texas as well. They have assisted local law enforcement in manhunts and  border security.   Their 98 percent success rate with locating and capturing targets  demonstrates their potential usefulness in future border security  efforts.   Joe Braman's unique and incredible ability to train dogs has made a  positive difference, not just in Texas, but around the world, and I  would like to extend to him our district's appreciation for his  excellent work and devotion to justice.                            ____________________
