 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are about to embark on something that  is pretty amazing to me. Next week, I am told, we are going to take up  the Senate healthcare bill that is going to be the first cousin of the  House bill. There are a lot of things that are referred to as putting  lipstick on a pig, but this is truly putting lipstick on a pig, where  we are going to take healthcare away from millions of Americans.   We might make it a little better by extending some Medicare or  Medicaid monies, but in the end that will go away. We will potentially  set up some high-risk pools for people with preexisting conditions. I  will tell you, from my time in the State legislature when we dealt with  high-risk pools, that gives access to healthcare for the rich folks.   In essence, what we are going to do next week, because some folks in  this body forgot to read the Affordable Care Act when it came up, is we  are going to repeal it and we are going to replace it with a piece of  garbage.   Today I rise on behalf of the 48 rural and frontier hospitals in  Montana--48 rural and frontier hospitals that are the backbone of our  State.   I rise for the 77,000 hard-working Montanans who now have healthcare  because of Medicaid expansion, and the 41,000 jobs of our State of 1  million people sustained by our healthcare industry today.   I rise on behalf of every Montanan who deserves to know what is going  on in Washington, DC. What is going on back there? Are you guys really  talking about jerking my healthcare away from me? Are you guys actually  talking about taking something up that is really not going to do much  for the 30 million Americans getting pounded by high premiums and high  deductibles? Are you doing this to give the top one-tenth of 1 percent  of the Americans in this country a tax break?   Right now, the Senate majority in this body is playing Russian  roulette with people's lives. A handful of Washington politicians are  crafting a secret healthcare bill in a smoke-filled room, probably a  little whiskey is involved, a few steaks. They are crafting a bill that  will impact every man, woman, and child in this country.   I heard earlier today, they said these meetings were open. It would  be nice to know where they are. I would love to go in and give my two  bits on what rural America feels about how we need to move forward with  healthcare in this country. This is a problem that is not going away  unless we address it in a commonsense way.   So they are crafting this bill in secret. We don't know what is in  it, but we have indication it is going to be very similar--a first  cousin--to the American Health Care Act passed in the House so we  should be deeply concerned. This is irresponsible legislation that  jeopardizes healthcare for over 250,000 Montanans, denying coverage to  over 150,000 Montanans who have a preexisting condition like cancer,  heart disease, even high blood pressure, and, quite frankly, would put  many of our rural hospitals at risk--at risk of closure; at the very  best, changing the methods by which they deliver healthcare to these  rural communities, by the way, that are hanging on by  [[Page S3636]]  their fingernails. This House bill is creating uncertainty in Montana,  it is creating uncertainty across this Nation, it will fundamentally  change our lives forever, and I do not believe it will be for the  better.   My office has received over 3,600 pieces of correspondence related to  the American Health Care Act. Many Montanans are terrified of the  implications of this horrible bill. As elected officials, we are  obligated to answer the tough questions, defend our positions, and  advocate for our constituents. That is not what is happening here. As a  result, the Senate, through their secret meetings and through a  potential rushed-through healthcare bill next week--and I see no reason  why it will not be--we are not doing right by our constituents.   The process and this bill are a disservice to folks like Julie  Williams from smalltown Montana--Shepherd, MT. Julie was diagnosed with  multiple sclerosis, MS, in 2011, 5 months before the Supreme Court was  set to make their decision on the Affordable Care Act. She spent those  5 months terrified that she was in for a constant fight with insurance  companies over coverage, but the Supreme Court upheld the ACA, and  Julie has insurance and doesn't have to worry about being denied  coverage if she moves, changes jobs, or--God forbid--becomes unemployed  because she now has a preexisting condition. Julie also doesn't have to  worry about insurance companies cutting off her treatments because she  happens to hit a lifetime cap, which is a very real concern for a  healthy young woman with a disease like MS. She didn't have to worry-- she didn't have to worry until now. If a bill like the American Health  Care Act passes, Julie could be charged more because of her disease.  She is unable to afford that coverage. The plan may not pay for the  healthcare services she needs.   This legislation is also a disservice to a lady with the same last  name, no relation, Jennifer Williams, of East Glacier, MT, one of the  most beautiful parts of the world. Thanks to the preventive care  provisions in the current healthcare system, Jennifer and her husband  have been able to catch a few conditions early and avoid bigger  problems in the future. That is going away.   Unfortunately, their premiums are rising. Congress needs to address  that problem head on. I couldn't agree more. This bill that passed from  the House doesn't do that. It will send folks like Julie and 250,000  Montanans on Medicaid out into the cold, no access to affordable care,  jack up the cost of healthcare for folks with health insurance, and  jack up the cost of healthcare for folks in their fifties and sixties.  We can and should be working together to lower those costs for folks  like Jennifer, Julie, and other Montana families. Instead, we are here  scoring political points--or trying to--upending all the good things in  the ACA and the current healthcare system. Instead, we should be  working together in Congress. The Senate should be working together-- not in some back room but right here on the floor--to lower premiums,  copays, and deductibles, while increasing access to lifesaving medical  care.   Look, we have said it before, we will say it again: The Affordable  Care Act isn't perfect, but it has a lot of good things. Let's fix the  things wrong with it and keep the progress we have made, but instead,  we hear in Washington, particularly the Republican majority, is  creating chaos in the marketplace and driving costs up. This chaos is  putting our rural hospitals and community health centers at risk. That  is not just the statement. That is a statement of fact.   Every day, folks in rural communities rely on their local hospitals,  clinics, everything from basic checkup to emergency treatments. Thanks  to Medicaid expansion, in Montana, these hospitals and community health  centers have seen a reduction in charity care, and they have been able  to keep their doors open, but the American Health Care Act puts those  funds at risk and puts these frontier medical centers on the chopping  block. These medical professionals are sworn by oath to provide  healthcare for folks. If Medicaid expansion goes away, the hospital  will be forced to absorb those costs.    Over the last 10 months, I have held over a dozen listening sessions,  eyeball-to-eyeball listening sessions with Montanans. We are going to  be holding some more. The sessions have been over health. I have heard  one thing loud and clear from people: If Medicaid expansion goes away,  these rural frontier hospitals will have to fundamentally change how  they deliver healthcare or they may be forced to shut down altogether.  These hospitals operate on razor-thin margins, and they cannot afford  to see these funds disappear.   Take my hometown, Big Sandy, MT. Back in 1910, my grandfather came  out, took a look around, saw grass as tall as the belly on a horse, and  said: ``This is where we are going to homestead.'' He went back and got  my grandmother. The farm that Sharla and I farm today was started,  patented back in 1915. They worked together with their neighbors, the  homesteaders of that area. They built barns, they built businesses, but  it took them 50 years to build a hospital. In the mid-1960s, a hospital  was finally built in Big Sandy, MT--50 years of people working together  to get that hospital built.   I am going to tell you, if we don't do smart things in this body, if  we take steps backward and not very many--and this bill I have seen  from the House is horrible, and I don't think the bill in the Senate is  going to be much better because it is a low bar. Hospitals like the  hospital in Big Sandy will go away. I am going to tell you something,  when that hospital goes away, Big Sandy goes away. Rural America goes  away.   Big Sandy is just an example of hundreds of small towns in Montana  and throughout this country that depend upon rural hospitals for  healthcare. Without hospitals, Montana frontier communities will be  forced to drive 100 miles to deliver a baby or take an expensive  ambulance ride after an accident. People are not going to be able to  afford or they are not going to choose to live there because of a lack  of healthcare. They are not going to take that risk. They are going to  move out of those small towns, and they are going to move to places  where they have healthcare. In some cases, families who have lived in  those house and on that property for generations will be forced to  move. These hospitals just don't keep patients alive, they keep  communities alive. The House bill would kill those rural hospitals and  would be the death of rural America.   That is not the only uncertainty facing rural America. In Montana,  insurance companies filed their proposed rates with the insurance  commissioner last year, but these insurers are left without vital  information for their proposals. They don't know if this administration  will continue the cost-saving reduction payments that help make  healthcare more affordable. Insurers have said if these payments go  away, consumers will face double-digit rate increases. Montanans  deserve to know from their elected officials what kind of impact this  action has on premiums, and yet the insurance commissioners are leaving  consumers and Montanans in the dark.   Transparency builds a more effective government. Hiding important  information from the public is unacceptable at any level of elected  official. We live in a country where citizens can hold their government  accountable, and the American people make good decisions when they have  good information, but right now, a select few in this body are  shielding the American public from what is really going on. We hear  about a bill that is going to impact one-sixth of the economy, we hear  about a piece of legislation that will rip healthcare away from 23  million Americans, we hear about a bill that will take us back to the  days when Montanans couldn't afford to get sick, but we haven't seen  it.   Families across Montana are sitting at the kitchen table wondering if  their healthcare coverage is going to go away. Folks are walking out of  the doctors' offices with newfound conditions and wondering: Will I be  able to get treatment if something similar to the American Healthcare  Act is passed by the Senate? Children are being born prematurely, with  asthma and cerebral palsy, and parents are left fearing their son or  daughter will never be able to afford insurance.   These families deserve more from Congress. At a bare minimum, they  deserve hearings. They deserve a panel of  [[Page S3637]]  experts discussing how we can lower premiums, reduce healthcare costs,  and put transparency into prescription drugs. They deserve smart  action, not political action. They deserve a Congress that will work  together to improve the lives of all Americans, not one that works  behind closed doors to draft secret legislation that will send shock  waves through homes across this country.   Our Founders expected more from this body. Quite frankly, I expected  more from this body before I got here. Montanans expect their U.S.  Senate to work for them.   I am going to leave you with one story. I was in Butte, MT, at one of  my listening sessions. A gentleman was sitting at the table. He was  probably 45 years old. He said: You know, I have two kids and I can't  work. I have had diabetes since I was a teenager. I have had some  issues with mental health for a good portion of my adult life.   He said: I haven't been able to work, haven't been able to support my  family, and then the Affordable Care Act came along, and the State of  Montana was wise enough to pass Medicaid expansion. I was able to go to  a doctor. I was able to get my diabetes handled because of Medicaid  expansion. I was able to see a psychologist and get my mental health  issues under control, and I was able to go back to work. I was able to  support my family.   He said: And now you guys in Washington, DC, want to take all that  away from me.   I will tell you, I will fight like hell to make sure that never  happens. And if the majority leader wants to try to ram this down the  people's throats, I will spend the rest of my life telling them why and  who did what to them.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and  legacy of a brave Montanan and American, Harold Haugland.   Harold's story begins in Glendive, MT, where he was born in 1928 to  Peter and Alma Haugland. Harold and his family were well known in the  community for their compassionate hearts and unrelenting work ethic.  Harold took these Montana values to the U.S. Army in 1949, where he  quickly became a highly decorated soldier, receiving a number of medals  and citations.   In late November 1950, Harold joined the Company D, 15th antiaircraft  Artillery Battalion, 7th Infantry Division.   Two thousand five hundred U.S. and 700 South Korean soldiers were  deployed east of the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea when they were  engaged by an overwhelming number of Chinese forces. By early December,  the U.S. Army evacuated approximately 1,500 wounded servicemembers; the  remaining soldiers had been either captured or killed in enemy  territory.   Because Harold could not be accounted for by his unit at the end of  the battle, he was reported missing in action as of December 2, 1950.  Harold's name did not appear on any prisoner of war lists, and no  returning soldiers reported him as a prisoner of war. The U.S. Army  declared him deceased as of December 31, 1953.   In 1954, a number of remains were recovered from north of the Korean  Demilitarized Zone. However, Harold's remains were not included and he  was declared nonrecoverable. After his death, Harold was awarded the  Distinguished Service Cross for his heroism and leadership.   During a joint recovery operation in 2004, Harold's remains were  found in a mass grave on the eastern bank of the Chosin Reservoir in  North Korea. Thanks to recent technological advancements in forensic  science, the U.S. Department of Defense positively identified one of  the individuals as Harold Haugland. After nearly 66 years, an American  hero has been brought home to Montana for a full and proper military  burial.   Harold represents the very best that this Nation has to offer with  his profound bravery and dedication to service. Like many before him  and after him, Harold paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect the  freedoms that make the United States the greatest Nation in the world.   To Harold and his family, on behalf of myself, Montana, and a  grateful nation, I extend our deepest thanks for Harold's service,  sacrifice, and valor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor an American  hero.   Frank McCauley passed away last week peacefully in Hamilton, MT.  Frank was the oldest living fighter pilot ace from World War II.   He originally joined the Army at the beginning of America's entry  into the war, but quickly then turned to the Air Force where he  discovered his passion and skill as one of our Nation's first fighter  pilots.   Frank flew his P-47 fighter ``Rat Racer'' on 46 missions while  supporting B-17 bombers in the European Theatre, and he is credited  with shooting down five and a half Nazi aircrafts. For this he received  a Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross, and four Air Medals.   In 2015, Frank and his family were flown to Washington, DC, and he  was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor  that Congress can bestow on an individual for his service during World  War II.   After leaving the Air Force, Frank had three sons--Craig, Kirk, and  Kevin--and he built a life on the west coast with a successful career  in the construction business. In 1974, Frank retired, married the love  of his life, Bobbie, and moved to the Bitterroot Valley in western  Montana.   It was in Montana where Frank and Bobbie enjoyed their retirement  years by traveling in their motor home and organizing numerous parties  for their friends, family, and neighbors.  [[Page S3646]]    Frank McCauley embodies the Greatest Generation, and he is a symbol  for the American dream.   He is survived by his wife, Bobbie McCauley; sons, Craig, Kirk, and  Kevin; stepdaughter, Nancy Cook; and numerous grandchildren, great- grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren.   To ensure Frank's life story is preserved and to honor the  contributions he has made to our country, I am proud to enshrine his  story in the Congressional Record.                            ____________________
