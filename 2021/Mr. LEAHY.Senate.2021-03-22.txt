 Mr. President, all of us have been sent here by the people  of our States to represent them. I have always felt a true measure of  the quality of our service is reflected in the kind of people we hire  to help us do these awesome jobs. The people in our State offices, on  our frontlines, are critical in this effort.   John Goodrow is one such public servant. I hired him in 1987 from his  job at a local radio station. John brought his radio voice and Vermont  sensibility. He has a great sense of humor and could see the  challenges, frustrations, and occasional absurdities of everyday life  in a Senate office. This was coupled with a determination to serve all  Vermonters.   On March 4 of this year, John Goodrow marked 34 years as a loyal and  dedicated service. With deep appreciation and respect and more than a  little bit of sadness, I recently informed my staff that John has  decided to retire on March 31.   At the age of 25, John came to my office scheduling appointments and  events, and serving as my on-the-ground Vermont press secretary. He  clipped news items in a time when they were actually cut and copied  from newspapers, and John loved his typewriter. It was just a few years  ago that he reluctantly let go of the typewriter in his office. Staff  may have even spirited it away when he wasn't there.   He understood the importance of my travel throughout our State to  meet with Vermonters, and in his bones, he knew it how meaningful it  was for Marcelle and me to be home at our farmhouse in Middlesex.   He fielded the scores of scheduling requests that came to my office.  And later, as my deputy State director, he has helped in overseeing an  exceptionally skilled and dedicated staff.   What I also treasured was how direct John could be with me. When  something was wrong, he let me know. If I was reluctant to do something  he deemed important, he made his case. In our jobs, we are frequently  surrounded by people who are too quick to flatter. That was never a  problem with John and something I always valued.   John has been a valuable resource and coach to countless staff  members and interns over the years. His institutional memory, his good  judgment and steadiness of purpose, and his connections to Vermonters  across our State are unmatched. His droll sense of humor, including  practical jokes, and his gifted storytelling can take you back many  years, including back to every one of my campaigns. And his empathy and  compassion for others is a gift.   Marcelle and I value John's friendship, his loyalty, and his  dedication to helping those in need. We have watched his family grow  and prosper as he and Mary Ellen raised their two boys, Joe and Jamie.   While we will miss his booming voice when we walk down the hall of  the Burlington office, we will take comfort in knowing that voice will  continue to be heard at Centennial Field as baseball season begins  anew.   Marcelle and I congratulate John for all he has accomplished, we  commend  [[Page S1670]]  him for his service to Vermont, and we thank him for his friendship and  loyal service to our State. We will miss our daily interactions with  him, but we are grateful that he forever will be part of the Leahy  family.                            ____________________
