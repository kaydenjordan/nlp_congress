 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson for his  leadership and hard work on this important legislation.   Too often, students across the country leave school without the  necessary skills to compete in the modern economy. As the cost of a 4- year degree continues to soar higher and higher and students are taking  on greater debt, employers across this country are struggling to find  skilled workers to fill good, high-paying jobs. Career and technical  education bridges the gap between the classroom and the workplace,  offering students a clear pathway to a meaningful career.    I am pleased this legislation includes my amendment supporting dual  and concurrent enrollment. By allowing high school students to begin  earning postsecondary credit, dual enrollment can shorten the time to  degree or credential completion, puts students on the fast tack to a  good job, and saves families a significant amount of money. Students  who participate in dual enrollment are more likely to continue and  pursue postsecondary education, less likely to need remediation, and  more likely to complete a degree.   My district is lucky to be home to a great technical college that  does its job. For example, in Rosemount, Minnesota, Dakota County  Technical College partners with local employers to provide students  customized training that fits employer-specific needs.   I am proud to support this important legislation that will increase  opportunity and prepare students with the skills to succeed.
