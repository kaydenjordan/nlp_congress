 Mr. President, today I am placing a hold on the nomination  of Michael Faulkender to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for  Economic Policy, which was reported favorably from the Finance  Committee on September 18, 2018. I will maintain that hold until the  Treasury Department provides the Senate Finance Committee sufficient  information and documents related to Russia and its financial dealings  with President Trump and his associates, as well as outside  organizations Russia used to help elect him. I originally asked for  these documents on May 10, 2017, and, to date, have still not received  satisfactory responses to these important matters.   I have stated repeatedly that we must follow the money if we are  going to get to the bottom of how Russia has attacked our democracy.  That means thoroughly reviewing any information that relates to  financial connections between Russia and President Trump and his  associates, whether direct or laundered through hidden or illicit  transactions.   The Treasury Department for which Mr. Faulkender is nominated to  serve is responsible for much of this information. The Treasury  Department authorities include intelligence and enforcement functions  to combat financial crimes and threats, including money laundering.   For these reasons, I will object to any unanimous consent request  concerning the nomination of Mr. Faulkender until these issues are  resolved.                            ____________________
