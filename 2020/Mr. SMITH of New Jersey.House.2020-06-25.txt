 Mr. Speaker, the JUSTICE Act is designed to  ensure greater transparency and accountability in policing in order to  build safer communities.   I cosponsored the JUSTICE Act because it is a serious, comprehensive  and balanced reform initiative--an important step forward.   I am deeply grateful to Senator Tim Scott and Congressman Pete  Stauber for authoring this bicameral legislation.   The killing of George Floyd while in custody by a Minneapolis police  officer demands justice and has resulted in a fresh and necessary look  at crime and policing.   I watched the video of Derek Chauvin kneeling on the neck of Mr.  Floyd who pleaded ``I can't breathe'' with horror and disbelief.  Chauvin not only betrayed his solemn duty to serve and protect but he  betrayed, as well, police officers throughout the nation who serve with  great honor and valor, and make enormous sacrifices to protect the  innocent and enforce the law.   Today I--like many Americans--believe that nonviolent dialogue and  persuasion are not only the best way, but it is the only way to achieve  meaningful change.   Those who commit violent acts against police and others, as well as  those who destroy property and steal, should be prosecuted to the  greatest extent of the law.   The JUSTICE Act that we will vote on today includes new funding of  $225 million for improved police training--including best practices for  violence deescalation and alternatives to the use of force--which will  likely reduce injury or death to both police officers and criminal  suspects. The training also includes the most effective approaches to  suspects with mental health conditions and developmental disability  including individuals with autism.   The JUSTICE Act also authorizes a $500 million matching grant program  to help police departments purchase body-worn cameras and receive the  necessary training to ensure optimal use. It conditions eligibility for  this funding on certain criteria, including usage at all times when an  officer arrests or detains anyone.   The evidence for bodycam use is compelling. Studies have shown that  the use of body-worn cameras can reduce complaints against officers by  up to 90 percent and decrease officers' use of force by 60 percent.   The JUSTICE ACT also provides $500 million for duty-to-intervene  training and directs the Attorney General in consultation with state  and local governments, and organizations representing rank and file law  enforcement officers to develop training curricula on the duty of a law  enforcement officer to intervene when another officer engages in  excessive use of force.   Had any one of the three officers on the scene in Minneapolis  intervened when George Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe, his life  could have been saved.   Other reforms embedded in the legislation include maintaining and  appropriately sharing disciplinary records for officer hiring, use of  force reporting to the FBI, no-knock warrant reporting, incentivizing  chokehold bans and increased penalties for false police reports.   The JUSTICE Act empowers the Community Oriented Policing Services  (COPS) grant program to hire recruiters and enroll candidates in law  enforcement academies to ensure racial and demographic representation  similar to the communities served, and funds an education program for  law enforcement on racism produced by the Smithsonian's National Museum  of African American History.   The bill makes lynching a federal crime.   The legislation also creates the Commission on the Social Status of  Black Men and Boys which will study and issue a wide-ranging report on  conditions affecting Black men and boys, including homicide rates,  arrest and incarceration rates, poverty, violence, fatherhood,  mentorship, drug abuse, death rates, disparate income and wealth  levels, school performance in all grade levels and health issues and  will make recommendations to address these issues.   That said, why not vote for the Democrat bill that is before the  House today as well?   I have serious concerns that the language in H.R. 7120--the Democrat  proposal--eviscerates qualified immunity in civil lawsuits for our  women and men in law enforcement.   Let's be clear, current policy provides no immunity whatsoever--nor  should it ever--from criminal prosecution as in the case of the officer  responsible for the death of George Floyd.   But qualified immunity--a judicially created legal doctrine--shields  government officials, including law enforcement, from personal  liability lawsuits so long as their actions do not violate ``clearly  established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable  person would have known.''   According to the Congressional Research Service, ``The Supreme Court  has observed that qualified immunity balances two important interests-- the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power  irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment,  distraction and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.''  [[Page H2489]]    Section 102 of the Democrat bill ends qualified immunity and states  in pertinent part that ``It shall not be a defense or immunity in any  action brought under this section against a local law enforcement  officer . . . `` even if ``. . . the defendant was acting in good  faith, or that the defendant believed, reasonably or otherwise, that  his or her conduct was lawful at the time when the conduct was  committed. . . .;'   If Section 102 became law, it would likely result in a flood of legal  actions--an engraved invitation to sue law enforcement officers.   Moreover, it will deter police from using force where the use of  force is necessary to save life or protect property--diminishing the  ability of police to provide public safety in dangerous situations.   Finally, a June 15 letter from the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF POLICE  ORGANIZATIONS--which represents one thousand professional police  associations and units and 241,000 officers throughout the United  States--wrote: ``Our most significant concerns include amending Section  242 of Title 18 United States Code to lower the standard for mens rea  (Title I Subtitle A, Section 101) and the practical elimination of  qualified immunity for law enforcement officers (Section 102).  Combined, these two provisions take away any legal protections for  officers while making it easier to prosecute them for mistakes on the  job, not just criminal acts. With the change to qualified immunity, an  officer can go to prison for an unintentional act that unknowingly  broke an unknown law. We believe in holding officers accountable for  their actions, but the consequence of this would be making criminals  out of decent cops enforcing the laws in good faith.''   I include the entire letter in the Record:                                             National Association of                                       Police Organizations, Inc.                                      Alexandria, VA, June 15, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chair, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Jordan: I am       writing to you today on behalf of the National Association of       Police Organizations (NAPO), representing over 241,000 sworn       law enforcement officers from across the country, to advise       you of our opposition to the Justice in Policing Act, H.R.       7120, as currently written.        NAPO is a coalition of police unions and associations from       across the nation, which was organized for the purpose of       advancing the interests of America's law enforcement officers       through legislative advocacy, political action and education.        Unequivocally, what happened to George Floyd was egregious.       There is no legal justification, self-defense justification,       or moral justification for the actions of the officer. We, as       rank-and-file officers, support improving policing practices.       While we do have significant concerns with several provisions       of the Justice in Policing Act, we believe there are areas       that we can come together on to address the need for greater       transparency, accountability, and training in law       enforcement. However, until our concerns are addressed, we       cannot support this legislation.        Our most significant concerns include amending Section 242       of Title 18 United States Code to lower the standard for mens       rea (Title I Subtitle A, Section 101) and the practical       elimination of qualified immunity for law enforcement       officers (Section 102). Combined, these two provisions take       away any legal protections for officers while making it       easier to prosecute them for mistakes on the job, not just       criminal acts. With the change to qualified immunity, an       officer can go to prison for an unintentional act that       unknowingly broke an unknown law. We believe in holding       officers accountable for their actions, but the consequence       of this would be making criminals out of decent cops       enforcing the laws in good faith.        Another provision of serious concern is the change proposed       to the current legal standard of ``objective reasonableness''       for the use of force outlined in the 1989 U.S. Supreme Court       decision Graham v. Connor (Sec. 364). The Supreme Court has       repeatedly said that the most important factor to consider in       applying force is the threat faced by the officer or others       at the scene. The use of force has to be reasonable given       what the officer perceived to be the threat at the time, not       with the 20/20 vision of hindsight. Law enforcement officers       across the nation take an oath that they will run towards       danger when everyone else is running away--and they do so to       protect our families and communities. Subjectively changing       the legal standard for holding officers accountable for their       actions will have a chilling effect on the men and women in       uniform. It undermines their ability to respond in an       immediate and decisive manner, and thus creates a hesitation       that would threaten the safety of our families, communities       and officers.        No cop wants to work with a bad cop--it makes the job more       dangerous and difficult. We support ensuring officers who       have substantiated serious allegations of misconduct that       have been officially and fairly adjudicated can no longer       practice law enforcement, but we must ensure officers have       due process before they are decertified. Unfortunately, one       of the underlying assumptions of the Justice in Policing Act       is that law enforcement officers should not get the right to       due process, a right we give all citizens, a right all unions       work to protect for their members in disciplinary actions.        We support creating national standards for training on de-      escalation and communication techniques to help officers to       stabilize situations and reduce the immediate threat so that       more time, options, and resources can be used to resolve the       situation without the use of force. Such training will go       much further in achieving the goals of this legislation to       reduce the use of lethal force than the lessening of legal       protections for officers. We also believe that rank-and-file       officers, as practitioners, or their representatives, must       play a role in developing national training standards.        Training standards on the use of force and de-escalation       would also reduce the use of ``chokeholds'' or carotid artery       restraints, which are already banned by law enforcement       agencies across the country as a means of less-than lethal       force for their officers. However, ``chokeholds'' are a vital       tool for officers to have when use of deadly force is       justified. If the subject poses an immediate threat to the       safety of the officer or others and a ``chokehold'' is the       officer's best or only option, it is vital that she is able       to use it. We strongly recommend against criminalizing these       maneuvers outright and we oppose making them a civil rights       violation (Sec. 362(c)). We advise prohibiting ``chokeholds''       unless deadly force is authorized.        Data collection on the use of force is key to improving       integrity and transparency in policing. It is important that       the data collected on the use of force reflects the entirety       of the situation: use of force by officers and use of force       against officers, and not just force using firearms. The       Federal Bureau of Investigation began collecting such data in       their Use of Force Database in 2019, which they established       in collaboration with state and local law enforcement.        Data collection, training, and certification all cost a       significant amount of money, yet the Justice in Policing Act       does not provide additional funding to help states and       localities comply with the many mandates of the bill. In       fact, in order to ensure compliance, it penalizes states and       law enforcement agencies by taking away all or part of the       Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne JAG) and the Community       Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Grant funding. The       consequence of this on all sectors of the criminal justice       system will be long lasting. At a time when it is well known       that state and local governments are facing serious budget       and revenue holes due to the coronavirus pandemic and       officers are facing furloughs and layoffs, this legislation       assumes that somehow governments will have the funding to       comply with the requirements of the bill. To incentivize       compliance with any police reform policies, funding must be       provided, and it is imperative that all sides have had their       voices heard. This is where the Justice in Policing Act falls       the shortest.        I have highlighted a few of the areas where we have strong       opposition and others where we agree on the intention and       goal. There are additional areas of the Justice in Policing       Act not covered in this letter with which we have concerns       and those whose objectives we support. We urge you to       consider our concerns and the perspective of the officers on       the street and give us a seat at the table as this       legislation moves forward. Until that consideration is       granted, we oppose the Justice in Policing Act.        Thank you for your attention to our concerns and we hope to       work collaboratively with you to improve policing practices       in America. Please feel free to contact me if you would like       to discuss our concerns further.            Sincerely,                                          William J. Johnson, Esq.,                                                Executive Director.
