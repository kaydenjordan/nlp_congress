 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Kevin Hern, from the  great State of Oklahoma not only for his leadership on the Republican  Study Committee Budget and Spending Task Force--ably chairing that  committee--but also as an advocate for more domestic energy production  to deal with this energy crisis.    Like your constituents in Oklahoma, my constituents in rural Kentucky  are feeling the pain. I was just with some farmers in Fleming County,  Kentucky, on Friday when we were back in the district. And one of the  farmers stood up, and he said: I don't know where you get your numbers  in Washington, Congressman, but 8.6 percent doesn't sound right for us  in Fleming County.   It is more than twice that. It is painful to fill up the diesel in  our tractor. It is impossible for us to fill up our trucks to get  around to move our produce. This is not 8.6 percent. You all don't know  what the real number is and how it affects real Americans.   That is how bad this inflation crisis is. But I rise in strong  support of this Republican Study Committee's proposed Federal budget.  Our Nation is over $30 trillion in debt. This debt crisis threatens the  long-term prosperity of every American. It is that debt, and it is that  overspending, Mr. Speaker, that has helped to usher in this historic  inflation crisis that is crushing my constituents in Fleming County and  so many other middle-class Americans across this country.   The RSC budget restores fiscal responsibility to Washington by  balancing the Federal budget within 10 years and rescuing America from  bankruptcy, stopping the spending binge in this town.   Let's be clear, we will never balance the Federal budget if Democrats  continue their spending spree. We will never balance the budget  continuing this reckless deficit-producing fiscal policy and  threatening tax hikes in this ``build back better'' calamity that fails  to raise revenue, but instead would crush economic growth and actually  diminish the tax base.   We will also never balance the budget if the Biden administration  continues its inexplicable war on American energy, which is key to  economic growth, key to reducing the deficit. That is why I commend RSC  Budget and Spending Task Force chairman, Kevin Hern, for including my  legislation in the budget, the Fair Access to Banking Act.   This legislation, the Fair Access to Banking Act, protects key  American industries, such as energy producers, from discrimination by  banks and lenders who politicize access to capital to satisfy the  radical agenda of climate extremists.   And here is the irony: We all care about the environment, especially  farmers. We care about the environment. They are the ultimate  environmentalists. But what sense does it make to deprive financing to  the very energy companies that can innovate our way to solutions to the  climate issue.   When President Biden was sworn into office, gas prices averaged $2.36  across the country. This month, gas prices reached $5 nationally for  the first time--and they are on their way to $6 a gallon.   In less than 2 years, our Nation went from energy dominant to energy  desperate. And yet, the Biden administration continues to push ESG  investments and regulations such as the SEC's new climate risk  disclosure rule designed to choke off investment in energy production.   The Biden administration for sure is blocking construction of the  Keystone XL pipeline, another energy infrastructure. It is halting new  lease sales for oil and gas. It is stonewalling over 4,400 permits to  drill. It is thwarting new large-scale refineries. And this has all  contributed to constraining energy supply, contributing to inflation.   But ground zero in this war against domestic energy production is the  Biden administration's weaponization  [[Page H5724]]  of financial regulation to redirect capital away from fossil energy.  The European financial sector, Wall Street banks, large, woke asset  managers have all started the trend of politicizing capital allocation  through the environmental, social, and governance movement. But the  Biden administration's Security and Exchange Commission is now making  matters worse by proposing a regulation that would force every public  company to disclose reams of immaterial and unreliable information  about the Green House gas emissions arising from their operations, the  producers of energy they consume, and even the activities of their  suppliers and customers.   This 534-page monstrosity marks the transformation of the SEC from an  independent agency dedicated to investor protection to an unaccountable  and politicized bureaucracy intent on advancing radical environmental  policy over which it has neither jurisdiction nor competency.   Not only does this regulation discriminate against affordable,  reliable energy by redirecting capital away from the American energy  sector, it directly conflicts with the SEC's mission to protect  investors. While asset managers continually prioritize ESG funds, the  fees for those funds are actually, on average, 43 percent higher than  nonESG funds.    Stocks and many ESG-related exchange-traded funds have elevated  price-to-earnings multiples precisely because investment returns are  sacrificed for nonpecuniary factors and policy objectives like social  justice, diversity quotas, and lower carbon emissions.   It is time for us to stand up for American energy dominance. It is  time for us to stand up for the American energy sector. It is time for  us to stand up to retail investors who depend on returns instead of  some woke political agenda that, frankly, they don't care about.   My farmers in Fleming County depend on returns. They depend on  affordable electricity. Washington is out of touch with the reality and  the hardships of American savers and American workers who can't afford  Biden's inflation. That is why we need this budget.   Now more than ever we must defend and encourage investments in  American energy production to lower costs for Americans at the pump.   Mr. Speaker, the duel visions for the future of America on this issue  could not be clearer. On the one hand, Congressional Democrats are  doubling down on a dangerous agenda in the middle of a generational  energy crisis at cost to millions of middle-class Americans. Out of  touch.   On the other hand, Republicans are renewing our commitment through  the Fair Access to Banking provision contained in this budget to  require lending to be based on risk-based metrics, not on the woke  politics of the day.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with my Republican colleagues in  support of this budget. I am proud to stand with Americans who depend  on energy independence and energy dominance and affordable, reliable  energy.   I ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand with  the American people, not with woke Wall Street, not with large asset  managers who put politics ahead of returns. Vote for the Republican  Study Committee budget.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership of my friend from Oklahoma.                                time  2000
