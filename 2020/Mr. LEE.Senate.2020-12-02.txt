 Mr. President, it is nothing short of a tragedy when anyone  suffers from ALS. This is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, one  that attacks the nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord of its  victims and eventually affects control of the muscles, even the muscles  that are needed to move, to speak, eat, breathe, and otherwise live.   Sadly, this is a disease that is always fatal. The average life  expectancy is only 2 to 5 years following diagnosis. Not only are the  people who suffer from ALS robbed of time but also their ability to  work, imposing great hardships on them and on their families.   The bill that we had before us today to help these victims by  reforming our Social Security Disability Insurance Program is a good  cause, and it is one that I think we all support, but I think it goes  about the job in the wrong way. It sets bad precedent, and it fails to  include other needed reform.   We must remember that ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, is one of many  similarly debilitating and deadly diseases that Americans are suffering  from today. While not as well known, all of these victims are also  deserving of the same kind of special attention and accommodation in  Federal policy.   Let's review some of the background of the program. The Social  Security Disability Insurance Program, or SSDI, was created, in part,  to help people who suffer from conditions like ALS, providing monthly  cash benefits to those who become disabled and therefore unable to  work.   One challenge with a program like this is that the agency  administering the program, that is, the Social Security Administration,  has to verify an applicant's eligibility for benefits before they can  start sending out the checks. Today, eligibility determination takes an  average of 3\1/2\ months. For some people and for some diseases,  including ALS, 3\1/2\ months can be a dangerously long time.   So, in 2018, the SSA established a new policy to fast track the  application process for those with serious and urgent medical  conditions. Under this Compassionate Allowance Initiative, more than  200 diseases now automatically make applicants eligible for expedited  review.   But while the Compassionate Allowance Initiative shortens the  determination process from an average of several months to an average  of 39 days, there is still a lengthy 5-month waiting period to actually  start receiving the benefits, and in the case of urgent, fatal  diseases, that is still too long of a wait.   The bill that we have before us today seeks to address this problem  but only for the victims of ALS. Now, obviously, we should try and help  the victims of this tragic disease to the very best of our ability.  They are not, however, the only ones who need to be helped. Of the list  of compassionate allowance conditions, some are just as urgent as ALS  and some are even worse. There are, sadly, several for which there is  no known cure and that have life expectancies that are terribly short.   I want to cite some examples. For instance, Creutfeldt-Jakob disease,  a degenerative brain disorder, is among these. This particular disease  leads to dementia and most often results in death within 6 to 12  months. Tragically, there is no cure, and around 1,000 Americans are  diagnosed with it every single year, including a dear friend of mine in  Utah who a couple of years ago passed away from this ailment.   Another is cardiac amyloidosis, also known as stiff heart syndrome.  This disease affects the way electrical signals move through the heart,  leading to abnormal heartbeats and faulty heart signals. For those  diagnosed, there is no known cure, and they typically face a life  expectancy of only about 6 months after the onset of congestive heart  failure. About 4,000 people develop this condition each year.   Take peritoneal mesothelioma, this disease is a cancer that develops  in the lining of the abdomen, usually leading to death within 12 months  of the first signs of illness. Around 600 cases are diagnosed every  year in the United States.   That is why I have been working for the past year with my colleagues  to broaden the scope of this legislation, so that Congress doesn't  waive the SSDI waiting period one disease at a time. It should not  matter which fatal, rapidly progressing and debilitating disease an  American is suffering from--all fatal diseases with no known cure  should have access to disability benefits after their Social Security  Administration determination.   The men and women who suffer from those conditions and the family  members affected by their ailments have precious little time left, and  they are just as worthy of help. They are certainly no less worthy of  help than those with ALS. There is always hope that a cure can be found  for them or  [[Page S7170]]  that, at the very least, a new treatment can further extend the life of  these men and women. Rather than removing the waiting period for those  with one specific disease, we should remove the waiting period for  those who suffer from any of a small select group of conditions that  have no cure and have the shortest life expectancies. There is no  reason we cannot help those who suffer from ALS and these other  conditions. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can protect  victims of ALS and these other conditions as well.    The bill, as written, sets the stage for only those diseases that  have the most recognition and, to put it bluntly, the most fundraising  backing to fund bill sponsors, and it would set at a disadvantage the  conditions that are far more rare and underfunded. Who will be the  voice for the men and women who suffer from those diseases? Who will  fight for them? Adding similarly cruel maladies to this list takes  nothing away from ALS, and it can make all the difference in the world  for Americans suffering from similar disabilities.   I had hoped to offer my broader approach as an amendment, but after  months and months of working with the Social Security Administration  and with the Congressional Budget Office, I was, unfortunately, given  incomplete information at the time an agreement was reached on  scheduling a vote on this bill. I appreciate Senator Cotton's and  Senator Braun's patience in allowing me to work towards a fix while  they remain committed to advancing their legislation, for which I  commend them.   Additionally, while I would have hoped that my work with the Social  Security Administration and the Congressional Budget Office could have  gone more quickly, I do appreciate their efforts to address my  questions and compile the necessary information and tools to estimate  my amendment's fiscal impact.   While I was pleased to see Senator Grassley's amendment, which at  least would have paid for the removal of the waiting period for ALS, I  will continue to work on legislation that will remove the waiting  period for diseases that meet a set of criteria--no known cure with a  life expectancy of less than 5 years--while not further jeopardizing  the solvency of the disability insurance program. It will be ready for  introduction soon.   My concerns and efforts have not been about waiving the SSDI waiting  period for those who tragically suffer from ALS. I certainly agree that  we ought to improve the time that they have left. But picking and  choosing favorites among those with comparable conditions is not the  right way to go about it. The lives of the men and women who suffer  from other very similar conditions are just as valuable, and we should  be a voice for them, too.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 1044 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Lee  substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; and the  bill, as amended, be considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friend and  colleague, Congressman   Rob Bishop. After 18 years of service in the  U.S. House of Representatives, he has decided to hang up his gloves and  embark on his well-deserved retirement.     Rob Bishop has served Utah's First Congressional District with  integrity, tenacity, humility, and humor, and it is my high privilege  to have worked with him over the last 10 years and, in the process, to  have become his friend.   Born and raised in Kaysville, UT, Rob has been a lifelong resident of  Utah's First Congressional District, with the exception of the 2-year  mission where he lived in Germany while representing the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He graduated from Davis High School  with high honors and later graduated magna cum laude from the  University of Utah with a degree in political science.   The embodiment of a public servant, Rob began his career as a high  school teacher at Ben Lomond High School and Box Elder High School,  teaching courses in German, AP U.S. history and government, and  coaching debate. He notoriously had one rule in the classroom: I am  never wrong. That might tell you something about   Rob Bishop.   An avid lover of musicals, he was active in community theater, where  he happened to have met his wife Jeralynn. They first met on the  production of ``South Pacific'' at the Palace Playhouse, and they later  starred together as the prince and princess in a production of ``Once  Upon a Mattress.'' In their real-life love story, they have five  children--Shule, Jarom, Zenock, Maren, and Jashon, with spouses  Melissa, Kristin, Shalise, and Courtney, as well as nine grandchildren.   Inspired in his public service by Barry Goldwater, he was also  involved in local politics from a young age, working at various levels  of government and of the Republican Party. He has gone from being a  precinct chair to a member of the Republican National Committee and  from being vice chair of the Davis County Teenage Republican Club to  the adviser to the Utah Teenage Republicans in 1996. Starting in 1997,  he served two terms as chairman of the Utah Republican Party.   At just 25, he was elected to the Utah House of Representatives when  he was known for always wearing sweaters and no socks. He served in the  State legislature for 16 years and, during the last 2 years, having  been unanimously elected, served as speaker of the house of  representatives.   In 2002, after serving in the State legislature and having spent 28  years of teaching, he decided to serve at the national level. As   Rob  Bishop said in one of his most popular campaign slogans: ``Utah has  plenty of Bishops--send this one to Washington!''   Rob has faithfully devoted his life to representing Utah's First  Congressional District, and he has been doing that ever since making  that critical decision to run for Congress.   I remember one of the first times I worked with him when Rob was a  relatively new Member of Congress and I was serving at the time as  general counsel to then-Governor Jon Huntsman. At the time, a private  fuel storage organization was trying to store spent nuclear fuel rods  in above-ground storage casks along the Wasatch Front corridor, just  miles from Utah's major metropolitan area and just under the low- altitude flight path of fighter jets flying between Hill Air Force Base  to the Utah Test and Training Range.   Out of all of the Members of Utah's congressional delegation at the  time, all of whom, I would adhere, were similarly opposed to this  proposal to store spent nuclear fuel in this particular place in this  particular way--our congressional delegation was united in  [[Page S7171]]  that regard--but   Rob Bishop stood out as one who was particularly  concerned about it and was particularly determined to prevent such a  dangerous idea from taking place.   Congressman Bishop had a full understanding of the problem, and he  had a complete mastery of the scientific facts of the issue, and he had  detailed, helpful ideas about how to address it. He also understood the  significant and long-lasting potential ramifications that this plan  could have had for Hill Air Force Base and the Utah Test and Training  Range.   Thanks to   Rob Bishop's vision, direction, and determination, he  developed a strategy and worked hard to implement that strategy and  eventually worked to pass a bill designating the area in question as  wilderness--creating a wilderness curtain around the designated storage  area--making it impossible for the storage plant to be completed.   Rob  Bishop thus successfully prevented spent nuclear fuel rods from coming  to Utah and being stored in a particularly unsafe way and in an unsafe  place close to Utah's major population center.   Though relatively new to Congress at the time, Rob was punching way  above his weight. Why? Well, because he is awesome and because he was  willing to dive into the nitty-gritty details of an issue and put  in the hard work, not knowing and, frankly, not even caring who got the  credit. Rob Bishop just wanted to get it done. That is who   Rob Bishop  is, that is how he serves, and that is why we love him. That has  characterized   Rob Bishop's entire time in Congress: doggedly,  thoughtfully, and honestly working for Utahns' best interests, and  never really caring much who got the attention.    He served on the Armed Services Committee, the powerful House Rules  Committee, and the Science Committee. As both chair and ranking member  of the Natural Resources Committee, he chaired hearings with his  characteristically witty quips and wry jokes. He has also chaired the  Congressional Western Caucus, served on the House German Caucus for his  whole tenure, including for 2 years as chair, and he helped found the  10th Amendment Task Force.   When Speaker of the House John Boehner created committees for  congressional reform,   Rob Bishop was named chairman of the Committee  for Procedural Reform and, later on, leader of the Rules group. Under  Speaker Paul Ryan, he was named chair of the Federalism Committee. Rob  did all this in addition to being a staunch advocate for the military  and, in particular, for Hill Air Force Base.   One of his proudest achievements was getting an extension of the  Michaels airstrip at the Dugway Proving Ground in Tooele County. When  he was told that there was no funding for it to be attained at the  Federal level, he successfully got the Utah State Legislature to  appropriate the funding to make it happen. He was instrumental in  establishing Falcon Hill, an aerospace research park just outside of  Hill Air Force Base and a public-private partnership between the Air  Force, the State of Utah, and private developers that was the first of  its kind anywhere in the country and a model of many more like it to  come.   Rob has also brought his love of baseball with him to Washington. A  huge admirer of Mickey Mantle and Ernie Banks, Rob is known to have  actual dirt from the pitcher's mound at Yankee Stadium in his  Washington, DC, office. He has been a long-time supporter of the Salt  Lake Bees, even championing the construction of their stadium while he  was in the State legislature, and he is a diehard Cubs fan. Every year,  he dons a uniform himself, leading his office in the intramural  baseball league on Capitol Hill, with their team name known as the  ``Raucus Caucus.''   Rob has brought the same passion he has for baseball to serving his  constituents. He has, for years, worked with the Close Up Foundation to  bring high school students to Washington, and he has partnered with  teachers and students to put on an AP government conference every year.   He has famously led constituent and student groups on long, expert  nighttime tours of the Capitol Building. In fact, he is known as the  guy who gives the very best Capitol tours in all of Washington, and he  has consistently spent hours upon hours late into the night making  personal phone calls to each constituent who writes in to his office.   One of my favorite things about   Rob Bishop is precisely how  understated and down to Earth and often self-deprecating he is. It is a  true feat when you have been in Congress as long as he has and  accomplished as many things as he has.   While he is known for his sharp three-piece suits here in Washington,  I can't count the number of plane rides I have taken with   Rob Bishop  where he shows up on the plane actually wearing gym shorts, sandals,  and a hoodie. In fact, basically every time, he has given me the sage  advice not to torture myself wearing a suit while on a 4-hour plane  ride.   In fact, just the other day--just this week, as we were flying from  Salt Lake City to Washington, DC, he commended me for finally having  gotten the memo. At least this time, as he noted, I wasn't wearing a  suit, although he derided me a little bit for not wearing shorts.   But when you have a conversation with   Rob Bishop, you never feel  that he is trying to advance his own agenda or gain attention or  fanfare. As a matter of fact, it is quite the opposite. It feels like a  real conversation with a real goal to fix a problem. He simply tells it  like it is--an altogether rare, refreshing, and much needed quality on  Capitol Hill.    When Rob ran for Congress, he said it was his goal to make Congress  less powerful when he left than it was when he came. In all of his time  here, he sought to put power in Washington back in the hands of Utahns  and back in the hands of people across the country in their respective  States. Just so, in all his time here, he slept on either an air  mattress or on a futon so that he wouldn't get too comfortable, so that  he would never feel too ``at home'' in Congress.   Rare is the person who can come to change Washington but not ever be  changed by Washington.   Rob Bishop has managed to do just that. He has  made a real difference for the people of Utah and the people of the  United States of America.   It has been a distinct pleasure to call him a friend and a colleague,  and I have to say I am going to miss   Rob Bishop's service here in  Washington. Just the same, we have all benefited and we will all  continue to benefit for many decades to come from what he has done  here, who he has been here, and what he has stood for here so valiantly  and consistently and faithfully and with such great decency and  humility.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
