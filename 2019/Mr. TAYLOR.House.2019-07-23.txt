 Madam Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Allen  Independent School District for being named a District of Distinction  by District Administration Magazine.   Allen ISD serves thousands of students grades K through 12 in a  rapidly growing community. In an effort to meet growing needs of the  community, Allen ISD launched a STEAM Center to provide a unique  learning environment to help foster an interest in STEAM amongst  students. The brand-new facility offers students hands-on learning  experiences ranging from indoor robotics labs to outdoor discovery  gardens.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to  join me today in congratulating Allen ISD, their staff, parents, and  students for being named District of Distinction and commend them on  their dedication to cultivating a passion in students for learning more  about science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics.
