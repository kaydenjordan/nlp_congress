 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for  yielding.   I rise today to recognize the passing of my friend and colleague,  Representative Don Young.   While many accomplished and effective men and women have served here  in the House of Representatives over the years, very few have built a  legacy like Representative Young.   Over the last almost 12 years, I have had the honor of serving with  him on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where he spent  untold hours fighting for stronger investment in American  infrastructure. The Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act on the  floor today is just one of many examples of this.   Don took his job as dean of the House seriously. He regularly offered  advice to colleagues, like his warnings to me to never shave my beard.  He was eager to welcome Members and their families to Capitol Hill. My  kids loved getting a tour of his office and hearing his wild hunting  stories.   Representative Young will be remembered for his boisterous  personality and outrageous anecdotes, but above all, he will be  remembered for his passion for the people of Alaska.   I am thankful for the time I served with Representative Young, and my  prayers are with his family, friends, staff, and constituents.   Today, I encourage my colleagues to honor our friend and support H.R.  6865.    Madam Speaker, I hereby remove my name as cosponsor of  H.R. 7010.
