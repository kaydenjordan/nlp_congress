 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a highly  regarded business leader, mentor, and community leader from Flint, MI:  Mr. Willie Eldrage Artis, founder and owner of Genesee Packaging, who  passed away on June 2, 2022, at the age of 88. Mr. Artis made an  immeasurable impact as a partner to the automotive industry, on the  Flint community, and the State of Michigan over the past 40 years. It  is a privilege and a sorrow both to recognize him here today and  celebrate his lifework and many achievements.   Born in 1934, Willie spent the first 18 years of his life living with  his parents in Memphis, TN, amid the height of the South's Jim Crow  Era. Though difficult, these years instilled in Willie an unfailing  work ethic and the ability to stand up for himself and his rights, even  in the most difficult of circumstances. After leaving for Chicago,  Willie began working on the manufacturing floor of the Triangle  Container Corrugated Company, learning the ins-and-outs of the  packaging business from the ground up. He brought this knowledge with  him when he moved to Flint in 1964 and began working for Flint  Boxmakers. In just 2 years, he was promoted to manufacturing manager.   In 1979, Willie and a fellow colleague of color took advantage of the  recently issued minority business programs administered by General  Motors to leverage their years of expertise and open Genesee Packaging.  Since its formation, Genesee Packaging has been a place of opportunity  for the community to gain employment and increased access to economic  achievement for customers and employees alike.   His energetic service to the Flint community and State of Michigan  included his membership with the Michigan Minority Business Development  Council, Genesys Health Systems, the Flint Public Library, and the  Flint Business and Development Council. In 1989, he was appointed to  serve on Governor James Blanchard's entrepreneurial business  commission, was inducted into the Junior Achievement Business Hall of  Fame in 2001, and in 2005 received special recognition from Governor  Jennifer Granholm for his many contributions to the State of Michigan.  Additional recognition for his work in minority business development  and civil rights came from then President Bill Clinton, the U.S.  Senate, the Michigan House of Representatives, the State of Michigan,  and the city of Flint.   In October of 2019, Willie published his memoir in a book titled  ``From Jim Crow to CEO: The Willie E. Artis Story,'' where he shared  his lessons from life and business as one of America's most honored  industrialists. His story embodies that of the American dream, rising  up from poverty through determination and hard work, embracing  entrepreneurship and becoming a sought-after partner by top  corporations and even the White House during the Obama administration.   I cannot understate the impact that Mr. Artis has had on the city of  Flint and State of Michigan. A pillar of strength and leadership  throughout the community and the embodiment of generosity to those who  knew him personally, Willie will no doubt be missed, but his legacy  will endure. I ask you to join me--and Willie's beloved wife Veronica,  their children, and their grandchildren--in recognizing and celebrating  his life and numerous accomplishments. I hope that each of us can find  some comfort in the precious moments and memories that were shared with  him.                            ____________________
