 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life of Dr. Lester Johnson, Jr., who passed away on November 29, 2017,  at 91 years of age. Dr. Johnson's work to provide a high-quality  education to all students in Savannah, Georgia, has truly made our  community a better place to live.   His teaching career spanned 43 years, with 20 of those years teaching  at Alfred E. Beach High School, a place where he was a student himself.  Dr. Johnson passionately taught industrial arts and mathematics  classes, and he received the Beach High School Teacher of the Year  Award in 1961.   In 1969, Dr. Johnson began to teach students at Savannah State  University, where he later received the university's Distinguished  Teaching Award in 1991.   Dr. Johnson's accomplishments don't stop with education. A few of his  many accomplishments include being a former State representative and  the first African-American Eagle Scout in Savannah.   Dr. Lester Johnson's students leave his legacy throughout the First  Congressional District and the rest of our Nation. He will truly be  missed.                            ____________________
