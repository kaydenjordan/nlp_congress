 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for  yielding.   I have been here long enough to see my Republican colleagues bring to  the floor these bills and plop them down heavily on the table.   I have been here long enough to have citizens assault me in a town  meeting and ask: ``Have you read the bill?''  [[Page H1765]]    I have been here long enough to hear the demagoguery about: ``What's  in the bill? Do you know what's in the bill? Have you read the bill?  How can you do this?''   I have heard demagoguery about the 3-day rule. I call it the 24-hour- and-2-second rule. That is the last second of the first day, 24 hours  of the second day, and the first second of the third day. We are not  even going to make that. This was filed at 8 o'clock last night.   I ask any Member in this House to join me in the well if you have  read this bill. Join me if you have read this bill.   No one is joining me.   These are earmarks. They call them authorizing legislation, but they  are earmarks. They are pieces of legislation in this bill that are  against the rules, of course, but we will waive those rules. They are  things that were gone through in the dark of night, at 8 o'clock last  night.    These are the appropriations bills, the only piece of this  legislation that were done properly.    When the Speaker became the Speaker, he said: ``We will  advance major legislation one issue at a time.''   How can any self-respecting Member of this House, how can any self- respecting Republican who made that representation to my Tea Party  friends, vote for this rule?   I have no idea.   This is an abomination of the legislative process. You have had 6  months to get it right. Six weeks ago, the Speaker promised that an  issue of great importance to us, DACA, would be solved. It hasn't been  addressed, much less solved.   But the real problem is that nobody knows what is in this  legislation. With all due respect to the chairman of the Rules  Committee, he hasn't read this bill.    Mr. McGovern hasn't read the bill. I have not read the  bill. It was 8 o'clock last night. The only person that could read this  bill is the supercomputers. None of us even claim to be supercomputers.   This rule ought to go down. Very frankly, there are a lot of things  in here I know that I like and I know that everybody else likes, but if  we defeat the rule, we ought to go back to a process that we can  respect, that you argued you were going to follow, that you pledged to  the American people you were going to follow, and that Mr. Cantor and  Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Ryan wrote a book about and said they were going  to change this institution and do it right.   This is wrong. Vote ``no.''                                time  1015     Mr. Speaker, not a single person has read this bill. It  was filed at 8 o'clock last night. If we had put this on the floor, not  a single one of those on the other side of the aisle would have voted  for it. Not one.   They have demagogued for years about reading the bills. This doesn't  come close to their 3-day layover rule. Not close. It is being rushed  through because some have fundraisers, perhaps, this weekend, or have  flights or codels they want to go on. We have wasted 6 months in  passing the appropriations bills, which, supposedly, should have been  passed by September 30 of last year.   No one can be proud of this process. The Speaker said, when we set  the caps, that he would bring a bill to the floor. He promised the 73  of us that made it possible to set these caps--because you don't have  the votes on your side--that he would bring to this floor a fix for the  Dreamers who are at risk of being kicked out of the country. I know  there is a case, but it is short-term, not permanent. The Speaker did  not keep that promise. It has not been on the floor.   What we now have on the floor is an appropriations bill. I think most  of us know what is in this appropriations bill. These are earmarks. You  don't call them earmarks. You call them authorizing language. They are  bills that  [[Page H2022]]  nobody in the Appropriations Committee has read. If you have, stand up  and correct me. As I said, nobody has read that either.   This is report language. Come to the well if you have read this  language.                                time  1200    None of you--none of you--would support this process if we had  offered it.   Now, the good news is that what the Appropriations Committee has done  is quality work; and I congratulate Mrs. Lowey, Mr. Frelinghuysen, the  subcommittee chairs, and the ranking members. It is worthy of support.  But I am waiting for all the Tea Party people who harangued me and  others on my side about reading the bills, giving us sufficient time to  consider them. The Speaker of the House said, when he became Speaker:  We will take issues one at a time.   Is there no shame?   Is there no realization of the hypocrisy that is being displayed?   Mr. Speaker, the product is a good one. And I say that about the  appropriations bill. I have no idea what all the report language says.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker, and I thank Mrs. Lowey.   Mr. Speaker, we brought this country from the brink of depression to  a growing, robust economy with a stock market that has almost tripled  by passing the National Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Not a single  Republican voted for that, Mr. Speaker. Not one. I wonder how many will  vote for this bill after they have said time after time, after time,  after time: Read the bill; have 3 days' layover.   Actually, your 3-day rule is a 24-hour-and-2-second rule: the last  second of the first day, 24 hours of the second day, and the first  second of the third day. You put everybody in a quandary because this  is a good product that the Appropriations Committee has delivered. It  does good things for our country, both in terms of national security  and in terms of domestic investment.   What a sad state of affairs. How dysfunctional this body has become.  How marginalized has the Appropriations Committee, on which I was so  proud to serve, has become. Rushing it through in just a matter of  minutes. It is a sad day, Mr. Speaker.
