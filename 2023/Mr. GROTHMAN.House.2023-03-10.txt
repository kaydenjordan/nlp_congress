 Mr. Speaker, I would like to discuss three issues. Some  have gotten attention, and some have not this week, but all of them are  important, and I would say none of them got the attention they deserve.   The first issue to talk about is the size of our Federal debt.   Now, I know, ever since I was a child, people have talked about  deficit spending and the amount of the Federal debt that someday the  children or grandchildren will have to pay off.   I think it is important to look, though, that this time things really  are different. The only time the Federal debt ever got to the total  gross national product in this country--which is one way to compare  debt at different times in our country's history--was when it actually  hit 100 percent at the end of World War II. That is not surprising.   If you know people who lived during World War II, Mr. Speaker, the  entire economy was devoted to munitions, a huge percent of our  population was in the armed services, and we hit 100 percent.   However--unlike now--when the war ended, it was easy to reduce  Federal spending. Hundreds of thousands of troops were, in essence,  laid off and sent back to work in the private sector, we stopped  building the ships, planes, and tanks we needed during the war, and as  a result, over the next 30 years, the amount of the Federal debt  dropped from 100 percent of GDP down to around 30 percent. It bounced  back and forth around that level, maybe 40 percent, all the way to  about 1995.   Even then that was too big, and people commented at the time, but the  debt was about 30 to 45 percent of GDP.   Then, beginning with around 2010, things began to shoot up, and in  COVID they shot up even more. We are now--or within a couple years will  be--where we were at the end of World War II. But there are no tank  factories or ship factories to shut down, and we can't lay off hundreds  of thousands of troops.   Indeed, any Congressman knows that basically our day is spent  attending meetings in our offices when we are here with various groups  asking for spending increases and saying that they absolutely need  them.   So this time, we really are in a crisis.   Not only are we in a situation in which we are approaching 100  percent of our debt equaling 100 percent of GDP, but because interest  rates are going up and the huge increase in debt the last 2 years, the  amount we are paying in interest is skyrocketing.   We cannot reduce the interest. If we had interest on our debt--which  we anticipate will go up in the next year from $640 billion a year to  $740 billion a year--that is a $100 billion spending increase that we  have no control over.   As the debt continues to go up and as the Federal Reserve feels--and  I was in a committee hearing yesterday both the Republican witnesses  and Democrat witnesses felt given what inflation was going on, as the  Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, the amount of  interest that we have to pay every year goes up.   Think about that, Mr. Speaker. We have got about a $100 billion  increase in the difference between what we are going to pay in interest  in 2023 and 2024 before we look at anything else.   So the fact that this budget proposal contains more spending is, by  itself, deeply concerning. It shows that the basic numbers have not  gotten through the heads of the Biden administration, or maybe they  feel that by the time we finally hit the wall and the value of the  dollar will have a hard time paying off our debt, that he will be in a  retirement home and other people will have to deal with it.   But the American public should know that for the first time since  World War II, we are approaching having the total debt equal to 100  percent of our GDP--a complete crisis.   The next thing to look at is if we must spend more, then where does  President Biden feel it has to be spent?   One place it is not going to be spent, one place that we actually  have a reduction here, is homeland security. The biggest crisis we have  in this country is people streaming across our southern border. But we  can find over a 10 percent increase for the Department of Commerce, we  can find almost a 10 percent increase for the Department of the  Interior, an 11 percent increase for the Department of Labor, and a 19  percent increase for the Environmental Protection Agency, but when it  comes down to the one thing that you turn on the TV every night and  say, wow, we have to spend more money there, on the Department of  Homeland Security there is a 1 percent reduction.   This is where our President is.   We are going to continue to have increased spending across the  board--some of which is necessary--but the one place we don't have an  increase is homeland security. That and transportation. I take that to  be because we just had the huge infrastructure bill and, therefore, we  don't need an increase in the spending on transportation.   The other thing I would like to point out, as you dig deeper into the  budget, with regard to any agency you look at, Mr. Speaker, you have  more money for bureaucrats devoted to dividing America by race: We have  to do more to favor this race or that race or this gender or that  gender.   That is so offensive and un-American. I am going to address it a lot  more in a few minutes. But it is interesting that at the time we are  getting the highest amount of debt as a percentage of GDP in my  lifetime, the President responds by saying that the one area that we  absolutely have to have more in is hiring bureaucrats whose job depends  on telling America we have a racist problem and we have to identify  people by race. That is a big problem.   So I encourage the American public to pay attention to the budget,  pay attention to the fact that we are hitting in our lifetimes the  greatest debt ever, and pay attention to the fact that even before we  argue and quibble about how much the Department of Education should go  up or down or how much we should spend more or less on defense, we are  going to have a $100 billion increase in the amount of interest we pay  next year.    The next area to look at--and I mentioned that the Biden  administration actually feels we can reduce the total amount we are  spending on homeland security--is I wish the press would spend more  time seeing what is happening with the children at our southern border.   There was, in retrospect, a relatively small number of children who  had to be separated from their parents who had  [[Page H1275]]  broken the law, and by court order those children were returned to  their parents in either 15 or 30 days. It was a relatively small  number.   Now you look, Mr. Speaker, and it varies from month to month, but it  is not unusual to have 8,000 to 10,000 unaccompanied children enter  this country every month.   Where are all of these people who, a few years ago, were alarmed that  some young people would have to spend 2 weeks without their parents,  and now we have 8,000 to 10,000 kids a month entering America?   We don't spin them back around and say: Go back to your parents where  they belong.   Instead, we look at an address that perhaps is attached to their  shirt that says 123 Elm Street, Portland, Oregon, and the Border Patrol  or the agencies, like Catholic Social Services, find some way to  deliver that child where it says on the address.   Does anybody feel that is outlandish?   I know the individual Border Patrol agencies think how horrible that  is.   We do know that sometimes when children come with people who they  believe are their parents, the Border Patrol gets suspicious and does  DNA tests. It is not unusual to find that people try to bring children  across and say that they are their children, you do a DNA test, and you  find out they are not. So we already realize there are sketchy things  going on down there.   What becomes of these children whom their parents send across the  southern border?   Some of them have to go to work. The New York Times had an  interesting article about that recently. When parents send their  children to work then the children perhaps are supposed to send money  back to Central America and to South America.                                time  1245    We know that people who are crossing the southern border--depending  upon where they are from--the drug gangs are taking advantage of the  open border policy by President Biden, and the drug kings are demanding  payment, perhaps payment coming back from America. Is it right that a  young child without their parents gets shipped somewhere in America and  has to work in some factory, and some of the money is sent to the drug  cartels, other money is sent back home to the parents? Is that good? Is  that what America wants to encourage? America is responsible for  allowing this system to continue. And what do the kids do?   At least The New York Times says they work in factories--maybe there  can be safer factories--but they work in factories. How many are  working, for example, in the sex trade? Who knows? This is something  the press ought to be paying more attention to. I intend to have a  hearing on this topic sometime within the next 6 weeks, and hopefully  we can find out a little bit more about what happens to these  individual kids.   If the people, including the media, who is so alarmed that the kids  of parents who have broken the law had to spend a couple weeks apart  from their parents, if this media would wake up a little bit, they  would find a lot more kids are being permanently separated from their  parents or at least separated from them for years and years at the  border. If the press would wake up, they would be able to apply the  pressure that we need to get these children back to their parents.   I will give another example along the lines of keeping families  together. I know that there are devotees of Black Lives Matter who  don't believe in the traditional family, they would rather have  families without a dad at home, but I still believe that is best. What  happens when a child shows up at the southern border with only one  parent?   Now, we know in the United States in our court system if the parents  are separated, frequently there are court orders. Both mom and dad have  to stay relatively close to the child. We don't let one parent grab the  child without the other parent signing off and run to a different part  of the country.   Nevertheless, the Border Patrol is worried--and they are on the  ground--they are worried when they see children show up with one parent  and not the other parent. Has anybody adjudicated this? Have any social  workers determined this is okay or is it just one parent who doesn't  care about the other parent bringing their children here? The United  States apparently takes no interest as families are being torn apart.   Again, this is something that my subcommittee will look at, but it  shouldn't take that long. It should be the comatose American press  corps who right now is paying attention and saying where is the legal  documentation that allows you to show up with your parents and the  other parent be gone? This desire to get rid of the nuclear family or  deprive children from south of the border of their mom or dad is  offensive, and the United States is part of it.   I hope that the Biden administration does something about it, and I  hope when we ever get around to an immigration bill or that a new  President gets in office that the policy is such that we are not going  to take one child unless we know where both parents are.   Now, the third issue is an issue that is so dear to President Biden's  administration. When he was sworn in as President--I actually attended  his inaugural speech, being the bipartisan guy that I am--President  Biden addressed racism four times and white supremacy once. I think it  is unusual when we obsess over racism in this country. We are obviously  about the least racist country that existed, right? People come here  from all around the world. People back in the eastern hemisphere fight  Tribe against Tribe in Africa. They fight country against country in  Europe. Different states or different religions fight and kill each  other in India, but they all come here to America, and they get along  just fine.   Nevertheless, Joe Biden is obsessed with the idea that we have a  horrible racist country, and we have to weigh in and perhaps give  preferences to people one way or the other. So we get the drum beat of  racism, racism, racism. We heard it again in his State of the Union  speech. In his State of the Union speech, Joe Biden couldn't resist but  go after the police in this country and say that Black parents have to  tell their children to look out for the horrible police. Even the  studies that are now years old show that when adjusted for criminal  behavior, adjusted for arrest, there is no greater danger of Black  people in the population as a whole in confrontation with police, but  Joe Biden, I can only assume because he wants to tear apart America,  keeps getting up on the platform saying we have got this racist  problem, we have got to look out for the police. It is not true. What  is the result of this mindset that we have this horrible racial problem  and we have to do something about it?   Joe Biden obviously wants this narrative to continue. The first thing  he wants to do is hire a bunch of bureaucrats--more certainly in his  proposed budget--hire bureaucrats throughout the Federal agencies to  deal with the supposed racial problem and dive in looking for the  people you hire, the people you deal with. Let's look at it through the  racial prism.   As it so happens--and I think this should be more publicized--America  has had a policy of affirmative action since 1965 in this country. That  is when President Lyndon Johnson, I think in part in response to the  Jim Crow era which had just ended in the south, began a policy of  affirmative action. Today, every American business with at least 100  employees or any business with at least 50 employees that does $50,000  worth of contracting with the government is affected by the affirmative  action order that was begun by Lyndon Johnson over 50 years ago.   Obviously, the purpose of affirmative action is to put the thumb on  the scale when a company does hiring, when they do promoting, when they  do firing. The stated purpose of this massive bureaucracy is to give  what was a practical matter amongst the preferences to Americans  who basically descend from anywhere around the world other than  northern Africa and Europe. I should point out recently President Biden  wanted to--or gave notice--that he wants at least people to fill out  forms differently. Right now you are considered, I guess, what we will  refer to as ``white'' if you are from north Africa, but President Biden  wants to take people from Egypt and Syria, whatever, and give them a  new place on the form. I would assume--I am not sure but I would  assume--that means more affirmative action for people in that part of  the world, as well.    Insofar as companies change their policies to make these forms come  up  [[Page H1276]]  better or more what they like, it means that you are giving preferences  to one group over another group. Even more absurdly, frequently the  group you are giving preferences to are immigrants who weren't even  here in the United States. I wish we would have hearings on this topic,  and I wish the press would delve into this topic and ask: Why if you  move here from, wherever, Peru, Pakistan, Philippines, wherever, why in  the world should you be treated differently or should a company feel  that they have to go out of the way to give preferences to these groups  when they have never been subject to any discrimination in this country  at all, much less slavery? Why when it comes to African Americans-- assuming that we should do this sort of thing, and I am not sure it is  right at all, but if we are going to have to do this sort of thing at  all, why if somebody moves here from Jamaica or Bahamas or Nigeria or  somewhere, comes here for a better life in America when a company hires  you or when an American governmental entity hires you, why do these  diversity people feel you should be given preference over people who  are already here? Does anybody think that is a little bit odd? I think  it is something they particular ought to look into because President  Biden wants to get so many more people here, including illegally. As a  practical matter right now there are a lot of big businesses who feel  it will help them in the eyes of the government if they hire people who  just immigrated here, maybe people who just immigrated here illegally  as opposed to some of the native born.   I will give an anecdote that I repeated in committee the other day. I  spoke to a gentleman whose son worked for a major American cabinet  department. He was happy with his job. He went to school for the job he  got. After 8 or 9 years he wondered why he wasn't moving up, why he  wasn't promoted. He was doing a good job. Well, he was told: ``You are  a white guy who is not a veteran.'' Of course we give preferences to  veterans, too. Now, is that right? If it is right, if people feel from  here on out that is the way it is going to be in the United States,  shouldn't the agencies that behave this way at least be required to  post something saying that if you are going to be held back because you  are not a veteran, if you are going to be held back by your race that  you should know this before you accept this job? I would think at a  minimum we should at least alert the public. It is kind of unusual that  we have this problem, but I do feel that some committee or the press,  if they want to educate the public about what is going on, ought to  delve into this issue a little bit more. These are questions that I  think the press ought to ask.   When we embark on this affirmative action policy in which we are  picking people by background, does this affect the quality of life in  America? Okay. If when we determine admissions to medical schools or  admissions to schools of engineering or something like pilots, when the  Biden administration says we have to run all these through the bean  counters, do we wind up with perhaps some people who are not as  qualified? Does that affect the quality of life in America?   When is a minority entitled to a preference? Is it somebody who is  half from a different country, is it a quarter, is it an eighth? Right  now you self-identify. Elizabeth Warren was something like 1/64th or  128th Native American, and she claimed to be Native American, used it  to become a law professor at Harvard. Good for her. Is that right? How  about a quarter? Is that right? Half? An eighth? I'm not sure. Is it  right that if you move here directly from Spain you are European. If  your ancestors came from Spain and spent a few generations in Mexico  you are somebody in need of protection? Does that make any sense? I  think the press ought to ask that question.   Again, in this country I believe affirmative action was--or we were  led to believe--was to a certain extent making up for Jim Crow or even  slavery, but if you are somebody who comes here of African descent,  from Nigeria or Jamaica, you didn't experience Jim Crow, you didn't  experience slavery. Is it right that preferences be given to groups  like this?   A lot of times people say it is about diversity. Well, there is such  a thing as diversity in background, and maybe we learn different things  with different backgrounds, but this is all--or frequently--race  related. If I grow up next to somebody who is a quarter Mexican, and we  have had the exact same experiences and are best friends and played  together on the football team and graduated together from high school,  is there really diversity in hiring one of us instead of the other of  us or letting one of us in school compared to the other school? That is  ridiculous, but that is what the law is currently right now. Of course,  I think there are a lot of people that have a vested interest in  keeping this going. There are people who, I think, want to destroy  America by trying to set people from one area up against another area.  There are people that want to protect their jobs, and these could be  very good-paying jobs, monitoring this diversity stuff from company to  company, and now in order to protect their jobs these programs have to  continue to keep on going. They are good-paying jobs, and they are  consultants who make well into the six figures whose jobs depend upon  this diversity stuff. I hope the press looks into that, sees how much  people are making.   The diversity program can favor women, as well. Right now in America,  single women under 30 actually make more than single men under 30. Do  we need all this paperwork and experts to delve into things to protect  the women? I don't know.   I will give a little anecdote. I know a woman, she is retired now,  but she was a human resources person for a manufacturing firm that did  business with the government. They had over 100 employees.                                time  1300    There were two anecdotes that bothered her and caused her to search  me out. One was the company she was with wanted to hire a new engineer.  Like many companies do, they hired an independent firm to administer  their affirmative action program because they didn't want to get in  trouble with the Federal Government.   The affirmative action group told them--although some people say they  shouldn't have told them. You want to go from hiring five engineers to  six engineers? Well, right now, all five engineers in your company are  men. The sixth engineer better be a woman. It doesn't have to be a  woman, but if it is not a woman, you have to be prepared to be audited  and prove you did all you could to try to hire a woman in that sixth  slot.   She didn't really like that. She thought that was wrong. Is that  right?   The same thing happened in management. There were four members of  what was classified as management. They wanted to hire a fifth. They  were told by the experts, who they were paying, in this field: You  better look for a minority for that fifth management position. It  doesn't have to be a minority, but if the Federal Government audits  you, you could get in trouble. You better be able to prove you did all  you could to try to hire a minority.   I was back home a few weeks ago and talked to a woman who brought  this up on her own. She worked for a financial institution. She said  that an opening for a position had been going on for months, but they  couldn't hire anybody because all the applicants were White men.  Interesting.   Is that right in America? I guess the bank felt you don't want to get  on the wrong side of the Federal Government.   In any event, these are three topics that I don't feel the press has  paid enough attention to, but I hope they do a better job in the future  of alerting the American public to the fact that we are approaching 100  percent of GDP in our debt, the highest since World War II. Unlike  World War II, we are not going to lay off or shut down tons of  factories making tanks and ships. It is going to be much more difficult  this time.   I hope the American public also decides to weigh in when we do have  an increase in spending. Is it right? One of only two agencies--at  least on this summary; three agencies on this summary of all the  agencies we have. Homeland Security, which is in charge of the border,  is one of the few that is actually getting a cut.   Does the American public think that is the one agency that is  overstaffed and bloated? I am not sure.  [[Page H1277]]    I hope the American public and the press corps, which really  determines our agenda, pay a little bit more attention to all the  unaccompanied minors streaming across the southern border without  parents, maybe never to see their parents again.   Who knows what people are doing with them, human trafficked or  whatever, but that is what we do right now. Johnny shows up with a note  on his shirt: Deliver me to 123 Elm Street, Portland, Oregon.   Yes, sir. We don't ask where your parents are. We are going to  deliver him wherever you want. I hope the American public is concerned  about that.   Finally, I think, particularly in the days of Joe Biden, where he is  trying to hire so many more bureaucrats to administer affirmative  action sort of programs, why don't we ask some questions about this,  about this program? Who benefits? Do they benefit? Does it affect the  overall quality of work in some areas in America?   I think we ought to have that discussion. I know the Supreme Court is  having that discussion, but it affects, like I said, a lot more than  admissions to school. It affects hiring, both in the private sector and  public sector, and it affects government contracting, as well.   Three topics for the press if they are paying attention.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 5 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday,  March 14, 2023, at 4 p.m.                            ____________________
