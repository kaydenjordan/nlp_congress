 Mr. President, I am here once again to shed a little  light on the dark money scheme to capture and control our Supreme  Court.   As folks may recall, my first two speeches covered the early  foundation of this scheme--a prominent conservative lawyer Lewis  Powell's detailed strategy memo for the corporate U.S. Chamber of  Commerce and then Justice Lewis Powell's work on the Court to assure  his corporate power strategy's success.   From there, I turned to what historian Richard Hofstetter called the  paranoid style in American politics and how extreme anti-government  megadonors like the Kochs harness that rightwing fringe and how, at the  same time, they had at their disposal the polished mercenaries of  corporate administrative agency warfare.   Then I discussed the scheme's two big recent dark money wins at the  Supreme Court--the AFPF dark money case and the Brnovich voter  suppression case.   The nutshell overview of all of this is that it is a short jump for  big donors from regulatory capture, which is a well-understood and  broadly observed phenomenon, to applying known techniques of regulatory  capture to capture a court.   As the big donors had this realization and made this jump, one of  their most important players in applying capture techniques to the  judiciary has been the Federalist Society.   I will start with some very straightforward observations. Every  member of the Court's six-Justice Republican majority is a current or  former member of the Federalist Society.   Justices regularly headline Federalist Society fundraisers, like the  gala Brett Kavanaugh chose for his first major public speaking  engagement after his disastrous confirmation, and they boast of their  association with the group. The Federalist Society is a dark money  organization. It receives millions in anonymous donations.  [[Page S5095]]    The Federalist Society carefully vetted and promoted each member of  the current Court majority. Each member rose to the top of the group's  donor-approved slates of nominees. Each was backed by the Federalist  Society's extended network of satellite groups.   For the dark money forces behind the capture of the Court, the  Federalist Society became their nomination's gatekeeper.   The Federalist Society has three component efforts. The first is  basically a law school debate club. At more or less every law school in  the country, they organize seminars and invite academics, judges,  attorneys to speak. It is pretty standard law school stuff.   The second is a fairly run-of-the-mill Washington think tank. They  issue newsletters, host podcasts, convene events with conservative  legal luminaries. This think tank's mission is to ``reorder priorities  within the legal system'' and to create a network of members that  ``extends to all levels of the legal community.''   Then there is the third Federalist Society operation. This is the  gatekeeper. It doesn't really care about fostering young legal minds.  It doesn't care about galas or podcasts either. It cares about one  thing: the allegiance of Republican-appointed Justices to rightwing  donors' interests. And the dark money sluice gates into the Federalist  Society provide the perfect means of influence. Money talks. Dark money  whispers.   The Federalist Society gatekeeper role began with the hiring of a  Cornell Law graduate named Leonard Leo, fresh from a clerkship in 1991.   Leo's first task was building the lawyers division to serve as a  pipeline for rightwing lawyers to rise through the Federalist Society  ranks toward the Federal courts.   Observers say the Federalist Society didn't hire Leo for his skill as  an attorney. What they saw in him was a savvy networker and fundraiser   Johns Hopkins professor Steven Teles, who has written extensively on  Leo and the Federalist Society, says the idea was to build what he  called ``a network . . . with Leonard Leo at the center . . . [to] give  conservatives a chance to meet one another and check one another out.''   Under Leo's new system, ``the one thing all the lawyers [would] have  in common is that they all know Leonard, and he knows all of them.''   Big rightwing donors recognized the opportunity that Leo's Federalist  Society operation presented: a trusted broker to sift through eager  legal talent and pluck out adherents to donor-friendly, rightwing legal  doctrines and then push the most promising adherents toward judgeships,  where they could advance the scheme's ultimate goal of courts that will  reliably rule in the donors' favor.   As the New Yorker's Jeffrey Toobin has written, Leo quickly attracted  the preeminent scheme funders, including the foundations of rightwing  megadonors John Olin, Lynde and Harry Bradley, Richard Scaife, and, of  course, the perennially mischievous and malign Koch brothers.   The scheme also raked in anonymous funding through Donors Trust--what  has been called the dark money ATM of the right.   As another observer of the conservative legal movement Professor  Amanda Hollis-Brusky said, ``The funders all got the idea right away-- that you can win elections, you can have mass mobilizations, but unless  you can change . . . the courts, there are limits to what you can do.''   The second Bush administration, the Federalist Society quietly became  the big donors' nominations turnstile.   Bush and his team welcomed Leo's help. It made things easy. Need  someone to pay for public relations cavalry to rescue a struggling  circuit court nominee? Leo's donors made it happen.   According to a 2003 email from a White House staffer to the then- Presidential Staff Secretary, a young guy by the name of Brett  Kavanaugh, Leo coordinated ``all outside coalition activity regarding  judicial nominations.''   In another email uncovered by the Washington Post, Bush aides  referred to Leo explicitly as their judicial nominations cash machine.   ``Leonard Leo will know,'' they said, ``where to find money to hold a  presser for a failing nominee.'' That is from one Bush aide to another.   They go on: ``We probably don't want the fed soc''--Federalist  Society--``paying for it, but he might know some generous donor.''   Leo's official fed soc bio, still online today, boasts that he  ``organized the outside coalition efforts in support of the Roberts and  Alito U.S. Supreme Court confirmations.'' The goal, of course, was to  change the Court. The Court changed.   Under Chief Justice Roberts, the Court's Republican-appointed  majority served up scores of partisan 5-to-4 decisions, delivering  partisan win after partisan win to identifiable Republican donor  interests.   Even before the Republican majority expanded to 6, that run of wins  reached 80--80 partisan 5-to-4 decisions--a judicial rout favoring very  happy rightwing donors.   When Donald Trump assumed office, the Federalist Society gatekeeper  role became even more obvious and even more toxic.   You may recall that dark money emperor Charles Koch made waves when  he told his rightwing network he could support neither Hillary Clinton  nor Donald Trump in 2016.   But the house of Koch and the house of Trump soon reached an  accommodation. The house of Koch decided on a grand Trump gesture for  their scheme donors--let their operative, Leonard Leo, handpick a list  of Supreme Court nominees for Trump to announce early in the general  campaign. For the price of known, scheme-approved Supreme Court  prospects, peace might be acquired between house of Koch and house of  Trump. Trump announced the list.   For what it is worth, I think the rest of the accommodation was for  house of Trump to turn over all energy and environmental positions in  government to climate change deniers approved by house of Koch, and at  the end of the day, it was probably a lot of the same dark money behind  both of those accommodations.   Anyway, rewind to 2016 and recall how large the Supreme Court loomed  over that Presidential campaign.   Justice Scalia died suddenly during a hunting trip. Mitch McConnell  broke with all Senate norms and denied President Obama any hearing or  vote for President Obama's pick to replace Scalia, Judge Merrick  Garland.   This vacancy would decide the partisan balance of the Court, which  meant the 2016 election would determine whether the 5-to-4 rightwing  majority that had delivered so abundantly for the donors would end or  be renewed for years or even generations.   Remember Lewis Powell's memo to the Chamber, ``The judiciary may be  the most important instrument for social, economic, and political  change'' in all of government. Well, nothing could focus the scheme's  donors on the stakes of that election more clearly than that vacancy.    With Scalia's sudden death, the scheme was at risk. So scheme donors'  dark money flowed in ever-larger amounts to the Federalist Society, to  Leonard Leo, and to Donald Trump.   Ambitious judges noticed. A court of appeals judge described to me  the conduct of some of its colleagues as auditioning--auditioning. They  weren't just deciding cases for the parties before them, they had  another audience beyond the courtroom. You don't audition without  someone to audition to. These judges knew they were being assessed, and  they auditioned. And no one auditioned harder than Brett Kavanaugh. He  filled his court of appeals decisions with signaling, and even set the  record for speeches to the Federalist Society. I think it was over 50.  He knew who he was auditioning for.   When Trump took the White House, the Federalist Society assumed  control of judicial nominations, at least the important ones. Trump  said so himself. He wasn't even subtle about it. House of Trump had  peace to keep with House of Koch. This was no time for subtlety.  Trump's new White House Counsel, Don McGahn, even joked about this  role, of course, at a 2017 Federalist Society event. He said:         Our opponents of judicial nominees frequently claim the       President has outsourced his selection of judges. That is       completely false. I have been a Member of the Federalist       Society since law school. Still am. So, frankly, it seems       like it's been in-sourced.    Leo became the gatekeeper in chief, actually taking leaves of absence  from  [[Page S5096]]  the Federalist Society to advise Trump directly on Supreme Court  nominations.   Now, there are unanswered questions about whether this was even  legal, but the point was clear. Virtually all major Trump nominees  would be scheme-chosen, donor-approved FedSoc members. And, indeed, 86  percent of Trump's Supreme Court and appellate court nominees were or  are members.   Leo and the Federalist Society's control ran deep. In Leo, the donors  controlled an agent to orchestrate every aspect of Supreme Court  judicial battles, and they provisioned him with dark money beyond  imagining, and with a devious structure of front groups to hide behind  while effectuating their scheme.   We are still learning about the scope of Leo's covert funding and  influence, but a 2019 Washington Post expose painted a remarkable  picture: a vast network of Leo-affiliated front groups; shell entities  with no employees and vague connections to Leo cutouts; shared post  office boxes; common contractors and officers across nominally separate  entities, even some sharing Presidents; dark money funders, anonymous  advertising, and enormous pay packages for operatives.   It has the earmarks of a covert operation of the sort that is run by  hostile countries in the intelligence arena. But this covert operation  was run in America against America by Americans. By the Post's  reckoning, $250 million in dark money flowed through this apparatus.  Testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Courts Subcommittee,  which I chair, has since updated that number to $400 million. Groups in  this apparatus have gorged on dark money, their coffers swelling by  orders of magnitude as Leo's influence grew.   For example, in 2002, DonorsTrust, the scheme's dark money ATM, had  contributed $5,000 to the Federalist Society. Scroll forward to the  most recent year on record: It contributed $7 million.   Before 2010, the Federalist Society received an occasional anonymous  gift of $1,000 or more, at most one per year. Over the last decade, it  averaged more than a dozen each and every year. Donors were not kidding  around, not with that kind of money--$400 million. The scheme to  capture the Court was deadly serious.   Eleven days after Donald Trump was sworn into office, he announced  Neil Gorsuch--a name from the Federalist Society's infamous list--to  fill Scalia's former seat. Then Brett Kavanaugh was hand-walked by  Leonard Leo to the top of the list, after all his ardent auditioning  from his court of appeals seat. And 7 days before Donald Trump lost the  2020 election, Amy Coney Barrett--a Federalist Society member and  regular feature speaker at Federalist Society events--filled Ruth Bader  Ginsburg's seat. The scheme's Federalist Society gatekeeper operation  had delivered to its big donors a complete overhaul of the Court in  less than 4 years.   One man, his secretive array of front groups, and hundreds of  millions of scheme donors' money, delivered a donor-approved six- Justice majority to the Court.   The Federalist Society was the turnstile that controlled the  appointments, and dark money was the inducement that controlled the  turnstile.   To be continued.
