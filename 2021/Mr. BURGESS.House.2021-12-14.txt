 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, we will immediately  consider the Strategic Production Response Act which will require the  Secretary of Energy to develop a plan to increase energy production on  Federal lands if oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is used without  a severe energy supply interruption. In November, the Biden  administration announced the release of 50 million barrels of oil from  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to manipulate the market and address  high energy prices that were created by his policies.   On his first day in office, President Biden weakened America's energy  independence by rejoining the Paris climate agreement, blocking new  energy development on Federal lands, and killing the Keystone pipeline.  These are just a few examples of how this President's policies have  slowed our Nation's economic recovery and will prevent us from  reclaiming true energy independence.   Releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve without an  emergency declaration is unprecedented. No severe supply disruption  exists, only a President who seeks to enact radical Green New Deal  policies. Low Presidential approval ratings are not the emergency that  Congress envisioned when the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was  established in 1975.    The path to affordable energy is simple: increase supply to meet  demand. Congress must reverse the policies that limit production of  energy here at home. Clean energy is a priority for all Americans, but  hurting domestic producers will only increase our Nation's dependence  on dirty energy products from Russia, China, and the Middle East which  are inherently less clean than American energy.  [[Page H7659]]    In conclusion, the Strategic Production Response Act ensures that a  plan is in place to increase energy production before any President may  use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for purely political purposes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question so we can consider this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Morelle for yielding  me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of S.J. Res. 33, a  bill to raise the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion.   The Federal debt limit began over 100 years ago, in 1917, and it has  been required to be raised 100 times since then.   The problem isn't whether we should increase our debt limit; it is  that we have to issue debt at all. Debts are issued to cover the  difference between what you make and what you spend. When you spend  more than you make, you have to find a way to pay for the spending.   We are in the middle of a spending spree. For the last 11 months,  well over $1 trillion in taxpayer money was spent largely on partisan  priorities, and more likely coming if the Democrats manage to get a  final agreement on the Build Back Better Act or perhaps what more aptly  might be described as a socialist spending scam.   On December 10, the Congressional Budget Office published an estimate  of the Build Back Better Act, confirming the bill's true cost to be  almost $5 trillion, $4.9 trillion, while adding $3 trillion in new  debt.   Democrats claim the bill is paid for, but that is simply not true.  Now, it is confirmed by independent analysis. Instead of zero dollars,  the bill will create a carve-out for deducting State and local taxes  that will add almost $250 billion to the deficit.                                time  2110    It will protect so-called green companies from a new minimum tax and  provide $12,500 tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle so long  as that vehicle is made using union labor.   The bill will also provide billions in benefits to the wealthy  through the expanded child tax credit that will add over $1.5 trillion  to the deficit if this policy is made permanent, and that is, of  course, what is being pushed for in the Build Back Better Act.   Additionally, the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that the Democrats  just ushered into law requires a $118 billion transfer from Treasury to  the highway trust fund, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has  stated will occur tomorrow, December 15.   Republicans will not support raising the debt limit while Democrats  push through trillions of dollars for purely partisan political  spending, thereby depleting our Treasury not just for today but for  generations to come.   Unfortunately, all this spending will only exacerbate the very high  rate of inflation, inflation which has been crippling so many Americans  and causing so much suffering in the last 11 months.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in November, the  Consumer Price Index rose by 0.8 percent, but 6.8 percent over the last  12 months. The most significant increase was in the energy sector,  while prices went up for gas, food, shelter, and vehicles, among other  things.   Here is the real bad news: We have only seen the tip of the iceberg  when it comes to inflation. Likely, the inflation rates by March are  going to be absolutely astonishing. And that is what happens when you  push so many dollars out into an economy that has no way to absorb  them.   Sure, 2 years ago we all voted for the CARES Act, a trillion dollars  to rescue the country from the coronavirus. And then there was  additional coronavirus relief passed in December. And then almost  immediately another coronavirus bill in February, and then the  transportation bill in September, and now the Build Back Better Act.   The economy simply cannot absorb those dollars that the Federal  Government is pushing out. They have got no place to go except to  create more and more inflation. And who does inflation hurt? It hurts  those people at the lower end of the income scale.   Despite repeated encouragement from the Committee on the Budget  Ranking Member Jason Smith and Senator McConnell, Democrats have  refused to raise the debt ceiling through reconciliation, which of  course is their right to do. They have majorities in both the House and  the Senate.   They have had ample time to do this, but they simply would not act.  So, instead, a temporary extension that would only last a couple of  months happened earlier this year. And now, once again, in the middle  of the night,  [[Page H7810]]  we are having to vote on a bill to increase the national debt in order  to pay for Democrats' social spending and infrastructure policies.   Democrats claim that raising the debt limit has always been  bipartisan. But, you know, here is just a little bit of history: In  1993, the Democrats used reconciliation to raise the debt limit with a  party-line vote in the omnibus budget reconciliation bill.   In 2010, the Democrats again raised the debt limit by $1.9 trillion  with a purely party-line vote. Republicans voted in opposition out of  concern for the then-Obama administration's amount of spending that was  occurring. A New York Times article reporting on the vote said, ``They  wanted to raise the ceiling enough to avoid putting their Members  through another such vote before the midterm elections.''   Do you kind of get the sense that history is repeating itself  tonight?   Financial success and financial longevity begins years before it is  realized. We certainly cannot be reckless and feckless with the  Nation's future now. Under no argument is this plan fiscally  responsible. Under no fantasy is the Build Back Better Act paid for.   We have to remember to be beneficial to the American people, we have  to be demonstrative of representative government. We should not be  raising the debt limit to allow for continuation of partisan social  spending.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, Republicans will  amend the rule to immediately consider an amendment to the Democrats'  fiscal year 2022 budget resolution to replace the socialist $5 trillion  tax-and-spend reconciliation instructions with new instructions for  authorizing committees to produce legislation to reduce the deficit to  combat runaway inflation currently fueling the highest price spike in  40 years and to get Americans back to work.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Smith), the ranking member of the Budget Committee, to explain the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Fallon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, just before I close, I do want to take a moment and  acknowledge that it was 1 year ago last night that the FedEx trucks  departed from Kalamazoo, Michigan, carrying the very first doses of  what we now know as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.    And when you stop and reflect upon what was accomplished between the  middle of May and the middle of December of 2020, it truly was a  startling scientific accomplishment; not one, not two, but three  vaccines.   We told ourselves at the beginning of the Operation Warp Speed  process that if we got 40 to 45 percent effectiveness, it would be a  victory, and those vaccines delivered in excess of 90 percent. People  might quibble and say, well, you have to get a booster or you have to  get an additional shot. We are so fortunate to have those tools to be  able to combat this illness.   We are by no means through, but then even just last week the  additional news that now an oral medication, the so-called Tamiflu for  coronavirus, is now available, which I submit is going to change with  the application of additional therapeutics, is really going to change  the equation, and I just wanted to take a minute and reflect on that.   We are, again, just one day past the 1-year anniversary of Kalamazoo,  Michigan, delivering that vaccine to the world.   Otherwise in closing to this argument, raising the debt ceiling to  $2.5 trillion does seem a tad irresponsible in the middle of  unprecedented spending by House Democrats. You have got control of the  White House, you have got control of the Senate, you have got control  of the House, and you haven't passed a single appropriations bill.   How are we supposed to run our business if we will not do our normal  work and pass a budget and pass the 12 appropriations bills?                                time  2130    The Federal Government is currently operating under the second  continuing resolution of this fiscal year. One-third of Federal  spending is done through discretionary appropriations. When you stop to  think about it, that is really not much. That means two-thirds comes  through on autopilot. But the amount that we actually tell ourselves we  are going to control, the one-third of the Federal budget, we haven't  done our work.   Now, we are talking about raising the debt limit to pay for trillions  of dollars in spending, and the Democrats won't even fund the basic  functions of government through regular appropriations. That actually  comes at a cost. It is very difficult to get a phone call answered by a  Federal agency, by the head of a Federal agency, by a Cabinet Secretary  because we no longer make the appropriations.   These folks are relatively new on the job, within the last year. They  have no history of knowing that they have to come to Congress to get  their appropriations bills passed. So as a consequence, they basically  ignore the Congress.   Democrats are desperate to push through as much social spending as  they can because the balance of power, quite likely, is getting ready  to change. Why else would they be so reckless in such a short amount of  time with Americans' hard-earned taxpayer dollars? We cannot push  inflation higher by raising the debt limit to allow for trillions in  additional partisan spending.   Mr. Speaker, here is the real problem that is going to lead to that  balance of power shift. It is inflation that is at levels that have not  been seen since the Carter administration.   Again, my prediction is, over the next 6 months, this is going to  become a great deal worse. It will be unsustainable for most American  families who live paycheck to paycheck. Then on top of that, it is a  spending level that is driving that inflation level. And we are doing  nothing, nothing to put the brakes on that.   Mr. Speaker, again, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question so  we can get to the talk for fiscal sanity and ``no'' on the underlying  measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
