 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague from Arkansas  Congressman French Hill's bill, H.R. 2611, that will modify the  boundary of the Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site  to include seven residences on South Park Street in Little Rock,  Arkansas.   While this bill would authorize the National Park Service to enter  into cooperative agreements with private property owners of the South  Street properties, H.R. 2611 will do more. It will also help us to  remember. It will help us to remember that on September 25, 1957, nine  young people, with Federal troops for escorts, bravely walked past  crowds of hatred, bigotry, emotional degradation, and even physical  abuse to desegregate Little Rock Central High School.   On that historic day in 1957, nine young people showed the United  States and the world that we were and are better than segregation and  better than racism and injustice. They proved to the world that, as  Americans, we really do believe the Declaration of Independence when it  says that all men are created equal.   I believe that allowing the historical residences surrounding Little  Rock Central High School to slip into disrepair or oblivion would be a  severe injustice to those who gave of themselves to further the cause  of civil rights and equality.   I would like to thank my colleague from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) and the  distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) for their work on this  important issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
