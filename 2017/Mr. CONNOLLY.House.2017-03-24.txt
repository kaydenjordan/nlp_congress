 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for  yielding me this time.   The Hippocratic Oath says ``primum non nocere''; ``first, do no  harm.''   This bill violates the Hippocratic Oath in all respects. Twenty-four  million people losing their health care, our friend from Wyoming thinks  that is a choice?   A string of benefits required to be covered by insurance companies to  protect consumers, to protect our loved ones when they get ill,  vitiated. Maybe that is popular in some parts of this country, but I  don't know where they are. This bill will unravel health care for all  Americans. It is the wrong path to take, and I urge defeat of this  legislation in its entirety.                            Parliamentary Inquiry
