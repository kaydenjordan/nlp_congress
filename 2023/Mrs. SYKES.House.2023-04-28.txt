 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Workers Memorial  Day, a day where we honor workers who have lost their lives, endured  injuries, or become ill due to unsafe working conditions or exposure to  chemicals in the workplace.   Mary Harris Jones--some know her better as Mother Jones--was a  champion of workers' rights during the industrial revolution. She  reminded us to ``pray for the dead and fight like hell for the  living.''   That is what we are going to do today and every day, not by just  simply remembering these workers who sacrificed their safety, health,  and lives because that is simply not enough. We must continue to fight  for safe jobs for all.   I am proud to stand with unions to protect workers' rights. Nearly  every health and safety protection that working people across our  Nation have, can be traced back to the work of unions.   I can say with confidence that you cannot find a harder working group  of people than those in Ohio's 13th Congressional District. We are  resilient, dedicated, and determined, and we deserve strong workplace  standards to protect the health and safety of our neighbors, coworkers,  and families.   I will continue to stand with unions in the fight for dignity in the  workplace so all Ohioans can feel safe and secure when they go to work  each day.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues in advance for remembering  and recognizing April 28 as Workers Memorial Day.                            ____________________
