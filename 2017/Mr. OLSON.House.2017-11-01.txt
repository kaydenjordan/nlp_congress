 Mr. Speaker, there is a great town back home in Texas 22,  which some people think has a strange name. It is called Needville,  Texas.   The folks in Needville need nothing except open ground and clear  skies with millions of bright stars visible at night. On the third  weekend in October for the last 34 years, the whole town turns out for  the Needville Harvest Festival.   The Harvest Fest is all Texas. There is a talent show with twirlers  and clog dancers; barbecue cook-offs; contests for the best fajitas,  the best pork loins, the best chicken, and the best pork ribs; and they  give away a 4-by-4 Gator. City slickers think that is some sort of  lizard. It is a big farm tool, a farm tractor.   The best part is all the money they raise goes to their city to  improve their 60-acre Harvest Park and the Needville schools.   I will close with a message from Mayor Ernie Stuart, Harvest Festival  President Chris Janicek, and my guest for President Trump's speech this  upcoming February, Katie Vacek. They all say, ``Go Astros. Beat L.A.''                            ____________________
