 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of Ms. Dorothy Burns, who passed away on Sunday, February 16, at  the age of 84.   Throughout her life, Ms. Burns was a trailblazing woman who was  heavily involved in Georgia government, advocating for candidates she  thought were best for our State.   Within the State, she served as the very first vice chair of the  Georgia Republican Party. Ms. Burns held leadership roles on countless  successful campaigns, including Georgia Senators Johnny Isakson, Mack  Mattingly, and Paul Coverdell and Presidents Ronald Reagan and George  H.W. Bush. Additionally, she served numerous times as a delegate to  national political conventions and as a Presidential elector.   But her dedication did not stop with politics. In Gainesville,  Georgia, Ms. Burns taught the speech and hearing impaired how to read  braille. She founded the K-12 school, Lakeview Academy, which continues  to thrive today.   Ms. Burns is leaving our State much better than she found it and will  be deeply missed. Her family and friends are in my thoughts and prayers  during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
