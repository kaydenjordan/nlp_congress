 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the human tragedy  that is President Biden's border crisis.   From day one, the Biden administration has blatantly ignored U.S.  immigration laws and policies that are designed to keep America safe.  The consequences from the human trafficking, the sex trafficking, and  the drug trafficking are devastating.   Under the incompetent administration of Biden and his Border Czar,  the Vice President, and DHS Secretary Mayorkas, savage drug cartels now  control our U.S. border and are sending massive amounts of deadly  fentanyl illegally into our communities, including mine in the  Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. Worse, they are now smuggling rainbow- colored and candy-flavored drugs across our border in an effort to  target our children.   Biden's disastrous open border and amnesty policies have made this  crisis worse every single day, but he is blind to see the chaos at our  border. Americans are justifiably outraged by his failed leadership.   Border Czar Kamala Harris recently said that the border is secure.  The only thing that is secure is the cash flow to the drug cartels so  long as Biden's border crisis continues.                            ____________________
