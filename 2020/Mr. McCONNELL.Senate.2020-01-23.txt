 Mr. Chief Justice, it is my understanding the schedule  today will be similar to yesterday's proceedings. We will plan to take  short breaks every 2 or 3 hours and will accommodate a 30-minute recess  for dinner, assuming that is needed.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 483, the  managers of the House of Representatives have 16 hours and 42 minutes  remaining to make the presentation of their case.   The Senate will now hear you.   The Presiding Officer recognizes Mr. Manager Schiff to continue the  presentation of the case for the House of Representatives.                         Opening Statement--Continued    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, I thank you, and I thank the  Senators for 2 now very long days. We are greatly appreciative of Chief  Justice, knowing that, prior to your arrival in the Chamber each day,  you have a lot of work at the Court, necessitating our beginning in the  afternoon and going into the evening.   I also want to, again, take this opportunity to thank the Senators  for their long and considerable attention over the course of the last 2  days. I am not sure the Chief Justice is fully aware of just how rare  it is, how extraordinary it is, for the House Members to be able to  command the attention of Senators sitting silently for hours--or even  for minutes, for that matter. Of course, it doesn't hurt that the  morning starts out every day with the Sergeant at Arms warning you  that, if you don't, you will be imprisoned. It is our hope that, when  the trial concludes and you have heard us and you have heard the  President's counsel over a series of long days, that you don't choose  imprisonment instead of anything further.   Two days ago we made the case for documents and for witnesses in the  trial. Yesterday we walked through the chronology, the factual  chronology, at some length.   Today we will go through article I, the constitutional underpinnings  of abuse of power, and apply the facts of the President's scheme to the  law and Constitution. Here I must ask you for some forbearance. Of  necessity, there will be some repetition of information  [[Page S488]]  from yesterday's chronology, and I want to explain the reason for it.   You have now heard hundreds of hours of deposition and live testimony  from the House condensed into an abbreviated narrative of the facts. We  will now show you these facts and many others and how they are  interwoven. You will see some of these facts and videos, therefore, in  a new context, in a new light: in the light of what else we know and  why it compels a finding of guilt and conviction. So there is some  method to our madness.   Tomorrow we will conclude the presentation of the facts and law on  article I, and we will begin and complete the same on article II, the  President's unconstitutional obstruction of Congress. The President's  counsel will then have 3 days to make their presentations, and then you  will have 16 hours to ask questions. Then the trial will begin. Then  you will actually get to hear from the witnesses yourself, and then you  will get to see the documents yourself--or so we hope, and so do the  American people. After their testimony and after we have had closing  arguments, then it will be in your hands.   So let's begin today's presentation. I yield to House Manager Nadler.   Mr. Manager NADLER. Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, my  fellow House managers, and counsel for the President. This is the third  day of a solemn occasion for the American people.   The Articles of Impeachment against President Trump rank among the  most serious charges ever brought against a President. As our recital  of the facts indicated, the articles are overwhelmingly supported by  the evidence amassed by the House, notwithstanding the President's  complete stonewalling, his attempt to block all witnesses and all  documents from the U.S. Congress.   The first Article of Impeachment charges the President with abuse of  power. President Trump used the powers of his office to solicit a  foreign nation to interfere in our elections for his own personal  benefit.   Note that the active solicitation itself--just the ask--constitutes  an abuse of power, but President Trump went further. In order to secure  his favor from Ukraine, he withheld two official acts of immense value.  First, he withheld the release of $391 million in vital military  assistance appropriated by Congress on a bipartisan basis, which  Ukraine needed to fight Russian aggression. Second, President Trump  withheld a long-sought-after White House meeting which would confirm to  the world that America stands behind Ukraine in its ongoing struggle.   The President's conduct is wrong. It is illegal. It is dangerous. It  captures the worst fears of our Founders and the Framers of the  Constitution.   Since President George Washington took office in 1789, no President  has abused his power in this way. Let me say that again. No President  has ever used his office to compel a foreign nation to help him cheat  in our elections. Prior Presidents would be shocked to the core by such  conduct, and rightly so.   Now, because President Trump has largely failed to convince the  country that his conduct was remotely acceptable, he has adopted a  fallback position. He argues that even if we disapprove of his  misconduct, we cannot remove him for it. Frankly, that argument is  itself terrifying. It confirms that this President sees no limits on  his power or on his ability to use his public office for private gain.  Of course, the President also believes that he can use his power to  cover up his crimes.   That leads me to the second article of impeachment, which charges  that the President categorically, indiscriminately, and unlawfully  obstructed our inquiry, the congressional inquiry, into his conduct.  This Presidential stonewalling of Congress is unprecedented in the 238- year history of our constitutional Republic. It puts even President  Nixon to shame.   Taken together, the articles and the evidence conclusively establish  that President Trump has placed his own personal political interests  first. He has placed them above our national security, above our free  and fair elections, and above our system of checks and balances. This  conduct is not America first; it is Donald Trump first. Donald Trump  swore an oath to faithfully execute the laws. That means putting the  Nation's interests above his own. The President has repeatedly,  flagrantly, violated his oath.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                            ____________________     Mr. Chief Justice, I am going to recommend that we  take a 15-minute break at this point.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.   There being no objection, at 2:57 p.m. the Senate, sitting as a Court  of Impeachment, recessed until 3:25 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.    The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Manager Schiff.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, I am going to pick up where my  colleague from Texas left off, but I want to begin by underscoring a  few of the points that she made, in listening to her presentation, that  really leapt out at me in a way they hadn't leapt out at me before.   First, I want to address--my colleague shared a number of slides  showing the polling strength of Joe Biden vis-a-vis the President as a  demonstration of his motive, the fact that he went over these political  investigations to undermine someone he was deeply concerned about.   This is an appropriate point for me to make the disclaimer that the  House managers take no position in the Democratic primary for  President. I don't want to lose a single more vote than necessary. But  those polls do show the powerful motive that Donald Trump had--a motive  that he didn't have the year before or the year before that; a motive  that he didn't have when he allowed the aid to go to Ukraine without  complaint or issue in 2017 or 2018. It was only when he had a growing  concern with Joe Biden's candidacy that he took a sudden interest in  Ukraine and Ukraine funding and the withholding of that aid.   I also want to underscore what the President said in that July 25  call. My colleague showed you that transcript from July 25 where the  President says: ``I would like you to find out what happened with this  whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike.'' My colleagues  have explained what that theory is about that server, that CrowdStrike  server--the crazy theory that it was Ukraine that hacked the Democratic  server and that server was whisked away to Ukraine and hidden there so  that the investigators and the FBI couldn't look at this server. That  is what Donald Trump was raising in that conversation with President  Zelensky.   I bring up this point again because you may hear from my colleagues,  the President's lawyers, as we heard during the testimony in the House,  that the concern was over Ukrainian interference in the election, and  why isn't it possible that both Russia and Ukraine interfered in the  election? Never mind that is contrary to all the evidence. But it is  important to point out here that we are not talking about generic  interference. We are not talking about, as we heard from some of my  colleagues in the House, a tweet from a Ukrainian here or an op-ed  written by somebody there and equating it with the kind of systematic  interference of the Russians. What we are talking about here--what the  President is talking about here is a very specific conspiracy theory  going to the server itself, meaning that it was Ukraine that hacked the  Democratic server, not the Russians. This theory was brought to you by  the Kremlin, OK? So we are not talking about generic interference. We  are talking about the server. We are talking about CrowdStrike. At  least, that is what Donald Trump wanted to investigate or announced-- this completely bogus, Kremlin-pushed conspiracy theory.    I was also struck by that video you saw of Tom Bossert, the former  homeland security adviser for the President, in which he talked about  how completely debunked and crazy this conspiracy theory is. And then  there was that rather glib line that he admitted was glib, but  nonetheless made a point, about the three or five ways to impeach  oneself, and the third way was to hire Rudy Giuliani.   Now, it struck me in watching that clip, again, that it is important  to emphasize that Rudy Giuliani is not some Svengali here who has the  President under his control. There may be an effort to say: OK, the  human hand grenade, Rudy Giuliani, it is all his fault. He has the  President in his grip.   And even though the U.S. intelligence agencies and the bipartisan  Senate Intelligence Committee and everyone else told the President time  after time that this is nonsense, that the Russians interfered, not the  Ukrainians, he just couldn't shake himself of what he was hearing from  Rudy Giuliani. You can say a lot of things about President Trump, but  he is not led by the nose by Rudy Giuliani. And if he is willing to  listen to his personal lawyer over his own intelligence agencies, his  own advisers, then you can imagine what a danger that presents to this  country.   My colleague also played for you that interview with Director Wray.  And, again, I was just struck anew by that interview. In that  interview, Director Wray says: ``We have no information that indicates  that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election.'' That is  Donald Trump's Director of the FBI: ``We have no information that  indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 election''--none, as in  zero.   The reporter then says: When you see politicians pushing this notion,  are you concerned about that in terms of the impact on the American  public?   And the Director says: ``Well, look, there's all kinds of people  saying all kinds of things out there.''   Well, yes, there are, but this person is the President of the United  States. When he says ``there are all kinds of people out there saying  all kinds of things,'' well, what he is really saying is the President  of the United States. It is one thing if someone off the streets says  it, but when it is coming from the President of the United States, you  can see what a danger it is if it is patently false and it is  promulgated by the Russians.   And, again, the reporter says: We heard from the President, himself,  he wanted the CrowdStrike portion of this whole conspiracy  investigated, and I am hearing you say there is no evidence to support  this.   And Wray says: ``As I said, we at the FBI have no information that  would indicate that Ukraine tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential  election''--none.   And so you can imagine the view from the Kremlin of all of this. You  can imagine Putin in the Kremlin with his aides, and one of his aides  comes into the office and says: Vladimir, you are never going to  believe this. The President of the United States is pushing our  CrowdStrike theory.   I mean, you can almost imagine the incredulity of Vladimir Putin: You  are kidding; right? You mean he really believes this? His own people  don't believe this. Nobody believes this.   It would be bad enough, of course, that the President of the United  States believes this Russian propaganda against the advice of all of  his advisers--common sense--and everything  [[Page S499]]  else, but it is worse than that. It is worse than that. On the basis of  this Russian propaganda, he withheld $400 million in military aid to a  nation Russia was fighting, our ally. I mean, when we ask about what is  the national security implication of what the President did, how much  more clear can it be that he is not only pushing Russian propaganda, he  is not only misleading Americans about who interfered in the last  election, that he is not only doing the Kremlin a favor, but that he is  withholding aid from a nation at war. The Russians not only got him to  deflect blame from their interference in our democracy, but they got  him to withhold military aid.   Now, of course, there was this convergence of interest between the  Kremlin and the President. The President wasn't pushing Kremlin talking  points just to do Vladimir Putin a favor. He was doing it because it  helped him, because it helped him and because it could get these  talking points for him in his reelection campaign. And for that, he  would sacrifice our ally and our own security.   But nothing struck me more from Representative Garcia's presentation  than that quote from Vladimir Putin from November of this past year,  just a couple of months ago. Putin said:         Thank God nobody is accusing us anymore of interfering in       U.S. elections. Now they're accusing Ukraine.    ``Thank God,'' Putin says. Well, you have to give Donald Trump credit  for this. He has made a religious man out of Vladimir Putin, but I  don't think we really want Vladimir Putin, our adversary, to be  thanking God for the President of the United States, because they don't  wish us well. They don't wish us well. They are a wounded animal. They  are a declining power. But like any wounded animal, they are a  dangerous animal. Their world view is completely antithetical to ours.  We do not want them thanking God for our President and what he is  pushing out. We don't want them thanking God for withholding money from  our ally, although we can understand why they may. To me, that is what  stuck out from that presentation.   Now, in the first part of this presentation, we walked through the  corrupt object of President Trump's scheme--getting Ukraine to announce  these two political investigations that would help benefit his  reelection campaign. And just looking at how baseless and fabricated  the allegations behind him were made plain his corrupt motive.   But in addition to this overwhelming evidence, there are at least 10  other reasons we know that President Trump directed his scheme with  corrupt intent. There are at least 10 other reasons we know that  President Trump was interested in his own personal gain and not the  national interest in pressing for these investigations.   First, the President only wanted these investigations to be announced  publicly, not even conducted.   Second, the President's only interest in Ukraine was the ``Big  Stuff'' that mattered to himself, not issues affecting Ukraine or the  United States.   Third, the President tasked his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to  pursue these investigations on his behalf, not government officials.   Fourth, both before and after the July 25 call, the investigations  were never part of U.S. official foreign policy. NSC officials, too,  make clear that this was not about foreign policy. Other witnesses  confirmed the investigations, in fact, diverged from U.S. official  policy.   Fifth, the investigations were undertaken outside of normal channels.   Sixth, Ukrainian officials understood that the investigations were  purely political in nature.   Seventh, multiple administration officials reported the President's  July 25 call.   Eighth, the White House buried the call.   Ninth, President Trump confirmed he wanted Ukraine to conduct  investigations in his own words.   And, finally, President Trump did not care about anti-corruption  efforts in Ukraine.   Let's go through these one by one.   First, perhaps the simplest way that we all know that President Trump  wanted these investigations done solely to help his personal political  interests and not the national interest is that he merely wanted a  public announcement of the investigations, not an assurance that they  would actually be done. If his desire for these investigations was  truly to assist Ukraine's anti-corruption efforts or because he was  worried about the larger issues of corruption in Ukraine, someone  actually investigating the facts underlying the investigations would  have been most important. But he didn't care about the facts or the  issues. He just wanted the political benefit of the public announcement  of an investigation that he could use to damage his political opponent  and boost his own political standing.   Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who was at the center of this scheme,  made this quite clear in his testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         GOLDMAN. Now, for Mr. Giuliani, by this point, you       understood that in order to get that White House meeting that       you wanted President Zelensky to have and that President       Zelensky desperately wanted to have that Ukraine would have       to initiate these two investigations. Is that right?        Ambassador SONDLAND. Well, they would have to announce that       they were going to do it.        GOLDMAN. Right. Because Giuliani and President Trump didn't       actually care if they did them, right?        Ambassador SONDLAND. I never heard, Mr. Goldman, anyone say       that the investigations had to start or had to be completed.       The only thing I heard from Mr. Giuliani, or otherwise, was       that they had to be announced in some form and that form kept       changing.        GOLDMAN. Announced publicly?        Ambassador SONDLAND. Announced publically.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The other evidence gathered by the House's  investigation confirms Ambassador Sondland's understanding. For  example, recently, the House received documents from Lev Parnas, an  associate of Rudy Giuliani's, now indicted, in response to a subpoena.  As you know, Lev Parnas was indicted by the Southern District of New  York for crimes, including election law violations. As part of the  documents that Parnas turned over, we obtained handwritten notes that  Parnas apparently took some time in 2019. One of those notes lays out  the scheme very clearly and succinctly.   Now, it is not every day that you get a document like this--what  appears to be a member of the conspiracy writing down the object of the  conspiracy, but that is exactly what we see here. We see the scheme  that ultimately was directed by President Trump to coerce Ukraine to  announce the investigation of the Bidens. I repeat: to announce the  investigation--not investigate, not conduct. The only thing that  mattered was the public announcement, as this note says with an  asterisk: ``Get Zelensky to Announce that the Biden case will Be  Investigated.''   And in early September, after Mr. Giuliani and Ambassadors Volker and  Sondland had tried but failed to get President Zelensky to issue a  public statement, President Trump made this clear himself. He explained  to Ambassador Bolton that he wanted Zelensky in a ``public box''; that  is, President Trump would only be satisfied if President Zelensky made  a public announcement of the investigations, which he subsequently  agreed to do on CNN.   Here is Ambassador Taylor's testimony on this:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          I understand the presentations will continue for a  while, and I would suggest a dinner break at 6:30 for 30 minutes.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Chief Justice Roberts, Senators, and, of  course, the counsel for the President, at this point, everything was  going to plan. Mr. Giuliani was scheming with the corrupt Ukrainian  prosecutors who were offering dirt on Biden that would help President  Trump get reelected. They were pressing President Trump to remove  Ambassador Yovanovitch, including publicly tarnishing her reputation,  based on false and baseless claims. But then the President's scheme hit  a roadblock.   On April 21, President Zelensky--then the anti-corruption candidate-- won a landslide victory in Ukraine's Presidential election. U.S.  officials unanimously testified that President Zelensky's mandate to  pursue reform would be good for our national security. However, it was  potentially bad news for President Trump's scheme.   Mr. Giuliani did not have a relationship with Zelensky. As a  reformer, he would be less amenable to announcing the sham  investigations. Zelensky would not want to get dragged into U.S.  domestic politics.   Additionally, the election of a new Ukrainian President raised the  concern that Lutsenko, with whom Mr. Giuliani had been plotting, would  be replaced by a new Ukrainian prosecutor general. A new prosecutor  general, especially one appointed in an anti-corruption regime, would  likely be less willing to conduct sham investigations to please an  American President.   Mr. Giuliani decided to attack the issue from both sides. He pressed  President Trump to remove Ambassador Yovanovitch, which would keep  Lutsenko happy. He continued to work hard to get dirt on Biden. And he  tried to get a meeting with Zelensky to secure the new Ukrainian  leader's commitment to press the investigations. This strategy played  out on April 23 and 24.   First, on April 23, Parnas and Fruman were in Israel, trying to  arrange a meeting between Giuliani and the newly minted Ukrainian  President Zelensky.   On April 23, Giuliani left a voicemail message for Parnas. Let's play  that voicemail.   Well, I was going to say it would be difficult to hear, but I am sure  you cannot hear it at all. Let me tell you what it says. He says:         It's Rudy. When you get a chance, give me a call and bring       me up to date okay? I got a couple of things to tell you too.    Parnas and Giuliani eventually spoke on that same day. We have the  phone records that prove that. According to phone records, Parnas and  Giuliani had a 1-minute-50-second call.   Fifteen minutes after they hung up, the records also show that Mr.  Giuliani placed three short phone calls to the White House. Shortly  thereafter, the White House called Giuliani back. Giuliani spoke with  someone at the White House for 8 minutes and 28 seconds.   I will quickly note that at the time the Intelligence Committee  issued its report in mid-December, we did not know whether that 8- minute-28-second call was from the White House. We have since received  information from a telecom company that it was indeed the White House.   We don't have a recording of that call. Neither the White House nor  Giuliani produced any information to Congress about what was discussed.  Of course, the White House has refused, as you already know, to  cooperate in any way. But even without the evidence that the White  House is hiding--with  [[Page S509]]  the evidence we do have--these phone records prove that Mr. Giuliani  was keeping President Trump informed about what was going on when he  was trying to meet President Zelensky and get Ukraine to commit to the  investigations.   Let's look at President Trump's decision to remove Ambassador  Yovanovitch. Following the call between Mr. Giuliani and the White  House on April 23, Parnas asked Giuliani for an update. Parnas texted:  ``Going to sleep my brother please text me or call me if you have any  news.   Giuliani responded: ``He fired her again.''   That was, of course, in reference to Ambassador Yovanovitch. Her  removal would no doubt please the corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor,  Lutsenko, who offered derogatory information about Hunter Biden. It  also eliminated a potential obstacle identified by Giuliani.   Parnas responded: ``I pray it happens this time I'll call you  tomorrow my brother.''   And it did--because we know that the very next day, on April 24,  Ambassador Yovanovitch received two frantic phone calls from Ambassador  Carol Perez at the State Department. The second call came at 1 a.m.   According to Ambassador Yovanovitch, as you can see from the slide on  the screen, the Director General of the Foreign Service told her that  ``there was a lot of concern for me, that I needed to be on the next  plane home to Washington.''   Yovanovitch recalled:         And I was like, what? What happened?    And Perez said:         I don't know, but this is about your security. You need to       come home immediately. You need to come home on the next       plane.    Yovanovitch asked what Perez meant by ``physical security.'' Perez  ``didn't get that impression'' but repeated that Yovanovitch needed  ``to come back immediately.'' This was no coincidence.   Mr. Giuliani and his agents conspired to meet President Zelensky.  They conspired for Ambassador Yovanovitch to be removed. Within hours  of Mr. Giuliani saying he prayed Ambassador Yovanovitch would get  fired, Ambassador Yovanovitch got a frantic phone call to get on the  next plane.   That same day, on April 24, Giuliani appeared on ``Fox & Friends''  and promoted the false conspiracy theories about Ukraine and Vice  President Biden that were all part of this agreement. Let's look and  listen to what he said.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         And I ask you to keep your eye on Ukraine, because in       Ukraine, a lot of the dirty work was done digging up the       information. American officials were used, Ukrainians       officials were used. That's collusion with Ukrainians. And,       or actually in this case, conspiracy with the Ukrainians. I       think you'd get some interesting information about Joe Biden       from Ukraine. About his son, Hunter Biden. About a company he       was on the board of for years, which may be one of the most       crooked companies in Ukraine. [Ukranian Russian company--not       a Ukranian--you know, big difference there. Yanukovych--the       guy they tossed out and Manafort got in all the trouble       with--the guy who owns it worked for Yanukovych, pulled 10       billion out of the Ukraine, has been a fugitive--was a       fugitive when Biden's kid first went to work there.] And       Biden bragged about the fact that he got the prosecutor       general fired. The prosecutor general was investigating his       son and then the investigation went south.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambassador Yovanovitch was never provided a  justification for her removal. She was an anti-corruption crusader, a  highly respected diplomat. And she had been recently asked to extend  her stay in Ukraine.   While American Ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the President--we  do understand that--I am sure you would all agree that the manner and  circumstances surrounding the Ambassador's removal were unusual and  raised questions of motive.   Every witness who testified confirmed that there was no factual basis  to the accusations Lutsenko lodged against Ambassador Yovanovitch.  Under Secretary of State David Hale, the most senior career diplomat at  the State Department, testified that Maria Yovanovitch was an  outstanding Ambassador and should have been permitted to remain in  Kyiv.   Even more significant, several witnesses testified that President  Trump's decision to remove Ambassador Yovanovitch undercut U.S.  national security objectives in Ukraine during a critical time.   Dr. Hill, for example, explained that many of the key U.S. policies  toward Ukraine were being implemented by the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. And  then suddenly ``we had just then lost the leadership.'' This created  what Hill labeled ``a period of uncertainty'' as to how our government  was going to execute U.S. policy.   George Kent testified that the ouster of Ambassador Yovanovitch  ``hampered U.S. efforts to establish rapport with the new Zelensky  administration in Ukraine.''   So why did President Trump remove a distinguished career public  servant Yanukovych and anti-corruption crusader and a top diplomat in  the State Department?   We know why. The answer is simple: President Trump removed Ambassador  Yovanovitch because she was in the way. She was in the way of the sham  investigations that he so desperately wanted; investigations that would  hurt former Vice President Biden and undermine the Mueller  investigation into Russian election interference; investigations that  would help him cheat in the 2020 election.   Rudy Giuliani admitted that he personally told President Trump about  his concern that Ambassador Yovanovitch was an obstacle to securing  Ukrainian cooperation on the two bogus investigations they solicited  from Ukraine. And Rudy Giuliani confirmed that President Trump decided  to remove Ambassador Yovanovitch based on the bogus claim that she was  obstructing his scheme to secure Ukraine's cooperation. Indeed, Mr.  Giuliani was explicit about this when he told the New Yorker last  month. He said:         I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She       was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.    So let's recap. Mr. Giuliani and his agents, on behalf of President  Trump, the United States President, worked with corrupt Ukrainians to  get dirt on President Trump's political opponent. Mr. Giuliani said  this in press interviews. He texted about it with his agents, and he  repeatedly called the White House.   Following the election of a new Ukrainian leader committed to  fighting corruption, President Trump removed Ambassador Yovanovitch, an  anti-corruption crusader, and Mr. Giuliani told us why: to get her out  of the way for the investigations to move forward. That is how far  President Trump was willing to go to get his investigations. To smear a  highly respected, dedicated Foreign Service officer who had served this  country unselfishly for his own selfish political interests is  disgraceful.   Even with the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch, President Zelensky's  election victory threw a wrench into the President's scheme. That is  because Lutsenko was reportedly going to be replaced. After Mr.  Giuliani told the New York Times on May 9 that he intended to travel to  Ukraine on behalf of President Trump in order to ``meddle in an  investigation,'' Ukrainian officials publicly pushed back. Please hear  what I said. Ukrainian officials publicly pushed back on the  suggestions of corruptions proposed by Mr. Giuliani, who was working on  behalf of the U.S. President.   Well, Mr. Giuliani canceled his trip on May 10 and claimed on FOX  News that President Zelensky was surrounded by ``enemies'' of President  Trump. Let's listen.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that we  have a break for 30 minutes.   There being no objection, at 6:24 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of  [[Page S514]]  Impeachment, recessed until 7:14 p.m., whereupon the Senate reassembled  when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.    Mr. Chief Justice, after consulting with Congressman  Schiff, it looks like roughly 10:30 tonight. So we may need a short  break somewhere between now and 10:30.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Members of the  Senate, counsel to the President, my colleagues, the American people,  the second official act that President Trump used to corruptly abuse  his power was the withholding of an Oval Office meeting with the  President of Ukraine.   Before we took the break, we started walking through the overwhelming  evidence about how President Trump withheld this official White House  meeting that was vitally important to Ukraine as part of a corrupt  scheme to convince President Zelensky to announce two phony political  investigations. These investigations were entirely unrelated to any  official U.S. policy and solely benefited President Trump.   We talked about why withholding the meeting was so significant to our  ally Ukraine. Ukraine is a fragile democracy, under relentless attack  from Russian-backed separatists in the east. U.S. support is vitally  important to Ukraine in that war. They desperately need our support.  They desperately need our assistance.   Because of this vast power disparity, President Trump had immense  power over Ukraine, and President Trump knew it. So when President  Trump asked for a favor on a July 25 call, he knew that President  Zelensky would feel incredible pressure to do exactly what President  Trump wanted.   President Trump used his agents--both his administration appointees  and his personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani--to make clear to Ukraine,  even in early July, that the much-needed White House meeting they  requested would only occur if they announced these phony political  investigations.   To be clear, as Ambassador Sondland testified, ``everyone was in the  loop.'' That includes Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of  State Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.   Even ahead of the July 25 call, Ambassador Sondland was in close,  repeated contact with these officials. His mission: Schedule a  telephone conversation during which the new Ukrainian leader would  personally commit to do the phony investigations sought by President  Trump in order to unlock a meeting in the Oval Office--this for that, a  quid pro quo.   This isn't just based on the testimony of witnesses. It is  corroborated by texts and emails as well. Let's look at some of that  evidence now.   On July 13, for example, Ambassador Sondland emailed National  Security Council official Timothy Morrison and made the case for  President Trump to call the Ukrainian leader prior to the parliamentary  elections scheduled for July 21. In that email, as the highlighted text  shows, Ambassador Sondland said the ``sole purpose'' of the call was to  assure President Trump that investigations would be allowed to move  forward. In other words, to get the Oval Office meeting, President  Zelensky had to move forward on the phony political investigations,  part of the scheme to cheat in the 2020 Presidential campaign--this for  that.   On July 19, Ambassador Sondland spoke directly with President  Zelensky. He spoke directly with President Zelensky to prepare him for  a call with President Trump. Ambassador Sondland coached President  Zelensky to use key phrases and reassure President Trump of Ukraine's  intention to bend to President Trump's will with respect to the phony  investigations that President Trump sought.   Ambassador Sondland told Kurt Volker that he gave the Ukrainian  leader ``a full briefing. He's got it.''   That is what Sondland told Volker.   In response, Volker texted: ``Most important is for Zelensky to say  that he will help with the investigation.''   That same day, Ambassador Sondland emailed top administration  officials, including Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney, Secretary Pompeo,  and Secretary Perry, to summarize his conversation with Zelensky. In  that email, Ambassador Sondland said Zelensky is ``prepared to receive  POTUS' call. Will assure him''--meaning POTUS--``that he intends to run  a fully transparent investigation and will `turn over every stone.' ''   Both Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney and Secretary Perry responded to  the email, noting that the head-of-state call would be scheduled.   Secretary Perry wrote: ``Mick just confirmed the call being set up  for tomorrow by NSC''--the National Security Council.   Mulvaney responded: ``I asked NSC to set it up for tomorrow.''   Neither Mulvaney nor Secretary Perry took issue with the fact that  Sondland coached Zelensky to yield to President Trump's pressure  campaign, but instead they took steps to connect the two leaders.  Everyone was in the loop.   They were aware that during the July 20 call, President Trump  intended to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election and  pressed the Ukrainian leader to announce investigations into former  Vice President Biden and the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory. There was  no focus on advancing America's foreign policy or national security  objectives. The only priority was President Trump's corrupt demand for  phony investigations in exchange for an Oval Office meeting--this for  that.   Here is Ambassador Sondland's testimony confirming this scheme.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. Everyone was in the loop. It was no       secret. Everyone was informed via email on July 19th, days       before the Presidential call. As I communicated to the team,       I told President Zelensky in advance that assurances to run a       fully transparent investigation and turn over every stone       were necessary in his call with President Trump.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. ``Necessary in his call with President Trump.''   Now, we come to July 25, the morning of the infamous phone call--the  culmination of a monthslong campaign to engineer a corrupt quid pro  quo.   That morning, before the call took place, President Trump provided  guidance to Sondland. On the morning of July 25, he told him that  President Zelensky should be prepared to announce the investigations in  exchange for the White House meeting. After Sondland's call with  President Trump on the morning of July 25, Sondland urgently tried to  reach Kurt Volker. When he could not reach Ambassador Volker by phone,  he sent a text that said, ``Call ASAP,'' and he left a message.   Volker testified that he indeed received that message, which involved  the following content: ``President Zelensky should be clear,  convincing, forthright, with President Trump about his commitment to  fighting corruption, investigating what happened in the past.'' That  refers to the Russian-inspired fake, phony, and false conspiracy theory  about Ukraine having been involved in interfering in our 2016  elections.   He continues: ``And if he does that, President Trump was prepared to  be reassured, that he would say yes, come on, let's get this date for  this visit scheduled.''   Ambassador Volker then conveyed that message approximately 30 minutes  before the Trump-Zelensky call to Zelensky's top aide, Andrey Yermak.   As you can see on the slide, Ambassador Volker texts Yermak,  Zelensky's guy, and says, ``assuming President Z convinces Trump he  will investigate/`get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016,'' the  White House meeting would get scheduled--this for that.   So President Trump talks to Ambassador Sondland. Sondland talks to  Ambassador Volker. Volker talks to President Zelensky's aide Yermak,  and then the July 25 call occurs.   When Ambassador Sondland testified, he agreed with this sequence,  indicating it ``certainly makes sense.'' Here is what Sondland had to  say.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, the House managers have requested a  5-minute break.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:19 p.m., recessed until  8:38 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.    Mr. Chief Justice, if I may, one brief announcement:  In the morning, there will be a coronavirus briefing for all Members at  10:30. Senator Alexander and Senator Murray are involved in that. The  location will be emailed to your office.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Chief Justice Roberts, Senators, and counsel  for the President, we have now been through the first two official acts  by the President. But neither of those official acts got the President  what he wanted--help in his reelection campaign. So he turned to  another official act to turn up the pressure even more--withholding  nearly $400 million of vital military assistance to Ukraine in exchange  for the investigations.   Withholding military assistance to Ukraine made the original abuse of  power, soliciting foreign interference in our elections, that much  worse. But it was also in and of itself an abuse of power. And not only  that, it violated the law. It was illegal.   The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan, independent  agency, concluded that President Trump's hold on the security  assistance clearly violated the Empowerment Control Act, a law that  Congress enacted to curb President Nixon's own abuse of power.   President Trump may not like it, but once a law is passed, the  President cannot change that law without coming back to us, the  Congress.   And President Trump did not just break the law, he jeopardized our  national security, because Ukraine's national security is our national  security. How? Because a free and democratic Ukraine is a shield  against Russian aggression in Europe. That has been one of America's  most important foreign policy and national security goals since World  War II. Freedom, liberty, democracy--those values keep us safe.   Let us now explain how President Trump's improper withholding of  military assistance was clearly done to pressure Ukraine to announce  the two baseless investigations--a gross abuse of power.   First, we will briefly describe how important the military aid was to  Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression, which affects our  security.   Second, we will explain how President Trump used the power of his  office to freeze military aid to Ukraine in a way meant to conceal it  from Congress.   And third, we will present the overwhelming evidence that President  Trump ordered the hold for a corrupt purpose: to pressure Ukraine to  announce two investigations that would personally benefit his own  reelection effort.   Let us start with the importance of the aid to our--the United  States'--national security. The United States has supported Ukraine  since it secured independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Our  support was critical to convince Ukraine to forgo its pursuit of a  nuclear arsenal in 1994. We promised them that we would defend them if  necessary. But our support became truly vital in 2014, when Ukraine  revolted against its Russian-friendly President, Viktor Yanukovych.  Ukrainian citizens rose up in protest, demanding democratic reforms and  an end to corruption. The protests, rightly known as the Revolution of  Dignity, removed the pro-Kremlin President.   Russia responded by using its own military forces and proxies in  Ukraine to invade Ukraine. This was the first effort to redraw European  boundaries by military force since World War II.   The war was devastating to Ukraine and remains so today.  Approximately 7 percent of Ukraine's territory is now occupied by  Russia. Approximately 15,000 people have been killed as a result of the  conflict, and over 1.4 million people have been displaced.   In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United States and  our allies imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and entities and  agreed to provide billions of dollars in assistance to support  Ukrainian sovereignty and democratic development.   We understood immediately, Democrats and Republicans alike, that  Ukraine's safety and security was directly tied to our safety and  security. With this all in mind, since 2014, the United States has  delivered roughly $1.5 billion in security assistance and another $1.5  billion in other assistance  [[Page S520]]  to our ally Ukraine. Our allies in Europe have provided approximately  $18 billion in loans and grants since 2014.   As we have explained, the U.S. assistance comes partially from the  Department of Defense, which provides important military support. It  comes partially from the State Department, which helps Ukraine purchase  military services or equipment manufactured by American companies in  the United States.   Ambassador Taylor explained how security assistance counters Russian  aggression and can help shorten the war in the east. Here is his  testimony:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, the security assistance       that we provide takes many forms. One of the components of       that assistance is counter-battery radar. Another component       are sniper weapons.        These weapons and this assistance allows the Ukrainian       military to deter further incursions by the Russians against       Ukrainian territory. If that further incursion, further       aggression, were to take place, more Ukrainians would die. So       it is a deterrent effect that these weapons provide.        It's also the ability--it gives the Ukrainians the ability       to negotiate from a position of a little more strength when       they negotiate an end to the war in Donbas, negotiating with       the Russians. This also is a way that would reduce the       numbers of Ukrainians who would die.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Congress imposed certain conditions on the DOD  assistance. Those conditions require DOD to hold half of the money in  reserve. To release all of the funds, DOD, in coordination with the  State Department, must conduct a review and certify to Congress that  Ukraine has done enough to fight corruption.   President Trump may argue that the conditions imposed by Congress are  similar to the hold he placed on aid to Ukraine. As Mick Mulvaney said,  ``[w]e do that all the time.'' But let us be very clear: These types of  conditions, which are often included in appropriations bills, are  designed to promote official U.S. policy, not the policy of one  individual or one President. This is exactly the type of permissible  condition on aid that Vice President Biden was implementing when he  required that Ukraine fire its corrupt prosecutor general before  getting a loan guarantee.   Prior to 2019, the Trump administration provided security assistance  to Ukraine without incident. Even under the previous Ukrainian  administration of President Petro Poroshenko--which suffered from  serious corruption--President Trump allowed $510 million in 2017 and  $359 million in 2018 to flow unimpeded to Ukraine.   But in the summer of 2019, without any explanation, President Trump  abruptly withheld the security assistance for Ukraine.   So what had changed by July of 2019? Congress had appropriated the  funds. President Trump had signed this into law. The Department of  Defense had certified that Ukraine was meeting the required anti- corruption reforms. In fact, DOD had begun to spend the funds. So what  happened?   Well, in April, two critical things happened. First, Joe Biden  publicly announced his campaign for President. Second, the Mueller  investigation concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S.  elections to assist the Trump campaign and that the Trump campaign had  extensive contacts with Russians and even took advantage of some of the  Russian efforts. The evidence shows that the only reason--the only  logical reason, and we deal in what is reasonable--President Trump  withheld the aid was to undermine these threats to his political  future.   As we have discussed, security assistance to Ukraine has broad  bipartisan support from Congress, as well as every agency within the  President's own administration.   Let us be clear about something. The money mattered to Ukraine. It  mattered to Ukraine. Witness testimony revealed that this money was 10  percent of Ukraine's defense budget--10 percent.   Now imagine if President Trump just decided without cause or  explanation to hold 10 percent of our own defense budget. That would  have a dramatic impact on our military. It certainly did to Ukraine,  our ally.   Keep in mind, too, that President Trump had to sign the bill into  law, which he did in September of 2018. At no time--at no time--through  the congressional debate or passage of the bill did the White House  express any concerns about the funding or the program itself.   I want you to see the slide before us. It shows President Trump signs  the bill authorizing aid to Ukraine for fiscal year 2019.    On June 18, President Trump's own Department of Defense certified  that Ukraine had met all of the anti-corruption requirements necessary  to receive aid. And do you know what? The Department of Defense  announced that the money was on its way, just as we, the United States  of America, had promised.   Senators, our word must continue to mean something. Our word must  continue to mean something powerful in the world. So let us make  certain that America continues to live up to its promise.   Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, thank you so  much for the attention that you have given to our presentation  throughout this day. It is a long day. You are here without your cell  phones or any access to other information. It is not easy, but you are  paying attention, and the country and the managers thank you for that.   We have just gone through the importance of security assistance to  Ukraine to our national security and the clear consensus among  Congress, the Executive, and the President's agencies and advisers that  the aid should be released to Ukraine. In fact, by June 18, after  having certified that Ukraine had met all the anti-corruption reform  requirements to receive the aid, DOD announced its intention to provide  the $250 million in security assistance to Ukraine.   This brings us to the second part of this section of our argument.   Soon after that June 18 press release, President Trump quickly moved  to stop the aid from flowing. He did this with no explanation, against  the clear consensus of his advisers and his agencies, and against our  Nation's security interests. He was so determined to do it in order to  pressure Ukraine to do his political dirty work that he was willing to  violate the law, something his own officials were well aware of and  worried about.   How do we know the President ordered the hold? First, there is no  real dispute that the President ordered the hold. The hold on security  assistance to Ukraine was a unilateral official act by the President.  Immediately after the DOD's June 18 press release announcing the $250  million in security assistance funds for Ukraine, President Trump  started asking questions about the funding program. Laura Cooper from  DOD and Mark Sandy from OMB testified about this sudden interest in  Ukraine security assistance, something that Cooper called unusual.   We, of course, have received no documents from OMB and DOD because of  the President's obstruction. Why did the President want to hide these  documents? We don't know, but thanks to Freedom of Information Act  lawsuits and hard-working reporters, we know a little from the  documents that we do have.   For instance, we know that the day after the DOD press release, the  President asked for information about the Ukraine aid. On June 19,  Michael Duffey, the Associate Director for National Security Programs  at OMB, sent an email to Elaine McCusker, the DOD comptroller, with an  article by the Washington Examiner reporting: ``Pentagon to send $250M  in weapons to Ukraine.''   In Duffey's email, he asked McCusker the following question:         The President has asked about this funding release, and I       have been tasked to follow-up with someone over there to get       more detail. Do you have insight on this funding?    It seems that on June 19, Robert Blair, Mick Mulvaney's deputy,  called Acting OMB Director Russell Vought to discuss Ukraine's security  assistance. He told him: ``We need to hold it up.''   That is right. The hold was actually directed impulsively without any  policy or agency review as soon as President Trump learned about it  from a press release.   We know what was on the President's mind about Ukraine that day  because President Trump gave a phone interview with Sean Hannity on FOX  News. During the interview, he mentioned the so-called CrowdStrike  conspiracy theory that blames Ukraine rather than  [[Page S521]]  Russia for interfering in the 2016 election. Remember, President Trump  raised the CrowdStrike theory a month later during his July 25 call  with President Zelensky. Of course--and this has been said many times-- that theory has been completely refuted by U.S. intelligence agencies,  as well as the President's own handpicked senior advisers.   The New York Times also reported that on June 27, Mick Mulvaney sent  Blair an email. Mulvaney wrote:         I am just trying to tie up some loose ends. Did we ever       find out about the money to Ukraine and whether we can hold       it back?    What was Blair's response to Mulvaney? That it was possible to hold  security assistance, but he warned: ``Expect Congress to become  unhinged.''   Blair, who previously worked for Congress, knew that Congress would  be ``unhinged'' because there was overwhelming bipartisan support for  Ukraine. Congress had already authorized the release of the funds. DOD  had already told Congress and the world that it was going to spend the  $250 million on Ukraine security assistance, and it had already started  to do so.   Mark Sandy, the senior career official at OMB responsible for this  type of aid, couldn't recall any other time in his 12-year career at  OMB when a hold was placed on security assistance after a congressional  notification was made.   Later, if the President's counsel starts listing other times that aid  has been held, ask yourself three questions.   One, had Congress already cleared the money to be released; two, was  there a significant geopolitical development in that country; and  three, did the GAO determine that the hold was illegal, in part,  because Congress was not notified?   Here, the money had been cleared. There was nothing new or important  in Ukraine to disrupt the aid--just that a true anti-corruption  reformer was elected. The hold was illegal.   From freedom of information releases and press reports, we know about  just a few of the many documents being hidden from you about how the  hold began. Given President Trump's obstruction with the facts that  have come to light through the Freedom of Information Act lawsuits and  news reporting, you may assume the documents that are being withheld  would probably incriminate the President; otherwise, why wouldn't he  have provided them? If he had a legitimate executive privilege claim,  he could follow the rules and make each claim. Instead, he just said  no--no to everything.   By mid-July, the President had put a hold on all the money. Jennifer  Williams, special adviser to Vice President Pence for Europe, learned  about the hold on July 3. She said it came ``out of the blue'' and  hadn't previously been discussed by OMB or the National Security  Council. The hold was never discussed with any policy experts in any of  the relevant agencies.   That is remarkable. President Trump ordered a hold on congressionally  appropriated funds without the benefit of any interagency deliberation,  consultation, or advice. The evidence shows the President's hold was an  impulsive decision unrelated to any American policy.   On July 12, Robert Blair, Mulvaney's deputy, emailed Duffey at OMB.  He said ``the President is directing a hold on military support funding  for Ukraine.'' This is according to Sandy, the career officer at OMB  who got a copy of the email.   Now, we don't have a copy of the email because of the President's  obstruction, but here is what we do know from Mr. Sandy's description  of the email, as well as testimony from other witnesses. The hold was  not part of a larger review of foreign aid. We do know it was not the  result of a policy debate about what was best for America. It came  ``out of the blue.'' We now know why it was done: to turn the screws on  Ukraine to provide political help for the President.   The hold was immediately suspect simply because of its timing. Duffey  later asked Blair about the reason for the hold. Blair gave no  explanation. Instead he said ``we need to let the hold take place'' and  then ``revisit'' the issue with the President. Blair either didn't know  the reason or wouldn't share the real reason because it was corrupt. It  sure would be nice to know what Blair knew about the reason for the  hold and what Duffey knew. We could ask them the question if you  authorize a subpoena.   Now, we had hoped, as we said, that the Senate would authorize  subpoenas before our arguments were made. We thought it would have been  helpful. But we know that you will have another opportunity to call  witnesses, to require documents, and we hope that your decision will be  informed by the arguments we are making to you over these days and that  you will, in fact, get the full story.   Well, we do know actually the reason why the President did what he  did. We know the President held the money. It wasn't because of any  policy reason to benefit America or any concern about corruption in  Ukraine or any desire for more burden-sharing from other countries. It  was because the President was upset that Ukraine was not announcing the  investigations that he wanted because he wanted to ramp up pressure to  force them to do it.   From the very beginning, it was clear the hold was not in America's  national interest. Those within the U.S. Government responsible for  Ukraine security and for shaping and implementing U.S. foreign policy  were caught off guard by the President's decision. Support for the aid  and against the hold was unanimous, forceful, and unwavering. The  President can call Ukraine policy experts ``unelected bureaucrats'' all  he wants, but those are officers charged with implementing his official  policy developed by the President himself, which was also a product of  congressional action.   Anyway, it wasn't just the career officers. President Trump's own  politically appointed senior officials--his Cabinet members--also  opposed the hold. Why? Because it was against our national interest.   But the President wasn't persuaded by arguments about national  interest. Why? Because the hold had nothing to do with the national  interest. It had to do with the interest of just one person, Donald J.  Trump.   The demand for Ukraine to announce these investigations was not a  policy decision but a personal decision by the President to benefit his  own personal interest. At an NSC-led meeting on July 8, OMB announced  that President Trump had directed a hold on Ukraine security  assistance. The news shocked meeting participants. Ambassador Taylor  testified that he and others on the call ``sat in astonishment'' when  they learned about the hold. He immediately ``realized that one of the  key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened.''    David Holmes, political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv,  testified he was ``shocked'' and thought the hold was ``extremely  significant'' because it undermined what he understood to be  longstanding U.S. policy in Ukraine. Catherine Croft, the State  Department special adviser for Ukraine, testified that the announcement  ``blew up the meeting.''   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent said. ``There was  great confusion among the rest of us because we didn't understand why  that had happened.'' He explained: Since there was unanimity about this  security assistance to Ukraine, it was in our national interest, it  just surprised all of us.   The policy consensus at this and later NSC meetings was clear. With  the exception of OMB, which was following the direction of the  President, everyone supported lifting the hold. All the way up to the  No. 2 officials at the agencies--the political appointees of President  Trump--there was unanimous agreement that the hold was ill-advised and  the aid should be released.   Tim Morrison, national security adviser to John Bolton, understood  that the most senior appointed officials ``were all supportive of the  continued disbursement of the aid.''   On August 15, at the President's golf club in Bedminster, NJ, members  of the President's Cabinet ``all represented to Ambassador Bolton that  they were prepared to tell President they endorsed the swift release  and disbursement of the funding.''   The President ignored his advisers' recommendation to lift the hold.  He provided no credible explanation for it--not from the day the hold  was made until the day it was lifted.   Witness after witness--including Hale, Vindman, Croft, Holmes, Kent,  Cooper, Sandy--testified they weren't  [[Page S522]]  given any reason for the hold while it was in place.   Croft said: ``[T]he only reason given was that the order came at the  direction of the President.''   Mr. Holmes confirmed: ``The order had come from the President without  further explanation.''   Kent testified too: ``I don't recall any coherent explanation.''   Ambassador Sondland agreed: ``I was never given a straight answer as  to why it had been put in place to begin with.''   Dr. Hill explained: ``No, there was no reason given.''   Even Senator McConnell has said: ``I was not given an explanation for  the hold.''   Even as OMB was implementing the hold, officers in OMB were saying it  should be lifted. Mr. Sandy testified that his team drafted a memo on  August 7 to OMB Acting Director Russ Vought. It recommended lifting the  hold because of, one, the assistance was consistent with national  security to support a stable, peaceful Europe; two, the aid countered  Russian aggression; and three, there was bipartisan support for the  program.   Michael Duffey, the senior political appointee overseeing funds,  approved the memorandum. He agreed with the policy recommendations, and  it wasn't just OMB. Senior advisers in the administration tried over  and over again to convince President Trump to lift the hold over the  summer.   Sometime prior to August 16, Ambassador Bolton had a one-on-one  meeting with President Trump about the aid. The President didn't budge.  Then, at the end of August, when the hold on the aid became public,  Ambassador Taylor expressed to multiple officials his concerns about  withholding the aid from Ukraine at a time when it was fighting Russia.  Ambassador Taylor stressed the importance of the hold not just as a  message to Ukraine but, importantly, to Russia as well. Withholding the  aid on vital military assistance while Ukraine was in the midst of a  hot war with Russia sent a message to Russia about U.S. support of  Ukraine.   Ambassador Taylor felt so strongly about the harm withholding the  security assistance that for the first time ever in his decades of  service at the State Department, he sent a first-person cable with his  concerns to Secretary Pompeo. In the cable, he described directly the  ``folly'' that Taylor saw in withholding the aid. Here is his  testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Patrick MALONEY: Have you ever sent a cable like that? How       many times in your career of 40, 50 years have you sent a       cable directly to the Secretary of State?        Bill TAYLOR: Once.        Patrick MALONEY: This time?        Bill TAYLOR: Yes, sir.        Patrick MALONEY: In 50 years?        Bill TAYLOR: Rifle company commanders don't send cables,       but yes, sir.    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Ambassador Taylor never received an answer to  the cable, but he was told that Secretary Pompeo carried it with him to  a White House meeting about security assistance to Ukraine.   It seemed this meeting about the aid may have occurred on August 30.  There are press reports that Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Esper, and  National Security Advisor Bolton discussed the hold with President  Trump shortly after Ambassador Taylor sent his cable. Keep this in  mind. This was 2 days after the hold was publicly reported and after  the President was briefed on the whistleblower complaint. Yet, even  then, President Trump refused to release the aid.   On August 30, Michael Duffey sent an email to Elaine McCusker, the  DOD comptroller. It said: ``Clear direction from POTUS to continue to  hold.'' President Trump has refused to produce this or any other email  to Congress.   When the administration was forced to produce it in a freedom of  information case in response to a court order, this critical passage  was actually blacked out. What is the reason for blacking out this  direction from the President about an issue so central to this case? No  reason has been given to us. So you should ask yourself this: What is  the President hiding?   The President finally released the hold on September 11, but, again,  there was no credible reason given for the release. Mark Sandy  testified that he could not recall another instance ``where a  significant amount of assistance was being held up'' and he ``didn't  have a rationale in this case.''   On the day it was released, OMB still didn't know why President Trump  had ordered the hold. On September 11, the day the President finally  released the aid, McCusker at DOD reportedly sent an email to Duffey  asking: ``What happened?''   Michael Duffey answered: ``Not exactly clear but President made the  decision to go. Will fill you in when I get details.''   So let's take a step back for a minute. Why was no reason given to  anyone for the President deciding to hold up hundreds of millions of  dollars in military assistance to our allies? Because there was no  supportable reason for withholding the aid. No one agreed with it.  According to the 17 witnesses in the House impeachment inquiry,  President Trump insisted on holding the aid and provided no reason,  despite unanimous support for lifting the hold throughout his  administration, including his handpicked top advisers. It also wasn't  consistent with American policy. The aid had the clear support of  career officers and political appointees in President Trump's  administration as important for national security. There was no  national security or foreign policy reason provided. No one could think  of one. DOD had already certified to Congress, as the law required,  that Ukraine had met the anti-corruption conditions for the aid and  that it planned to begin implementing the expenditures.    So why did the President do this? I think we know why. The President  ordered the hold for an improper purpose: to pressure Ukraine to  announce investigations that would personally benefit President Trump.   That brings us to a key point. It wasn't just that the President  ordered a hold on the aid without any explanation against the unanimous  advice of his advisers and even after, for weeks, as his  administration--both career and political appointees--continued to try  to get him to release the hold. What the President was trying to hide  was worse. What the President did was not just wrong; it was illegal.   In ordering the hold, President Trump not only took a position  contrary to his senior advisers, counter to congressional intent, and  adverse to American national security interests in Ukraine, he also  violated the law.   This issue was not a surprise. From the start of the hold in July,  compliance of the Impoundment Control Act was a significant concern for  OMB and DOD officials. Mark Sandy raised concerns with his supervisor,  Michael Duffey, that the hold might violate Impoundment Control Act.  DOD voiced the same concerns.   Laura Cooper from DOD described the discussion at a July 26 meeting  with No. 2 officials at all of the relevant agencies about the hold,  stating: ``Immediately, deputies began to raise concerns about how this  could be done in a legal fashion.'' She further testified that there  was no legal mechanism to use to implement the hold after Congress had  been notified of the release of the funding.   At a July 31 meeting with more junior officials, Laura Cooper put all  attendees on notice, including representatives of the White House, that  because ``there were only two legally available options, and we do not  have direction to pursue either,'' DOD would have to start spending the  funds on or about August 6.   In other words, the President had a choice. He could release the aid,  or he could break the law. He chose to break the law. He was so  determined to turn up the pressure on Ukraine that he kept the hold for  no legitimate purpose and without any congressional notification for  long enough to violate the law.   The concerns from OMB and DOD were ultimately accurate. As has been  mentioned just last week, the nonpartisan Government Accountability  Office found that President Trump broke the law by implementing the  hold and in failing to notify Congress about it.   Because of the President's hold, DOD was ultimately unable to spend  all the $250 million in security assistance before the end of the  fiscal year, as Congress--as we--intended.  [[Page S523]]    As GAO explained, the Constitution grants the President no unilateral  authority to withhold funds from obligation. And they further  explained:         Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President       to substitute his own constitutional priorities for those       that Congress has enacted into law. OMB withheld funds for a       policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment       Control Act.    The bottom line, President Trump froze the aid to increase the  pressure on Ukraine to announce the investigations he wanted. He  violated the law. He violated his constitutional duty to take care that  the laws be faithfully executed.   But the President didn't just violate the Impoundment Control Act  while pressuring Ukraine to announce the investigations he wanted. He  was dishonest about it in the process. This is really telling because  he is still not telling the truth about it even now.   The budget documents that implemented the hold until September 11  asserted that it was being imposed to ``allow for an interagency  process to determine the best use of such funds.''   But that wasn't true. There was no ongoing interagency process after  July 31 after it became clear that the entire interagency, including  Cabinet offices, unanimously agreed the aid should be released. The  truth is, there simply was no debate or review in the interagency  regarding the best use of such funds. So the reason given by the  President was not only illegal; it was false too.   The dishonesty in the budget documents weren't the only steps that  the President's men at OMB took to cover up his misconduct and enable  his scheme. OMB went so far as to remove the authority to approve the  budget documents from Mark Sandy, a career officer, and gave it to  Michael Duffey, a political appointee without experience managing such  documents.   This change was unusual. It occurred less than 2 weeks after Sandy  raised concerns that the hold violated the law. Sandy was not aware of  any prior instance when a political appointee assumed this kind of  funding approval authority.   Duffey's explanation that he simply wanted to learn more about the  accounts doesn't make sense to Sandy. Really? This odd change in  responsibility was just another way to keep the President's illegal  hold within a tight-knit unit of loyal soldiers within the OMB.   Michael Duffey defied the House's subpoena. At the President's  direction, he refused to appear. The White House did not assert any  privileges or immunities when it directed Duffey to defy Congress's  subpoena. It wasn't a real exercise of executive privilege. They told  him not to appear, and they had no reason why.   If Mr. Duffey knew about any legitimate reason for the hold, I will  bet he would not have been blocked from testifying. The fact that he  was blocked might lead you to infer that his testimony would be  damaging to the President and would be consistent with the testimony of  the other witnesses that the hold was solely used to ratchet up  pressure on Ukraine.    But the warning from DOD wasn't just about how the hold was illegal.  There were also practical consequences. By August 12, the Department of  Defense told OMB it could no longer guarantee it would be able to spend  all $250 million that Congress had directed before the end of the  fiscal year.   Not long after this August 12 email, DOD determined that time had run  out. Ms. Cooper testified that DOD estimated that as much as $100  million of aid might go unspent, even if the hold was immediately  lifted. As a result, DOD refused to certify that it would be able to  spend the funds by September 30.   On August 20, OMB issued the first of six budget documents and  removed the language providing legal cover for the hold. From that  point on, the White House knew that DOD would not be able to spend all  the funds, which was what the law required before September 30. Yet,  even though he knew the hold would violate the Impoundment Control Act,  President Trump continued the hold for another 23 days without telling  us--without telling the Congress.   This had the exact outcome that DOD feared. After the President  lifted the hold on the evening of September 11, DOD had only 18 days to  spend the remaining $223 million, which is about 89 percent of the  total. DOD scrambled, and they spent all but approximately $35 million.  About 14 percent of the appropriated funds were left.   That $35 million would have expired and would have been forever lost  to Ukraine had Congress not stepped in to pass a law to roll the money  over to the next year. But even as of today, more than $18 million of  that money has not yet been spent. Why? You will have to ask DOD. They  haven't given us a reason.   OK, all of this shows, clearly, that President Trump knowingly and  willfully violated the law when he withheld aid from Ukraine. But just  to be clear, the Articles of Impeachment do not charge Donald Trump  with violating the Impoundment Control Act. We are not arguing that,  but understanding this violation of the law is important to  understanding the broader scheme of his abuse of power. It shows the  great lengths the President was willing to go to in order to pressure  Ukraine to do his political dirty work.   The security assistance wasn't something the law allowed him to give  or take at his discretion. No, he was legally obliged to release the  money, but he simply didn't care.   Why? He was so determined to get the announcement from Ukraine to  smear his election opponent that holding the aid to force Ukraine to do  that was the most important thing. He didn't care if he was breaking  the law.   I have been sitting here on the Senate floor. Honestly, I never  wanted to be here under these circumstances. But I have been looking at  ``novus ordo seclorum.'' Now, I didn't study Latin. So I had to look it  up. It means: ``A new order of the ages is born.'' That is what the  Founders thought they were doing. Keeping that new order, the  democracy, where the power is in the hands of the people, not in the  hands of an unaccountable executive, is what we in the Congress--the  House and the Senate--are charged to do.   Senator Blunt and I are in charge of the Joint Committee on Printing.  Every year, we print a new copy of the Constitution. This year, in the  back, we printed a quote: ``At the conclusion of the Constitutional  Convention, Benjamin Franklin was asked, `What have you wrought?' He  answered, ` . . . a Republic, if you can keep it.' ''   That is the challenge that all of us face, and that you Senators  face.   I turn now to Mr. Crow, who will outline information about the  President's intentions.   Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, counsel  for the President, just bear with us a little while longer. I promise,  we are almost there.   You have heard a lot the last few days about what happened. How do we  know that the President ordered the hold to pressure Ukraine to  announce investigations that would help his personal political  campaign? In other words, how do we know why it happened?   We know it because, to this day, there is no other explanation. We  know it because senior administration officials, including the  President's own senior political appointees, have confirmed it. We know  it because the President's own Chief of Staff said it at a national  press conference. And we know it because the President himself directed  it.   Here are the facts. One, the President asked President Zelensky for a  favor on July 25, and we all know what that favor was.   Two, multiple U.S. officials with fact-based knowledge of the process  have confirmed it.   Three, President Trump lifted the hold only after his scheme was  exposed.   Four, there were no other legitimate explanations for the release of  the hold. It was not based on a legitimate review of the foreign aid.  It was not based on concerns of corruption in Ukraine. It was not  because President Trump wanted countries to pay more. There are no  facts that show that the President cared about any of those things.   Five, as we know, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney admitted  at a press conference that the bogus 2016 election interference  allegations were ``why we held up the money.''   Eventually, the truth comes out. There was no legitimate policy  reason  [[Page S524]]  for holding the aid. So the truth came out.   As Ambassador Sondland said, the President was a businessman who saw  congressionally approved, taxpayer-funded military aid for Ukraine, our  partner at war, as just another business deal to be made. Military aid  in exchange for fabricated dirt on his political opponent. Dirt for  dollars. This for that. A quid pro quo.   Let's start with the President's own words to President Zelensky on  the July 25 call. With the hold on his mind and on President Zelensky's  mind, too--we know that--President Trump linked military aid to his  request for a favor. At the very beginning of the call, President  Zelensky said:         I would also like to thank you for your great support in       the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate       for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy       more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.    The ``great support in the area of defense'' included, of course, the  $391 million in military aid, because remember, just a month before,  DOD had publicly announced its intent to provide $250 million of that  aid. President Zelensky was showing gratitude to the President for the  aid that DOD had just announced would be on its way. But the President  had put a hold just a few weeks before.   Immediately after President Zelensky brought up the U.S. military  support and said that Ukraine was almost ready to buy more Javelin  anti-tank missiles, President Trump pivoted to what he wanted in  return. He turned from the quid to the quo.   President Trump immediately responded. He said: ``I would like you to  do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and  Ukraine knows a lot about it.''   And what was that favor? Well, we all know by now; don't we? It  wasn't to fight corruption. It wasn't to help the United States or our  national interests. It was the two specific political investigations  that he wanted Ukraine to announce to help his own personal political  campaign. President Trump's quick pivot from the critical military aid  that he knew Ukraine desperately needed to the investigations that  would benefit him personally speaks volumes. By bringing up the  investigations immediately after President Zelensky raised the issue of  military support, he linked the two issues.   U.S. officials listening to the call also made that connection. Here  is what Jennifer Williams, Vice President Pence's aide, testified:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the  trial adjourn until 1 p.m., Friday, January 24, and that this order  also constitute the adjournment of the Senate.   There being no objection, at 10:32 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, adjourned until Friday, January 24, 2020, at 1  p.m.
