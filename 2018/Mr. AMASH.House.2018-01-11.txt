The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 682, the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Amash) and a Member opposed each will  control 10 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment replaces the underlying bill with the USA  RIGHTS Act. Like the base bill, under the USA RIGHTS Act, the  government can still use section 702 for its purpose of surveilling  foreigners overseas; and the government can continue to store, share,  and access that data to investigate national security threats.   The key difference is, in USA RIGHTS, it has to do with the  collection and use of innocent Americans' data, not foreign  intelligence. This means the amendment cannot harm section 702 programs  if, as the government says, they are designed solely for foreign  intelligence rather than domestic surveillance on Americans.   We all want the intelligence community to be able to do its job, and  I have offered the USA RIGHTS amendment to give them the tools to  collect foreign intelligence while also protecting the Fourth  Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, my amendment protects the rights of Americans  consistent with the Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).                                time  1030     Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ted Lieu).   Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, let me make this issue  really simple for the American people: spying on foreigners without  following the Constitution, that is okay; spying on Americans without  following the Constitution, that is not okay.   The Fourth Amendment does not have an asterisk that says our  intelligence agencies don't have to follow it. The Constitution applies  to all of government. That is why I support the USA RIGHTS Act.   Support this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time each side  has remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 3\3/4\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 2\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, my amendment protects the rights of Americans  consistent with the Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 1\3/4\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Garrett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Garrett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this body cannot be afraid of the  Constitution. It has been our guiding moral force for this Nation for  all of our beginnings and our nows.   This amendment is truly an amendment that will protect and provide  for the FBI to do its work and to protect our men and women around the  world who are wearing the uniform unselfishly. But let me be very  clear: all this amendment does, frankly, is provide a roadmap for the  FBI to utilize when it is surveying and it is using the private data of  Americans. All the amendment does is ask the FBI and the Attorney  General, where there is probable cause, that such communication provide  evidence of a crime; and, as well, if there is a foreign power or  foreign agent, to be able to utilize a warrant, and that is the  protection of the Fourth Amendment.   Uphold the Constitution. Vote for the Amash-Lofgren amendment and  let's move forward on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to whether the gentleman has  additional speakers?    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time each side  has remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 1 minute  remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 1 minute remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill and the USA RIGHTS amendment present  a stark choice.  [[Page H157]]    The underlying bill allows the government to warrantlessly collect an  astounding volume of Americans' communications, makes no material  reforms to the collection and use of that data against Americans, and  explicitly allows even more surveillance than the law currently  permits.   In contrast, USA RIGHTS allows the government to conduct broad  foreign surveillance and share intelligence throughout the relevant  agencies, but it also adds protections to prevent the erosion of  Americans' Fourth Amendment rights.   These are two very different options, Mr. Speaker, but for all of us  who care about civil liberties, who believe the United States can  protect itself without retiring the Fourth Amendment, and who believe  Congress has an independent obligation to protect the Constitution, the  choice is clear: support the USA RIGHTS amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on adoption of the amendment will be followed  by 5-minute votes on:   A motion to commit, if ordered;   Passage of the bill, if ordered; and   The motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 4578.
