 Mr. President, we are doing a number of important things  in the Senate this week.   Last night, we passed the Natural Resources Management Act. This is a  bipartisan package of more than 100 individual bills that will help  protect our natural resources, spur economic development, increase  access to public lands, and much more.   I was very pleased that my Custer County Airport Conveyance Act,  which I introduced with the other Members of the South Dakota  delegation, was included in this bill. This legislation will give  Custer County Airport full ownership of the land on which it operates  and allow the airport to make improvements to its facilities.   Custer County Airport supports business and recreational aviation and  fire suppression efforts in the Black Hills region, and I am pleased  that this bill will increase the airport's ability to serve this area  of South Dakota.   I am grateful to Chairman Murkowski for her leadership on this  important lands package, as well as to Ranking Member Manchin and all  of those who worked on these bills at the committee level.
