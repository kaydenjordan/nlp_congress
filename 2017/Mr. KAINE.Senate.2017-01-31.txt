 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise to speak concerning the nomination  by President Trump of Rex Tillerson to be Secretary of State. I believe  I am going  [[Page S518]]  to be speaking a little bit this afternoon and possibly later. This  will just be part of my remarks this afternoon.   First, I am going to say some positive things about Mr. Tillerson's  career and the importance of the position, but then I want to talk  about the reason for my opposition, which has to do largely with my  concern about whether he is capable of exercising truly independent  judgment on behalf of the United States, particularly given his 41-year  career with ExxonMobil.   To begin, Mr. Tillerson has an exemplary record with ExxonMobil. I  was impressed by it. I have been impressed by his business acumen. I  think this one would, frankly, be relatively straightforward if he had  been nominated for Secretary of Commerce. I think it would be  relatively straightforward had he been nominated for Secretary of  Energy.   That is an interesting aspect of some of these nominations. I think  there are some people who are up who--if they were in other positions,  they might be easier, but because of the ones they have been nominated  for, it has made it a little more difficult. I put Mr. Tillerson in  that category.   Secretary of State is an enormously important position. We all know  that it is important, but we, even for the public, separate the  Secretary of State position from others.   There are four Cabinet Secretaries who by law are not allowed to be  involved in political campaigns. They can't go out on the campaign  trail during election season. They are designated as ``special,'' and I  think they are special for a reason--Secretary of Defense, Secretary of  State, Secretary of Treasury, and the Attorney General. The reason  these four positions are made separate, in my view, is they are  positions that are supposed to have a special gravity, positions that  are supposed to be above politics. They are also positions that are  supposed to have a degree of independence.   An Attorney General needs to have a degree of independence from a  President because that individual must weigh in on the legality of  actions even of the administration in making decisions. I think the  Secretary of State needs some independence and gravitas as well. That  is why the Secretary of State position is such a special one.   I want to focus on this area of independence and the independence I  wanted to see in a Secretary of State Tillerson and that I did not feel  comfortable enough after the research I have done and after the hearing  itself. It fits into three basic categories--issues with respect to  climate, issues with respect to Russia, and issues with respect to the  development policy that the United States uses in nations around the  world, including very poor nations that are resource rich but often  find that their oil reserves or other natural resources put them into  kind of a resource-cursed position where, resources notwithstanding,  they actually trend toward authoritarianism and keeping their citizens  in poverty.   Let me start with climate. Climate is an enormously important issue  in Virginia, as it is to all States, but to give you kind of the  Virginia focus on climate issues, Virginia voters overwhelmingly  believe that humans are affecting climate and that something should be  done about it. We have 134 counties. The eastern part of Virginia-- Hamilton Roads, near the Atlantic--is the second most threatened area  in the United States to sea level rise. So if you go to Hampton Roads,  VA--1.6 million people, the center of naval power in the United States  and the world--what you find is sea level rise accelerating to the  extent that neighborhoods where you could once sell a house, you can't  sell it anymore. Flooding that was once every few years is now regular.   Even our Nation's military operations in Hampton Roads are  jeopardized. There is a main road leading into the Norfolk Naval Base,  which is the largest naval base in the United States--the largest naval  base in the world. That road is increasingly flooded just during normal  tidal conditions. We are not talking about storms; we are talking about  normal tidal conditions. The inability to get road access into  America's center of naval power is highly challenging, highly  problematic. In the future, it is going to be very expensive for us.   So the climate change issues in Hampton Roads--whether it is  affecting your ability to sell a house, the ability to conduct naval  operations--and in many other areas is of deep concern to my State.   There are climate issues in other parts of my State, from weather  patterns to warming temperatures wiping out species in the Shenandoah  National Park because as the temperature warms, the species need to  move higher and higher, and at some point they can't move any higher.  So there are endangered species in the Shenandoah National Park because  of climate issues.   The issue is not only important to my State, it is a critically  important part of the job. The Secretary of State in the previous  administration was involved in crafting the Paris climate accord.  Nearly 200 nations agreed that climate change is a huge problem and  that we have to do something about it, and each nation came forward  voluntarily to craft its own plan so that the world could deal with  this problem.   The U.S. played a critical role--Secretary Kerry and others--in  forging this global coalition around the overwhelming scientific  consensus. The Secretary of State in this administration, along with  others--the EPA Administrator--will play a key role in determining  whether we continue to take seriously climate, whether we continue to  take seriously the promises we made under the climate accord, or  whether we go backward. I don't want to go backward because it would  hurt my State and hurt our country and hurt the world.   During my examination of Mr. Tillerson during his confirmation  hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I was not happy  with the answers with respect to climate issues. The overwhelming  majority of scientists say that climate change is real and that it is  caused significantly by the burning of fossil fuels and the release of  CO2. This is not a controversial conclusion; it should not  be partisan, either.   The first climate bill that was introduced in this body was  introduced by Senator McCain in 2004. Then, in 2007, a predecessor of  mine, Senator Warner of Virginia, a Republican, and Senator Lieberman  of Connecticut, a Democrat, introduced a bipartisan bill. Senator  Warner, now retired--John Warner--still speaks regularly on the  national security implications of climate change.   During the hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I  examined Rex Tillerson about the role of ExxonMobil in climate  research. ExxonMobil is a company that is chock-full of engineers and  scientists. It is one of the most accomplished companies in the world  if you just measure it by the extent of engineering and science talent  that it has.   There has been a series of investigative articles in the last few  years in the Los Angeles Times, the New York Review of Books, and  Inside Climate News that get into the question of what ExxonMobil knew  about climate science and what they told the public. I wanted to ask  Mr. Tillerson about this. Some of the information that I put on the  table during that examination: There was an internal letter in  September of 1982 from Exxon's Theoretical and Mathematical Science  Laboratory. This was during the time Mr. Tillerson was working for the  company.   I want to read a quote from this letter which I put into the Record  as I was examining Mr. Tillerson:         However, over the past several years a clear scientific       consensus has emerged regarding the expected climate effects       of increased atmospheric CO2. . . . There is       unanimous agreement in the scientific community that a       temperature increase of this magnitude would bring about       significant changes in the earth's climate. The time required       for doubling of atmospheric CO2--    Doubling of atmospheric CO2--       depends upon the future world consumption of fossil fuels.       There is potential for our research to attract the attention       of the popular news media because of the connection between       Exxon's major business and the role of fossil fuel combustion       in contributing to the increase of atmospheric       CO2. . . . [O]ur ethical responsibility is to       permit the publication of our research in the scientific       literature; indeed, to do otherwise would be a breach of       Exxon's public position and ethical credo on honesty and       integrity.    In other words, by 1982 the key scientific research organizations  within  [[Page S519]]  ExxonMobil, which has a sterling cadre of scientists and researchers,  said: Here is our view of the scientific research--and not just other  scientific research, they did their own studies to replicate it. They  concluded that the burning of fossil fuels was going to lead  potentially to a significant increase in global temperature, with  catastrophic climate effects.   There is other information as well that ExxonMobil had within it  during Mr. Tillerson's tenure with the company. But by 2000, ExxonMobil  in its face to the public was saying something very different. Despite  the internal recognition of climate science and the potential effects  on the economy and on our atmosphere and despite scientists with  ExxonMobil saying we have an ethical duty to share these facts with the  scientific community, by 2000, ExxonMobil was publishing, in major  publications in this country, op-eds--full-page op-eds in newspapers  and magazines. I am going to read a quote from one, an ExxonMobil  published op-ed in 2001:         Knowing that weather forecasts are reliable for a few days       at best, we should recognize the enormous challenge facing       scientists seeking to predict climate change and its impact       over the next century.        Geological evidence indicates climate greenhouse gas levels       experience significant natural variability for reasons having       nothing to do with human activity. . . . Against this       backdrop of large, poorly understood natural invariability,       it is impossible for scientists to attribute the recent small       surface temperature increase to human causes.    So, from 1982, there were scientists at ExxonMobil who were aware of  it and were saying we have a duty to share this with the public and  with our fellow scientists, but by 2000, in statements to the American  public--all during Rex Tillerson's tenure at ExxonMobil--the company  was taking a very different position.   I summarized this material during my examination of Mr. Tillerson  before the Foreign Relations Committee, and I asked him: What do you  have to say about this evidence and about the numerous public reports  that ExxonMobil knew about climate science but made a decision to tell  the American public something different? A pretty straightforward  question from a Senator whose State is experiencing climate change, a  pretty important question for a nominee who will be in charge of, as  Secretary of State, carrying out our obligations under agreements, such  as the Paris climate agreement.   Mr. Tillerson's answer to me was a little surprising. He said: Oh, I  can't answer this. You are going to have to ask somebody at ExxonMobil.   He had stepped away from ExxonMobil a few days before the hearing. I  was puzzled by it. So I went back to him and I said: Well, wait a  minute. I want to make sure I got this right. You were at ExxonMobil  for 41 years.   That is right.   You were an executive at ExxonMobil for more than half of your tenure  there; isn't that right?   That is right.   You were the CEO of ExxonMobil beginning, I believe, in 2006; am I  right about that?   You are right about that.   I am not asking the company's position. You now are no longer at  ExxonMobil. I am asking you, as somebody who is going to be in charge  of carrying forward America's obligations under the Paris climate  accord, whether the allegation that ExxonMobil knew about climate  science but chose to say something different to the American public--I  am going to ask you if you can answer that question.   And he came back again and said: You are going to have to ask  somebody at ExxonMobil.   I then asked Mr. Tillerson a really important question. I said this:  Do you lack the knowledge to answer my questions or are you refusing to  answer my questions?   And he said: A little bit of both. A little bit of both.   And I said to him: You have been there 41 years. I have a hard time  believing you don't know the answer to this question. I think you are  refusing to answer my question, and he didn't comment on that.   I then followed up with one more question to Mr. Tillerson that I  also think was important because I am a lawyer, and I just wanted to  make sure I understood this. I asked him: Are you sitting here today  subject to any kind of a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit  you from answering the question I just posed to you? And he said no,  that he was not.   I asked Mr. Tillerson these questions because I am deeply interested  in climate change. It affects my State in a significant way, and it is  directly relevant to his job, but I asked him for another reason as  well. I am just going to talk for a minute about the reason, and I am  going to yield to my colleague from Oregon and return later this  evening on the other points.   The reason I was asking Mr. Tillerson about this was not just his  awareness of science, I was asking him to see whether at this point, as  a nominee for Secretary of State of the United States, he could set  aside a 41-year loyalty to his previous employer, ExxonMobil, and  instead focus solely on his obligations to this country if he were to  be confirmed as Secretary of State.   I believe he knew the answer to the question I asked him, and he told  me he was not under any legal agreement that would bar him from  answering my question, but he, nevertheless, refused to answer my  question. When I challenged him on it and said: You are refusing to  answer my question, he basically agreed that was the case.   I think we are entitled to a Secretary of State who can set aside any  other loyalty, including an understandable loyalty to an employer of 41  years, and exercise complete and independent judgment on behalf of the  interests of this country. The refusal of Mr. Tillerson to answer my  questions about a matter clearly within his knowledge, clearly within  the job description of Secretary of State and deeply important to my  Commonwealth, led me to have significant doubts about whether he could  separate his previous employment from his independent obligation to  this job, should he be confirmed.   I am going to have more to say on a couple of other issues related to  this independence point when I return later this evening.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
