 Mr. President, there has been a longstanding question of  whether there would be drilling for oil in the eastern Gulf of Mexico  off of the State of Florida.   This had been settled in law 10 years ago. Then, my colleague Senator  Mel Martinez and I passed a portion of legislation called GOMESA. That  portion of the legislation put the drilling off of Florida in the  eastern Gulf--everything east of a north-south line called the Military  Mission Line, which is a line running south of approximately Fort  Walton Beach--everything east of that is off limits in law to any kind  of oil drilling activity, along with the remainder of the coast of  Florida; 125 miles from the coast going all the way over to Pensacola  and to the Perdido River, which is the Alabama-Florida line.   The reasons for this are many, but not the least of which is called  the Military Mission Line. That area of the Gulf off of Florida is the  largest testing and training area for the United States military in the  world. Compared to other testing ranges, such as the Nevada Test Site-- it dwarfs that site. As we can see, from north to south, we have ranges  as far as 300 miles from east to west. For example, off of Naples, FL,  all the way west to the Military Mission Line is approximately 250  miles. That has been needed by our U.S. military because of the testing  and training.   It has been doubted over the years as the relentless pursuit of oil  drilling by the oil industry has tried to erode into that, and that is  why, in a bipartisan way, Senator Martinez and I put in law for the  period of years through 2022, from when we passed this back in 2006, it  off limits.   The question is, What is coming afterward? Well, of course if it is  up to the Department of Defense, there will be no oil drilling  activity. That is what I wanted to bring to the attention of the Senate  today.   Two previous Secretaries of Defense in Republican administrations,  including Secretary Rumsfeld, have written letters to state the policy  that any oil-related activity in that testing and training range would  be incompatible with the mission of the testing and training of the  U.S. military.   The reason I am bringing this to the attention of the Senate today is  that a letter signed by the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness has just come into my possession. A gentleman  named  Mr. President, in conclusion, we can't have oil drilling,  not only for our national security and the testing and training of our  most sophisticated weapons systems in the Gulf off of Florida, but also  we couldn't stand it if we had another oil spill that would do to us  what the last one did. It was a spill way far west off of Louisiana,  but it drifted to the east and blackened the sugary white sands of  Pensacola Beach and Destin Beach, and there were tar balls as far east  as Panama City Beach. Because of that, we lost an entire season of our  guests, our tourists. They did not come to the Gulf Coast of Florida,  not just in the Florida panhandle but all the way south down the Gulf  to Naples and to Marco Island--a $60 billion per year tourism industry  for Florida's economy. We can't suffer that kind of shock again.   So whether it be the degradation of the environment, the messing up  of the training and testing of our U.S. military and their largest  testing and training range, or the devastating economic loss to Florida  of its tourism industry--for all those reasons, we need to pass this  legislation. It will be coming forth in a bipartisan fashion.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
