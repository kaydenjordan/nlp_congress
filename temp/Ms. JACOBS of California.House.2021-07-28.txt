 Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose my  colleague Congresswoman Claudia Tenney's amendment No. 34, which would  maintain the arbitrary 25 percent cap on U.S. contributions to U.N.  peacekeeping operations.   I recently introduced legislation, the U.S. Commitment to  Peacekeeping Act that would, among other things, permanently repeal  this cap and ensure that the United States is fulfilling its  commitments to the United Nations.   As someone who used to work at the U.N. Department of Peace  Operations, I know firsthand how the cap and resulting arrears have  harmed our interests. It damages our standing and credibility at the  U.N. making it difficult to effectively advocate for human rights.   It reduces our ability to conduct proper oversight and accountability  through needed reforms, something my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle agree is important.   It also impairs peacekeeping missions' ability to operate and delays  funding to peacekeepers.   All of this makes it harder for the United States to advocate for and  secure its interests. In order to fully lead on the global stage, we  need to fully commit to our international obligations.   Tenney amendment No. 34 is counterproductive. I oppose it in the  strongest terms, and urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting these  efforts to weaken our standing at the U.N. and around the world.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this en  bloc package and thank the gentlewoman for including my amendment  today.   Madam Speaker, before coming to Congress, I served at the State  Department working on countering and preventing violent extremism and  addressing the real drivers behind it. What we know is that it is not  possible to solely rely on security assistance and military tools to  counter violent extremism. In fact, one of the common drivers of local  recruitment into these extremist groups is abuses by state security  forces.   When the United States provides security assistance to militaries  tasked with countering violent groups, we need to acknowledge the  possible consequences and ensure that the assistance we do provide is  not going to people who will abuse their own citizens and, in turn,  exacerbate the very problem we are seeking to address in the first  place. We need to properly allocate resources to actually address the  drivers of violence and conflict, which means more funding to efforts  like the Global Fragility Act.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues on these  efforts.    Mr. Speaker, this past year exposed deep  inequities in our society, but it did not create them.   In San Diego County, 60 percent of families couldn't access the  childcare they needed before the pandemic. We know it has only gotten  worse.   It isn't enough to just get back to normal. For too many families,  ``normal'' wasn't working.   That is why I am so proud that, this week, we will pass  appropriations legislation that increases funding for education,  healthcare, childcare, and more. I am proud that the package includes  $3 million in local project funding for my district, including funding  to boost early learning and multimedia education in Linda Vista and  City Heights and to make Balboa Park more accessible.   I am also grateful that the package includes my request for $1  million for San Diego County's Child Care Expansion Fund to help  providers increase available spots for care.   There is so much work to be done to build the future we deserve, and  I am grateful to be here doing it on behalf of the community that I  love.                            ____________________
