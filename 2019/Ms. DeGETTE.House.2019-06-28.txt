 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 2047) to provide for a 2-week extension of  the Medicaid community mental health services demonstration program,  and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
