 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 1565, the Senior Security Act.   This commonsense legislation will provide much-needed information for  policymakers and regulators to fine-tune protections for elderly  investors.   In south Texas, where we share the deep value of respect for our  elders, we say society is judged on how we care for our parents, our  grandparents, and beyond. We all know how closely financial health is  tied to overall well-being. I am proud to support this legislation that  equips us to identify better ways to protect our senior citizens and  for them to protect themselves from fraud and scammers.   This Senior Security Act aims to protect our seniors and prevent  these attacks from happening. This legislation will build upon the  Senior Safe Act by creating an interdivisional task force at the  Securities and Exchange Commission to examine and identify challenges  facing seniors and investors.   Within 2 years of enactment, the U.S. Government Accountability  Office must study and report the economic costs of the financial  exploitation of our seniors. Let's be clear: Scammers will stop at  nothing to take advantage of our seniors, and it is up to us in this  House to stop them.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my congressional colleagues to join me in  supporting this important piece of legislation, and I urge its passage.
