 Mr. President, I rise today because, like many  Americans, I am deeply troubled by the Democrats' reckless calls to  abolish ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. That is  why I am introducing a resolution to condemn calls for the abolishment  of ICE and express support for all officers and personnel who carry out  ICE's important mission of protecting American borders. With the ever  present threat of international terrorism in the post-9/11 era,  abolishing ICE is unthinkable. As our country battles threats from  abroad, a historic opioid crisis, and increasing rates of violence  against law enforcement officers, we must show our support for the  mission of ICE. That is what this resolution does: It says that we see  all of you at ICE and your commitment and that the Senate supports you.   ICE's mission is simple: to protect Americans from the cross-border  crime and illegal immigration that threaten our communities. The  criminal trafficking of persons and goods across our borders is among  the greatest threats to public safety in this country. When ICE agents  take to the streets, they are looking to protect our most vulnerable  from being exploited by cartels and international gangs like MS-13.  This violent gang has taken hold in at least 42 States, including  Louisiana.   Just last year, ICE agents removed a million pounds of narcotics and  more than 4,800 gang members from the streets of this country. They  arrested nearly 800 members of the notoriously violent MS-13 gangs,  like Juan Blanco, who was arrested after assaulting someone with a  machete in Baton Rouge. Those numbers are just a small fraction of the  nearly 127,000 arrests made by ICE agents against people who came here  and committed violent crimes against law-abiding Americans. Those  criminals were responsible for more than 50,000 assaults, 2,000  kidnappings, and 1,800 homicides.   However, in 2017, assaults on law enforcement officers also rose  dramatically. This wasn't limited to police officers; assaults on ICE  agents nearly tripled last year. Now, I am shocked to hear that some of  my colleagues are calling for this important Federal agency to be  abolished. In fact, I learned today that some Democrats in the House of  Representatives plan to introduce legislation that would abolish ICE  and expose its agents to the scrutiny of international courts. This  open contempt for ICE is astonishing, and it belittles the courage of  those who work for this Agency and engage in the legitimate defense of  our borders.   The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency performs vital  functions that are necessary to any government, like securing its  borders. Last year, agents worked tirelessly around the clock to rescue  1,422 victims of  [[Page S5064]]  human trafficking. More than 900 of those victims were children.  Abolishing ICE would mean that these people, these precious lives,  would still be in grave peril. If we were to heed these extremist calls  to abolish ICE, thousands of pounds of heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl  would be in our schools and on the streets of our neighborhoods. We  cannot ignore the role that ICE agents play in combatting terrorism,  sex trafficking, child pornography, gang activity, labor exploitation,  and the opioid crisis.   I want to make sure that our agents understand that the American  people have their back. My resolution will honor the mission of the  Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency and commend the bravery of  these men and women who put their lives on the line every day to  dismantle violent and dangerous gangs. I thank all my Republican  colleagues who are joining with me on this crucial piece of  legislation.   Although much of their work is thankless and goes sight unseen, I am  grateful to the thousands of ICE agents who work around the clocks to  keep our streets safe. Without them and their tireless service, I can  only imagine what our headlines would look like, and I am ashamed of my  colleagues on the radical left who are calling for the elimination of  this vital agency. I know I speak for more than just myself when I say,  simply, don't abolish ICE.                            ____________________
