 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the distinguished career of U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell, who  has dedicated himself to public service for more than 40 years. Tom  retired on Friday, September 1.   Over the last four decades, Chief Tidwell climbed the ranks, starting  as a firefighter and becoming a district ranger, then forest  supervisor, before leading more than 30,000 employees of the U.S.  Forest Service.   Chief Tidwell worked on collaborative approaches to combat wildfires,  maintain support for forests and grasslands, and support community- based partnerships to reduce appeals and increase work.   Since Tom was named chief in 2009, the Forest Service has enhanced  treatments to improve and protect the health and strength of our  forests and grasslands. Because of Chief Tidwell's vision, we have seen  an emphasis on active management, forest products, and clean water.   Under Tom's leadership, the agency has made strides in helping the  ecosystem remain sustainable while addressing the many challenges  threatening America's forests, grasslands, and rural communities.   We are deeply grateful for Tom's 40 years of commitment and service.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chief Tidwell for his friendship and his service,  and I wish him the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
