 Madam Speaker, I rise today to continue to recognize the  month of October as Cybersecurity Awareness Month and to further  highlight the importance of cybersecurity across our country.   Our Nation's safety and security are being challenged by enemies  through cyberspace. As we have seen over the last year, these attacks  can lie dormant for many months before being detected and can have  devastating impacts on our economy and way of life. Furthermore, these  cyberattacks can be carried out by both state and nonstate actors with  ease, as they are relatively inexpensive to execute.   There are certainly effective ways to immediately respond to a  cyberattack, yet victims are often constrained due to lack of  capabilities, knowledge, or resources.   In many ways cyberattacks have emerged as a near-perfect weapon  against our Nation. During these last 10 months in Congress, I have  become aware of just how destructive a cyberattack can be on a small  business. It makes no difference what the business does. The only  concern of the thieves is that the business be vulnerable. That is what  happened to a company in my district in rural north Georgia 3 years  ago.   The operations of a company that manufactured various bathroom  fixtures came to a screeching halt when it was hijacked by a ransomware  attack. This business was then forced to send a $100,000 ransom using  cryptocurrency, bitcoin, to obtain the decryption key that would allow  them to resume functioning. For almost 5 weeks their operations were  shut down by the attack.   When I spoke to the business management team, they told me the attack  happened so quickly that they were not sure what to do or to whom to  turn. In the end, this business suffered a loss of over $1 million in  hard currency--money that had to be paid out to fix or replace  equipment and almost $10 million in lost revenue.   Any American or business can face the same horrifying reality. That  is why it takes all of us to prevent these intrusions from occurring.  It starts with fundamental cybersecurity practices that work to  strengthen network resiliency; commonly known as good cyber hygiene.   The Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Security Agency, known as CISA, spearheads efforts to educate Americans  on what steps they can take to practice proper cyber hygiene.   I fully support CISA's efforts in this endeavor and encourage  everyone, especially businesses, to take a look at the resources CISA  has to offer to be more safe and more secure online. Madam Speaker, you  can find them online at www.CISA.gov.                             Biden Border Crisis     Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the ongoing and  record-breaking Biden border crisis. Hidden in last Friday's news dump,  the latest data from Customs and Border Protection reveals Biden's  self-inflicted crisis at our southern border is far from over. Last  month there were 192,000 encounters at our southern border alone--a 232  percent increase from September of last year. This is the seventh  straight month of more than 170,000 illegal encounters--a trend never  before recorded.   This insanity must stop. The chaos at our southern border has now  recklessly reached over 1.4 million illegal border crossings since  President Biden took office. Yet during the President's townhall last  week, he claimed that he hasn't had time to visit the crisis that he  created. Keep in mind, Madam Speaker, the President has managed to  visit his Delaware beach house almost every weekend of his Presidency.   It is shameful, Madam Speaker, that the President doesn't feel the  need to witness the very crisis that he created. I refuse to ignore  this administration's blatant dereliction of duty. The country needs to  continue to hear about it until the issue is fixed, and I will continue  working with my Republican colleagues to strengthen border security and  put Americans first.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
