 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Caruthers girls basketball team, our CIF Division V State Basketball  Champions.   On Friday afternoon, despite playing a school with roughly four times  the  [[Page H2618]]  enrollment, our Blue Raiders rolled to an impressive 62 to 38 victory  over Ramona-Riverside.   Friday's victory is a testament that hard work, practice, and  teamwork is a recipe for success in any arena.   Coach Almeida put it best when she said her girls are, ``Winners by  nature. They're fighters and tough and never give up.''   I am proud to represent: Anna Marshall, Eshnoor Gasoj, Felicia  Ramirez, Jacklyn Kulow, Kathleen Duran, Destiny Giles, Jennyfer Balino,  Paige Sterling, Aileen Cortez, Elvis Ponce, Jaque Magana, Malia Ishii,  Mikayla Duran, and Jasmine Torres.   I am excited to see their future victories and the success I know  they will continue to have on the court and in life.   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Blue Raiders,  our Division V California State Basketball Champions.                            ____________________
