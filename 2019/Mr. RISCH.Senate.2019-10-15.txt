 Madam President, today I wish to highlight the hard  work and determination of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  The small business that I am honoring today goes above and beyond when  it comes to embodying the American entrepreneurial spirit. As a member  and former chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, it is my pleasure to recognize Hanson Garage, Inc.,  as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for October 2019.   Hanson Garage in Orofino was founded in 1917 by Hans ``Pete'' Hanson  and began selling Dodge vehicles in 1919. Pete's son, Ket Hanson, later  took over the garage and passed it on to his sons Keith and Larry when  he retired in the early 1980s. Keith and Larry grew up sweeping floors  and washing cars at the garage, and upon graduating from the University  of Idaho, they became partners in the family business. More than 100  years and three generations later, Hanson Garage remains a smalltown,  family-owned business renowned for its passion, friendliness, and  dedication to providing exceptional service.   The garage sells new and used Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep, and Ram  vehicles, Suzuki ATVs and motorcycles, and KTM motorcycles. It also  offers services such as financial assistance, vehicle repair, and a  variety of parts for purchase. Over the years, the business has  received several awards from Chrysler and Suzuki for exceptional sales  and service, and the Hanson family attributes the business's success to  their consistent fair prices and superior customer service.   Thirteen families in the Orofino area are employed at Hanson Garage,  comprising a significant share of the workforce for a community of  about 3,000 people. Keith and Larry Hanson are active members of the  Orofino Chamber of Commerce and supporters of local youth sporting  events and of the Orofino Lumber Jack Days and the County Fair. I would  like to extend a well-deserved congratulations to Keith and Larry  Hanson and all of the employees of Hanson Garage for being selected as  the October 2019 Idaho Small Business of the Month. You make our great  State proud, and I look forward to watching your continued growth and  success.  [[Page S5788]]                                ____________________
