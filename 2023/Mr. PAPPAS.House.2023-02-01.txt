 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the addiction crisis  that continues to impact just about every community and every family  across this country.   Many of us have lost neighbors, friends, and loved ones. Despite  significant efforts at all levels of government, recent statistics show  the problem is worsening.   My hometown of Manchester saw a 22 percent increase in opioid-related  overdoses last year and a 41 percent increase in opioid-related deaths.  We must do more to confront this crisis to support those who are  suffering from substance use disorder and to stop the trafficking of  fentanyl and its analogues.   These substances, which authorities are now finding in nearly all  illicit drugs, have only made this crisis more and more deadly.   That is why last week, alongside Representatives   Dan Newhouse and  Tony Gonzales, I reintroduced the Save Americans from the Fentanyl  Emergency Act. Our bill would permanently schedule all fentanyl-related  substances as Schedule I drugs. This would ensure that law enforcement  retains an important tool to get these deadly drugs off the streets and  hold traffickers accountable. It will help save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation.                            ____________________
