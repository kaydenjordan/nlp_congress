 Madam Speaker, Israel embodies the  resilience, the ingenuity, the can-do comeback spirit of humanity at  its best.   One need not be Israeli to be inspired by the survival and success of  Israel, which has persisted in the face of improbable odds. One need  not be Jewish to be inspired by a Jewish state whose rebirth and  resilience and resourcefulness is one of the greatest success stories  the world has ever seen.   A tiny nation the size of New Jersey has emerged, in the span of a  few decades, as a global power and a global innovator, as a start-up  nation and as a water superpower.   The story of Israel's renaissance takes on special meaning in our  present moment, at a time when our own country is reeling from the  cataclysm of COVID-19. Israel reminds us that it is possible to  overcome. It is possible to emerge stronger than ever. And it is  possible, in the words of President Joe Biden, to ``build back  better.''   Madam Speaker, Israel has endured for more than seven decades. And by  the grace of God, may it endure for many more.                            ____________________
