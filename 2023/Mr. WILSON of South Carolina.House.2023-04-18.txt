 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I was grateful  to join Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other Republican colleagues in  addressing the media to mark the first 100 days of the House majority  and to present success with the Commitment to America. This includes a  strong economy, a nation that is safe, a future built on freedom, and  an accountable government.   Highlights so far include defunding Joe Biden's army of 87,000 IRS  agents, eliminating the military vaccine mandate, establishing the  bipartisan committee to strengthen America against the Chinese  Communist Party, protecting America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve,  passing the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and also passing the Lower  Energy Costs Act.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   America supports the people of Russia oppressed by war criminal  Putin, as we see by the persecution of Vladimir Kara-Murza, who, as has  been exposed by today's Washington Post, is fighting for a free Russia.  We shall remember Vladimir Kara-Murza.                            ____________________
