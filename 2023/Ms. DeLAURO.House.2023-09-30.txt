 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have had 15 minutes to review a 71-page document, a document that  was filed before midnight last night. There hasn't been any time for  staff to review a 71-page document on such an important issue that we  are facing.   It demonstrates a lack of responsibility, and a lack of a willingness  to have a bipartisan agreement on a continuing resolution. I rise in  strong opposition to the bill.   The day before the government shuts down, the majority is still  throwing anything that they can at the wall to see if anything sticks.   House Republicans have already proven that they cannot and they will  not pass a continuing resolution on their own, even one with outlandish  spending cuts that could never pass the Senate or be signed into law.   A bipartisan, bicameral solution is the only way forward. I worked on  these efforts last December, and House Republicans at that time decided  not to participate with the Senate Republicans. With Senator Shelby and  Senator Leahy, we hammered out a budget for 2023.   The Speaker knows the bipartisan Senate continuing resolution would  easily garner a majority in this House of Representatives. Yet, he  refuses to let it go to the floor of the House.   What is he afraid of? What are we trying instead?   Yesterday, Republicans voted to defund our support for our allies in  the Middle East, including a billion-dollar cut to Israel, with a  further cut to Jordan. That did not work, so today, the target is  Ukraine, despite the fact that it is the majority's will, demonstrated  several times this week, to provide support for Ukraine's self-defense.   The Biggs amendment that would strike all Ukraine security assistance  initiative funds from the defense bill failed, 104-330.   The Gaetz amendment that would have prohibited all funding for  Ukraine in the defense bill failed, 93-339.   A Greene amendment to prohibit assistance to Ukraine in the State and  foreign operations bill failed, 90-342.   This body voted to separately fund Ukraine after it was stripped from  the defense bill in the darkness of night, and that was 311-117.   Mr. Speaker, the appeasement strategy of the far right does not have  majority support in this body. Standing with our allies does have  support here, which is tried-and-true American patriotism, American  justice, American views, and their values for freedom and the fight for  democracy.   That is who we are. That is what we are about. Those who would do  otherwise, it is shameful, shameful in bringing down the United States  of America and its support for those people who seek freedom in our  world today.   Department of Defense officials recently sent letters to the four  corners of the Congress. Under Secretary McCord writes: ``Without  additional funding now, we would have to delay or curtail assistance to  meet Ukraine's urgent requirements, including for air defense and  ammunition that are critical and urgent now as Russia prepares to  conduct a winter offensive and continues its bombardment of Ukrainian  cities.''  [[Page H4924]]    Then he continues: ``Delays to additional funding would also be  perceived by Ukraine as a sign of wavering U.S. support and likely as a  betrayal of our previous commitments. Allies and partners are also  unlikely to sustain their increased level of support without clear,  continuing U.S. leadership. As you know, Secretary Austin successfully  engages over 50 nations every month to press for sustained support. It  is crucial that the U.S. continues to lead this global coalition--``  the United States should lead--``and we need the resources to  underwrite our leadership role.''   House Republicans have shown that they are unwilling and they are  unable to govern. Some have shown they are willing and they are able to  abandon our allies.   It is time for this body, for my Republican colleagues, to abandon  the Gaetz strategy or the Greene strategy and try, as we have in the  past, for a bipartisan strategy that we all know will ultimately  conclude the shutdown and fully fund the United States government.   A shutdown will hurt families and farmers, children and  servicemembers at a time when families are living paycheck to paycheck.   Let us keep the U.S. Government open. Let us proceed with a  bipartisan, bicameral agreement as has been proposed by the United  States Senate and let us continue to support Ukraine's fight for  freedom.   Mr. Speaker, let's get to work. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Lawler), for the purpose of a colloquy.    Yes, I do. I strongly support the Senate version.    I just say to you that maybe you have had the chance to  read 71 pages. This bill doesn't extend the authority to help Ukrainian  refugees.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I find it very strange, indeed, that there is no mention of several  things, at least preliminarily which we have looked at in this bill.   There are many changes between this bill, as the gentleman asked me,  and the Senate bill. There are many changes.   The gentleman from New York should understand that there are many  changes between this bill and the Senate bill.   Here is one that I believe the majority will not mention. They  amended the Senate bill to give themselves a pay raise--a pay raise. It  is there.   Yeah. You can look at me, you can smile, but what you did was you  amended the Senate bill to give yourselves a pay raise while you have  threatened day in and day out servicemembers; you have threatened  workers across this country, and you have said to them, we don't really  care about you and whether or not you can support your family. We don't  care about that. No. We mainly care about ourselves and our pay raise.   It is pretty true to form with what the American people think about  Members, but they should know which Members are willing to give them up  in their own self-interest for a pay raise.   It is despicable. You are about to shut the government down, but  hours before you do so, you give yourself a pay raise. It is pathetic.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if I might, I would like to read a letter  that was sent by the Under Secretary of Defense, Michael McCord.   The letter was sent to the Speaker of the House as well as to the  Senate majority and minority leaders. It is addressed to Leader  Jeffries.   ``I write to express the Department of Defense's deep concern with  the absence of security assistance funding for Ukraine in the  continuing resolution being considered in the House . . . or any  similar continuing resolution that might be proposed. The Department of  Defense is anxious to avoid a lapse in appropriations, but it is  important that a CR protect our security interests and uphold our  commitments and our values.   ``As you know, the Department has been providing vital security  assistance to Ukraine since Russia's unprovoked invasion in February  2022, thanks to the bipartisan support of Congress. It is just as vital  today that we continue that support.   ``Today, DOD has exhausted nearly all available security assistance  funding for Ukraine. We are already out of funding for the Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative, one of the two security assistance  tools we have.    ``The other funding tool we need are those funds provided to  replenish our military's inventories for the weapons and supplies we've  provided to support Ukraine in their fight via drawdown. We have only  $1.6 billion remaining of the $25.9 billion Congress has provided.  [[Page H4925]]  We have already been forced to slow down the replenishment of our own  forces to hedge against an uncertain funding future--'' our own forces.  ``Failure to replenish our military services on a timely basis could  harm our military's readiness.   ``Without additional funding now, we would have to delay our curtail  assistance to meet Ukraine's urgent requirements, including for air  defense and ammunition that are critical and urgent now as Russia  prepares to conduct a winter offensive and continues its bombardment of  Ukrainian cities. For example, a lack of USAI funding now will delay  contracting actions that could negatively impact the Department's  ability to purchase essential additional 155-millimeter artillery and  critical munitions essential for the success of Ukraine's Armed Forces.   ``This ammunition is critical to sustaining Ukraine's Armed Forces,  including for their ongoing counteroffensive. An inability to ensure  timely procurement and deliveries could undermine essential Ukrainian  operations to retake additional territory or defend against potential  future Russian offensives.   ``It would also affect our ability to support Ukraine's land forces,  including obstacle breaching equipment, sustainment of previously  provided small Unmanned Aerial Systems, systems to detect, analyze, and  locate adversary signals, and demolitions equipment. It would affect  training, maintenance, and sustainment of the equipment we have  previously provided, exportability efforts, spare parts, and other  activities to ensure the Ukrainian Armed Forces receive a full  capability.   ``A funding cutoff would also send a negative signal to our defense  industrial base, which we have asked to step up munitions production  across the country, resulting in increased defense capacity and higher  employment.                                time  1145    We cannot afford to throw that progress away. In fact, we are  counting on it to implement our national defense strategy. It is  important to note that from workers supporting Stinger and AMRAAM  manufacturing in Arizona to factories producing components for Patriot  interceptors and GMLRS in Arkansas, this funding is strengthening the  American economy and creating hundreds of new American jobs.   ``Some have suggested that the Department could still execute the  mission and support Ukraine's needs if it were given permission to  transfer funds from inside a short-term CR from our own needs to fund  more security assistance. To be clear, the Department does not support  that approach, which will create an unacceptable risk to us. Under a  CR, the Department will be operating at a level approximately $25  billion below our budget request for FY 2024, which was and is  consistent with the Fiscal Responsibility Act funding levels.   ``The bottom line is we cannot sustain adequate levels of Ukraine  assistance with transfer authority alone.   ``Delays to additional funding would also be perceived by Ukraine as  a sign of wavering U.S. support and likely as a betrayal of our  previous commitments. Allies and partners are also unlikely to sustain  their increased level of support without clear, continuing U.S.  leadership. As you know, Secretary Austin successfully engages over 50  nations every month to press for sustained support. It is crucial that  the U.S. continues to lead this global coalition, and we need the  resources to underwrite our leadership role.   ``The Department appreciates your leadership on this vital matter,  and I am sending an identical letter to the Speaker of the House, as  well as the Senate majority and minority leaders.''   Michael McCord, the Under Secretary for Defense.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I would make reference to page 7 of the 71- page document. In the Senate bill, I might add, they include a line  that says the Senate bill includes the blocking or the prohibition on a  Member pay raise. That has been dropped from the bill that has just  been proposed.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just so I can reiterate what I had said earlier, we now have really  the language in both the Senate bill and in the House bill, and it is  really not so clean a continuing resolution as it has been portrayed.   This strikes the Member pay prohibition, in effect, giving Members a  pay raise.   Let me just explain. If you have a copy of the bill, on page 7--in  the Senate bill, there is language that the Legislative Branch  appropriations bill, what division it is, et cetera. Section 6, really  what it does is the Senate bill prohibits the movement toward a Member  pay raise.   Now, what the House Republicans have done is, page 7, line 13, what  they do, they just drop that part of the language that comes from the  Senate bill. In essence, what they have done is to provide themselves  with a pay raise.   I think that you haven't given us time to read the 71 pages. I am  hopeful that all of you have had the opportunity to read the 71 pages.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), the distinguished Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, House Republicans have shown they are  unwilling and unable to govern. Some have shown they are willing and  able to abandon our allies.   Russian tyranny and aggression threaten more than just Ukraine's  borders. We learned in Georgia, and we learned in Crimea, if you stand  by while Russia takes an inch, they will take a mile. Vladimir Putin  must be held to account for upending Europe's security in peacetime for  a pointless and bloody war, which has disrupted energy markets and  triggered food insecurity around the world.   We must be clear about what this means, plain and simple. This is  appeasement like the world experienced in 1938, which led to a  cascading, murderous result.    Ukraine's fight for democracy and sovereignty requires decisive  action and absolute support from the free world. We must act like the  leaders of the free world. We must not abandon our position as the  world's beacon of democratic values. We must not surrender our global  influence to Russia, China, or any group that threatens democracies.   Members of this body have come together again and again to reaffirm  our commitment to helping Ukraine defend itself against vicious  invasion.   Let us keep the government open, and let us proceed to make sure that  we do not abandon our allies.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to note here that,  first of all, I am very interested that there was a rereading of the  bill as it came from the House and from the Senate and that there is a  view that it needs  [[Page H4932]]  to be reviewed in some way because, in fact, as the bill stands, there  is a pay raise that is being done, in addition to which there are  student loan efforts that are thwarted, as well, making it more  difficult for about 45 million borrowers to be able to get the kind of  services that they need.   I really want to make the point that I have had the opportunity to  chair the Appropriations Committee for 2 years--and for those 2 years,  with a 3- or 4-person majority--with the assistance of colleagues in  the House and in the Senate. Last December, it was honestly just in the  Senate because House Republicans refused to participate in the  negotiations. I think there were very few, in the continuing resolution  that we put forward, Republicans who voted for a continuing resolution.  I think, if I recall the number precisely, it was nine, but it allowed  us to be able to hammer out the bills over the next several weeks until  December.   At that juncture, what we did was we came together. We hammered out  the bills. No one got everything that they wanted, but we could pass  the bill.   Now, I move forward to what happened last May and last June when  there was a budget agreement that was hammered out by the President and  the Speaker of the House. To be very honest with you, I did not vote  for that budget agreement. I would have never let this Nation default,  but I was very concerned about the harm that was going to be done to  the people of this country through the appropriations process that was  established by the majority, and that was to significantly cut $142  billion from the services that we provide. That is education, mental  health services, medical research services. All of that, I viewed, was  going to be curtailed.                                time  1415    It is the law of the land. It is civics. When the House passes  something, the Senate passes something, the President signs the bill,  it is the law of the land. The Speaker of the House and the Republicans  in this House walked away from that agreement, and that is why we stand  where we are today in this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I once again would reiterate what I have been saying all  along and what I have said in the last several days: this House has  overwhelmingly, in the last 2 days, the majority has demonstrated that  we want to provide support for Ukraine's self-defense.   We had several amendments: a Biggs amendment, a Gaetz amendment, a  Greene amendment, all of which resulted in overwhelming support for  Ukraine.   I continue to believe that this is an appeasement strategy of the far  right and, in fact, does not have a majority support in this body, but  I believe that standing with our allies does have support.   I would reiterate that our own Department of Defense--something that  I believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have great  regard for, listen to, support their efforts, increase funding for  defense--care deeply about this issue of our national security and our  ability to be able to defend our allies overseas. They all have a great  affinity for this effort, and I applaud that, but that seems now to be  abandoned.   In the words of the Under Secretary of the Department of Defense,  they cannot do without this funding. I would remind Members that in a  very specific and poignant letter it lays out that: ``The bottom line  is we cannot sustain adequate levels of Ukraine assistance with  transfer authority alone.   ``Delays to additional funding would also be perceived by Ukraine as  a sign of wavering U.S. support and likely as a betrayal of our  previous commitments.''   Mr. Speaker, the United States betraying our commitment to Ukraine is  essentially the bottom line on this continuing resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to  suspend the rules will be followed by a 5-minute vote on:   Agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 335,  nays 91, not voting 7, as follows:                               [Roll No. 513]                                 YEAS--335
