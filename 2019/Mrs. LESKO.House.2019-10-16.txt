 Mr. Speaker, I have to say that I am a proud cosponsor of  the resolution before us today to censure Congressman Adam Schiff. And  I want to thank my fellow Arizona Congressman for leading the effort on  this great job.   We have watched Congressman Schiff say now for 2 years that he had  evidence that President Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia,  but then when we saw the Mueller report, we determined that that just  was not accurate.   Then in committee recently Mr. Schiff read a false, made-up narrative  of a conversation he purported to be between President Trump and the  Ukrainian President. It was absolutely made up and false, I believe, to  try to deceive the American public.   Then on national TV, Mr. Schiff said: No--when asked--no, our office  did not have any prior contact with the  [[Page H8153]]  whistleblower. And then we found out that that was untrue.   So I support the resolution to censure Congressman Adam Schiff.                            ____________________
