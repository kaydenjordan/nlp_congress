 Mr. President, it has been my good fortune to serve in  the Senate for 24 years. I have great respect for this institution and  continue to believe that the men and women who serve here are  extraordinary examples, by and large, of public service and that we  have done great things of a historic nature.   I think of the days of the Obama Presidency, when we had to rescue  our economy, make reforms on Wall Street that made a difference, and  build a public health system that we have aspired to for decades. We  achieved those goals--not easily--with hard work and determination. I  am glad to have been a part of it.   When I hear the Republican leader come to the floor and talk about  his memory of the Senate, I hasten to add: There is another side to the  story. I will come to the floor in a few days to outline the history of  the filibuster, but I am sure the Senator from Kentucky, who has been  in the Senate--and his staff--in elected capacity for decades, would  concede this point: Up until the 1960s, the filibuster was rarely used  in this U.S. Senate. The demand for, once, 67 votes, then 60 votes was  rare.   Oh, it was remembered that, in the 1960s, civil rights legislation  foundered on the floor of this U.S. Senate because of the filibuster,  but it was rarely applied. That changed. It changed under the Senator  from Kentucky's leadership. It became so commonplace--the filibuster  was being used so frequently--that it led to Senator Reid, then the  Democratic leader, making some fundamental changes in the Senate rules.   I remember that day very well, and I remember the anguish that  Senator Reid felt at the time. But he felt he had no recourse because  the filibuster had become commonplace, the 60-vote requirement  commonplace.   I don't know exactly what the argument is from the other side at the  moment, but I think any fairminded Senator would concede the Senate is  capable of doing great things; it is capable of being deliberative; yet  it still can be decisive.   There comes a time when we should act. And to merely let every issue  get mired down into a 60-vote requirement and filibuster and nothing  come out of this Chamber as a result cannot be what our Founding  Fathers envisioned for the world of the U.S. Senate.   I want to address that issue at another time in more detail, with  facts and figures on the use and misuse of filibuster, but at this  moment I would like to raise another question, which is related.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 54         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
