 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 minutes  for my remarks as well as 10 minutes for Senator Wicker and Senator  Collins' remarks before the vote.    Mr. President, I think my colleagues are making the  really important point of the national security implications of the  bill that we are looking at and voting on. And I agree with what my  colleagues have already said. Speaker McCarthy had a difficult job. I  think there is a lot in this debt agreement that is important, that is  positive. But the one thing we are not doing here--and, by the way, it  is the most important thing we do as U.S. Senators--is have a strategy  for the national defense of our Nation during an incredibly dangerous  time globally. We are not doing that.   We need a strategy. Already, my good friend from South Carolina  mentioned some ideas. I am going to touch on those, but let's just  reiterate. The Presiding Officer sits on the Armed Services Committee.  Many of us do. We get witness after witness, including the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense, saying this is the most  dangerous time since any period in history since World War II. That is  the consensus. Not a lot of people would disagree with that.  Authoritarian dictators, with an immense appetite for conquest, are on  the march, and yet what does this budget agreement do? It cuts defense  spending significantly, as already mentioned.   Now, some people will say: Well, look at the top line. We never had a  higher top line--$800-plus billion. As the Presiding Officer knows, the  actual real measure of how serious we are as a country isn't the top  line. Because of inflation over the years it is hard to compare.   The real measure of how serious we are, in terms of what we are  putting toward defense--what the No. 1 priority of the U.S. Congress  should be, in my view--is what percentage of our national wealth we are  dedicating to defense. This budget will take us, in the next 2 years,  with the cut this year, an inflation-adjusted cut of 4 to 5 percent,  and a nominal increase next year of 1 percent, which would be about a  5- to 6-percent cut--it will take us below the 3 percent of GDP number  for defense for the first time since 1999, during the peace dividend  era of the Clinton administration. So we will be below 3 percent of  GDP.   When you look at different periods of American history, the Korean  war, we were at almost 15 percent; Vietnam, 8 percent; Cold War Reagan  buildup, almost 6 percent; Iraq, Afghanistan, War on Terror, 4.5  percent, we are going to be going below 3 percent. It hasn't happened  since 1999, and before that it has almost never happened in the history  of the country, at least in the 20th century.   Here is the most important point: In 1999, the threats to our Nation  weren't nearly as dramatic and serious as they are today, and nobody  disagrees with that.   So what this budget does is it just accepts the Biden defense budget,  which,  [[Page S1865]]  as Senator Graham has already mentioned, shrinks the Army, shrinks the  Navy, shrinks the Marine Corps. That is what it does: less ships, not  more ships; smaller number of soldiers and marines, not more. So  accepting the Biden defense budget is actually something new during the  Biden administration.   What do I mean by that? As Senator Cotton mentioned, the last two  previous Biden budgets came in, in anemic numbers, and in a bipartisan  way--a strong bipartisan way, by the way--Democrats and Republicans  significantly plussed-up those budget numbers. Last year, it was a $45  billion increase to the weak Biden budget on the Armed Services  Committee that every single Senator on the committee voted for, except  one. That is about as bipartisan as you can get. The year before, it  was a $25 billion plus-up. And as many people know, we were already  discussing, in a bipartisan way on the Armed Services Committee,  another significant plus-up to this Biden budget. So Democrats and  Republicans knew it was weak and not sufficient to meet the challenges  of today.   But what happened? The music stopped, and now all of a sudden we are  accepting the Biden budget. I know Democrat Senators who think that is  wrong. They think that is wrong.   One amendment I am going to offer, as we are debating this, is to do  something very simple. It is to look at the Biden Pentagon's priority  list--their unfunded priority list--that this President and his  Secretary of Defense put forward. It is $18 billion, which the Armed  Services Committee, in a bipartisan way, was already getting ready to  agree to move forward and fund. I am going to ask my colleagues to fund  it. At a minimum, let's fund it. We are not going to bust out of the  top line of this agreement. We will just take that $18.4 billion and  move it from the $80 billion IRS account and put it to the Pentagon. It  is pretty simple. It should be 100 to 0.   Do we want more Navy ships, more marines, or more IRS agents during  this very dangerous time? I think the answer is pretty clear. I think  the American people know the answer.   Senator Cotton already mentioned this idea that the Speaker has  talked about. We need more efficiencies in the Pentagon. I couldn't  agree more. By the way, the Navy leadership right now--we need a lot  more efficiencies out of that place. You have a Navy Secretary who is  more focused on getting his climate plan out before his shipbuilding  plan. The priorities of the Department of the Navy right now are  remarkably misaligned with real-world challenges.   What are those real-world challenges?   I think the Presiding Officer was there when we had a briefing from  some of our top Intelligence Agency officials. It was a classified  briefing, and I asked him if this number was classified. They told me  no. They came out and said the real Chinese budget, in terms of the  military, is probably close to about $700 billion. That is a big  budget. As Senator Cotton mentioned, they are increasing in real terms  6, 7, 8 percent--cranking out ships, cranking out fifth-generation  aircraft.   And we are going to cut the budget this year and dramatically cut it  next year and go under 3 percent of the GDP in one of the most  dangerous times since the end of World War II?   As Senator Cotton also mentioned, the National Defense Strategy  Commission, which the Congress authorized a number of years ago to look  at the serious national security threats facing our country, came back  to the Armed Services Committee 2 years ago and said: What we need to  do to address these serious national security challenges from China,  from Russia, from Iran is to have 3 to 5 percent real GDP--or real  growth--on the defense budget.   That was broadly accepted by Democrats and Republicans. As a matter  of fact, I think one of the members of that national security  commission is now the Deputy Secretary of Defense in the Biden  administration.   But we are not even close. We are going backward.   Then Senator Graham's point about a supplemental to get Leader  Schumer and the President to say ``we are going to have a supplemental  for deterring authoritarian aggression'' is going to be critical. I  would say the vast majority of my colleagues here--Democrats and  Republicans--would support that. We need a serious, robust defense  budget to deter war. If the young men and women who volunteer to serve  in our military are asked to go fight a war, we need a strong budget so  that they can come home victorious and not come home in body bags.   This is deadly serious business, and we are not putting enough  attention to it. It is one of the No. 1 things in the U.S.  Constitution: that we need to provide for the common defense, to raise  and support an Army, and to provide and maintain a Navy. That is our  job, and we are not doing it. With this budget, this rushed budget, we  need to get serious, and, hopefully, in the next few days, we can do  that as we debate this agreement.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 125 and ask  that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Sullivan] proposes an       amendment numbered 125.    The amendment is as follows:    (Purpose: To provide adequate funding for defense and increase the          rescission of funding for the Internal Revenue Service)         On page 5, line 16, strike ``$886,349,000,000'' and insert       ``$904,779,000,000''.        On page 5, line 21, strike ``$895,212,000,000'' and insert       ``$950,017,950,000''.        On page 53, line 22, strike ``$1,389,525,000'' and insert       ``$74,625,475,000''.     Madam President, the Fiscal Responsibility Act,  unfortunately, does not meet the moment in terms of defending our  Nation.   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and others have said we are now in  the most dangerous period of any time since World War II. And yet this  bill cuts defense spending in inflation-adjusted terms by approximately  3 percent this year and 5 percent next year.   By endorsing the President's defense budget, this bill shrinks the  Navy, shrinks the Army, and shrinks the Marine Corps. Next year, it  will take us below 3 percent of GDP spending for the first time in 25  years.   My amendment does what the Armed Services Committee and this Chamber  have done in a broad bipartisan manner over the past 2 years. It  significantly pluses up the inadequate defense budget submitted by the  President. My amendment fully funds the Biden Pentagon's unfunded  priorities list by----   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.    By $18 billion.  [[Page S1886]]    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.    And it raises----   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds more.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?    And for fiscal year 2025, it raises the defense top  line by 5 percent to simply keep pace with inflation. These increases  are offset by rescinding the additional amounts from the President's  $80 billion plus-up from the IRS.   So, my colleagues, the choice is clear: more Navy ships, soldiers,  and marines to protect America or more IRS agents to harass Americans.  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this important amendment.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.
