 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the hard  work and dedication of our north country Olympians, who made history at  the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang.   The United States women's bobsled team, trained in Lake Placid in my  district, finished strong with an incredible silver medal win.   We are also incredibly excited for Saranac Lake's very own Chris  Mazdzer, who made Olympic history this year, taking home Team USA's  first ever medal in men's singles luge.   Chris trained tirelessly at the Olympic Training Center in Lake  Placid, and I know he has inspired the next generation of New York-21  athletes from across our region.   Mr. Speaker, the north country has been buzzing with excitement since  the Winter Games began, and seeing Chris on the podium was an  incredible moment for us all.   Congratulations to Chris and to all our Olympians, who showed the  world just what the north country has to offer.                            ____________________
