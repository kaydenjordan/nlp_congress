 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize a truly  great citizen of Aurora, Colorado, Dr. Randy Stith.   As the executive director and CEO of Aurora Mental Health Center for  over 40 years, Randy has exemplified the qualities of a great Colorado  leader throughout his entire career. He has spent the last four decades  providing access to mental healthcare to those in the greater Aurora  area, often committing to 60-hour work weeks, while keeping up-to-date  in the behavioral healthcare field, which is constantly evolving.   Randy has been a true trailblazer in championing the expansion of  mental healthcare, as it has rapidly progressed as part of the  healthcare industry, especially over the past 50 years. He has served  his community valiantly through triumph and tragedy, most notably,  offering free counseling through the Aurora Mental Health Center to  anyone in the Aurora area who had been impacted by the 2012 theater  mass shooting.   Randy's commitment to serving his patients, as well as his community,  will be difficult to replace. However, I know that the entire Aurora  community takes great pride in knowing that we have civic leaders such  as Randy who are locally active.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Dr.  Randy Stith, and to the entire staff of the Aurora Mental Health  Center, for their tireless and unwavering commitment to offering  excellent mental healthcare services to the people of Aurora, Colorado,  over the last 40 years.                            ____________________
