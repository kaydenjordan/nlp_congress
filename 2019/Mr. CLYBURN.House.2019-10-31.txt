 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   Over the last month, the impeachment inquiry has built a powerful  body of evidence around President Trump's call with President Zelensky  of Ukraine when he told a foreign leader, ``I'd like you to do us a  favor, though.'' We have learned so much about that call and things  that followed it because some dedicated public servants have  demonstrated patriotism to this great country by coming forward and  testifying and giving us the information as they know it.   These brave patriots, career diplomats, have been called ``radical  unelected bureaucrats.'' They have been called that by a group of  people who Thomas Paine would call summer soldiers and sunshine  patriots. He warned us that these people will, in a ``crisis, shrink  from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now,  deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is  not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the  harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.''   We are here today because brave, dedicated public servants and  patriots are standing up for their country.
