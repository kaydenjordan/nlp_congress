 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we just voted in a very important vote  on the Senate floor--a bipartisan vote--to confirm Mr. David Bernhardt  as the next Secretary of the Interior for the United States of America.  It was a strong vote--56 to 41.   I want to begin my remarks this afternoon by rising to express my  gratitude and appreciation to Mr. Bernhardt for stepping up to the  plate to continue to serve his country and to continue to serve the  Department of the Interior now in the role of Secretary, the individual  who is going to be running the Department of the Interior for the  United States.   I thank my colleagues. It was a bipartisan vote in the Senate, which  I think is important for voting for now-Secretary Bernhardt. Actually,  I would like to be the first Senator to call him Secretary Bernhardt.  If you and your family are watching, Mr. Secretary, thank you.   I also want to mention that I have been listening to some of the  speeches made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. To be  perfectly blunt, I find what we just witnessed a bit disheartening. I  would like to say at the outset that we can and should disagree on  policy disputes. Certainly issues like land issues are really important  to me in my State, that is for sure. We can disagree about the  direction of how we are going to move some of those policies forward.  What is disheartening, though, is when you have someone like Mr.  Bernhardt, who is willing to serve his country again--and I am going to  talk about that--essentially getting his reputation dragged through the  mud on the Senate floor. It is not a good thing. It doesn't encourage  people to want to serve.   So, Mr. Secretary, thank you. I know this wasn't an easy confirmation  process.   When you look at his background, this is actually one of the most  qualified individuals to serve as the Secretary whom we have had in  many years. He was the Solicitor General under President George W.  Bush, confirmed by the Senate; he was the Deputy Secretary for the last  2 years, confirmed by this body; and now he is the Secretary. I would  say those are very high qualifications. I just want to talk about him  for a little bit.   Why do I support Mr. Bernhardt? The Secretary of the Department of  the Interior is really important to America. It is critically important  to my State, the great State of Alaska. We have over 200 million acres  of land under the Department of the Interior's control in Alaska--200  million acres. That is over two times the size of California. In fact,  one-quarter of all the lands that the Department of the Interior  manages for the United States reside in Alaska. Let me repeat that.  One-quarter of all the lands that the Secretary of the Interior manages  in America are in my State.   So we take this role of Secretary of the Interior very, very  seriously, which is why I wanted to come to the floor and again thank  Secretary Bernhardt  [[Page S2423]]  and let him know that even though there were a lot of Senators down  here really ripping into him, the vast majority of us--56 of us, at  least--think he is going to do a great job.   Why do we think that, Mr. Secretary? Well, certainly with regard to  Alaska, sometimes Secretaries of the Interior understand our State and  that we are different and unique and that Federal laws passed by this  body say so. Other Secretaries of the Interior don't. They don't  understand that in Alaska you have to balance conservation with  resource development and economic opportunity. Secretary Bernhardt does  understand this, and this is refreshing. Secretary Zinke did. This was  refreshing. It was a refreshing break from the previous administration,  the Obama administration, where Secretaries of the Interior, like Sally  Jewell, went out of their way to tilt Federal power in a way that  disadvantaged the State of Alaska, despite Federal law saying you  shouldn't do that.   Well, we just had a U.S. Supreme Court decision 2 weeks ago saying  that that practice of the Department of the Interior and their  different officials tilting the law against Alaskans had to stop. It  was a huge case that I talked about on the floor last week, Sturgeon v.  Frost, which says that in the laws of the Federal Government,  particularly as they relate to Alaska--the Supreme Court stated it  several times in a 9-to-0 opinion--Alaska is unique and Alaska is  different. When it comes to the Department of the Interior, it is very  different.   Well, Mr. Secretary Bernhardt knows that, and that is one of the  reasons why I am so pleased to have voted for him and supported his  confirmation, which we just saw on the Senate floor. It is not just me  who supports him. Let me provide some quotes from letters and support  groups, because, again, after listening to some of my colleagues the  last couple of days, you would have thought that everybody was against  him. Actually, most groups who care about conservation were for him.  Let me give one really important group--the Alaska Federation of  Natives, an extremely important group in my State. The Secretary of the  Interior has trust responsibilities to lower 48 Indians and Alaska  Natives. This group had this to say about Mr. Bernhardt:         He listens well. He is articulate in his responses. He       draws reasonable conclusions. Moreover, he has established a       trusting relationship with the Alaska Native community around       the issues of resource development and subsistence hunting       and fishing.    So they have been complimentary and supportive.   The American Farm Bureau says:         This President's nomination of David Bernhardt as Secretary       of the Interior is great news for American agriculture. He       understands the needs of America's farmers and ranchers and       is an excellent choice for Interior Secretary.    The Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies--who are they? Those  are the men and women in each State who manage fish and game like the  Department of the Interior. Here is what they had to say:         The Association is appreciative of Mr. Bernhardt's       continued support for the great work of state fish and       wildlife agencies in conserving our nation's natural       resources.    The Congressional Sportsmen Foundation says:         Mr. Bernhardt has demonstrated he is a true advocate for       sportsmen and women across the country by working with the       community throughout his career in natural resources       management, and implementing Secretarial Orders that promote       sportsmen's access to public lands.    That is a very big issue in my State.   Even a group like Ducks Unlimited says: ``His integrity in following  the law is beyond reproach.'' Let me say that one again. ``His  integrity in following the law is beyond reproach.'' David Bernhardt is  a champion of conservation and the right person for the job.   When I was the commissioner of natural resources in the great State  of Alaska--which actually is a job similar to the Secretary of the  Interior, where we manage an enormous portfolio of land, water, oil,  gas, minerals, and timber--I had the opportunity to actually hire Mr.  Bernhardt when he was in the private sector as an attorney helping the  State of Alaska with a big complicated lands issue. He did a great job.  He was a hard worker. He was a man of integrity. So the list goes on  and on of the supporters.   So, again, Mr. Secretary, we just want you to know that given your  background as former Solicitor of the Department of the Interior and  former Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior and as  someone who has gotten rave reviews from groups all across the country,  and now as the Secretary of the Interior, my view is that you are  actually one of the most qualified individuals to hold this position.  So congratulations. You certainly earned it. We appreciate your service  to this great Nation of ours, your service to the Department of the  Interior, and your service to my State, the great State of Alaska, and  we certainly look forward to working with you as you continue your  public service for our country, for Interior, and for Alaska. I just  wanted to come to the floor to commend you on a strong bipartisan  support, and we are going to look forward to working with you.
