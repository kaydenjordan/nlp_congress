 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  the Penn State men's wrestling team for winning the NCAA Division I  National Championship earlier this month in St. Louis, Missouri.   Mr. Speaker, Penn State has been a force to be reckoned with in  Division I wrestling. This is Penn State's sixth title in 7 years. It  is the second consecutive national title.   I could not be more proud of my alma mater or this team that gave us  a season to remember.   Many college athletes dream about participating at the NCAA  championships. It marks the pinnacle of their athletic careers.   Among the Nittany Lion national champions, All-Americans Bo Nickal,  Jason Nolf, and Zain Retherford combined for a total of 82.5 points,  which would have placed the trio sixth overall in the final team  standings.   Penn State also made history with All-Americans true freshman Mark  Hall and redshirt freshman Vincenzo Joseph earning their first titles  to become the first freshmen NCAA champions in program history.   Congratulations to Coach Sanderson and the Nittany Lions on this  outstanding achievement. Your hard work and dedication shows, and you  are the pride of Happy Valley.                            ____________________
