 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  town of McKenzie, Tennessee, which is located in Carroll County.  McKenzie's yearlong celebration commemorating 150 years since their  proclamation begins this week.   The town of McKenzie has persevered through epidemics, wars, and two  great fires. In 150 years, McKenzie has grown from a population of 500  people to over 5,000 people, and over 10,000 residents outside the city  limits. The town was visited by President Grover Cleveland and is home  to the Tennessee College of Applied Technology at McKenzie and the  fastest growing private university in Tennessee, Bethel University,  which is led by my good friend, President Walter Butler.   I congratulate the town of McKenzie, its Mayor Jill Holland, Carroll  County Mayor Joseph Butler, and its residents on a remarkable 150-year  history. McKenzie has shown great resilience, and I wish it nothing but  the best on its next 150.                            ____________________
