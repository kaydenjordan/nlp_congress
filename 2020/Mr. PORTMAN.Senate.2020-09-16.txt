 Mr. President, I am here on the floor this evening to  talk about what Congress needs to do right now to help the American  people with regard to this coronavirus pandemic. We are not out of the  woods yet. People are still struggling, with the economy being weak,  and we still have a real healthcare crisis to deal with.   Since this crisis began, Congress has come together as Republicans  and Democrats both here in the Senate and over in the House, working  with the White House, to pass five coronavirus bills--five. Legislation  addressed both the healthcare crisis and the economic free-fall that  were caused by the virus and also by the government-imposed shutdowns.  The biggest of these bills was the one you hear most about; that is,  the roughly $2 trillion in the CARES Act that was passed by a vote in  this Chamber of 96 to 0--totally bipartisan.   Unfortunately, since May, when the last of these bipartisan bills was  enacted, partisanship has prevailed over policy, and Washington has  been paralyzed, unable to repeat the coming together for the public  good.   Democrats in this Chamber have consistently insisted that the only  way forward is a bill called the Heroes Act. This is a $3.5 trillion  piece of legislation that passed the House of Representatives 4 months  ago along partisan lines.   By the way, $3.5 trillion would be the most expensive legislation  ever to be enacted.   When this bill passed the House 4 months ago, POLITICO and others in  the media accurately called it a messaging bill that had no chance of  becoming law.   It is disappointing that Democrats have continued to push this ``my  way or the highway'' approach because this bill is a nonstarter for a  lot of reasons, including the price tag and the fact that it includes  non-COVID-related provisions. To name one example, it repeals the State  and local tax deduction cap. That is a $135 billion Tax Code change,  and most of the benefit is going to go to the top 1 percent of wage  earners. What does it have to do with COVID-19?   Now is not the time to give tax breaks to the wealthy, to make  changes to our immigration policy, or impose unprecedented mandates on  State election procedures that are normally in the province of the  States, not us--all of which are part of the Heroes Act. Instead, this  should be a time where we focus on what the American people need right  now and help them to handle this healthcare and economic challenge they  are facing, but that hasn't happened.   Last week I spoke on this floor about all the things in the targeted  bill that was voted on last Thursday in this Chamber, where there is  bipartisanship, where Democrats and Republican actually agree.   I talked about the need to extend the PPP program--Paycheck  Protection Program--which is helping small businesses keep their doors  open, but it expired on August 8. A lot of small businesses are saying  to me back home in Ohio: I am barely holding on. When is this coming? I  need an extension to this program.   Yet we can't seem to get our act together here even though it is  totally nonpartisan, as far as I can tell.   The bill we voted on last Thursday also has more funding for  something  [[Page S5644]]  desperately needed in my home State of Ohio and other States around the  country, which is more money for testing. It also has more money, by  the way, for developing a vaccine more quickly and effectively and for  getting these anti-viral therapies up and going. All of this is stuff  we should be able to agree on, right? No, we haven't been able to.   Another thing that was in that bill last Thursday was providing  funding for the schools so they can reopen--K-12 but also for our  colleges and universities. These schools are starting to reopen, and  they need the help badly. Actually, it had enough funding in there that  it was slightly more than the funding that was in the Heroes Act, the  Democrats' proposal, for the same purpose--$105 billion. Why couldn't  we get together?    What else did it have? It had something very important for a lot of  people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. It had an  extension of the current Federal supplement for unemployment insurance  in the States. It had a $300-per-week, Federal-taxpayer-paid additional  supplement on top of the roughly $350 that States already provide on  average for unemployment. Yet that was rejected.   We couldn't even have a good vote to proceed on the bill, to have a  debate on the bill so we could have an honest debate and say, oh, $300  is too much, or it is not enough, or maybe the PPP program needs to be  slightly changed this way or that way, or maybe there is less money for  schools needed or more money for schools.   We couldn't even get on the bill because you need 60 votes to do  that, and we only had 52, which is a majority of this Chamber, but it  is not the 60-vote supermajority. Fifty-two Republicans supported it.  Unfortunately, no Democrats were able to support it. I don't get that  because all we were saying was, let's get on this bill and have a  debate, and if later on in the process you don't like where we ended  up, there is another 60-vote margin, and you can filibuster it again.   We couldn't even get on the bill to have a debate. To me, that is  really sad because the American people weren't given the opportunity to  get some help, but also they weren't given the opportunity to see what  the differences are and have this out in the open.   That is legislation that 52 Republicans supported. We are ready to  go. Let's have the discussion. Let's have the debate.   The Federal funds to help the unemployed get by was a particular  concern of mine, and I want to focus on that tonight. That unemployment  benefit is a classic example of where Senate Democrats have blocked  what I think is a reasonable compromise--I will explain why I think  that--and instead have decided to provide nothing. Nothing.   What we should do instead is we should embrace a compromise together  for these families who continue to struggle to make ends meet because  some people can't go back to work still because their movie theater or  their bowling alley or their motor coach company can't hire them.  Either they are shut down or they simply can't hire them back. There  are people who are unemployed who still need our help.   Early on in this pandemic, both Republicans and Democrats recognized  this. We recognized the need to bolster the State-run unemployment  insurance programs to help offset the massive job losses we saw in  March and April. That is why the CARES Act we talked about earlier-- this bipartisan bill--contained an unprecedented $600-per-week  additional Federal supplement on top of the State supplement for 4  months.   By the way, the State benefit in Ohio on average is $360. The $600  was on top of $360, coming up to $960 per week. We did that for a  period of 4 months. That provided an important income source for a lot  of people. It made a huge difference in the lives of a lot of people  who early on couldn't work because the government was actually closing  down businesses, saying: You can't open.   Some say that was too much. We will talk about why they say that. But  it was a big help, and it was appropriate in a sense at the time to do  something that big because the government itself was saying: You are  going to lose your job through no fault of your own. We the government  are saying you have to shut down, so we are going to provide you an  unemployment benefit.   It was also used for other things--to pay rent, to pay that car  payment, to just get by.   As the year has gone on, we have made progress now on slowing the  spread of the coronavirus, adding testing, adding more personal  protective gear, and so on. Many parts of our economy have been able to  reopen in a safe and sustainable manner. And that is good. Without the  help we provided in the legislation--the five bills we passed--we  wouldn't be so far along. They helped. They helped keep the doors open  at a lot of small businesses. They helped provide the money for our  healthcare system, for testing.   With that reopening around the country, hiring picked back up, and  now we have far fewer people on unemployment than we did at the  beginning of this pandemic. So there are fewer people who need  unemployment insurance. Unemployment is at about 8.4 percent. That is  what it was last month. That is down from over 15 percent in the  spring. Now, 8.4 percent is still too high, particularly compared to  the record lows we saw just before this pandemic. It is more than twice  what it was then. But it is undoubtedly a step in the right direction.  Unemployment claims are either holding steady or dropping now in most  States. That is good.   With this positive progress we were seeing, I think it was fair for  Congress to want to take another look at the original unemployment  insurance supplement, which expired at the end of July, and see whether  there was a new supplement that we could continue to help those in need  while better reflecting this improved economy and the need for workers  rather than a situation where the government was actually imposing  shutdowns of much of our economy.    That is where things broke down. At the end of July, the $600  supplement ended. Everybody knew it was going to end then. But  Republicans and Democrats couldn't agree on how to best structure an  additional UI supplement.   By the way, having differences isn't unusual around here. We have  debates all the time. That debate was a big part of the negotiations in  July and August. What is disappointing to me and to many of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle and to so many people we  represent is that instead of taking us up on our offer that we  offered--to extend the $600 per week to be able the negotiate  something, for 2 weeks, which would have put a lot of pressure on the  negotiations--think about it--the Democrats said no. I don't know why  they said no, but Democrats would not even allow us to extend the $600  to put pressure on negotiations. Deliberately, they allowed these  benefits to expire. It went from a $600 benefit on top of the State  benefit to zero Federal benefit.   Let me repeat that. Rather than work to agree on a weeklong extension  of a lifeline for so many people to buy time to work something out,  Democrats instead chose to let these benefits expire and allowed  millions of Americans to go without benefits.   When we hit this impasse on the UI issue that Congress just couldn't  break, the Trump administration stepped in, and President Trump quickly  signed an Executive order on August 8--so a week after the benefit  expired--which authorized FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management  Agency, to begin distributing an emergency lost wage assistance  unemployment check.   So the government stepped in at the executive branch and said: You  guys in Congress can't figure this out. The $600 has gone to zero, so  you just have the State benefit now, and you have a lot of people still  unemployed through no fault of their own. It is tough to get by on 360  bucks a week.   So President Trump and his administration stepped in and said: We  will provide it temporarily--temporarily, because that is all the money  they had through what is called the Wage Assistance Program. Under this  program, $44 billion from the Disaster Relief Fund was made available  to States to use as a supplement to their unemployment insurance  programs--still leaving $25 billion, by the way, in that fund for  natural disasters.   I spoke to Labor Secretary Scalia on Friday. I asked him: Is there  any money left in that fund?   Remember, this was done on August 8, and they had a limited amount of  money.  [[Page S5645]]    He said: No, Rob. Actually, it was a temporary program, meant to be a  bridge so Congress would get its act together between August 8 and now.   So basically, in a month and a week, surely Congress would do  something here, but we haven't. Now, that money has run out. Now,  people who were getting the $600 benefit, down to zero, and then back  up to $300, which most are getting in a lump sum because it takes a  while to process this money--that $300 is now ending. No more $300-per- week Federal supplement.   By the way, almost every State and territory except for two has  applied for and received some of this funding from the Feds. Ohio was  able to receive enough funding to cover 6 weeks of lost benefits, so  basically from August 1 until now. Ohio got $1.4 billion from the fund.  It is sending out its unemployment insurance benefits this week. Next  week it ends because they have run out of money. They have used the  Federal money.   The $300 supplement has now ended. It is surely time for us to act.  It would be timely this week and next week to now do something to  provide for a supplement for people who lost their job through no fault  of their own.   We could have solved this last Thursday with the targeted relief bill  that came to the floor for a vote that I talked about. The timing was  perfect. We could have done that because part of the negotiations that  we had among ourselves, Republicans, over this and with some Democrats,  I suppose, was, what is the right level? What we came up with was $300.  That was part of the bill that got 52 votes last Thursday but needed  the 60 votes, and Democrats blocked it. Even though it got the majority  of the Senate, it didn't get the supermajority of 60 that it needed.  Again, we couldn't even get on the legislation to talk about it. That  $600 supplement in this bill was changed to $300, which was consistent  with where the administration has been over the last 5 or 6 weeks. That  helps the vast majority of unemployed individuals make ends meet  without driving our deficit even higher.    The $600-a-week supplement was not sustainable over time, in part,  because people were actually making more money on unemployment  insurance than they were with their jobs. You were being paid more not  to work than to work at $600 on top of the State benefit. In fact,  under that supplement of $600, the median wage earner in America  received 134 percent more of his or her previous wages, making it  harder, therefore, to jump back into the workplace and get our economy  moving again.   By the way, I heard this all over Ohio, and I know every single one  of my colleagues has. They heard it from businesses, particularly small  businesses but also larger businesses. The Ford Motor Company told me  they had a 25-percent absenteeism rate when I visited them over the  August break because people weren't coming back to work because of the  benefit that they had been getting of $600. So it was felt in small  businesses, yes, but also midsize and larger businesses and also a lot  of nonprofits.   I heard it from hospitals. I heard it from people who provide  addiction services, recovery services, treatment programs. Nonprofits  are having a hard time getting people to come back because, again, the  $600 on top of the State benefit average of the, say, $350--$950 a week  was more than they were able to pay them. People were making more on  unemployment insurance than they were at work. This was as the economy  was starting to pick up. We needed jobs.   We said: How about $300? Why did we pick $300? Well, again, $600 is  so generous that it is paying people more. By the way, the  Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group here in Congress,  analyzes these things. They analyzed it and said, if you continue the  $600 until next year, which is what the Democratic proposal is in their  legislation, the Heroes Act--if you continue the $600 until next year,  that would result in 8 out of 10 people on unemployment insurance  getting paid more on unemployment insurance than they would at work, 80  percent. That is from the CBO.   What is the right number instead of having 80 percent paid more by  not working? Well, I think $300 is about the right number. Some could  say that is too high, too, but the $300 on top of the State benefit was  what was rejected last Thursday by my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle.   By the way, when 80 percent of people are making more money by not  working, it hurts everybody. It hurts these businesses. Small  businesses and these nonprofits are not able to get people to come to  work. Look at the ``Help Wanted'' signs you may see in your own  community. It hurts the economy when you don't have this workforce and  you don't have these jobs coming back.   It also hurts the workers. I think all of us should want to reconnect  people to work. That is where people get their healthcare. If they have  it, they are likely to get it at work. That is where about 80 percent  of us get it. It is where people get their retirement, if they have it.  We want more people to have that, but a 401(K) is going to be through  work. This is where people get the training they need to keep up with  what is happening with their job. It is where people connect with other  people. It is where people get self-respect and self-esteem by working.  We should be encouraging work.   Again, I think somewhere there is a number there where you are  helping people who need the funds to be able to get by because they are  unemployed through no fault of their own, yet you are not offering such  a high benefit that it is more advantageous not to work.   The $300-a-week amount offered last Thursday is generous compared to  regular unemployment insurance. In Ohio, with the supplement, you go  from $360 a week State benefit to $660 per week. It is a big change. It  makes a big difference in people's lives. It would cover 90 percent of  the lost wages for the median worker nationwide. The $300 per week  covers 90 percent of the lost wages, helping particularly low- and  middle-income wage earners get by without creating, again, this $600  disincentive to work.   Even if $300 wasn't the perfect solution, it was certainly a starting  point. It was a policy point that could have been debated and amended  on the floor had we gone to the legislation. Again, we were blocked  even to go to the bill to talk about it. Democrats blocked us from  debating it, and so people got nothing. They don't get the $300, which,  again, 90 percent of lost wages for the median-wage worker would have  been replaced by that. But they get zero. All people are left with is  the State benefit now.   Again, unfortunately, in this place, politics was put ahead of the  interest of struggling families who need extra help. It is stunning to  me that this is the point we have reached in Congress's work to address  this coronavirus pandemic.   Early on, there were so many bipartisan victories we achieved because  Republicans and Democrats alike said: This is a crisis. We have to  address this not as our party might want to do but as Americans-- recognizing the severity of the challenge we were facing. It was  encouraging to see us come together to craft the CARES Act, which  passed 96 to 0 and made a big difference.   I had hoped we would be able to recognize from that victory the  importance of hashing out our disagreements and coming up with a  solution, finding common ground to be able to help those we represent.  Unfortunately, the opposite has happened. Politics seem to have taken  over. On the other side of the aisle, the Speaker of the House and  others may think this is good politics for them not to move forward  with something. Maybe they are right. Maybe it is good politics  somehow, but it is not what is best for the American people.   By opposing a reasonable compromise on unemployment insurance, as an  example, what this Congress is doing is leaving the American people  high and dry at the exact time that funding for these benefits has run  out.   Again, the short-term bridge that the administration provided, $300 a  week, is running out. It doesn't need to happen. Let's come to the  negotiating table this week and next week. We are going to be here next  week. We are supposed to vote on a continuing resolution, the funding  program. We will be here. We know what the differences are. We know  what the similarities are. We know how to put together a package. We  know what it has to be and  [[Page S5646]]  what the compromise is. For Republicans and Democrats alike, it is now  on us to come up with that bipartisan solution on unemployment  insurance and the other pressing issues we face as the American people.
