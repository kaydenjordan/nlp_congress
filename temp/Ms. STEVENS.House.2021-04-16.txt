 Madam Speaker, as I rise in support of the Workplace  Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act, I  pose the question: Where were you, Madam Speaker, at 2 a.m. last night  when a gunman stormed into a FedEx facility in Indianapolis killing  eight colleagues who did not have a workplace safety plan because their  phones were in their lockers, unable to text their loved ones that they  were alive?   This is what we are asking our colleagues on the other side of the  Chamber this morning as we debate this very important legislation.  Because when you refuse to change the laws to enact gun safety in this  country, when you refuse to enact a bill that will allow for workplace  safety prevention plans to be put into place, you are simply accepting  the status quo of the perpetuation of violence in our workplaces.   We are at a moment of crisis in this country when it pertains to gun  violence. We have the testimonies of the doctors and the nurses. This  has been extremely well-vetted.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from National Nurses  United in support of this legislation.                                         National Nurses United,                                                  February 23, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 170,000 registered       nurses represented by National Nurses United, we write to       urge you to cosponsor the Workplace Violence Prevention for       Health Care and Social Service Workers Act, introduced by       Representative Joe Courtney.        Across the country, registered nurses and other health care       workers are put at risk every day when providing quality care       for patients in need. Over the course of the past year, the       dangerous working conditions in our nation's hospitals and       health care facilities have been exposed due the Covid-19       pandemic. But these hazardous working conditions pre-date       Covid-19.        The danger of violence in the workplace has become its own       epidemic in our nation's health care and social service       workplaces. In 2019, nurses reported more than three times       the rate of injuries due to workplace violence than workers       overall. Nurses report being punched, kicked, bitten, beaten,       and threatened with violence as they provide care to others--      and far too many have experienced stabbings and shootings.        Violence on the job has increased for nurses during the       Covid-19 pandemic. According to a recent survey conducted by       National Nurses United, twenty percent of nurses report       facing increased workplace violence on the job over the       course of the pandemic, which they attribute to decreasing       staffing levels, changes in the patient population, and       visitor restrictions.        There are practical steps that healthcare and social       service employers can take to fulfill their obligations to       protect their employees from these serious occupational       hazards. We know that violence can be prevented through the       development and implementation of plans that are tailored to       specific patient care units and facilities. These plans must       assess and address the range of risks for violence--from the       sufficiency of staffing and security systems to environmental       and patient-specific risk factors.        The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and       Social Service Workers Act mandates that the Occupational       Safety and Health Administration promulgate a workplace       violence prevention standard that would require healthcare       and social service employers to develop and enforce plans to       protect their employees from violence on the job. To ensure       that workplace violence prevention plans are effective,       workers (including nurses, other direct care employees, and       security personnel) must be involved throughout all stages of       plan development, implementation, and review, which go hand-      in-hand with the standard's comprehensive training       requirements. The enforceable occupational health and safety       standard established in this legislation is necessary to       create and maintain protections against workplace violence       that our members, other  [[Page H1858]]       workers in healthcare and social settings, and, importantly,       our patients deserve.        Last Congress, the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health       Care and Social Service Workers Act was passed in the House       of Representatives with bipartisan support. As nurses and       other health care and social service workers continue to put       their lives at risk to do their jobs, it is imperative that       Congress pass this legislation and ensure it is signed into       law.            Sincerely,      Bonnie Castillo, RN,        Executive Director, National Nurses United.      Zenei Cortez, RN,        President, National Nurses United.      Deborah Burger, RN,        President, National Nurses United.      Jean Ross, RN,        President, National Nurses United.     Workplaces need violence protection. Vote to pass H.R.  1195.
