 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Thornberry,  Ranking Member Smith, and Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, the chair of the  Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, on which I am proud  to serve as ranking member. I thank them all for their contributions to  this bill that is before us today. Each year, our committee's  legislation addresses issues vital to the defense of our Nation, and  their leadership was key in crafting this bill.   I would also like to thank the ETC staff for their work on this bill,  particularly, Lindsay Kavanaugh, Pete Villano, Jamie Jackson, Eric  Snelgrove, Katie Sutton, Mark Pepple, and Nevada Schadler, as well as  my personal staff, Kathryn Mitchell-Thomas, and my two fellows, Brian  Mandock and David Wagner.                                time  1800    Mr. Chairman, this bill contains many critical provisions that will  enable and enhance our national security.   We added $1 billion beyond the President's request for the Virginia- class and Columbia-class submarines, ensuring continued naval and  strategic superiority beneath the seas.   We also incorporated my provision to require the Department to  include energy and climate resiliency efforts as a factor for  consideration in major military installation master plans so that we  can be better prepared to face climate change head-on.   The ETC portion of the bill ensures that we are also ready for future  threats by strengthening cyber operations and increasing preparedness  for countering weapons of mass destruction.   It also bolsters capability at the pointy tip of the spear,  especially when it comes to supporting our Special Operations Forces,  who execute our Nation's most difficult missions. We bolster this  capability by embracing risk, enhancing innovation, and improving  oversight.   To ensure we maintain strategic overmatch with near-peer adversaries,  we invest heavily in research and development, with a specific focus on  transitioning critical capabilities to the warfighter. For example, the  bill includes $40 million in additional funding for electromagnetic  railgun programs as well as $10 million to grow future cyber warriors  through the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program.   The bill guides the Department as we confront new threats across the  globe by expanding upon previous initiatives--for instance, encouraging  the use of initiatives modeled on the successful Hack the Pentagon  program to update cyber vulnerability and mitigation assessments of  Department facilities--and by exploring ways to safeguard the integrity  of increasingly globalized supply chains that support critical  technologies.   As we look to protect our country from threats beyond the next ridge  line, it is essential these science and technology initiatives remain  prioritized. We will not defeat next-generation threats resting on the  success of our past.   In closing, Mr. Chairman, I again thank and congratulate Chairwoman  Stefanik and all of the members of the subcommittee for their efforts  as well as the members of the House Armed Services Committee for their  dedication to national security.   Again, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the chairman  and the ranking member for their outstanding leadership of the  committee.   I look forward to voting in favor of this bill.
