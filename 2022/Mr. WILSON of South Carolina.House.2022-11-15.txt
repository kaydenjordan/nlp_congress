 Madam Speaker, in February, war  criminal Putin launched his illegal invasion of sovereign Ukraine.   His cowardly acts have resulted in the murder of thousands of  Ukrainian citizens, the torture of countless others, and the  destruction of civilian infrastructure. Putin sacrifices young Russians  for his personal gain of oil, money, and power.   The world witnesses the daily atrocities of war criminal Putin and  continues to be shocked. Congress has provided bipartisan support for  President Vladimir Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people through sanctions  against Putin and his corrupt cronies.   A recent Wall Street Journal poll is significant and shows the  majority of Americans continue their compassionate desire to assist the  heroic people of Ukraine in victory.   America must not waver in support of victory for Ukraine over war  criminal Putin and thus also help deter other would-be global invaders,  such as the Chinese Communist Party against Taiwan and Iran against  Israel with ICBMs against America.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
