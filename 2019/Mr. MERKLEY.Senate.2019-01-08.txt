 Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight to talk about  hostages, seven hostages--seven spending bills that have come through  this Republican-led Chamber, bills the House is ready to move forward  on that have, ironically, been taken hostage by the Republican  leadership of the Senate and the President of the United States.   Those seven hostages, those spending bills, the House has said: Well,  Mr. President, we have a difference of opinion that has to be worked  out, and that is Homeland Security. So let's continue that debate while  setting the other six free--freedom for six bills passed by the  Republican-led Senate so we can put America back to work.   It sounds like a pretty good idea, but good ideas and common sense  seem to be victims--victims of this Presidential temper tantrum over a  symbol on the southern border. So it shut down nine Cabinet  Departments: Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security,  Housing, Interior, State, Transportation, and the Treasury--affecting  all kinds of everyday functions for Americans.   The local schools keep functioning. They figure it out. The local  city doesn't shut down. The county doesn't shut down. Has your State  shut down? I don't think so. So why this childish behavior, why this  incompetence, why  [[Page S73]]  this disregard for the quality of life for Americans?   There are 800,000 workers who are either instructed to work without  pay or who are instructed to go on furlough. We are all affected. Every  one of us is affected by these Departments being shut down, but those  800,000 workers don't get a paycheck.   What does that mean when they try to write the check that will pay  for their mortgage or their rent, their student's tuition, or their  utility bill? How do they keep the lights turned on? It is all fine for  the President. His lights are staying on. He is not inconvenienced, but  these 800,000 Americans are more than inconvenienced. They are put into  a hard place over this hostage-taking by the President and the  Republican leadership of this body.   Out in Oregon, the estimate--admittedly somewhat imprecise--is that  9,000 workers have been affected. It seems in the ballpark. Oregon's  population is about 1 percent of the country, and 1 percent of 800,000  is 8,000. So 9,000 sounds in the ballpark. There are 9,000 Oregonians  who are affected by this foolishness.   An air traffic controller wrote to me and said, we are ``tired of  being a pawn in the partisan games that are being played in Washington.  . . . These shutdowns have compromised aviation safety.''   He said they hinder the FAA's ability to hire and train new  controllers and upgrade air traffic control systems. They break down  morale and an already understaffed and frustrated workforce.   Then there is the constituent who wrote to me to say: ``It is  unconscionable for Trump to deprive Federal employees of earned and  necessary income, holding them hostage for his foolish wall.''   There are seven spending bills held hostage, along with 800,000  Americans and their families' finances.   There is the young man in Lane County whom I spoke with after one of  my townhall meetings last week. He was supposed to be moving to  California to begin working in the Sierra National Forest this past  weekend. He was all set to go, giving up his current living  arrangements because he was going to be moving into Forest Service  housing. Then the shutdown happened. Now he has no job, has no key to  undo the lock. He has no ability to move into that Forest Service  housing. He is stranded. There are just all kinds of everyday stories  of challenges to Americans.   To President Trump, I say: Listen. Listen to the voices of ordinary  Americans who are having a hard time because of you and because of the  leadership of this Senate--the Republican leadership of this Senate.  Ordinary Americans are caught in the middle of this.   This is your shutdown, Mr. President. You said so. You said it on  television. You said it from the Oval Office. You said you were proud  to own this shutdown. You said:         I am not going to blame anybody else. This is my shutdown.    Yes, it is, Mr. Trump. Mr. President, it is your shutdown, and it is  not a shutdown with a mission, a mission that is important, because the  mission that is important, that you talk about, is border security.   Every Democrat, every Republican supports border security. All of us  who were here in 2013 voted for huge sums. I have heard some describe  that bill we passed in 2013 as $35 billion for border security. I heard  in an earlier speech tonight that it was over $40 billion for border  security, smart border security--smart border security.   Don't you want to spend the taxpayers' dollars smartly? Do you want  to waste them? Do you want to shut down the government and create a  hardship for 800,000 people because you want to waste their money?   Mr. President, and to my colleagues across the aisle, listen to the  common sense of people in your home State who want border security, but  they don't want a foolish shutdown.   The President said there is a crisis--crisis--at the border because  so many people are coming. How many people are coming to the border?  Let's take a look. This shows the number of folks who have been  apprehended at the border from the year 2000--19 years ago now--to  year-to-date in 2018. This is slightly out of date, so you can add a  little bit more to that final bar, but you see the point. There were  massive amounts in the year 2000, really high numbers in 2001 through  2007, and then the numbers dramatically decline through 2011 and  beyond.   I just got the numbers before I came to the floor for the last month  we had, which was October. About 60,000 people came to the border. In 1  month, in 2000, 200,000 people came to the border. That is quite a  difference. That is now less than one-third than last month.   There is no crisis there, only the humanitarian crisis, Mr. Trump,  that you are creating with your war on children--your war on migrant  children--shoving them back into Mexico to put them at the mercy of the  Mexican gangs; proceeding to let them into the United States and then  ripping them out of the arms of their parents while you lock up their  parents; deciding you are going to lock up the children with their  parents behind barbed wire and internment camps; establishing a  national system of child prisons that, last month, held 15,000  children, which is up from 7,000 in June; failing to provide medical  evaluations for these children when they cross the border. Two have  died--one after 6 days in the care of the American border guard.   You, Mr. President, have created a crisis, a humanitarian crisis. The  arrivals on the border are not the crisis; it is your hardened heart,  your dark and evil heart, your war on children; the deliberate strategy  of inflicting trauma on children in order to send a message of  deterrence, a political message of deterrence.   Who here believes it is right to deliberately injure children to send  a message of deterrence? That is the strategy Jeff Sessions announced  last May that started this intense assault on migrant children. Who  would defend it today? Find me one caretaker of children who believes  that inflicting trauma on children is acceptable. Find me one religious  tradition, one moral code that says that is OK--because it is not OK.  Every human civilization recognizes that.   Meanwhile, our farmers are wondering what happened to their Farm  Service Agencies. They are closed down across the country, including 23  in Oregon. What happened to those payments that the President promised  for those affected by tariffs? The payments can't be distributed  because of the shutdown. How about our Federal firefighters who need to  be in training right now for the fires we are going to see next summer  because of climate chaos?   We are seeing the impacts in every conceivable way, as my colleagues  have been pointing out, and it is time to end it. It is time to release  the hostages. It is way past time to end it. It has 18 days--3 days  from the longest shutdown in history. It is time to end it, put people  back to work, return to common sense, and at the same time quit  afflicting children and migrant adults as a political strategy.   Almost everybody--probably everyone in this room--came here as a  descendant of immigrants, almost all Americans. Not many of us are  directly descended from Native Americans. Most of us are descendants  from immigrants. How did we want them to be treated? We wanted them to  be treated with respect and decency as they waited for an asylum  hearing, and that is what we have to return to.   So release the hostages, return to common sense, and treat the  American people with respect.   Thank you.
