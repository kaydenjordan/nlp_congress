 Mr. Speaker, the recent numbers on our trade deficit in  this country tie in strongly with our supply chain issues we have been  facing during COVID and during this new administration. We have reached  a new record of $110 billion for 1 month of March of our trade  deficits.  [[Page H4868]]    So why are we in this precarious situation?   We are not producing the way we need to in this country. I just spoke  with some dairy folks a while ago from California. They are having more  and more difficulty in producing but also exporting. We are not  adhering to our trade regulations and our trade agreements. Basically  the USTR is saying we are not being empowered to make new trade  agreements, we are instead more worried about other things such as  climate change and things like that.   How are we supposed to compete?   How are small towns and small town economies supposed to keep going  when we cannot produce here and we cannot have trade agreements that  are adhered to?   Under the Trump agreements with China we were $300 billion behind  because they were not being enforced.   How are we supposed to have the means of production in this country  when we don't enforce our trade laws and our trade agreements?   We have shiploads that come over here full of more electronic  gadgetry or what have you from China and others, and then they leave  our ports a lot of times empty. They don't even fulfill obligations.  When they leave the ports in southern California they are supposed to  stop in the Port of Oakland, for example, and pick up our ag products,  almonds, et cetera, and take them back. Yet they don't because they are  not being enforced.   What does that mean for our economy?   It means bad things. Bad things for our rural ag economy and bad  things for our rural trade deficit. So if we don't have the means of  production here, if we are not sustaining them, then we will not have  food and we will not have the other things that Americans produce as  part of our trade agreements, and then we will be even more dependent  on imported food and imported products that have already put us over a  barrel.   Somewhere around 90 percent of our pharmaceuticals, for example, are  produced in China.   What if they decide to cut off their export to us and keep us over a  barrel on that?    How are we supposed to continue to compete?   How are we supposed to have an economy?   We need the President and his U.S. trade representatives to adhere to  enforcing our trade agreements because it means so much to our jobs,  and it means so much to our economy. If they are not producing for  export, then they are probably not going to be around to produce for  our domestic use.   So as we see the world food crisis mount up--and we haven't seen  anything yet indeed as water is being cut off in California, for  example, because of BOR and others are not finding that a priority over  fish and over salinity in the delta--we are going to find ourselves in  2023 without the food that we should have been growing in 2022.   It is not that tough. It is pretty simple. You need to plant a year  ahead in agriculture and food supply to have what you are going to need  next year. But we don't because we are after pie-in-the-sky other  priorities. So electrification of tractors they are talking about. No  farmer is going to be able to change his fleet out and get rid of his  trucks and his tractors to meet these ``goals'' set by somebody in  Washington, D.C., or Sacramento. We need to get back to basics. We are  coming out of 2 years of COVID. We are coming out of a timeline where  the economy has been harmed greatly by overbearing COVID regulations  and taking people out of the production chain. So we are all feeling  the effects of that--unemployment. Yet there are many employment  opportunities out there, and we are not taking advantage of the ability  to fill them because instead we are mailing out $1,200 checks for  prioritizing other things.                                time  1045    I just do not understand how we have a strong country, a strong  economy, when we don't prioritize domestic production, keeping the  supply chains filled.   We are having difficulty getting railroad bookings to move our  products back and forth between the coast and the Midwest to feed  ethanol plants in California, for example.   We want this newer, cleaner fuel, and we can hardly get the grain  there. What is going on with that? Why can't we have train track time  in order to move these very needed products?   Why are ports so balled up, being on the receiving end of imports but  not being able to get our exports out because we are not being more  forceful on our trade agreements?   How long are we going to keep doing this? It makes me wonder if the  administration is actually on the side of the American people or other  interests.   We are not going to be in a good way as we already suffer higher  costs for food, empty shelves. We need the Biden administration to  focus on full shelves and not empty shelves.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this week as we commemorate National Police  Week for those with us and for those who have fallen, I think we find  different ways to honor them. One of the ways we can honor them is also  to make their job easier. Unfortunately, with the Biden border crisis,  the numbers are devastating. There have been nearly one-quarter million  migrant encounters in March because it is a green light and because it  is a magnet at our border. There has been a 68 percent drop in  deportations in 2021.   Where are we going to put folks like this when we are overwhelming  the ability to have the judges and to have their cases heard?   It is not helping. And so we have sanctuary cities all across the  U.S. that are making it more acceptable for illegal immigration to  happen and making it very difficult for law enforcement to figure out  how to process and how to deal with the interactions with local police  and ICE.   So we have to have a much more coherent policy on our border: help  complete the fence, make these gaps go away that so many are pouring  through and giving us such huge numbers here. Forty-two have been  arrested on the terrorist watch list under Biden. Let's make the job  for our border police and our city police much easier and have a better  border policy.                            ____________________
