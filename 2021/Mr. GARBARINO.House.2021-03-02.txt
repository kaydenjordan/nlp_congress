 Madam Speaker, we are facing a growing public mistrust  of our electoral process.   In my district alone, over 800 ballots in Nassau County were sent out  in the wrong names and wrong addresses. In the school board election  this year, I received three ballots at my house, one for me and two for  the people who moved out 10 years ago.   On election day, all over my district, in Ronkonkoma, Seaford, and  Babylon, machines went down. Voters had to hand in their ballots, and  then they were misplaced.   I think all of us can agree that legislative fixes are needed. But  today, we are debating a bill, a partisan bill, whose sole aim is to  secure a Democratic majority.   This bill doubles down on problems that we saw during the 2020  election. Expanding mail-in voting--part of the problem. Legalizing  ballot harvesting--part of the problem. Eliminating State ID--now you  are just asking for a problem. Funding elections--I can think of a  million things that can be done before we fund elections.
