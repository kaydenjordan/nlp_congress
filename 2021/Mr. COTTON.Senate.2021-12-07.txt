 Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.   The Senate is a special institution. It is a unique institution.  James Madison said the Senate was the only truly innovative part of our  Constitution.   It remains the case today that our Senate is the only upper Chamber  in a Western parliament that has more power under our Constitution than  does the lower Chamber. That is in part because of the design of the  Senate in our Constitution; because of our Senate rules, of our  traditions, of our customs.   We have heard a lot about courtesy and collegiality and respect.  Those are very important customs around here, but it has to be a two- way street.   Earlier this year, in the Judiciary Committee, during the markup for  Vanita Gupta to be Associate Attorney General, I was speaking, as is my  right under the Judiciary Committee rules. There was at least one other  Republican Senator who was preparing to speak. There may have been  more. The Senator from Illinois, in his role as  [[Page S8951]]  chairman of the committee, cut off my remarks and forced through the  vote on Vanita Gupta, all so he could save 1 week to get her  confirmed--just 1 week.   I said right here at this desk 9 months ago that when our rules and  our traditions are so flagrantly breached, there has to be some kind of  consequence, and I outlined exactly what that consequence would be at  the time: that I would not expedite consideration, as the Senator from  Illinois rightly observes is the custom here, for any U.S. attorney  nominee from a State represented by a Democrat on the Judiciary  Committee because if there are not consequences when rules and  traditions are breached in this institution, we will soon not have  rules and traditions.   Now, I also said that if the Senator from Illinois would simply  express regret for what happened that day and pledge that it wouldn't  happen again, I would be happy to let all of these nominees move  forward. We have communicated this to the Senator from Illinois and his  staff on multiple occasions. I reiterated today that I would be happy  to confirm these nominees in the following few minutes if the Senator  from Illinois would simply express regret for what happened in the  hearing that day and commit that it won't happen again, which, I say  again, is simply committing that we follow our own rules. If we hear  that from the Senator from Illinois, we will have five new U.S.  attorneys.   And I see the Senators from Rhode Island and Hawaii and New Jersey  are here. As the Senator from Illinois said, I have no objection to  moving forward with any of these particular nominees. All these States  can have their U.S. attorneys this afternoon, but if not, I will have  to continue to insist that we not expedite these nominations. So I  object.    Mr. President, I would like to address the Chair with a  question to the Senator from Illinois.   I appreciate those comments. I would observe that since that day, we  have not had a similar circumstance in which any Republican wishing to  speak was cut off in a markup.    Can we simply have a commitment that that will not happen again in  the future, as it hasn't happened in the last 9 months?    Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks from the Senator  of Illinois. I will invite him to make his unanimous consent request  again. I do not intend to object further. And a voice vote is fine.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and honor the  433rd Fighter Weapons Squadron, which began providing advanced  instructor training to experienced F-15 pilots on January 3, 1978, as  part of the USAF Fighter Weapons School. The 433rd Fighter Weapons  Squadron was deactivated on June 1, 1981, and designated the U.S. Air  Force Fighter Weapons School, F-15 Division. On February 3, 2003, the  433rd was reactivated and designated the 433rd Weapons Squadron, once  again retaining its informal name, ``The Barnyard.'' Though the  squadron name has changed over the last 43 years, the tradition  established by the individuals of the institution has remained  consistent.   December 11, 2021, is graduation day for the pilots of the F-15  Barnyard, bringing the total to 511 F-15 patch wearers. That is 511  individuals who, over the last 43 years, have shouldered the burden of  responsibility in training and preparing America's fighting force to go  to war in the F-15 air superiority fighter. They are the pilots who  have flown on the front lines of aerial combat when called upon by  their nation. They are the warriors who lead their wingmen safely home.  The graduates of the F-15 division have collectively preserved the  Eagle's undefeated record in combat, suffering no losses during its  time in service. Twelve of the F-15 Weapons School graduates account  for 18 of the F-15's 38 air-to-air victories.   It is no surprise that those who have passed through the 433rd  Weapons Squadron, F-15 Division have gone on to do great things and  achieve high-ranking positions, in and out of the military. The  tradition of the F-15 Division is rooted in the never-ending pursuit of  excellence in aerial combat. Throughout their history, the fighter  pilots of the Eagle Division have devoted themselves to a worthy cause  with enthusiasm, devotion, and discipleship. They have trained and led  the pilots who have enabled air supremacy for our forces around the  world and in numerous conflicts.   The fighter pilots of the 433rd Weapons Squadron, F-15 Division join  a long lineage that has ensured air superiority for our Nation. From  DESERT STORM, to ALLIED FORCE, to SOUTHERN and NORTHERN WATCH, and  IRAQI FREEDOM, the fighter pilots of the F-15 Division of the Weapons  School have ensured that control of the skies is never in question. The  433rd Weapons Squadron, F-15 Division has stood on the shoulders of the  giants and dared to reach higher. It has established itself in the  history of this great Nation and its contributions to national defense  are highly commendable. Their brave pilots now pass the torch to the  next generation of air superiority warriors.                            ____________________
