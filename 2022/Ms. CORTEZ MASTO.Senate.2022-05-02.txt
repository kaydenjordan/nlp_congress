 Mr. President, today I recognize Robert  ``Bob'' Edgar Rose, who passed away on February 14, 2022. Bob served as  Nevada's 26th Lieutenant Governor and as chief justice of the Nevada  Supreme Court. He will be greatly missed and always remembered for his  invaluable contributions to the State of Nevada.   Bob grew up in Livingston, NJ. After law school, Bob moved to Nevada  to clerk for the Nevada Supreme Court. He then went on to practice law  in Reno before serving as chairman of the Nevada Democratic Party and  as Washoe County district attorney. In 1974, he was elected Lieutenant  Governor of Nevada. During his decades of service to the State of  Nevada, Bob made a difference in every role in which he served.   As Lieutenant Governor, Bob worked to safeguard the rights of all  Nevadans. He strongly advocated for the Equal Rights Amendment to  ensure equality under the law for women. Despite political backlash at  the time, Bob cast the deciding vote to send the amendment to the  Nevada Assembly in 1977. Although Nevada did not ratify the amendment  until 2017, Bob was recognized for his early leadership in this fight  for equality. This important vote may have cost him the chance to be  Governor, but Bob believed in doing what was right. Following Bob's  term as Lieutenant Governor, Governor Richard Bryan appointed him to  the Eighth Judicial District Court in Las Vegas.   In 1988, Bob achieved his lifelong dream of winning a seat on the  Nevada Supreme Court. During his 18 years on the bench, he led efforts  to modernize and improve Nevada's judicial system. Bob helped establish  the Nevada Judicial Assessment Commission and the Jury Improvement  Commission. Additionally, he pushed the court to mandate a statewide  seminar on standardized practices for domestic violence cases. Nevada  became the first State in the country to require such judicial  training. In recognition of his many accomplishments and contributions,  the Nevada Supreme Court awarded Bob the first Legacy of Justice Award  in 2009.  [[Page S2244]]    At every opportunity, Bob demonstrated his strong commitment to  justice. I know that his courage, integrity, and dedication to the rule  of law will not be forgotten. My thoughts are with Bob's wife, Jolene,  and with his family and friends during this time of loss.                            ____________________
