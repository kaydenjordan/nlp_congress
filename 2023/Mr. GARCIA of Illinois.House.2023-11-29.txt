 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition  to this extreme anti-immigrant bill put forward by my colleague from  New York.   I represent Chicago, a city founded by an immigrant and a city that  to this day welcomes immigrants. Although this year has tested us,  Chicagoans have stepped up to embrace our new neighbors.   As a proud immigrant representing a predominantly immigrant, diverse  district, I take offense to the blatant attacks against my  constituents. Outrage about public lands is just another excuse for  Republicans to vilify immigrant communities. If they really cared, they  wouldn't bulldoze through public lands and wildlife habitats while  destroying our environment in their zeal for a border wall. They also  wouldn't try to sell our public lands off to the highest corporate  bidder.   There are many ways to create a more just immigration system. This  bill is certainly not one of them, and I urge my colleagues to oppose  it.
