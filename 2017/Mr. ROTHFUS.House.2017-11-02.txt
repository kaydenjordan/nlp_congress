 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 849, the  Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act.   The Independent Payment Advisory Board, known as the IPAB, was  created under the ACA, and consists of a panel of 15 unelected,  unaccountable government bureaucrats with the authority to single- handedly cut Medicare spending. By doing this, the IPAB reveals the  truth that government, rather than the patient, is at the center of our  Nation's healthcare policy.   In repealing the IPAB, we begin to help get rid of the notion of the  mentality that Washington knows best when it comes to our healthcare.  It is imperative that we act now before nominees are put forward to  serve on the board and access to care is greatly decreased or denied.    My constituents in western Pennsylvania rely on these funds for their  healthcare needs. I am proud to see Congress working together in a  bipartisan manner on this commonsense legislation that will keep  patients and doctors in control of healthcare decisions and preserve  Medicare for current and future seniors.    Mr. Speaker, today House Republicans introduced H.R. 1,  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   This day has been a long time coming. Since Republicans gained the  majority in 2011, there have been numerous congressional hearings and  briefings, feedback from constituents on  [[Page H8424]]  what tax reform might look like, and even the introduction of a  comprehensive reform bill introduced in the last Congress. Republicans  campaigned on a better way to tax reform in specified areas for reform,  and we followed that up earlier this year with a framework document  setting forth our principles.   Today is the culmination of more than 6 years of work, but our work  is not done. Now Members of Congress and the public will have the  opportunity to study the legislation in detail. When all the dust  settles, two questions will remain:   Will this put more money in the average American's pocket?   Will this put America in a much better position in the global economy  and allow us to finally break through years of stagnation with much  healthier growth, more jobs, and higher incomes?   That should be our focus. I encourage everyone to visit  fairandsimple.gop, and I look forward to a real debate on how tax  reform and tax cuts will relight opportunities for all Americans.                            ____________________
