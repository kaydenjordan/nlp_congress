 Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. McCaul), I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas last  year it put over 50 inches of rain into an area the size of New Jersey.  It was the first category 4 hurricane to make landfall in the  continental United States since 2004. It was an extraordinary amount of  rain and a devastating event, leading to the largest housing disaster  in the history of the United States.   This led to 1.4 million Texans evacuating their homes, and 300,000  households were left without power. There was over $160 billion in  damage. This is the second most expensive storm, Mr. Chairman, in  American history, and the most expensive storm in Texas history.  Hurricane Harvey was the third major flood to impact the people of  Houston in my district since 2015.   Mr. Chairman, I want to particularly thank my good friend, Mr. Al  Green. We have worked together in the Houston area in a bipartisan  fashion. All of us in the Houston area--Al Green, Gene Green, Sheila  Jackson Lee, Ted Poe, and  Michael McCaul, who is also working with us  on this amendment and helped put this forward--all of us in the Houston  area have worked together in a bipartisan fashion to help the people of  Houston recover.   We were proud to work together with the Florida delegation to help  the people of Florida recover from Irma and Maria--and Puerto Rico. As  the only appropriator from southeast Texas, I was proud to spearhead  that effort in putting together three emergency hurricane supplemental  bills, for a total of $141 billion, the largest amount of money the  Corps commander tells me that he has ever seen in his 40 years of  service at the Corps.   Mr. Chairman, I particularly want to thank the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee, Mr. Frelinghuysen for his support. I want to  thank the chairman of the Transportation Committee, Mr. Shuster--he and  I were elected together in 2000--for his support on this important  recovery effort. We are approaching the 1-year anniversary of Harvey,  and we have not forgotten the devastation that it brought to the people  we represent.   After we passed that emergency appropriations bill, after those  agencies had received that money, one of our most important and,  frankly, frustrating jobs is getting the agencies to release the money,  to get it into the hands of the homeowners who had suffered, the  business owners who had suffered, and to make sure that the Army  [[Page H4837]]  Corps of Engineers is speedily carrying out the studies and  recommendations that they have to do to build the flood control  structures we need in southeast Texas.   This amendment, Mr. Chairman, that Mr. McCaul and I are putting  forward today says, very clearly, that the Secretary of the Army shall  expeditiously carry out these flood control studies and make sure that  they are built as rapidly as possible. I can tell you from my position  on the Appropriations Committee, as a subcommittee chairman  representing southeast Texas, I will use all of the tools the  Appropriations Committee has available to us, working with Chairman  Simpson and Chairman Frelinghuysen, to ensure the Corps moves rapidly.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Shuster for his support of this  amendment. And I also thank my colleague, Al Green, for his support on  this amendment today. We have worked together arm in arm in helping  people recover from these three disastrous floods over the last 3  years. This amendment will make sure the Army Corps of Engineers  completes these studies rapidly, that they execute quickly, and build  whatever is recommended to help protect the people of Houston and  southeast Texas from the next storm. We are going to make sure, as the  people's elected representatives, that our constituents' very scarce,  hard-earned, and precious tax dollars are wisely and carefully spent in  an expeditious way to rebuild and to protect us against the next giant  storm.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1800     Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al  Green), my colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with Chairman  Shuster and with my colleagues in the House representing the great  State of Texas in ensuring that this money gets out the door to our  constituents as soon as possible to help them recover, and that the  Army Corps of Engineers is moving as rapidly as humanly possible to  complete these studies and build the flood control structures we have  to have to protect the people of southeast Texas from the next storm.   Mr. Chair, I urge passage of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
