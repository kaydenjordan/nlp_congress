 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2021 World  Series champions, the Atlanta Braves.   After a stunning six-game World Series against the Houston Astros,  culminating in a shutout victory last night, the Braves brought home  the Commissioner's Trophy for the first time since 1995.   I, along with millions of Georgians, am incredibly proud of this  Braves team for their unparalleled talent, electric team spirit, and  unwavering determination.   Candidly, last night's victory was poetic justice after the Major  League Baseball commissioner caved to the woke left and stole the All- Star game from Georgia earlier this year over Georgia's new election  law reform that made it easier to vote and harder to cheat.   While ill-advised political ploys fade away, World Series  championships are forever.   Chop on, Atlanta Braves.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Miller for her  leadership on this vital issue of protecting education.   In their quest for absolute power, Democrats are not just stopping  with doubling the size of the IRS to target Americans, granting mass  amnesty for millions of illegal migrants, or imposing burdensome tax  hikes on workers and small businesses. No. They also plan to  nationalize early education.   The Democrats' $1.75 trillion Big Government socialist spending bill  aims to strip parents of their freedom and hand over more power to  bureaucrats and politicians in Washington. Under this irresponsible  spending package, the Biden administration obtains total control in  approving early childhood education standards while limiting parents'  choice in their children's education.   Mark my words, Madam Speaker. The Democrats' reckless reconciliation  bill is a shameless ruse to indoctrinate America's youth with divisive  curriculum and radical ideas. It is no coincidence that this comes at a  time when  [[Page H6170]]  the Department of Justice is targeting parents--yes, targeting  parents--for exercising their First Amendment rights to speak out  against critical race theory curriculum and unscientific mask mandates  in schools. No wonder parents across the country are fed up with this  nonsense.   Parents are the primary stakeholders in their children's education.  It is not the radical left; it is not the Federal Government; and it is  not the failed teachers unions. It is parents.   By injecting woke political propaganda into our schools instead of  focusing on beneficial subjects such as history, reading, writing, and  arithmetic, Democrats are holding children back from a top-tier  education.   Additionally, through the Democrats' empty promise guise of  affordable childcare, this legislation would actually drive childcare  prices through the roof, forcing middle-class families to spend roughly  $13,000 more per year.   Simply put, the Democrats' Big Government, socialist bill has the  Federal Government's fingerprints all over education, which is not in  accordance with the Constitution, and that should terrify every parent  across the country.   This is one of the many reasons why we need to preserve school and  parental choice at the local level. It will ensure every solitary  student has the opportunity to receive an education that will  adequately prepare them for the future and that every solitary parent  has the choice to decide where their children receive that education.   Madam Speaker, let's empower parents and not embolden the Federal  Government.
