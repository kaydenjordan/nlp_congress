 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Nadler for those  kind words and introduction. I am proud to rise today as one of the  newest Members and Representatives in the House, serving the great  people of New York's 19th Congressional District.   On a clear, crisp May morning in 2004, I stood proudly with my West  Point classmates, raised my right hand, and solemnly swore an oath to  protect and defend our Constitution from all enemies, foreign and  domestic. I still vividly remember the mix of emotions I felt as my  classmates and I tossed a thousand white service caps simultaneously  into the air--elation, relief, honor, pride, but mostly the tremendous  weight of responsibility that came with that oath.   I didn't know exactly what lay ahead, but I knew I would soon lead  troops in combat and that it would be my job to protect my fellow  soldiers, to serve my country, to serve my community, to make difficult  decisions with life or death consequences, and always to maintain my  integrity, no matter what.   Today, 18 years later, I am so proud to have renewed that oath to  protect and serve our great Nation. The weight of the responsibility I  feel today standing before you-all is even greater. The same way that I  fiercely protected my fellow soldiers, I will fight for my  constituents, the community that raised me, that sent me care packages  every single week when I was deployed overseas, that has had my back  every step of the way. I will fight for their health, I will fight for  their safety, and I will fight for their freedom.   As I look up into the gallery, I can see my wife, Rebecca, and our  two young boys, Theo and Cameron.   Theo is clapping. Good job, buddy.   They are extremely well behaved tonight, and for that we are greatly  appreciative.   They are 3 years old and 9 months old. They are too young to fully  appreciate the significance of this day and this moment, but I cannot  wait to explain to them the immense pride I feel standing here before  you, with you, my distinguished colleagues, humbly representing my  community.   This is a moment of immense consequence and challenge for our  country. I truly believe it is an all-hands-on-deck moment for our  democracy.   I pledge that I will fight every single day, with every ounce of my  being, to deliver for the great people of New York's 19th Congressional  District and to renew trust and faith in our Nation.
