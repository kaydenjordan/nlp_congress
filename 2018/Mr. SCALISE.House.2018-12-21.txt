 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the committee for  yielding time to talk about this important program.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for her consistent  commitment to making sure that the National Flood Insurance Program is  there for families who need it, families all around the country, not  just families, by the way, Mr. Speaker, in coastal areas. This is a  program that affects every community in our country. It is a program  that affects millions of people throughout the country, hundreds of  thousands in my home State of Louisiana, but people from all around. It  is an important program.   Mr. Speaker, I would love for this to be a private program, where  there were great options all around for people to buy private flood  insurance. Unfortunately, today there aren't; and so because there  aren't those private options, the only game in town is NFIP. So it is  incumbent upon us to make sure that this program works. And it has got  to be a program that is fair for ratepayers and fair for taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, over the years, we have had many different long-term and  short-term reauthorizations. It is well-documented. It has been one of  the frustrations of trying to get consistency in the program, but, in  the meantime, it is important that this program move forward.   Too many people are counting on NFIP to be there for them that have a  closing on a home this week; maybe somebody's buying a new house for  Christmas and they have to have flood insurance. We need to make sure  that that program is there for them.   So it is important that we continue to keep this going, while  negotiations will go on to see if we can get a long-term solution. The  House came together and figured out a way to get a 5-year  reauthorization, but the Senate wasn't able to put it together. I have  no doubt in the future we are going to have those negotiations and find  a way to get a long-term reauthorization for the program. I appreciate  all the efforts that are being made.   But, in the meantime, people know that you can't just have this  program expire as those negotiations go on.   So, with that said, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all the parties  involved who are negotiating in good faith to try to get this done.   Again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for her  continued efforts to make sure that people, millions of people all  across this country have that program.  [[Page H10569]]    I want to thank the chairman for his years of service. It has been a  long time. We have worked together, both former chairmen of the RSC,  and I know he is going to have brighter days ahead. I am sure he is  glad that he will have a few more days to live out his current career,  but I appreciate the gentleman from Texas' service over these years to  our country in Congress.                                time  1200
