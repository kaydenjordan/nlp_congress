 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because as of this morning at  9 a.m., 78 percent of the gas stations in my district in Greenville and  Spartanburg, South Carolina, are out of gas. My constituents are  calling my office hundreds at a time requesting relief.   What has happened with the Colonial Pipeline is a cybersecurity  attack. It is an attack likely from eastern Europe. A group that calls  themselves DarkSide is seriously impacting the lives of my  constituents.   This Congress has waited far too long to address our weak  cybersecurity in the overall U.S. economy. We must take steps as a  country and as a Congress to increase our cybersecurity to protect our  country from future attacks.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to craft legislation to make sure that what is going on right now  in the Southeast does not happen again.                            ____________________
