 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  100th birthday of my dear friend John Squire Drendel. John dedicated  his life to advocating on behalf of his clients and serving the people  of Nevada. For 70 years, John shaped Nevada's legal community, and I am  proud to join his family and friends in celebrating this significant  milestone.   On August 4, 1923, John was born in Carson Valley, NV, a beautiful  rural community just south of Carson City. In the midst of the Great  Depression, John left home to work on a nearby ranch and complete his  studies at Douglas County High School.   During his first semester at the University of Notre Dame in the fall  of 1941, the bombing of Pearl Harbor altered the trajectory of his  life. John served in the U.S. Navy as a lieutenant and as a commander  of a landing craft tank in the Pacific Islands of Saipan, Iwo Jima, and  Okinawa.   Following the end of World War II, John took advantage of the  education benefits provided in the G.I. Bill to complete his  undergraduate education and attend law school at the University of  Colorado. After obtaining his law degree, John returned home to Nevada  with his wife Marilyn to raise their four children and work as a Nevada  highway patrolman.   In 1950, John passed the Nevada Bar Exam and later partnered with  William O. Bradley to form Bradley & Drendel, a premier personal injury  firm in northern Nevada. In 1957, in order to make their services more  accessible to their clients, the two selected a converted garage in  Reno, NV, to serve as their firm's office. By 1970, John had solidified  his reputation by representing a diesel mechanic from Ely, NV, who  suffered from a debilitating injury while at work. John won the highest  verdict awarded to a single plaintiff in the U.S. at that point in  time, providing financial security for the mechanic and his family.  This firm continues to serve the community with a third generation of  attorneys. Currently, John's son Thomas is of counsel to the firm.   John is deeply respected by his peers and remains active in Nevada's  legal community as a founding member and former president of the Nevada  Trial Lawyers Association and the Washoe County Bar Association. John  has been honored with countless accolades throughout the duration of  his career, including the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Nevada  Trial Lawyers Association in 2001.   The list of John's contributions to the legal community and Nevada  are never-ending. John strived for excellence throughout his career and  has proven himself a great Nevadan. His professional accomplishments  are surpassed only by the wonderful family and community he has built  in the Silver State. I know John is happy to be spending his retirement  with his children Mary, John, Ann, and Thomas; their grandchildren  Sarah, Andrew, Anne, Clara, Nathaniel, Mary, and Matthew; and their  four great-grandchildren. I am incredibly pleased to honor this  momentous event in his life and wish him joy in the years to  come.                            ____________________
