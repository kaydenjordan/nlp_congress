 Mr. Speaker, today, I will make the motion regarding H.  Res. 630, a motion to condemn and censure the chairman of the House  Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff.   I am going to let some of my colleagues explain further, but I want  to explain to you what the rules are designed to do in the body that we  serve in. They are designed to protect the voice and the rights of the  minority. That is the way it is.   The majority does not need the rules to protect its rights because it  has the power to vote at any time what it wants to happen. But we  follow rules so that all Americans can be represented, even when they  are represented by the minority party.   That is not happening today. That is why we have to introduce this  motion to censure. No more secret proceedings. No more Soviet-style  proceedings.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all to vote for my motion to censure.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I rise  to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the privileges of  the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   House Resolution 630. Condemning and censuring Adam Schiff,  Representative of California's 28th Congressional District.   Whereas President Trump released the transcript of a call between him  and the President of Ukraine;   Whereas President Trump subsequently released the whistleblower  complaint of August 12, 2019;   Whereas, in a September 26, 2019, hearing on the whistleblower  complaint, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff purported  to relay the content of the phone call to the American people;   Whereas, instead of quoting directly from the available transcript,  Chairman Schiff manufactured a false retelling of the conversation  between President Trump and President Zelensky;   Whereas this egregiously false and fabricated retelling had no  relationship to the call itself;   Whereas these actions of Chairman Schiff misled the American people,  bring disrepute upon the House of Representatives, and make a mockery  of the impeachment process, one of this Chamber's most solemn  constitutional duties;   Whereas, for more than 2 years, Chairman Schiff has spread false  accusations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia;   Whereas, on March 20, 2017, then-Ranking Member Schiff read out false  allegations from the Steele dossier accusing numerous Trump associates  of colluding with Russia;  [[Page H8154]]    Whereas then-Ranking Member Schiff falsely claimed in a March 2017  interview to have ``more than circumstantial evidence'' of collusion  with Russia;   Whereas then-Ranking Member Schiff negotiated with Russian comedians  whom he believed to be Ukrainian officials to obtain materials to  damage the President of the United States politically;   Whereas, according to a New York Times article on October 2, 2019,  Chairman Schiff's committee staff met with the whistleblower prior to  the filing of his complaint, and staff members communicated the content  of the complaint to Chairman Schiff;   Whereas Chairman Schiff concealed his dealings with the whistleblower  from the rest of the Intelligence Committee, and when asked directly in  a television interview whether he had any contact with the  whistleblower, he lied to the American people and said, ``We have not  spoken directly with the whistleblower.'';   Whereas members of the Intelligence Committee have lost faith in his  objectivity and capabilities as chairman, with every Republican member  on the committee having signed a letter calling for his immediate  resignation as chairman; and   Whereas Chairman Schiff has hindered the ability of the Intelligence  Committee to fulfill its oversight responsibilities of the intelligence  community, an indispensable pillar of our national security: Now,  therefore, be it   Resolved, That--   One, the House of Representatives censures and condemns  Representative Adam Schiff for conduct that misleads the American  people in a way that is not befitting an elected Member of the House of  Representatives;   Two, Representative Adam Schiff will forthwith present himself in the  well of the House for the pronouncement of censure; and   Three, Representative Adam Schiff will be censured with the public  reading of this resolution by the Speaker.
