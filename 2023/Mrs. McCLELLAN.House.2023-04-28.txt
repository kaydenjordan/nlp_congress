 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the incredible  work of John Marshall High School's boys' basketball head coach, Ty  White.   Coach White recently received the Naismith High School Boys Coach of  the Year award after leading his team  [[Page H2104]]  to an undefeated season and the State title in Virginia.   The Naismith Awards are presented annually to the most outstanding  men's and women's basketball players and coaches who have achieved  tremendous success on and off the court.   Coach White has spent 13 years coaching the boys' basketball team and  has served as an invaluable mentor and community leader in the John  Marshall High School family.   I commend Coach White on his determination, leadership, and grit. He  and the John Marshall boys' basketball team, the Justices, have made  Richmond, our district, and their Congresswoman proud.   Go Justices.                            ____________________
