 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, time and again, prominent Democrats  show they are no longer content to work within the ground rules and  norms of our institutions. They prefer to threaten the institutions  themselves.   We have seen it in Presidential elections when Democrats say our  democracy is sacrosanct when they win but illegitimate and broken if  Republicans win.   We have seen it with the Senate's rules. Democrats just spent 4 years  not only praising but using the legislative filibuster. But now that  they hold the majority, they say it has actually been intrinsically  evil all along and must be scrapped.   We are seeing it right now with voting regulations, where the mere  fact that sometimes Republicans win elections has Democrats wanting to  rewrite all 50 States' election laws right here in Washington and turn  the Federal Election Commission into a partisan body.   And then there is the judiciary. In recent years, we have seen the  Democratic leader stand on the steps of the Court and threaten that  specific Justices ``won't know what hit them'' if they didn't rule the  way he wanted. We have seen a number of Democratic Senators send a  threatening brief suggesting the Court might need to be  ``restructured'' if its rulings upset liberals.   Last week, President Biden, who was marketed to the country as a  moderate and institutionalist, jumped in with both feet. He set up a  pseudo-academic commission to study the merits of packing the Supreme  Court. It is just an attempt to clothe this transparent power play in  fake legitimacy.   But alas, the far left cannot even wait for the fake theatrics of the  fake study to play out. Today, Democrats in the Senate and the House  have announced they will once again threaten judicial independence from  the steps of the Court. They are introducing a bill to add four new  seats to the Supreme Court so that Democrats can pack the Court,  destroy its legitimacy, and guarantee the rulings that liberals want.   Across the ideological spectrum, top jurists have been outspoken on  what a terrible idea Court packing would be. The late liberal icon,  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, explicitly warned against Court packing saying:  ``If anything would make the Court appear partisan, it would be that.''  ``Nine seems to be a good number''--Justice Ginsburg.   Justice Stephen Breyer reaffirmed his own opposition just last week.  The public, by the way, agrees. They see through this discredited  concept. One survey late last year showed that a clear majority of  Americans opposed packing the Supreme Court.   But the farthest left activists aren't interested in the common good.  They want power. And the same Democrats and the same corporate media  that spent the last 4 years hyperventilating and declaring a new  constitutional crisis was under way every 30 seconds seem to be  perfectly content to play along.   Now, if Republicans had introduced a bill to add four Supreme Court  seats for the last President to fill, there would have been weeks of  wall-to-wall outrage on every newspaper and cable TV channel nonstop.  Now it seems the main strategies are either to shrug off, look the  other way, or to actively play along and somehow lend credence.   It is not about whether this insane bill becomes law. Part of the  point here is the threats themselves. The left wants a sword dangling  over the Justices when they weigh the facts in every case. As the  Democratic leader threatened just 2 years ago, Democrats want the  Justices to know that they will ``pay the price'' for rulings that  Democrats don't like.   The left wants these swords dangling over the Senate and State  legislators and independent judges. The threats are the point. The  hostage-taking is the point. And responsible people across the  political spectrum have an absolute duty to denounce this.

I have gotten to watch them hone their skills and  grow into real leaders.   Unfortunately, the privilege of working with ultratalented young  people also means you often see a real all-star fly the nest, and today  I have to offer a reluctant goodbye.   Katelyn Conner Bunning was from Louisville. She joined my personal  office almost 11 years ago. She has done just about every job there is,  from answering phones to mastering policy issues.   For the last 4 years, I have relied on her extensively as my  legislative director. Katelyn has been a key adviser to me, a role  model to junior staffers, a key link between my leadership office and  my Kentucky-focused staff. Who better to help me deliver for the  Commonwealth than the daughter of a former Mr. Kentucky Basketball?   Along the way, some of the trickiest issues facing the Bluegrass have  landed on Katelyn's desk: securing retired miners' pensions and  healthcare, revitalizing abandoned coalfields, strengthening Kentucky  schools and helping students succeed, delivering certainty for Kentucky  farmers while opening new doors for industrial hemp, even protecting  kids' health by raising the minimum tobacco purchase age to 21.  [[Page S1953]]    Last year, I asked Katelyn to take charge of improving safety and  medication standards in the thoroughbred racing industry. Even as a  national publication was calling to end this sport altogether, Katelyn  assembled owners, trainers, jockeys, breeders, and fans to preserve  Kentucky's signature industry.   This is a long list of accomplishments. Yet it is only a short  summary of Katelyn's impact on my team and our Commonwealth. She has  set very high standards. She has helped everyone achieve them.   We are certainly going to miss her around here, but I am sure her  husband Eric and their new daughter Alice are looking forward to seeing  a bit more of her every day.   So, Katelyn, thank you for your ability, for your friendship. I wish  you and your family all the best.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on an entirely different matter,  colleagues in Congress and my fellow Kentuckians were heartbroken last  June when our dear friend, Carol Leavell Barr, suddenly and  unexpectedly passed away.   She left behind two beautiful young daughters and an adoring husband  in Congressman   Andy Barr. She was only 39 years old. Since then, we  have learned her fatal heart attack was likely the result of an  underlying condition called mitral valve prolapse.   Carol was diagnosed at a young age. Like millions of Americans with  heart valve defects, she lived for many years with no apparent  symptoms. Tragically, it only took an instant for her condition to turn  deadly. Approximately 25,000 Americans each year lose their lives from  this heart valve disease. Her passing deprived the Barr family of an  extraordinary wife and mother. We all lost a warm and uplifting friend.   One of the most troubling aspects of this syndrome is just how much  we still don't know. So Congressman Barr is taking action. He  introduced the Cardiovascular Advances in Research and Opportunities  Legacy Act, the CAROL Act. It would encourage new research into  valvular heart disease, help us better understand the risks, and bring  together top experts to identify potential treatments.   With this legislation, we can help prevent more families from  enduring this tragedy. More than 120 House colleagues have already  cosponsored the CAROL Act. It has also earned the support of major  health advocacy groups.   So today, I am proud to introduce the CAROL Act here in the Senate. I  am grateful to partner with Senator Sinema, one of Congressman Barr's  friends from their days serving together in the House. This important  legislation is a fitting tribute to a wonderful Kentuckian. It embodies  Carol's lifetime of service to others, and I look forward to its  passage.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.
