 Madam President, the provision in the underlying bill  that Senator Cruz's motion argues for is a good one in that we should  care about cooperation between China and Iran, but I would encourage my  colleagues to oppose this MTI because of another extraneous provision  in the motion.   The motion argues that the United States should tie our Iran  terrorism sanctions to our China policy, and that, frankly, is a bad  idea. Terrorism-related sanctions are about punishing and deterring  support for terrorism. If we want to use sanctions to deter cooperation  between Iran and China, then we should craft those tailored sanctions;  but to tie our Iran terrorism sanctions to our China policy would have  the effect, really, of muddying the waters about the purpose of  terrorism sanctions. Terrorism sanctions should be about stopping  terrorism--period, stop. If we start applying terrorism sanctions for  other purposes, it weakens our entire anti-terror strategy.   For that reason, I would urge opposition to the motion.                                Vote on Motion     Mr. President, I would urge opposition to this motion.   This motion asks the Senate to endorse President Trump's Iran  policy--a policy that, if you didn't notice, was a complete, total  failure.   The motion calls for a provision in the underlying bill to prohibit a  return to the JCPOA and to keep Trump's ``maximum pressure'' campaign  intact until a mythical comprehensive agreement is achieved with Iran,  inclusive of all their malevolent behavior. This policy just hasn't  worked. To apply it prospectively would be ruinous.   Friends, Iran is weeks away from having enough nuclear material for a  weapon. To deny this administration the ability to enter into a nuclear  agreement isn't just folly; it is downright dangerous.   I wish a comprehensive agreement with Iran was possible, but 4 years  of failure by President Trump was proof that, for the time being, it is  not. We should not endorse 4 more years of this failed Iran policy.   I urge opposition.                                Vote on Motion
