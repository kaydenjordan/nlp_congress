 Madam Speaker, this bill is critical for  millions. That is why I supported it in the previous Congress, but it  also contains some deep flaws that perpetuate racial injustice. I,  along with 47 Members, worked to eliminate those racially motivated  barriers to legalization from this bill. These harmful provisions will  deny immigrant youth a better future.   In this moment of racial reckoning, we have missed an opportunity.  Yet I will vote for this bill, and I urge support because we can do  better so that every immigrant child has a fair chance to call America  home.
