 Mr. Speaker, over the last 10 months, the COVID-19  pandemic has had a devastating impact on our communities: from our  frontline heroes working around the clock to families who have gone  hungry, to the millions who have lost their jobs, and, heartbreakingly,  the over 300,000 who have lost their lives.   While many of us believe that the Federal Government can and still  should do much more to alleviate the impact of the pandemic, we all can  be inspired by the compassion, innovation, and resilience of the people  in our communities who have stepped up to serve and to try to fill the  needs laid bare by this crisis. They are our local heroes.   A few weeks ago, my office launched a local heroes initiative to  showcase the countless people in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional  District who have gone above and beyond to help those in need  throughout this crisis. In just the first few days, we received over  100 submissions, and it has grown since then.   From nurses on our front lines to children organizing food drives, we  were overwhelmed by the stories of resilience, ingenuity, and absolute  determination by members of our community whose stories we don't hear  enough. So, today, I want to share a few of their stories.   I am talking about people like Nicole, an emergency manager, who is  now serving our community by running two emergency rooms due to the  overwhelming number of COVID-19 cases. Aunt Nee Nee, as she is known to  her beloved nieces and nephews, has only been able to see her family  for limited amounts of time, if at all, since the pandemic started.   People like Jillian, a mom of three, who regularly works 15-hour  shifts in the ER, then comes home, disposes of her scrubs in a bin so  she can hug her kids and help them do their schoolwork. She is a real- life superhero.   Young people like Emily, just 14 years old, who, when she realized  that some children in our community would be without holiday gifts this  year, organized a toy drive, contributing her babysitting money and  recruiting her younger brother and sisters to help make cards and wrap  the gifts.   People like Michelle, a nonprofit leader, who has ensured that our  LGBTQ communities are not left behind during this crisis; working to  secure housing, food, and medications for immunocompromised community  members.    Teachers like Jimmy, from Upper Darby, who knows how hard this  transition has been for both students and teachers. So he has gone  above and beyond to share acts of kindness, like dropping off doughnuts  for his fellow teachers or helping students get help to obtain the  technology they need for virtual learning.   People like Ala Stanford and the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium,  who organized free COVID testing for our most at-risk communities when  it became apparent that they could not otherwise obtain testing.   County employees, like Ed and Gayle, who have reinvented and  organized dozens of drive-thru food drives to help feed our neighbors  and keep the donors safe.   These local heroes should inspire all of us, no matter what our  party, to fight for more relief that the American people deserve.   Every day we delay getting relief to them means more businesses go  under, people get sicker, more Americans die, and families are  stretched even thinner financially. We have got to get this done. The  American people cannot wait.  [[Page H7238]]                                ____________________
