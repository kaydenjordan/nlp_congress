 Mr. Speaker, I have to hand it to my colleagues on the  other side. In the infamous words of Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel,  they ``never let a crisis go to waste.''   When the unemployment rate is up and incomes are down, when the job  openings are few but the food lines are many, when the American people  need their Representatives to put aside partisan politics, my  colleagues on the other side put forth this boondoggle proposal.   This partisan $1.9 trillion bill is being forced through Congress  when more than $1 trillion from previously passed laws remain unspent.   How about let's get that $1 trillion out the door before we come back  to the trough?   Mr. Speaker, they can't let this crisis go to waste, so they are  going to force-feed leftist policies to the American people and do  their best to disguise it as COVID relief.   My constituents back home are asking me: How does killing more jobs  by doubling the Federal minimum wage help reopen our economy? What do  climate change policies have to do with stopping the spread of COVID?  How does expanding ObamaCare help reopen our children's schools?   The answer is none of these policies have anything to do with  stopping or addressing the China virus. They are unnecessary and  radical. This budget is just Democrats doing what Democrats do, trying  to score political wins on the backs of Americans in crisis.   So we will vote on this bill, Democrats will claim their political  wins,  [[Page H291]]  and America will go further into debt. But the real relief that  Americans need, the relief of a job, an open school, and a thriving  economy, will once again go unaddressed.   I urge my colleagues to get real and scrap this pipe dream.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.                                time  1330     Madam Speaker, I rise this evening with a heavy heart.  Like many Americans, I am saddened by the loss of millions of innocent  and precious lives over the last 48 years since Roe v. Wade.   I know that there are millions of pro-life Americans rising up to  protect the unborn. Because of this, I am encouraged. I have hope. Over  the last 4 years, we saw remarkable pro-life wins all across America.  Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, and Ohio, these  States rose up to protect the most vulnerable among us. From both sides  of the aisle, they passed heartbeat bills because they know life--every  human life--matters.   Madam Speaker, when Roe v. Wade was passed, we didn't have 3D  ultrasounds readily available. We didn't have readily accessible  sonograms or the ability to provide lifesaving care to those whom we  call miracle babies, children who are prematurely born as early as 21  weeks. I have held a child in my arms, in my hands, who was born at 23  weeks, 1 pound, 8 ounces. She is a miracle baby. America didn't know  that pre-born children could feel pain as early as 21 weeks, or see  videos of babies in the womb clapping as their mother sings to them.   Sadly, not all States have seen the light. Back home in Colorado, we  are one of only seven States that allows full-term abortion in America.  We have to do better than this.   The CDC states that, in 2017, 647,000 Americans died from heart  disease, making it the leading cause of death in America. That is not  true. The leading cause of death in 2017, in the United States, was  abortion, killing 862,000 precious babies. This is not a tragedy; it is  an atrocity.   Madam Speaker, I am the mother of four children--four wonderful boys,  who I am raising to be men. I am raising my boys to love America, to  love people, and to always do their best. I have been in the doctor's  office, and I have seen my baby boys talking and turning in my womb.  They are my children. They are made in God's image, in His likeness.  They have a God-given purpose and a plan by their Creator who knows  them intimately and deeply and loves them, who has a plan, a future,  and a desired outcome for their lives. It is my job to raise them  according to God's bent. Before they had taken their first breath, God  knew them, and I was blessed to carry them.   Madam Speaker, I have seen women make the choice. I have a waitress  in my restaurant who chose life. She was in a very questionable  situation. Her life wasn't what everyone thought it should be. She  ended up with child, and she had a choice. She had a choice to not go  forward and be a mom, but she chose life, and now she is one of the  greatest mothers that I know. Her name is Jasmine Higgs, and her baby  boy is Darius. He is alive today because, glory to God, she chose his  life. She said that his life is worth any of the consequences that may  come against her.   Madam Speaker, today, with this rise, I encourage my colleagues to be  hopeful because a culture that celebrates life is on the rise in  America, and I am committed to working with pro-life patriots all  across the country until we end the horror of abortion.
