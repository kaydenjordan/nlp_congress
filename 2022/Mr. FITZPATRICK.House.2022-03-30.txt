 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an amazing  young man and Scout in my community in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Alex  Goglia. After completing his Arrow of Light Award in Pack 1 of the  Scouts, Alex crossed over into Scouts BSA Troop 1 in Sellersville.   Since then, Alex has moved up through the ranks of Scouting and  recently became a Life Scout. As a member of Troop 1, Alex has held  several leadership positions, including assistant patrol leader, patrol  leader, and now senior patrol leader. His leadership through the ranks  sets an excellent example for the younger Scouts to follow.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize Alex Goglia before this  Congress as an individual who lives the words of the Scout Oath and Law  in his everyday life and is steadfast in his commitment to better our  community back home in Pennsylvania.   Madam Speaker, recently, in the midst of an emergency medical  situation, Alex used his lifesaving skills he learned in Scouting to  save the life of a young child who was choking on a piece of food in a  restaurant where Alex was employed.   Alex's calm, quick, and heroic response was recognized by the  National Boy Scouts of America, which awarded him the BSA Medal of  Merit, a rare award offered by the Scouts.   We are incredibly grateful for Alex Goglia's meritorious acts and for  the positive impact that he has had within Scout Troop 1 and our entire  community.   Madam Speaker, we wish Alex much success as he pursues the rank of  Eagle Scout, and for all his other future endeavors.   Well done, Alex.                            ____________________
