 Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho), a good friend and a strong advocate for our  veterans.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to  support this legislation.   Representative Yoho does outstanding work. He traveled to VISN 8 in  St. Petersburg, Florida, which is about 3 hours away. We had a  discussion about this particular issue. He came up with the suggestion,  and he is following through with it. It is a good piece of legislation.  Let's get it through the Senate this time.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 512, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend  title 38, United States Code, to permit veterans to grant access to  their records in the databases of the Veterans Benefits Administration  to certain designated congressional employees, and for other  purposes.''.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to add extraneous materials.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to add extraneous materials.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 244, as amended, would require the Department of Labor to  establish a HIRE Vets Medallion Program to recognize and award  employers with a HIRE Vets Medallion for their efforts to recruit,  employ, and retain veterans, as well as their work to provide community  and charitable services to veterans and their local communities.   While we still have work to do, it is important to note that the  veteran unemployment rate has continued to decrease over recent years  and, as of last month, was at the low rate of 4.5 percent. Again, we  have more work to do. While many factors have led to the continued  reduction of the unemployment rate for the men and women who have  served, our Nation's employers in both the public and private sectors  deserve a lot of credit, and it is important that we highlight the work  that these companies have done and that we publicly recognize their  commitment to hiring our veterans--hiring our true American heroes. I  commend them so much.   With this idea in mind, H.R. 244, as amended, would authorize the  Secretary of Labor to create the HIRE Vets Medallion Program, which  would recognize employers who hire and retain veterans as well as  companies that provide support services to the veterans and their  communities.   Employers would earn either platinum or gold status based on  requirements that are related to the number of veterans hired each  year, providing pay equity for guardsmen and Reserve employees who were  called up to active military service and other requirements. Once these  employers have earned HIRE Vets Medallions, they would be able to  publicly display their awards to illustrate the work they have done on  behalf of our veterans and the priorities they place on hiring veterans  within their workforces.   As we work to continue to decrease the national unemployment rate  among our men and women who have served, it is vital that we highlight  and thank the employers who have stepped up and have recognized the  benefits of hiring a veteran, and there are many benefits as their work  ethic is outstanding--their dedication, their integrity. They are  really outstanding people, and I am glad that our employers have  stepped up.   I thank the staff of the Department of Labor and the Trump  administration for working with us to make improvements to the  legislation from what was passed last year.   I also thank Colonel Paul Cook of California for introducing and  advocating for this bill, which, again, has my full support.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 244, as  amended.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cook), a good friend and a great veterans' advocate. I  thank him for his service.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cook), a good friend and a great veterans' advocate. I  thank him for his service.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this  legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 244, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 974) to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in awarding a contract for the  procurement of goods or services, to give a preference to offerors that  employ veterans.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 974         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Boosting Rates of American       Veteran Employment Act'' or the ``BRAVE Act''.       SEC. 2. PREFERENCE FOR OFFERORS EMPLOYING VETERANS.         (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 81 of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by adding after section 8128       the following new section:       ``Sec. 8129. Preference for offerors employing veterans         ``(a) Preference.--In awarding a contract for the       procurement of goods or services, the Secretary may give a       preference to offerors that employ veterans on a full-time       basis. The Secretary shall determine such preference based on       the percentage of the full-time employees of the offeror who       are veterans.        ``(b) Enforcement Penalties for Misrepresentation.--(1) Any       offeror that is determined by the Secretary to have willfully       and intentionally misrepresented the veteran status of the       employees of the offeror for purposes of subsection (a) may       be debarred from contracting with the Department for a period       of not less than five years.        ``(2) If the Secretary carries out a debarment under       paragraph (1), the Secretary shall commence debarment action       against the offeror by not later than 30 days after       determining that the offeror willfully and intentionally       misrepresented the veteran status of the employees of the       offeror as described in paragraph (1) and shall complete       debarment actions against such offeror by not later than 90       days after such determination.        ``(3) The debarment of an offeror under paragraph (1)       includes the debarment of all principals in the offeror for a       period of not less than five years.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the       item relating to section 8128 the following new item:  ``8129. Preference for offerors employing veterans.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                time  1715                                General Leave     I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, to improve employment opportunities for veterans and  business opportunities for the companies that employ them, H.R. 974  would authorize the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to  consider how many veterans an offeror employs during a  [[Page H1112]]  decision to award a contract. Under this bill, the Secretary may give a  preference to such employers based on the percentage of the workforce  made up of veterans. It makes sense.   The bill would also allow the Secretary to debar any offeror who  willfully and intentionally misrepresents the number of veterans they  employ. I am glad that provision is in there.   Mr. Speaker, the unemployment rate among certain age groups of  veterans still exceeds their nonveteran peers, and this legislation is  one commonsense step to incentivize employers to bring veterans into  their workforce and increase job opportunities for veterans of all  ages.   I firmly believe that we should do all we can to encourage both small  and large businesses to provide job opportunities for veterans as well  as provide the Secretary the authority to consider such hires when  making contracting decisions. This will further incentivize government  contractors to make a positive investment in their companies by making  investments in our Nation's veterans.   I thank Miss Rice for her hard work on this bill, and it has my full  support.   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 974.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to  support this legislation. I commend Representative Rice for her good  work.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 974.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
