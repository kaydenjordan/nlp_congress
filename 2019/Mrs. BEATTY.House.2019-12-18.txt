 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record my remarks  supporting the impeachment of President Donald Trump.   Madam Speaker, I rise today--a day that will certainly be looked back  upon by future generations.   Many years from now, when conspiracy theories are put aside and the  truth made plain, the American people will know that President Trump  broke his oath, abused the power of that great office, and thought  himself above the law.   But they will also know that many members of this body--the People's  House--kept their oath to defend the Constitution and held President  Trump accountable.   History will note each of our names and where we stood today--for  democracy, for justice, and for this great country.   When we vote to impeach this president this evening, I can tell you  that I will do so with a clear conscience and with the full confidence  that future generations will judge us on the right side of history.
