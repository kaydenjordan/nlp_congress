 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lofgren for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the American Dream and Promise Act of  2019, but more importantly, for Dreamers and TPS recipients in my  community and all across our country.   As the Representative for the central coast of California, this bill  will affect not just the lives of Dreamers and TPS recipients, but the  lives of people throughout our communities.  [[Page H4287]]    In my district, there are nearly 20,000 Dreamers and thousands and  thousands of Salvadorian TPS recipients. These are men and women who  don't just live in my district; they work there; they go to school  there; they own homes there; they have families there. They are our  loved ones; they are our friends; they are our neighbors; they are our  employees. They are our community. They are our country.   As the grandson of immigrants who grew up in this Nation of  immigrants, I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, the Dreamers and TPS  recipients in my community are filled with the spirit of this country.  They don't just want to stay here; they want to contribute here. They  want to give back to this community and country that has given them so  much. They understand, they value, they yearn to fulfill their  obligations as Americans in this democracy.   Mr. Speaker, let's fulfill our obligation in Congress. Let's do our  job for our communities by giving our Dreamers, our TPS recipients that  opportunity for our country.
