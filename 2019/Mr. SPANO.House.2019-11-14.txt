 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to proudly announce the  introduction of a bipartisan bill to combat human trafficking, the HOPE  for Victims of Human Trafficking Act.   Too often, trafficking victims are forced to do things that they  would never choose to do, and sometimes they are forced by their  captors to break the law. This bill creates a legal presumption which  states that human trafficking victims who commit a covered offense  while being trafficked are presumed to have committed that offense  under coercion unless the prosecution can prove otherwise.   Consequently, this bill will stop many unjust convictions human  trafficking victims face, which will then better allow them to find  employment, seek additional education, and recover from their trauma.   I am proud to cointroduce this bill with my friend Representative  Alcee Hastings.   On behalf of the many human trafficking groups that supported the  bill, including Shared Hope International, Rights4Girls, Selah Freedom,  and others, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, too.                            ____________________
