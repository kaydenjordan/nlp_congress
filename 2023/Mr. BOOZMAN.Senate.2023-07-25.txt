 Madam President, I rise today to applaud the efforts of  the young people who interned in my Washington, DC, and Arkansas  offices this summer.   I appreciate their commitment and dedication to serving Arkansans and  [[Page S3519]]  being an ambassador for our office. These talented students and recent  graduates have grown professionally and personally through this  experience. On a daily basis, they provided support to all areas of  office operations. From giving tours of the U.S. Capitol, to drafting  press releases and researching legislation, they played a vital role in  helping us provide the best possible constituent service.   Interns also took advantage of our speaker series, hearing from some  of Arkansas' best and brightest in our Nation's Capital. This summer  offered our interns memorable moments, including attending Prime  Minister Modi's arrival at the White House, the Smithsonian Folklife  Festival, and the Army Birthday Run at Arlington National Cemetery.  These responsibilities and opportunities allow interns to maximize  their time in the Nation's Capital while ultimately serving the Natural  State.   I would like to recognize the following interns for their hard work  and service to Arkansans this summer: Alex Sumrall, Danny Moreno, Reese  Maginn, Cross Thompson, Wyatt Bailey, Kylie Roesler, Sydney Kincaid,  Ben Sherman, Julija Eddy, Kendall Webb, Blake Bradshaw, Rebecca Brown,  Trey Nichols, Sam Woodhouse, John Reagan Hiland, Jackson Renfro, and  Colin Keady all served in the Washington, DC office.   Anna Mathis, Kade Miller, Logan Moss, Heath Brandt, Ryan Munley, and  Mary Eichenberger served as interns for the Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry Committee.   Victoria Moody, Buddy Gaston, Jake Strawn, and Kyleigh Threlkeld  served in State offices.   I extend my deepest gratitude to our interns for their service. Their  contributions to our office have been invaluable, and I wish them all  the best.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to recognize  DaySpring Cards president James Barnett, who is retiring after 42 years  of service with the world's largest Christian expression company.   James is a business leader, family man, person of faith, community  supporter, and author. A native of Northwest Arkansas, he holds a  bachelor of science degree in business from John Brown University and  an MBA from the Walton School of Business at the University of  Arkansas.   After beginning his DaySpring career as an intern, James was inspired  to expand the company's reach into well-known retail stores. His four- decade commitment to DaySpring led to a successful career that  incorporated his dedication to business and ministry.   Since 1994, James has led DaySpring with humility, strength, and a  servant's heart. His leadership has been instrumental in the company's  mission of sharing God's word over the course of four decades. Even in  times of deep division in our Nation, his stewardship has helped  encourage countless people to live out their faith with devotion and  positivity.   His impact extends far beyond DaySpring. James has been very involved  in organizations around his community including athletic, charitable,  and scholastic boards. He served on the Arkansas Economic Development  Commission, and in 2020, he was board chairman of the Siloam Springs  Chamber of Commerce. He currently serves on the Walton School of  Business Advisory Board and is a member of the WorkMatters board.   I congratulate James on his faithful service and wish him the best in  his retirement, where I know he will be happy to spend more time with  his wife Marilyn, their children, and grandchildren. I know he will  continue working in different but meaningful ways to spread God's  love.                            ____________________
