 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant  Commander Andrew Patterson, a native of Chittenango, New York, who  currently serves as the Chief of Intelligence, Surveillance, and  Reconnaissance Plans/Operations for the military in Afghanistan. He is  the son of Marlene A. Patterson and the late commander, Kenneth F.  Patterson, U.S. Navy.   Lieutenant Commander Patterson has served in the U.S. Navy Reserves  for 12 years, as well as serving with the U.S. Customs and Border  Protection agency for 13 years. Stationed in Afghanistan, Lieutenant  Commander Andrew Patterson is leading the charge on the intelligence  collection operations against the Taliban, working closely with joint  regional U.S. military personnel.   In today's era of combat, the role of intelligence plays an  especially important role in the success of our military. Lieutenant  Commander Andrew Patterson is a true hometown hero. He is an  inspiration to all of us and is an exceptional community leader.   I would like to extend my gratitude to him for his answer to the call  to serve, his bravery, and his dedication to our Nation. I wish him the  best of luck as he continues to serve our country.   Go Navy.                            ____________________
