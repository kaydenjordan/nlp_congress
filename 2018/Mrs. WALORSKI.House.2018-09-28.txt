 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the  SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. It includes my bill, named  for Dr. Todd Graham, who was senselessly murdered last year over an  opioid prescription.   With this legislation, we build on Dr. Graham's legacy of treating  patients not only for their pain, but for their underlying causes.  Today we are taking bipartisan action to expand access to nonopioid  alternatives and give our communities better tools to prevent and treat  addiction.
