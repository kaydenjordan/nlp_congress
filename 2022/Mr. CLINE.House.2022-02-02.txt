 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Master  Sergeant Robert Mayne, who impacted lives of countless Lynchburg  students throughout his nearly 40-year career at E.C. Glass High  School.   Sarge, as he was known to those close to him, joined the military in  1941 and served as a tail gunner in the Martin B-26 bomber, where he  flew 70 combat missions. After more than 27 of years of service, he  retired from Active Duty in 1968.   That same year, Sarge joined E.C. Glass to teach and lead the  school's newly formed Air Force Junior ROTC program. After spearheading  the program for 20 years, he continued his work at the high school for  another 19 as a special education teacher and as an assistant to school  administrators. Even after retiring in 2007, Sarge continued to serve  as a role model, sharing his experiences with students.   Master Sergeant Robert Mayne passed away last week at the age of 98,  and our community mourns his loss and thanks him for his many years of  service.                             America Concedes Act     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the America  COMPETES Act, which would more appropriately be called the America  concedes act. At 2,900 pages, and with a price tag of $325 billion, the  Democrats' legislation does nothing to counter China's malign actions  and, instead, lines the pockets of the country's Communist Party.   The bill appeases Chairman Xi, fails to hold China accountable for  its role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and is even being used by the left  to push their Green New Deal agenda.   There is $8 billion for the UN Green Climate Fund, $2 billion for a  new Climate Leadership in International Mitigation, Adaptation, and  Technology program, $2 million in foreign aid for other countries to  address climate change, and the list goes on.   In fact, the bill mentions climate change 156 times, and it mentions  coral reefs more times than it does China.   This bill is not only weak on China, but it is harmful to the United  States, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.                            ____________________
