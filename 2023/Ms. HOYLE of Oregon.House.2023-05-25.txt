 Madam Speaker, we are at the brink of defaulting  on the U.S. debt, bringing economic devastation to the world economy  and downgrading our credit rating, which increases our debt.  [[Page H2620]]    My Republican colleagues have decided to leave for the weekend,  dodging their responsibility to this Nation. All they have offered us  is political theater, with a piece of legislation that would bring  devastating cuts to 15 percent of the Federal budget and no willingness  to reverse the Trump tax cuts that benefited their millionaire and  billionaire donors.   Last week, my GOP colleagues used every breath to honor the brave men  and women of law enforcement, yet their bill would cut up to $10  billion from Federal law enforcement funding and result in a 22 percent  cut to border security.   Their bill would cut 27,000 wildland firefighters as fire season is  starting in the West, putting more lives at risk.   So I ask my colleagues: Stop the political theater and sign our  discharge petition. Let's get to work passing a reasonable budget that  invests in working families.                            ____________________
