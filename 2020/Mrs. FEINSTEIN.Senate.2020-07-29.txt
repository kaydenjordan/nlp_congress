 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Border  Water Quality Restoration and Protection Act of 2020.''   For over two decades, cleaning up the Tijuana River Valley has been  one of  [[Page S4595]]  my top priorities for Southern California. The wastewater, trash and  sediment that continues to flow into San Diego and Imperial Counties is  a danger to public health and our economy and it must be addressed.   This legislation is a key piece of addressing this decades-long  issue.                             What the Problem Is    Polluted water from the Tijuana and New Rivers flows north across the  border into the United States causing unsanitary water conditions,  pollution and beach closures across Southern California. It also  jeopardizes military training exercises for Navy Seals in Camp  Pendleton.   Three-quarters of the 1,700-square-mile Tijuana River watershed lies  in Mexico. However, the watershed, along with all its pollutants,  drains into San Diego County and the Tijuana River Valley.                        Impacts of the Water Pollution    In addition to jeopardizing human health and safety, two of the most  drastic effects from this cross-border water pollution are harm to  wildlife and damage to the tourism industry, integral to Southern  Californian communities.   Pollution from Mexico harms sensitive areas that provide critical  habitat for more than 300 species of birds as well as marine animals  like leopard sharks and bottlenose dolphins, including: Tijuana River's  National Estuarine Research Reserve, the River Mouth State Marine  Conservation Area and River Valley Regional Park Preserve.   The beaches in the region are vital to San Diego's tourism economy.  Beaches in the communities of Coronado and Imperial Beach have been  closed for more than 200 days this year alone due to pollution.   Health and safety of residents and workers are also at risk. In  recent years, local Border Patrol union officials reported that 80  officers suffered from contamination, rashes, infections, chemical  burns and lung irritation due to toxic cross-border flows.   The harmful effects of pollution in the Tijuana River Valley on our  residents, businesses, economy and environment are simply unacceptable.                                Current Status    In February 2020, the Government Accountability Office issued a  comprehensive report, ``International Boundary Water Commission:  Opportunities Exist to Address Water Quality Problems.'' My office  worked closely with the GAO to utilize their findings to craft  meaningful change through this legislation.   Simultaneously, we were able to secure $300 million in the U.S.- Mexico-Canada trade agreement to address pollution in the Tijuana River  Valley Watershed.   With significant funding and detailed findings by the GAO  investigation, we developed this legislation in concert with federal,  state and local agency input.                              What the bill does    The Border Water Quality Restoration and Protection Act includes some  key reforms to advance concrete solutions.   One of the problems is that no one agency is in charge of this  problem. A whole range of agencies--EPA, International Boundary and  Water Commission, State Department, Department of Homeland Security,  Customs and Border Protection, Defense Department--all have  jurisdiction or interest in this international issue.   What we need is one agency in charge, taking input from the others so  decisions can be made. This approach is similar to other large,  regional environmental challenges like the Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico,  Everglades and Chesapeake Bay. Here in California, we have also seen  great success with this model of interagency coordination at Lake  Tahoe.   Here's how the bill would work:   The EPA would be officially named the agency with overall control of  this effort.   The EPA, along with its federal, state and local partners, would be  directed to identify a list of priority projects. It also would be  authorized to accept and distribute funds to build, operate and  maintain those projects.   Would permanently authorize the Border Water Infrastructure Program  to manage storm water runoff and water reuse projects.   State and local authorities would also be authorized to contribute  funding to federal projects, which is currently not allowed.   The International Boundary and Water Commission would be authorized  to mitigate storm water from Mexico and the pollution that comes with  it and is required to construct, operate and maintain projects on the  priority list developed by the agencies within the U.S. that improve  water quality.                                  Conclusion    We need a new and comprehensive approach to this issue that has  plagued border communities for too long. This bill creates a formal  process to consider effective, long-term solutions and additional  wastewater infrastructure to mitigate cross-border pollution and I hope  the Senate can move on this bill quickly.   I want to thank California Environmental Protection Agency,  California Natural Resources Agency, San Diego and Imperial counties,  cities of Imperial Beach and Coronado, Mayor of Chula Vista, Mary  Casillas Salas, Mayor of San Diego, Kevin Faulconer, and the Port of  San Diego for supporting this legislation. These communities, and  others, have been negatively impacted by this issue for far too long.   It's past time that we finally solve this problem to safeguard local  health and economic growth.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the Floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Bennet):   S. 4361. A bill to automatically extend and adjust enhanced  unemployment assistance for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency and  economic crisis, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
