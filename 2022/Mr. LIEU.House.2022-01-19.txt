 Madam Speaker, last year Democrats passed the American  Rescue Plan that provided funding to schools so they could reopen,  funding to cities and States so that first responders, municipal  employees, and county employees didn't get laid off, and it got  stimulus checks to the American people.   As a result, we were able to have over 6 million jobs created since  January 20, 2020, and the lowest unemployment rate now in nearly 50  years.   However, with the opening of our economies across the world,  inflation has happened, including in the United States, and that is why  I am so pleased that the Biden administration has announced $14 billion  to go to 500 Army Corps of Engineers projects, including at ports to  help with supply chain issues. By making sure we can move goods faster  and easier and to address these supply chain issues, we will reduce the  cost of goods, and that was because Democrats also passed the  infrastructure law. Democrats have delivered for the people.                            ____________________
