 Madam President, you all know where I stand on section 232  steel tariffs. I strongly support them because thousands of  steelworkers across the country have lost their jobs due to Chinese  steel overcapacity. Tough trade enforcement against  [[Page S4891]]  China cheating has long been overdue. These tariffs are a tool to bring  China to the table and to get long-term structural changes to support  American jobs.   My colleagues know I strongly oppose the Corker-Toomey legislation,  which would undo China's tariffs, let China off the hook, and gut the  section 232 status. That is why I stood on the floor 2 weeks ago to  block that.   What we are considering today is different. With this motion to  instruct, the Senate will reaffirm that it has a role in section 232  determinations. Of course, we should. That is why I have talked  regularly with Secretary Ross and Ambassador Lighthizer throughout this  process.   I will vote for the motion to instruct not because I think it makes  sense to consider trade policy on an appropriations bill that has  nothing to do with tariffs but because, of course, Congress should have  a role in 232 determinations. It should have a role in all trade  policies. I have been saying that for years. I am glad my colleagues  finally agree.    I ask unanimous consent for 10 seconds.    Let me be clear. Today's vote is not a vote for  undermining the trade agenda. It is not a vote to rescind steel  tariffs. I will do everything in my power to defeat any efforts to do  that.   I yield.
