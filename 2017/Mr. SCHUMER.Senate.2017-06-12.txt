 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Madam President, before I begin, I would like to take a  moment to remember the victims of the shooting at the Pulse nightclub  in Orlando that occurred 1 year ago today. It was the deadliest  shooting by a single gunman in our Nation's history. Forty-nine  Americans died that night, and 53 more were injured. They were  children, parents, sisters, brothers, and friends. They went out that  night to celebrate with their friends and instead came face to face  with a soul twisted by an inexplicable hate.   The best way I can see to honor their memory is to honor them with  action. We should redouble our efforts to make this country safer from  the scourge of terrorism and gun violence to ensure that our schools  and our churches, our theaters and our nightclubs are safe places where  all Americans can be who they truly are. Let that be our mission as we  remember the 49 victims of the Orlando attack and keep their families  in our prayers.                            ____________________     Madam President, on Russia sanctions, soon we will move  to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the Iran sanctions  legislation. The two leaders, Chairmen Corker and Crapo, the two  ranking members, Brown and Cardin, continue to negotiate a package of  strong Russia sanctions that can be offered as an amendment to the  bill. I am hopeful we can come to an agreement soon, one that at the  very least includes legislation put forward by Senators Graham and  Cardin that would establish a process for Congress to review any  Russia-related sanctions relief. Senator McCain, along with Senator  Cardin, has also submitted an amendment for tough, new sanctions, which  I very much support. Democrats feel strongly that Russia sanctions  should move alongside Iran sanctions, and we are prepared to do what we  can to make sure we get a vote on a good amendment and hopefully a  bipartisan one.                            ____________________     Madam President, as we continue to grapple with last  week's testimony from former Director Comey, it seems the new strategy  by some on the right is now to question the credibility of Special  Counsel Mueller. Already, former Speaker Gingrich and others have said  negative things about Mueller just weeks after praising his selection.  They know that Mr. Mueller is the man now responsible for following up  on Mr. Comey's testimony so the hard right is trying to discredit him  in advance. They know they can't debate the facts or the issues or  defend the actions of the White House on the merits, so what do they  do? They attack the referee and try to besmirch the reputation of  someone like Mr. Mueller.   Mr. Mueller is a man of integrity. That is agreed to by just about  everybody. He has devoted his entire career to his country. He came out  of private life to do a job on behalf of his country and be right down  the middle. Even Attorney General Jeff Sessions has praised Mr. Mueller  for his service and credibility, saying his ``integrity is undoubted,''  as is his ``experience and love of country.'' Those are Jeff Sessions'  words. Now the political right has pulled out their partisan knives to  try and defame his reputation.   It is a shameful, shameful ploy. The right must be afraid of what Mr.  Mueller is going to find. I would ask Speaker Gingrich a question. Is  he afraid of what Mr. Mueller is going to find out? Is that why he is  attacking his reputation? The baseless attacks on former Director  Mueller ring hollow. Former Director Mueller has been hailed as a  paragon of public service by people of all political stripes. This  country comes to a low point when that kind of attack is issued.   Despite what Speaker Gingrich may try to imply, we should have every  confidence that he will investigate the matters at hand with integrity  and thoroughness.   I can tell you one thing, the little bit I know about him, Speaker  Gingrich's attack and attacks like that will not do a thing to deter  Director Mueller from finding out the truth.                            ____________________     Finally, Madam President, a word on healthcare.   The Republicans continue to work on their healthcare bill behind  closed doors, and now it seems they are looking for a vote on a final  bill before the July 4th recess.   To all of America, this should be a red alert. This is not a drill.  This is a red alert. In a very short time, maybe only 2 weeks, the  Republican majority may try to jam through a healthcare bill that no  one in America has seen--no committee hearings, no public debate.  According to some reports, the Republicans will not publicly release  the text until the very last moment.   What Senate Republicans are doing on healthcare is one of the most  outrageous examples of legislative malpractice in decades.   Senator McConnell, who believes in regular order, ought to think long  and hard before he does this because it will not go down as a fine  moment in history for him, for his party, or for the Senate. This is  the party that chanted ``Read the bill, read the bill,'' when ObamaCare  was being debated, and now they will not even show the bill.   Democrats spent over a year on the Affordable Care Act, the ObamaCare  bill, with multiple committee hearings. We actually accepted dozens of  Republican amendments. Show us the bill. Senators Grassley, Hatch, and  others had amendments that were added to the bill. Show us the bill so  we have the same opportunity.   Why would the majority so starkly depart from the normal legislative  procedure? Why would they seek to pass in the dark of night a bill that  affects one-sixth of the economy, millions of people's lives?   Leader McConnell used to stress the importance of regular order in  the Senate. Why is he proceeding with the Republican healthcare bill in  the most irregular way? I know why. It is because Republicans don't  want the American people to see the bill. They are so ashamed of their  healthcare plan, they want to pass it in the dead of night, with no  hearings, no amendments--rushing it through.   It is not a bill they are proud of. If they were proud of the bill,  they would say: Let's debate it. They are ashamed of the bill. They  know they have the hard right on their backs saying: You have to do  something. But at least have the decency, the honor, a little bit of  courage to put the bill out there and let us debate it and let us amend  it.   The Republicans don't want the American people to know their bill  will likely gut Medicaid to finance a massive tax break for the  wealthiest of Americans, hurt the healthcare of average Americans,  middle-class Americans, elderly Americans, those who abuse opioids, so  they can have a big tax break for people whose income is above $200,000  a year.   The Republicans don't want the American people to know their bill  will make older and sicker Americans pay more for less coverage.  Someone 63 or 64 could see their premiums go up three, four, five  times, while millionaires and billionaires get a break on their taxes.  If it were my bill, I would be ashamed of it too. Thank God it is not.   Republicans don't want the American people to know their bill will  cause their costs to go up, their care to go down, while leaving  millions of Americans without health insurance. Why are Republicans  working so hard in secret for a bill they are clearly not proud of?  Because the ideologues on the hard right are pushing them to just  repeal and give a tax break to the rich.   It is because they repeated the political slogan ``repeal and  replace'' to their base for 7 years without coming  [[Page S3383]]  up with a workable healthcare plan when the day came that they were  actually in charge.   Now we have this Frankenstein bill from the House, assembled from  spare parts intended to buy off different Republican constituencies,  and the Republican majority in the Senate, which we thought at one  point would show more honor and more courage, seems to be taking the  same approach. They are working on modifying the bill so it can get 50  votes in their caucus, no matter what the impact is on the country.  Most of the devastating consequences of the House bill will remain.   Mark my words, my Republican friends, the Republican Party will  regret the day it passes a bill that looks anything like what is now  being considered. Every independent analysis has shown that TrumpCare  will devastate sicker, older Americans, folks in rural areas, the  working poor, younger couples and middle-aged couples who have a parent  in a nursing home. It will raise costs on middle-class families, and  those struggling to get there will be left with a healthcare system  that works only for the healthiest and wealthiest among us, and the  Republicans will own every last shred of the responsibility. They will  own it completely because there has not been a scrap of bipartisan  input on the bill, not a single Democratic amendment, not a single  hearing, and no one even knows exactly what the bill looks like.   A senior GOP aide said in the paper today that they weren't releasing  the bill text because ``we are not stupid.'' I challenge that claim.  Keeping a bill this bad holed up in secret and then forcing it down the  throats of the American people is much more stupid than simply showing  the bill, allowing it to be vetted and amended, and allowing it to be  improved. It is much more stupid.   The Republicans are going down a dark path, down a dangerous road  that will have devastating consequences for their party and of course  for the American people. Believe me, this is not what Democrats want.   We Democrats are actually willing to take on some of the  responsibility. We are willing to work with our Republican colleagues  to make improvements to our healthcare system and to fix problems with  the existing law. That involves some political risk. We are willing to  take on that risk to try and help more Americans afford healthcare.   The Republicans are doing just the opposite by hiding their bill  under lock and key. They are trying to avoid the risk of public  backlash on a bill that, at least the polling shows, has the support of  a mere sliver of the American people--18 percent. It will backfire. It  will do potentially irrevocable damage to their party and more  importantly to our country.   The Republicans ought to turn back before it is too late. They will  rue the day they rushed this bill, in the dark of night, that does so  much damage to the American people.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Will my good friend and gym mate from Texas yield for a  question?    Will my good friend and gym mate from Texas yield for a  question?    Will my good friend and gym mate from Texas yield for a  question?    Will my good friend and gym mate from Texas yield for a  question?    Is omniscience a comment of all-knowing, and if I don't  know what the bill is all about, then I couldn't be omniscient; isn't  that true?
