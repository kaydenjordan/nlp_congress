 Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such  notification, the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale  may be reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

The estimated total cost was $860.4 million.       Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $324.4 million of       this total.        On June 15, 2020, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 20-0G of an additional       thirty (30) All-Up-Round MK 54 Lightweight Torpedoes (MDE).

The total estimated case       value will increase to $1.18 billion.
