 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson for  yielding, and I also want to thank Chairmen Shuster and Barletta and  Ranking Members DeFazio and Johnson for their continued support.   I have had the honor of working on this legislation with my friends  from Florida: Congressmen Dan Webster, Brian Mast, and Frederica  Wilson.   I have said this before and I am going to say it again: Florida knows  hurricanes. In 2004 and 2005, Charley, Frances, Jeanne, Wilma, and  Katrina tore through our State, leaving families stranded and property  damaged.   I was the mayor of the city of West Palm Beach when we saw trees  crash to the ground, ripping power lines and blocking flooded streets.  Water systems were compromised, and our local governments, around the  clock, did a miraculous job cleaning debris, fixing broken  infrastructure, and getting life back to normal. It takes a lot to get  it done.   When hurricanes strike, communities are ravaged, and so are their  budgets. So I want to first thank FEMA for the funding assistance it  provided Florida in a great time of need. With that said, FEMA is now  asking some of our cities and counties to pay back money that was given  for disaster relief projects that were approved more than 10 years ago.  [[Page H3024]]    There is no question that FEMA should do a responsible audit and make  sure that money is used properly. However, the process should not be an  endless journey into the Federal bureaucracy. Our local governments  cannot afford to wait an infinite number of years for FEMA to do its  assessment, especially when millions of dollars are at stake.   The current practice stymies our local governments' ability to plan  their future budgets, and, unlike the Federal Government, they can't  run a deficit. So this bill would make sure that the process is more  evenhanded, giving FEMA adequate time to review its grant payments  while allowing for the financial security of our local governments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this very good  legislation, and I urge the Senate to take action.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New  York.   I just returned from a trip to South Korea and Japan, a bipartisan  trip, where we focused on the dangers of North Korea. First, I want to  just say what became very clear to us is how important our relationship  is with South Korea and Japan, both economically and for our national  security.   We sat in roundtable discussions with scholars, ambassadors, and  military leaders from the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China;  and I will tell you one thing was unanimous in the thinking: a  preemptive military strike right now on our part would be  catastrophic--catastrophic not only to our friends in South Korea, the  millions who live there, our friends in Japan, but the hundreds of  thousands of American citizens and our military personnel.   I thank our chairman and our ranking member for their good work, and  I urge my colleagues to support this good bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge a ``no'' vote on  this misleading name, Working Families Flexibility Act.   Quite simply, this is a bait-and-switch proposal. It awards employers  flexibility, not the families who need it. It fails ordinary working  men and women, like the mom who has no overtime stored up and must go  into credit card debt after having a baby or the dad who has worked  long, crushing overtime hours but can't afford to give up his pay in  order to stay home with his ill son.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats have better solutions: 12 weeks of paid family  leave, guaranteed paid sick days. These are proposals that will  modernize our workplace. It will lead to better workers and stronger  families.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, the women of the Democratic  Women's Working Group are here today with other Members that we have  invited to raise awareness about the offensive Marines United Facebook  page and others like it.   On these pages, male marines posted nude or intimate photos of female  servicemembers and veterans without their consent. This affected  hundreds of women, with an audience of an estimated 30,000 marines with  access to the Facebook page.   The Democratic women recently held a hearing on this alarming  situation which, incidentally, began less than a month after the first  Marine infantry unit was assigned women, and that was January 5.   At our hearing, we heard testimony from advocates for servicemembers,  a former marine, and a journalist who  [[Page H3053]]  covered this issue extensively, and most importantly, we heard from  Erika Butner and Marisa Woytek, two brave, resilient marines.   Marisa is a current lance corporal. She proudly followed in her  father's footsteps, and she joined the Marines because, as she stated,  she wanted to be part of something bigger than herself.   Erika enlisted in the Marines for many of the same reasons in 2011,  fully aware that she could be deployed to a combat zone. A lifelong  patriot, she was ready, and willing to take that chance. But in her own  words--little did she know that the ``war she would fight would be  among her very own brothers in arms.''   At our hearing, the women described harassment and exploitation at  the hands of their Marine brothers, and, quite frankly, it made us feel  sick to our stomachs.   Their male counterparts put up Erika's and Marisa's photographs and  made lewd and derogatory comments--asking other men to vote on whether  they would ``smash or pass'' on these women, meaning would they have  sexual relations with them.   The women were threatened with rape and violence, with Facebook posts  like: ``We should throw marines into a tub of acid and rip-off their  eyelashes.''   Sadly and shockingly, Marisa and Erika were not alone. Thousands and  thousands of photos of women were shared on these Facebook pages.   I want to say to Marisa and Erika and all of these women: We share  your anger and your hurt, and we are so grateful to you for coming  forward with your stories.   I am a mother of a United States Marine veteran who served in both  Afghanistan and Iraq--a proud mother--and I understand the selfless  sacrifice a marine makes when he or she puts on their uniform. So I am  outraged, as are my colleagues whom you will hear from today, that so  many brave marines were subjected to this kind of harassment and  exploitation while willing to sacrifice for our country. It is not only  personally degrading to courageous patriots, it hurts the effectiveness  of our military and the ability to recruit women.   So today's Special Order is another opportunity to amplify the voices  of Marisa and Erika and to send a message that we stand with them and  we will fight for their honor.    I want to thank Congresswoman Jackie Speier and Congresswoman Martha  McSally, who I hope will be here with us today. They are actually, very  sadly, at another hearing where the topic is sexual harassment in our  military academies.   After our hearing, they went on and they introduced a bill to make it  illegal for military members to share photos without consent. This is a  bipartisan effort. I am proud to be a cosponsor, as are many of my  colleagues, again, whom you will hear from in a few minutes; and we owe  it to Erika and Marisa and all of the other women that have been  subjected to this abuse to pass this legislation and to work together  to change the culture of disrespect that allowed it to happen.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lee), a great leader in this Congress, a member of our Appropriations  and Budget Committees and Subcommittee on Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies.   Representative Lee, we are pleased that you are with us tonight.    Very well said, Representative Lee. Mr.  Speaker, I thank Ms. Lee for her excellent service and advocacy.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield the floor to the gentlewoman from  the  [[Page H3054]]  State of Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), my co-chair and our vice chair of  the Women's Working Group, a very illustrious Member, and she serves on  the Transportation and Oversight Committees.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Kuster  for that forceful advocacy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee),  one of our greatest fighters for human rights, for women's rights; the  ranking member of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I think we have made it clear  that when a member of the military is unfairly abused, we are all  abused, we are all dishonored.   This is not a Democratic issue. This is not a Republican issue. This  is an American issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), one  of our great Americans, an Air Force veteran who serves on our Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Bacon,  first, for his service to our country and for speaking from the heart.  We are very pleased to join him in this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Torres), who serves on the Foreign Affairs and the Natural Resources  Committees.   I want to say that Representative Torres is, like myself, the mother  of a military veteran. Her son is a member of the Air Force. In  bringing the gentlewoman up here, she probably experiences a lot of  what I did. I think for parents whose children are in the military, man  or a woman, there are so many of those times where you just dread that  knock on the door.                                time  1830    You have seen your child put on uniform, and the pride that they  feel. Now, could you imagine having gotten a call from your son that  someone had posted a nude picture of him on a Facebook page and he was  being humiliated? It is just hard to believe.   I know you are going to share some of your insight into all this. I  am pleased to have you here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Torres).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  son's service and for her service, too. I know what it is like to be  the mother of a military person.   Mr. Speaker, we are waiting for--Representative McSally is going to  be with us in a few moments, and I thought, as we wait for her to join  us--as I said, she is at a hearing now. Unfortunately, the hearing is  on the topic of sexual harassment in the military academies.   I wanted to just state for the Record the folks who participated at  our Democratic Working Women's Group hearing that we had a couple of  weeks ago, we talked about Lance Corporal Marisa Woytek. We talked  about Erika Butner, who is a Marine Corps veteran, and both,  unfortunately, were victims of this Marines United scandal.    We also heard from James LaPorta, who is a journalist for The Daily  Beast and a former U.S. Marine Corps sergeant who has covered Marines  United extensively. His work has appeared in The Washington Post and  the Chicago Tribune, among other national publications. During his 8  years on Active Duty, Mr. LaPorta served within the infantry and  intelligence communities, deploying multiple times to the war in  Afghanistan.   We also heard from Miranda Peterson. She is the executive director of  Protect Our Defenders, which she joined in 2013. Protect Our Defenders'  mission is to uplift and support survivors of military sexual assault,  and to improve and reform the U.S. military's process for addressing  rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment.   Prior to joining Protect Our Defenders, Mrs. Peterson worked on the  historic lawsuits against the Department of Defense filed on behalf of  military sexual assault survivors who experienced abuse and retaliation  after reporting, and which were the subject of the Oscar-nominated  documentary film, ``The Invisible War.''   We also heard from Elizabeth Hillman, and she is the president of  Mills College. She was invited by Representative Barbara Lee. Elizabeth  Hillman has conducted extensive research on the history of sexual  violence in the military organization's culture. She is a director and  past president of the National Institute of Military Justice, a  nonprofit that promotes fairness in and public understanding of  military justice worldwide.   She previously served on the Response Systems to the Adult Sexual  Assault Crimes Panel, an independent panel chartered by Congress to  study and make recommendations about sexual assault in the U.S.  military.   And of course we heard from Gloria Allred, who is a nationally  renowned women's and victims' rights attorney. She was the lawyer  representing Marine Corps veteran Butner and Active-Duty Marine Lance  Corporal Woytek.   What treasures these activists are. They are patriots in their own  way because they are defending and standing up for our patriots; and  how sad that they have to spend so much of their time to do that.   Now, since this scandal broke up, there have been numerous articles  written. I want to share one as we wait for Representative McSally,  who, herself, is a military veteran.   Thomas Brennan actually broke this story. He wrote that: ``The U.S.  Department of Defense is investigating hundreds of marines who used  social media to solicit and share hundreds, possibly thousands, of  naked photographs of female servicemembers and veterans.'' That is just  so shameful.   ``Since January 30, more than two dozen women, many on Active Duty,  including officers and enlisted servicemembers, have been identified by  their full name, rank, and military duty station in photographs posted  and linked to from a private Facebook page.'' Again, very shameful.   Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to welcome Representative McSally. I  would say to you that I have been talking about you in your absence.  First of all, I told the Speaker that you were, unfortunately, at a  hearing on sexual harassment in the military academies.   But we are so grateful for your--first of all, for your service to  our country and for your advocacy in standing up for what is right for  our military men and women. Ms. McSally is our lead sponsor on this  PRIVATE Act, which we have had many speakers talk about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative McSally.  We have come to, I think, a perfect ending here today--those of us who  were here today. I know, on a bipartisan basis, we look forward to  fighting for the gentlewoman for what is right and to get this bill  passed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
