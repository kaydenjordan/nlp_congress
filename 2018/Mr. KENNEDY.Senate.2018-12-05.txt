 Mr. President, I just want to make a few comments in  memory of President George Herbert Walker Bush, whose funeral we  attended today.   Losing a parent or a grandparent is never easy. I know I speak for  the people in Louisiana when I offer my heartfelt sympathies to the  entire Bush family in their time of grief. I want them to know their  loss echoes in the hearts of all Americans this week. I also want them  to know their family is in our thoughts and in our prayers as we mourn  together.   At an age when most kids are trying to figure out what kind of smart  phones they want to buy, President George H.W. Bush thought of nothing  except answering the call of duty. He really was a part of the  ``greatest generation.'' I believe he was a hero and a patriot, not  because he made the choices that he made to fight for his country but  because he got up and continued to make the choice to serve the  American people every single day of his life as a Navy aviator, as a  Congressman, as an Ambassador, as CIA Director, as Vice President of  the United States, and, ultimately, as Commander in Chief.    President Bush, very simply, was a great American, not just because  he served his country during some of the darkest days in world  history--although he did, and he did courageously--but because he  embodied so many of the values that distinguish the American spirit.  Traits like bravery, selflessness, faith, and kindness are things we  don't have enough of in the village of Washington anymore and seem to  be in short supply, but President Bush had them in spades. He was smart  as a whip. He was a patriot, but he was also a person who deeply  believed in the importance of working together to try to build a better  world.   Upon leaving office, President Bush started the Points of Light  foundation. Points of Light is a charity whose mission is based on a  fairly simple premise--that there is nothing more transformative than  an individual's choosing to be generous with his or her time, gifts,  and talents. This idea has resonated with millions of Americans across  the world.   Since its founding in 1990, Points of Light has electrified the  American spirit of volunteerism, and each year the foundation supports  more than 20 million hours of community service--what an extraordinary  legacy.   President Bush understood that at its core public service is about-- this is going to sound strange--loving your neighbor. The Points of  Light foundation is a fitting legacy for this fine American who loved  his country and his family to the fullest, and he devoted every day of  his life to serving all 350 million of his neighbors. Without a doubt,  he was one of the brightest of those thousand points of light, and our  loss is Heaven's gain.   A smart person once told me that people don't really care how much  you know until they know how much you care. President George Herbert  Walker Bush knew a lot, but he cared a lot too.   America weeps, both in joy for his life and in sadness because his  soul is in a better place but not with us. America and the world have  lost a favorite son.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I want to take a moment to honor  an American hero and a fellow Louisianan. In just a few days, Charles  Davis, from Toledo Bend Lake, LA, will celebrate his 93rd birthday.  Charles is a World War II veteran who gave many years of his life in  the service of his country.   Charles Davis was 16 years old when Pearl Harbor was bombed. Like  many Americans, the attack on Pearl Harbor led Davis to serve his  country by enlisting in the Navy. While just a teenager, his service in  the military took him around the globe, fighting for the country he  loves.   During his time in the war, Charles served on a ship that was bombed  while out at sea. He spent 37 hours adrift alongside 1,200 soldiers,  with nothing to keep them alive other than their life vests. Charles  thought he was going to die that day, but after 37 hours in the ocean,  he was rescued. Nearly 300 of the men in the water with him did not  make it. Among the men who died that day was another American hero,  Charles's brother, Albert Anthony Davis.   Charles served in the military for 8 years and after the war returned  to Louisiana to serve as a firefighter. As Charles celebrates his 93rd  birthday, I want to honor his life and dedication to his country. He  risked his life in service to his country and lost a brother and many  comrades during the war.   Mr. Davis, we are grateful for your service, and I would like to wish  you a very happy birthday and many blessings in the years to  come.                            ____________________
