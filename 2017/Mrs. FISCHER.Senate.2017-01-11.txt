 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 184.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.   The bill clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Nebraska [Mrs. Fischer] proposes an       amendment numbered 184.    The amendment is as follows:     (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to     strengthening Social Security or health care for women, which may     include strengthening community health centers, and repealing and                            replacing Obamacare)         At the appropriate place, add the following:       SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO SOCIAL                     SECURITY OR WOMEN'S HEALTH.         The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate       may revise the allocations of a committee or committees,       aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution       for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments,       amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference       reports, relating to strengthening Social Security or health       care for women, which may include strengthening community       health centers, and repealing and replacing the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act, by the amounts provided       in such legislation for those purposes, provided that such       legislation would not increase the deficit over either the       period of the total of fiscal years 2017 through 2021 or the       period of the total of fiscal years 2017 through 2026.     Mr. President, this amendment would strengthen  community health centers across this country. In Nebraska we have 7  federally qualified health centers and 40 clinic sites that have served  over 75,000 people. These centers provide quality personalized health  care that women need and deserve.   Last year I had the opportunity to visit one of these in Omaha, the  Charles Drew Medical Clinic. I saw firsthand the comprehensive,  compassionate care that they provide to Nebraskans. Many times, women  are the ones who make health care decisions for their families, but  with higher costs and fewer choices, ObamaCare has hurt, not helped,  women in this country.   They have seen their premiums go up, they have had a hard time  finding the doctors that they trust, and they have had to sign up for  plans that they don't like. With this amendment, we can alleviate this  frustration. We can help ensure that they receive quality care in their  communities surrounded by a support system. It would strengthen women's  health. It would help take care of our families, our neighbors, and our  friends.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of my  amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.
