 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri  for giving me such latitude.   $55 billion that we don't have, folks. 42 billion, goes into this  new--the reauthorization of the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. Another  $13 billion going to target business owners who have less than 200  employees.   I know that there are restaurant owners and small business owners in  the United States who are looking for relief every single day. They are  trying to find a way to make ends meet.   How do I know this? Because in the beginning of my career, a lot of  what I did was analyze the very business owners who are struggling in  today's economy. And in today's economy, they are struggling for a  myriad of reasons.   Number one, our energy prices. When the price of oil shoots up so  drastically, it impacts transportation; it impacts how they get the  material that they sell in their stores every single day.   Wage inflation, which is completely out of control in the United  States. When wages go up, the costs of doing business goes up, no  matter what any politician on Capitol Hill says.   So throwing more money at this situation, especially money that has  never been appropriated; money that is going to come out of thin air,  is not going to make matters better for small business owners; it is  going to make them worse.   The ranking member on the Small Business Committee, the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), has a bill, the ENTREE Act, that  reauthorizes funds that have already been appropriated to be used to  help small business owners who were caught in this lurch; money that  they could use. It is paid for.   It will not put more dollars in circulation, which is one of the key  issues we are having in our economy with respect to the inflation that  is stifling small business. It is stifling working families. It  is stifling seniors who are on fixed incomes.    But it is more than just money coming from Capitol Hill. It is the  economic policy coming from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.   When you have massive amounts of regulations that small business  owners must comply with, two things occur: They spend more time devoted  to compliance, or they go out of business. Or, I am sorry, there is a  third; or they sell to a larger business.   We want small business owners to thrive in the United States. We need  them to thrive in the United States. But it is not just money, folks.  It is the rules that we force them to comply with.   And the last part--I started with energy; I am going to end with  energy.  [[Page H4409]]    When energy costs go up in the United States, when they go up  recklessly and willfully because of terrible economic and energy policy  from the President of the United States, the lifeblood of our economy,  which is small business, are the ones who feel it the most. They are  the ones who are affected. They are the ones who struggle with it. They  are the ones that can't get the materials they need. They are the ones  whose workers are struggling to figure out how to get to work because  gas is now $4.20 a gallon versus $2.20 a gallon.   We have to take a serious look about what we are doing from a  complete economic perspective here on Capitol Hill.   And it is not just about new money. New money sounds good. Everybody  likes getting new money. But new money rarely is the thing that fixes  the problem. What really fixes the problem are sound policies that  address our entire business economy, so that everybody can thrive.   What really makes sense is having a sound and sensible energy  policy--where you have cheap and affordable, whether it is renewable,  or whether it is fossil fuels--that people can rely on. That is the  lifeblood of every economy.   And if we could ever get that stuff right, we might have enough sense  on Capitol Hill to actually handle our spending problems.                                time  1000    If we can't get basic economics right, it is no wonder that Capitol  Hill always spends far more than it possibly takes in.   We have a measure to actually help small business owners right now.  It is called the ENTREE Act. Small business owners will get the help  that they need. It will work. It will actually help us stop being  reckless with money we don't have, which we, frankly, are borrowing  from the revenues that small business owners have to pay in the future  that they haven't even earned yet.   Don't pass this bill. It is not necessary. It is only more of the  same. It is more of the problem. It is more inflation. It is the  destruction of more purchasing power of the American people.   We must say ``no'' today. We need to reverse course in the United  States.
