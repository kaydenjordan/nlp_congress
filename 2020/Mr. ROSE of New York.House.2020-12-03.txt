 Mr. Speaker, this may be the last time I get to  address this hallowed Chamber, and for that I am grateful for this  opportunity.   I want to start by thanking my staff. It may come as a surprise to  some of my colleagues, as well as the press, but I do have some flaws.  My staff worked with me for 2 years--some of them even longer--and  together we--not me, we--accomplished an extraordinary amount for the  great people of southern Brooklyn and Staten Island.   As I leave to pursue new adventures, I want to depart, though, with a  few words of optimism for our great country, as well as a warning.   We live in a tough time for truth, and it is causing faith in our  government to corrode. There is not a person in this Chamber who thinks  the American people trust us. There is not a person sitting here right  now who thinks the American people believe in our government.   This didn't happen overnight. It was death by a thousand  disappointments, a thousand scandals, and a thousand lives broken by  politicians who mock a virus until it kills their neighbor; who carve  us up into blue States and red States, yet have the nerve to question  someone else's patriotism; who saw no problem whatsoever giving a  trillion-dollar tax cut to Big Pharma and companies that are killing  our planet, but then they clutch their pearls when we say we want to be  there for poor people and when we say we want to be there for the most  vulnerable.   During my few years in politics, I have seen how we can beat back  this festering cynicism: when we fight like hell for what is right,  especially for those who need us most, when we bring converts to our  side by promoting truth where there is injustice, and by appealing to  common sense and--God forbid--humanity.   I have seen constituents who thought their government was there only  to screw them over; begin to hope that maybe that wasn't the case when  we passed the Victim Compensation Fund; and when we cut through the red  tape to finally begin the construction of the East Shore Seawall, the  largest resiliency project in New York City history. I saw it when we  reunited families torn apart by the racist Muslim ban and when we  secured millions to combat the opioid epidemic.   In retrospect, those were the good days.   Then there were days when it felt like our politics was absolutely  irredeemable, when a peaceful march for justice in my community was  used as a weapon to tell my constituents that it is impossible to  believe that Black Lives Matter while also believing that the vast  majority of police officers are heroes. Those marchers were called  thugs and they were called rioters just for believing that peaceful  protests could change this country. The public was told that their  movement was dangerous and not something you should listen to but  something you should be afraid of. Yet for those who saw it with their  own eyes, the truth cut through all those smears.   I remember being outside of a supermarket. It was raining, and I was  miserable. An off-duty police officer came up to talk to me. He assured  me he was no Democrat, but he had been working that day of the march.  He had been skeptical, but those young men and women changed his mind,  and he was proud of them. That officer saw past the lies and past the  differences others have used to divide us. He witnessed his fellow  Americans in pain, and for him it changed everything. In typical Staten  Island fashion, though, right after, he told me he wasn't going to vote  for me and that I was going to lose for a thousand other reasons.   But conversations like that refreshed my memory and my faith that  this country can one day live up to its promise. We can put the  government back on the side of working people from New York City to  Washington, D.C., and everywhere in between.   That is the America we know is possible: One where, in the face of  unimaginable vitriol, we don't hate back; in the face of unimaginable  adversity, we don't give up fighting until it doesn't matter what you  look like and where you come from, but in this country you can  accomplish your dreams--a safe America, a just America, our America.   In light of recent electoral results, some have begun to wonder if  Democrats should soft-pedal the fight for equal justice, if they should  take a step back from fighting for economic security or even just give  up. I am here to say absolutely not. This cannot wait. Justice cannot  wait. If you aren't willing to risk everything to build a better  country, then you do not belong here in the first place.   Mr. Speaker, to close, representing Staten Island and south Brooklyn  has been the honor of my life. On behalf of Leigh, Miles, and myself, I  thank the people of the 11th Congressional District for this  extraordinary privilege. I am not sure what life has in store for us,  but I will be on the front lines making sure our city and our country  live up to its promise.   May God bless my colleagues with the strength to do what is right,  and may God bless this great country.                            ____________________
