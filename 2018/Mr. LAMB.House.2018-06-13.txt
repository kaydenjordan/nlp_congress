 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support  H.R. 5891, a bill I introduced with my Republican colleague, Mr.  Grothman, and I thank Mr. Grothman and Ranking Member Bonamici for  their efforts.   This bill is part of the fight against opioids. It creates an  interagency task force to study how we can take the work that these  government agencies are doing and do it even better.   We have to do it better for the families that are affected, and I  think the range of bills we are talking about today recognizes that. I  thank my Republican colleagues for focussing on that because the  mothers, the fathers, the brothers, and the sisters who have been left  behind, they are our first line of defense, and they need our support.   Mr. Speaker, heroin and opioid addiction is a full-blown crisis in  western Pennsylvania. It is a disease that does not discriminate.  People with money, people without money, people of all races, everyone  has been affected, and our people are dying every single day. An entire  generation of Americans, which is my generation, will have a huge hole  in it where our brothers and our sisters should have been.    Last year, we lost more than 60,000 Americans to the disease of drug  addiction, and they left behind more than 60,000 families. For too  long, those families have carried too heavy of a burden with too little  support from our government. I can tell you about the first one of  these families I met.   When I was a prosecutor investigating the death of their son, I met a  family whose son reminded me of so many young men that I served in the  Marines with. He was in his twenties. He was a hard worker. He was  prescribed prescription drugs for an injury that he got on the job. He  worked in the natural gas fields. He became addicted to opioids, and he  survived three different drug overdoses.   His family kept him alive. They rescued him from the side of the road  when he had been in a car with other drug addicts who threw him out  when he started to overdose. They fought for years to get him into  treatment and finally got him into a 30-day treatment program, where he  went and succeeded.  [[Page H5129]]    On the 31st day, that young man was released too soon, and his mother  was in a near fatal car accident the same day. He spent the day staring  at her in the ICU, and, no surprise, returned to heroin that same night  and passed away the next morning.   That man should still be with us today.   He was discovered by his grandfather and by his brother, and that  family will think about him and be asking forever what more they could  have done.   I have met them. I sat across from the father who cried in front of  me and asked what else he could have done. The fact is that they are  doing what they can, and if we, as a government, are going to ask them  to do everything they can, we have to ask the same of ourselves. We  have to have their back.   H.R. 5891 is a positive step forward. That is what this is for.   If this were any foreign military threat, we would study it in  detail. We would proceed strategically with great discipline and in a  bipartisan way, and that is what we are doing here.   This bill requires Federal agencies to do something that they don't  always do on their own, which is talk to each other and to put families  first. It also requires them to go listen to the people who are already  working most closely with these families--nurses, doctors, teachers,  therapists--so that we can use their testimony to make sure that this  task force produces results and not just a report. That is something we  have seen so far in western Pennsylvania.                                time  1530    Our former U.S. attorney, David Hickton, led a local working group  and task force in the western district of Pennsylvania, which then  became the model for the National Heroin Task Force. Within a couple of  years, they gathered enough data, enough testimony, and enough momentum  that that became the basis for the White House's unprecedented request  for funding to fight this battle. Eventually, this Chamber got together  with the Senate and, in a bipartisan way, passed the 21st Century Cures  Act.   We need to harness that same spirit now. As Ranking Member Bonamici  said, we need to spend more than we spent so far. This is an  existential threat, and we need to treat it that way.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, my colleague, Congressman Grothman, and  I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 5891.
