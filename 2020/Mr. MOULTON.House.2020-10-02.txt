 Mr. Speaker, in response to September 11, President Bush  and this Congress sent soldiers and Marines, like me, across the ocean  to fight against extremism. The terrorists that we fought against used  violence to advance their political agendas and viewed lawmakers here  as their enemies.   QAnon, the proud boys, the boogaloo boys, and other extremist groups  think and operate in similar ways.   But in this case, Americans do not have the luxury of looking across  the ocean at this threat and just hoping and praying that it doesn't  come home.   Members of these groups are American. Politicians have unforgivably  embraced them. Social media platforms legitimize them to an unwitting  public.   Well, I have had enough.   QAnon followers like to say, in their vague, ominous ramblings, that  no one can stop what is coming. That is wrong. We can, and we will.   Do not let the unforgivable mainstream support for these groups raise  doubts about our Nation's resolve in this fight against extremism, that  we will stop what is coming, and then we will build a safer, stronger  America.
