 Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the  Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High School  students as part of the 10th annual ``State of the Union'' essay  contest conducted by my office.   The material follows:              Ethan Mello, Woodstock Union High School, Junior         I believe that the most pressing issue facing our country       today is the issue of affordable healthcare. This issue is       unique to the United States among developed nations, but for       years we have refused to take action. Not only could       switching to a universal healthcare system lower costs, but       could also ensure that, like the rest of the countries in the       modernized world, the US insures all of its citizens as a       human right.        A universal healthcare system is a system where all of the       inhabitants of a country are guaranteed healthcare at no       cost. The government pays for all medical bills, and the       system makes sure that even the poor can be helped when they       get sick. Government paying for healthcare means higher       taxes, but no deductible costs. This system is a staple in       most European countries, as well as in Canada. The US is one       of the only major countries to not yet adopt this system. In       fact, out of the 33 developed countries recognized by The       Balance financial website, 32 have universal healthcare. The       UN has accepted universal healthcare as the best choice for       countries, and has a goal of worldwide universal healthcare       coverage by 2030. If the US keeps its current healthcare       system, they are unlikely to meet this goal.        In our country the healthcare system is structured so that       private companies provide insurance. However, his insurance       often doesn't encompass drug prices or certain other costs,       and is not affordable by the poor. The US has a Medicaid       system for some low income citizens, but this program does       not apply to everyone who is unable to consistently pay for       healthcare this has led to over 30 million Americans choosing       not to purchase healthcare, a dangerous choice if they get       sick or need emergency operations. Our system also allows       insurance companies to jack up prices to make profit, and       allows prescription drug companies to charge outrageous       amounts for cheap pills. The US had the highest insurance       costs relative to GDP in the world. This cost has not made       our life expectancy better either, as in that respect we are       still worse off than we should be as the most powerful       country in the world.        Universal healthcare has proven very effective when it has       been used in other countries. Universal healthcare lowers       healthcare costs, and eliminates administrative costs due to       the fact that it is completely run by one entity, the       government. In the United States this lower cost of       healthcare could not only boost the economy, but also allow       for more social mobility for the lower class, and less       earnings for the billionaire drug company executives.        Changing the healthcare system of the United States to       universal healthcare will not be an easy task, but it is one       that is necessary for the good of our country as well as the       people in it. In the next election, we need to ensure we       elect politicians who not only support universal healthcare,       but are willing to fight for it.                Salama Mbilizi, Winooski High School, Senior         ``Why should we study for a future that is being taken away       from us? We demand a safe future is that really too much to       ask?'' asks climate activist Greta Thunberg. This young       Swedish environmentalist has gained international attention       for her concerns about climate change.        I am a girl from Africa who came to the U.S. as a refugee       and I don't want to become a ``climate refugee,'' like people       in California who have lost homes due to fire. Climate change       first created droughts in California, which lasted over a       decade according to Climate Central. There is an 80 percent       chance of a multi-decade-long drought by 2100.        Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, cause       climate change. Exhaust gases from cars, uncontrolled factory       releases, burning of low-quality coal for heating, even       airplanes and ships create air pollution. We should reduce       the use of oil and gas, and use alternative energy sources       such as wind and solar power.        The government should start investing more in public       transportation, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions       because fewer people will have to drive and we can reduce air       pollution. According to Energy News Network, ``Public transit       produces significantly less air pollution per passenger mile       than a standard car carrying a single driver. Buses emit 20%       less carbon monoxide, 10% as much hydrocarbons, and 75% as       much nitrogen oxides per passenger mile than an automobile       with a single occupant.'' Smarter public transportation will       increase ridership, cut the number of cars on the road,       reduce traffic, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. We could       also recycle more plastics and stop cutting down forests.       Unless we change our behaviors, global warming will continue       and we will continue to experience weather extremes, forest       fires, and massive pollution.        When 195 nations met in 2015, they agreed to reduce       greenhouse gas emissions as part of the landmark Paris       Agreement. The United States later backed out of that       agreement but states and cities are still interested. I call       on Congress to pass and support legislation to help our       environment by honoring the Paris Agreement!        I have a personal interest because climate change affects       my life as well as our planet. If we don't change our       behavior, we will suffer and some of us will die. Already,       animals are going extinct at an alarming rate, reducing the       balance in our world and the quality of our life.        Scientists say that if we don't stop pollution and       greenhouse gases, Earth will be here for only a few hundred       years. But if we can reduce greenhouse gases, Earth can       remain okay for a million more years. Think about what will       happen to us, your children and grandchildren. I want to be       here for as many years as I can, enjoying this world I live       in.                 Patrick Meskill, Essex High School, Junior                            Vaccines Cause Adults         The law dictates a child as property until the age of 18.       While this is usually for the good of the child, what does it       mean for the fate of children with misinformed parents? Anti-      vax is a deadly philosophy of being against vaccinations, a       philosophy that gets children killed. While yes, children are       protected from abuse and neglect under Child Protective       Services, there is no law to protect them from their own       parent's ideas. Parent's can avoid federally required       vaccines under religious or superstitious reasons in 45 of       the 50 states (NCSL). However, when the safety of the public       is at stake, the anti-vax culture becomes a truly worldwide       epidemic.        The confusion comes from a defrocked former doctor, Andrew       Wakefield, who first proposed the vaccine/autism connection       (Ruth). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did an inquiry       in 2001 to address the  [[Page S4215]]       accusations, and found no connection to autism in vaccines.       Another complaint isolated the mercury in vaccines. Vaccines       contain small amounts of mercury to form thimerosal, a       preservative. These small amounts aren't any more than the       amount in 3 ounces of tuna fish. Nonetheless, the FDA       attempted lowering the amount of mercury in vaccines, but       still saw no relief in rising autism numbers. In 2004, 10 out       of the 13 authors on Wakefield's paper retracted their       hypothesis (Mayor). Then in 2010, the medical journal ``The       Lancet'' retracted Wakefield's paper, calling several       elements incorrect. America can now agree vaccines should be       made mandatory (Dyer).        Medical marvels have continued to raise humanity to higher       levels of immunity, causing fatal diseases to go nearly       extinct. These include measles, mumps, rubella, polio,       chickenpox, and smallpox. However, they still remain only       ``nearly extinct.'' Modern day preventable diseases have yet       to fade from America due to anti-vax. One study performed in       1982, watched 25 vaccinated and 25 unvaccinated children for       the first 5 years of their lives. The result? One vaccinated       child had mild measles but didn't die, while the unvaccinated       children saw 14 deaths by measles and one of tetanus (Epoke).       The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that       2018 has had more measles outbreaks than any year this       decade, and they typically start in unvaccinated groups       (CDC).        Vaccines should be mandatory. Schools have begun to act on       this already by requiring their students to be vaccinated to       attend. In Australia, parents will be charged every 2 weeks       A$28 (roughly 20 USD) for having unvaccinated children, per       child (Pasha-Robinson). These laws are something that should       be present in the United States. The flu shot is already       absolutely free with most health insurances, showing how       recommended it is. This science has been around for a long       time, and only recently, thanks to the internet's easily       accessible misinformation, has it been verbally contested. We       must make vaccines mandatory to protect our country from       preventable diseases. Yours or someone else's life may depend       on it.                            ____________________
