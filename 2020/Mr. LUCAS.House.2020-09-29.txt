 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last week when the House considered the massive Clean  Economy Jobs and Innovation Act, I expressed my disappointment with the  partisan policies in the bill, with the rushed and irresponsible  process of writing it, and, most of all, with the sheer number of  missed bipartisan legislative opportunities it represents.   This week, I am glad to see that my friends across the aisle have  taken heed of those words.   The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology has one of the best  track records in Congress for passing productive, bipartisan  legislation, and I am pleased to see us upholding that tradition once  again.   H.R. 5760, the Grid Security Research and Development Act is a truly  bipartisan Committee on Science, Space, and Technology product. It is  sponsored by vice-chairman Ami Bera and Energy subcommittee Ranking  Member Randy Weber. It has gone through regular order, and is the  result of thoughtful consideration, careful analysis, and substantial  debate. I support its passage today.   Currently, the U.S. energy sector and its aging electrical grid faces  many critical challenges, like higher demand, vulnerability to  cyberattacks, and increased integration of new energy sources. It is  our job in Congress to set the priorities to meet these challenges and  to focus our limited Federal funds where we can see the best return on  investment.   To deliver effective solutions, we must take the long-term and big- picture approach. We must support early-stage research that will spur  innovation over a broad range of energy applications and provide for  R&D to mobilize and defend our critical energy infrastructure.   The bipartisan Grid Security Research and Development Act will  strengthen our Nation's electric grid against rapidly changing  technological challenges. It authorizes the Department of Energy's  vital cybersecurity and emergency response R&D activities and directs  DOE to work with relevant Federal agencies to develop cybersecurity  best practices.   Through the committee markup process, we were able to improve this  legislation by adding key research infrastructure provisions from my  legislation, H.R. 5685, the Securing American Leadership in Science and  Technology Act.   This provision requires the Secretary to carry out a program of  research, development, and a demonstration of technologies and tools to  help ensure the resilience and security of critical integrated grid  infrastructures.   It also requires the Secretary to establish and operate a critical  infrastructure test facility that allows for both physical and cyber  performance testing to be conducted on large-scale infrastructure  systems. This test facility will amplify and accelerate the high- priority research and development activities authorized in the original  text and maximize the return on investment of taxpayers' dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my good  friends across the aisle for working with us to come to agreement on  this provision and on this bill. I am glad to see we can come together  to focus on our shared interest in improving U.S. national security and  energy resilience for the next generation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Weber), the ranking member of the Energy Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we must invest in the long-term, early-stage research  that will strengthen our energy infrastructure against a range of  emerging threats.   The Department of Energy is uniquely qualified to lead this endeavor,  and the partnerships that exist between its national laboratory  systems, universities, and industry has the potential to modernize and  transform U.S. energy delivery systems.   H.R. 5760 authorizes the advanced grid security R&D activities that  will make the future U.S. electrical grid reliable, resilient, and  secure for all Americans.   I, again, thank my friends across the aisle for working with us on  this bill. We need to come together and have serious conversations  about how to make real progress on next-generation energy issues. I am  glad to see us doing that today.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                                time  1700
