 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of Dr. Don Beach, who left a lasting impression on everyone  that had the privilege to know him.   Dr. Beach dedicated his life to education. His love for the classroom  began with teaching science and biology to high school and elementary  school students. In 1981, after 8 years at UT Arlington, Dr. Beach  joined Tarleton State University as the dean of the School of Education  and Fine Arts, but he could not be kept out of the classroom, later  returning to full-time teaching as the professor of educational  leadership.   Today, we are joined by doctoral students from Tarleton State  University here on their annual education doctoral trip, originally  created by Dr. Beach. His dedication and guidance have inspired the  students sitting here today who deeply mourn his absence.   Dr. Beach is remembered by many of us as one of the most impactful  faculty members in Tarleton history. His contributions to Tarleton,  both as a faculty member and as a mentor, will never be forgotten.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
