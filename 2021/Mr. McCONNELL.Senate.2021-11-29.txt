 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today's Democratic Party does not  make the policy decisions of a party that is serious about protecting  our country.   In May, President Biden released a budget proposal that proposed a de  facto cut in defense spending, and that was before the President's own  supercharged inflation further cut the purchasing power of every  defense dollar.   In August, his botched Afghanistan retreat shattered our allies'  trust and delighted the terrorists. In 10 months in office, despite  naive happy talk from the administration, the threats we face are  markedly worse. The vacuum they left in Afghanistan has emboldened  terrorists, from Iran's militias in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen to the  highest ranks of the Taliban's government.   Their desperation to return to a failed nuclear deal has given Iran  the upper hand in negotiations.   For 4 years, my colleague the Democratic leader seemed constantly  focused on Putin and Russia. But now, with Putin flaunting his power  and Russia engaged in ongoing cyber attacks, weapons tests, and troop  buildups? Crickets.   And for all their talk about China's threat, we have seen no evidence  that Democrats intend for the United States to keep pace with the PLA's  investments in nuclear and hypersonic weapons.   The bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission has made clear  that we cannot shortchange our military modernization and have a prayer  of competing with the People's Republic of China or even the declining  but dangerous Russian Republic.   Our colleagues across the aisle have missed one opportunity after  another to right the ship. They have used the reconciliation process to  pass trillions in new partisan spending without a cent for defending  the Nation.   And despite the strong bipartisan work of our colleagues on the Armed  Services Committee, the Democratic leader kept this year's Defense  authorization bill in limbo literally for months and now wants to block  the Senate from a real debate and a real amendment process.  [[Page S8769]]    Debating the right way to confront Russian threats to America and our  allies and equip our friends in Ukraine is certainly worth the Senate's  time. Putin is massing tens of thousands of troops on Ukraine's border,  but the Democratic leader is trying to block a debate about responding  to Russian aggression? It makes no sense.   Considering sanctions on the pipeline that fuels Putin's encroachment  over Europe--including provisions from Senator Risch that closely  mirror language that the House added unanimously--is certainly worth  the Senate's time. Setting the record straight on our resolve to  maintain a strong and credible nuclear deterrent that can check the  worst impulses of our adversaries is also worth the Senate's time.   Yet, once again, the Democratic leader seems to want to put national  security last. My colleague is trying to overcorrect for poor planning  by cramming a 2-week bill into 2 or 3 days' time. I imagine there might  be finger-pointing at the Republicans if that proves impossible.   So nothing less than the safety of the American people is at stake.  This is more important than political timetables or partisan wish  lists. So if the Democratic leader insists on forcing a cloture vote  later today, I will oppose cutting off these important debates  prematurely when they have really just begun.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on a related matter, why do our  Democratic colleagues want to shortchange our national defense? Well,  to free up their time and attention for another massive, reckless  taxing-and-spending spree, a radical wish list that would hurt American  families and help China.   Working families are already getting slammed by runaway costs because  the Democrats' last massive spending spree drove up inflation. Gas  prices are up about 50 percent, used car prices are up more than 25  percent, and grocery prices across practically every category are up  significantly over this time last year.   But, in response, Washington Democrats want to print, borrow, and  spend trillions more. Even if you accept all their budget gimmicks at  face value, this bill alone would unleash $800 billion in not-paid-for  spending in the next 5 years. Years 5 through 10 are when their  crushing tax hikes and phony accounting would actually begin to kick  in. But even then the bill is not paid for.   President Biden promised Americans over and over that this  legislation would cost zero dollars. Obviously, that is false. The  Congressional Budget Office says that after 10 years, after their tax  hikes and fake offsets are factored in, their spree would still add up  to $367 billion and add that all to the deficit.   President Biden said the deficit impact would be zero. In reality, it  is hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.   President Biden promised Americans something else too. He said he  would never raise taxes on the middle class. People earning less than  $400,000 per year were not to pay a penny more. He has completely  broken this promise as well.   Among the $1.5 trillion in job-killing tax increases are new burdens  for small businesses, family farms, and direct hikes on middle-class  families earning less than six figures. Meanwhile, amazingly, Democrats  did find room in their plan to include $300 billion in tax cuts for the  wealthiest blue-State ZIP codes in New York and California. Our  colleagues want to pretend they are launching another New Deal. Yet one  of the biggest components is a direct cash giveaway to their richest  constituents.   So the cost of this spending spree would be astronomical, and the  massive tax hikes that would only partly pay for it would literally  crush an already fragile economy.   Well, what about the content of the liberal wish list? If Democrats  get to steal the American people's credit card for this historic  spending spree, what would our citizens even get to unwrap?   Well, there would be massive government giveaways to supposedly green  initiatives, giving rise to a whole new generation of waste and abuse  like Solyndra.   There would be a gigantic slush fund so that HHS Secretary Becerra,  the culture warrior who sued Catholic nuns, could take over daycare and  prekindergarten across America. He would be in charge of subsidizing  certain kinds of private family choices but not others and tilting the  playing field against faith-based childcare.   There would be a continuation of inflationary welfare payments that  Washington is sending out with zero work requirements whatsoever, and  illegal immigrants would get the money as well. Oh, and, as we speak,  Senate Democrats are still trying desperately behind the scenes to get  sweeping amnesty included in the bill as well.   So it goes on and on like this, a hodgepodge catalog that is built to  satisfy the demands of activists, not the needs of families. If you ask  any working-class or middle-class American family for their top  concerns, you aren't going to hear many people pining for massive tax  hikes, electric car charging stations, and woke bureaucrats getting  control of their kids' early childhoods.   My colleagues across the aisle seem determined to spend the weeks  ahead on ways to waste Americans' money while making Americans'  problems even worse. So let's hope enough of our Democratic colleagues  step back, take stock, do the responsible thing, and kill this bill.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
