 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my  colleague from California, Congressman Correa, for leading this  important discussion.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to reiterate my alarm about the child abuse at  the border.   Due either to complete incompetence, deliberate indifference, or  both, this administration failed to fully comply with one of the first  court-ordered deadlines to reunite innocent children with their parents  from whom they were separated.   The Trump administration failed to implement an effective system for  identifying and reconnecting children with their parents before  executing its family separation policy. As a result, they have been  unable to accurately report the number of children in their custody,  the location of each child, and the immigration status of the parents,  many of whom who have already been deported.   Adding insult to injury, it was recently revealed that one of the  detained children under the age of 5 may actually be an American  citizen. Such a mistake should never happen and should shock every  American to their core.   This is a despicable humanitarian crisis created by Donald Trump, and  one which the Trump administration has shown no ability to solve.   Despite the President's attempt to divert attention from the crisis,  thousands of children remain separated from their families. This is a  national disgrace. Every parent, every grandparent, and every patriotic  American should be appalled by the harm that this President has  inflicted on children.   We must all exercise our First Amendment right to speak out against  this unconscionable family separation crisis. I urge my colleagues in  Congress to make every effort to ensure that these children are  reconnected with their parents. If the crisis proves impossible for the  administration to fully solve, Congress must hold accountable those who  are responsible.
