 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment No. 71.   Mr. Chair, for 60 years, the federally imposed perimeter rule has  limited access and increased costs for Americans flying into  Washington's Reagan Airport.   My amendment is simple. It adds seven new routes, one for each  airline currently operating out of DCA, while preserving all existing  flight routes.   Congress is long overdue to modernize this arbitrary, protectionist  Federal policy put in place for the economic protection of one airport  and one airline.   Deliberate misinformation has been circulating wildly among my  colleagues, and I want to be clear: Our effort is not about benefiting  one airport, one airline, or any one Member of Congress. It is about  empowering American consumers by providing more options and greater  convenience for people traveling to and from Washington, D.C.   For those who have benefited from the monopoly created by the  perimeter rule 60 years ago, the message is clear: America, your  choices will remain limited and your ticket prices will remain high.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment  to help DCA fly into the 21st century.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Cuellar).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Castro).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Moore).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
