 Mr. President, I wish to talk a little bit about  election security, but on a day like today, I have to at least mention  where we are with the giant omnibus bill that got dropped on us last  night at about 8:30--about 2,300 pages of legislative text--to try to  deal with all of government spending, all of discretionary spending.   If people don't know what an omnibus is, it is where we are supposed  to pass 12 individuals bills dealing with 12 different topics of our  spending. An omnibus is when you take all 12 of those and just do it at  once. It is supposed to be the exception to the rule, but for the last  17 years, we have done some version of an omnibus. Today's vote will be  the 18th.   We have 2,300 pages with technical legislative language and less than  24 hours to be able to go through it. There is no way to be able to  discover what all is in it.   There is another historic event that has happened this past week, as  well, which I think connects to this omnibus. Last Friday, the Treasury  Department announced that we just crossed over $21 trillion in total  debt--$21 trillion.   I have had some folks who have caught me and said: Now that we have  gone over $21 trillion and it looks like we could be rapidly  approaching $1 trillion of deficit this year alone--which would mean  that in the next 12 to 14 months, we will go from $21 trillion to $22  trillion in total debt--gosh, that looks terrible. It has to be this  Republican tax plan that is causing it. Well, there will probably be  some deficit spending with the Republican tax plan that went in because  it will take a couple of years for the income to be able to accelerate  with it, but this omnibus alone is $300 billion of additional  spending--just this, $300 billion.   So we go up to over $600 billion in deficit spending this past year,  and this omnibus will add another $300 billion to that. The disaster  relief funding that was done this year was $140 billion on top of that,  and the interest payment increase--just the increase--from last year to  this year was $54 billion.   It is not just some Republican tax plan that made this change. This  is a very rapid acceleration in overspending that is happening right in  front of our eyes, and the omnibus is not slowing it down. It is  accelerating it. We have to change how we are doing budgeting and the  trajectory that we face.   There are 16 of us who have started meeting last month--8 Democrats  and 8 Republicans, half from the House and half from the Senate--to  evaluate how we do budgeting.   The 1974 Congressional Budget Act that we are currently operating  under created this incredibly complicated system that has not worked in  a decade. Every year we come up and try to do it again, and every year  we end up with some omnibus package, and none of us has an amendment.  None of us has an opportunity to be able to see it, read it, or go  through it. It is just this: Here is the number. There it is. Vote for  it or not.   We have to be able to fix that process. There is no long-term  strategy. There is no regular order. There is no opportunity to be able  to make changes. There is no plan.   My hope is that by the end of the year, this bipartisan group will  have the opportunity to be able to present a different way of doing  budgeting. That is not trying to be partisan but just to be able to put  a neutral process in place in which we can actually be strategic about  where we are going, because we are accidentally stumbling into more and  more debt every single month, and it will happen again today.                              Election Security    Mr. President, I wish to chat with this body a little bit about  election security. Just to give a quick update, as many of you know,  the Department of Homeland Security has been actively engaged in trying  to fix what they can on election security leading up to the 2018 time  period.   I have absolutely zero doubt that the Russians tried to meddle in our  elections in 2016. They started in 2014 trying to strategically plan  for how they were going to try to interfere in our elections--the  social media, the false news, and as many different ways as they can to  be able to get out information and misinformation. They started the  process early. Quite frankly, they planned and executed well. They  exposed a weakness in our system.   We are an open society that is exceptionally trusting of each other,  and we are not used to having a foreign entity try to reach in and try  to influence us like that.   What the Russians exposed in 2016, we should be well able to push  back against in 2018 and 2020 and not be caught off guard again. The  Russians reached in and scammed multiple States in their election  systems. They were looking at voter rolls, trying to figure out if they  could get access to those. Now, they can't change votes by just looking  at voter registrations, but if they could look at and download those  files, they could also change those files, edit names, edit addresses,  and then, suddenly, when people show up to vote, they are not really  registered anymore or they are registered at a different precinct. They  could create chaos on election day just by going in and editing those  names. They could go into the unofficial results websites of  secretaries of State and during the  [[Page S1914]]  day of the election actually start putting up false election results or  changing algorithms and numbers, so that when numbers are added, they  are actually counted wrong, just to create uncertainty in the process.  So when the actual election day comes, the unofficial results come out,  and they are not reliable and everyone doubts the system itself.   Again, that doesn't change votes, and it doesn't change outcomes, but  it certainly destabilizes the system. We should be aware of that.   We have multiple States--there are not many, but there are around 10  to 12 States--that cannot audit their elections when Election Day comes  and goes. That means that they are completely counting on the machine  to be able to keep an accurate count. Now, that machine is not attached  to the internet. In fact, there is no State that has their election  equipment attached to the internet on the day of the election, but for  almost every one of them, there is a software update right before the  election. If any entity were to be able to get into any one of the  third-party software companies when the update is done and just put a  bit of software in there that just messes with the machine, you would  literally not know if that election result was reliable or not.   Did that happen last time? No. Were the Russians looking to try to  find different software companies and the different makes and models of  those companies that make our election machines? Yes, and we should  take that as a warning sign. Last time they were looking, and next time  they may be looking to mess with it and change it. We should be well  prepared for that.   We have a piece of legislation. It is a very straightforward piece of  legislation about secure elections. Myself, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala  Harris, Lindsey Graham, and Susan Collins, and most of us who are all  engaged in this one simple issue say: How do we stabilize our elections  system?   Elections are run by States and should be run by States. There is no  reason for us to federalize elections, but the Federal Government  should walk alongside States and say some simple things: We are going  to have quick communication between the States and the Federal  Government. So if a foreign entity is trying to reach into your State  to mess with your system, we can quickly let you know about it, and we  can help you in the process of protecting your State.   The last time this occurred in 2016, it was months before the  Department of Homeland Security was able to actually engage with those  States to let them know that what was really happening was a foreign  actor and to be able to help them with their security. We have to be  faster on that.   We want to be able to streamline that communication. We want to  encourage States, when they buy election equipment or they get election  equipment, that they be able to audit their results on the day of the  elections. The Federal Government should not pick their equipment.  Those States should because it is a State responsibility. But we should  incentivize them to actually lean in and make sure their equipment is  good, because at the end of the day, in a Presidential election, we are  all counting on every other State to make sure their election system is  good. If it is not, it is a problem for all of us.   We want to make sure that there is not only streamlined communication  and that there is not only good and auditable equipment, but that we  actually give classification to individuals so that they can deal with  classified information. That didn't happen last time, and so, again, it  was months before there was any contact back and forth, because the  Federal Government wanted to notify the States of what was happening,  but no one had the clearance to be able to get the information. Let's  fix that.   DHS is in the process of fixing that, but we would like to put in  legislation that just remains, so that in the future, we don't lull  ourselves to sleep again. Last time, it was the Russians. Next time, it  could be the North Koreans. Next time, it could be the Iranians. Next  time, it could be a domestic activist group that is just mad at  somebody for something, and they have learned the vulnerabilities that  the Russians pointed out.   In the days ahead, we need to secure our system for our election. It  is not a partisan issue. It shouldn't be a partisan issue, but it  should be something we learn the lesson on.   We are quickly learning the lessons about our vulnerabilities--cyber  vulnerabilities in our pipelines, in our electric grids, in our phone  systems, in internet fibers, in our election systems, in our banking  systems, and in multiple other areas. We should learn this lesson and  learn it well.   There are people who mean to do us harm. They are not necessarily  going to attack us bodily, but they don't like our growing economy,  they don't like our values, they don't like our openness, and they want  to use our openness against us. We can't imagine doing that to someone  else. They practice doing that to us.   We need to put up a basic guard, and we need to communicate to  nations and nation-states around the world: If you come and attack us,  this is going to be our response, so that they clearly know what they  are facing when they come after us next time.   It happened once. It will happen again. Let's make sure that we are  ready. Let's pass this bill about safe elections and get our elections  secure so that we can trust the results year after year after year, as  we have in the past.   I yield the floor.
