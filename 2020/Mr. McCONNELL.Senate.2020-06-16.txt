 Madam President, this week, like most weeks for a  month and a half now, has brought a study in contrasts to the U.S.  Capitol. Over in the Democratic-led House of Representatives, the  lights are off. The doors are locked. There is nobody home.   With our country facing a once-in-a-century pandemic, a historic  economic disruption, a major discussion of racial justice, and all of  the other important business we were already set to tackle this year  before all of this, the Speaker of the House has mostly kept her  Chamber on the longest running spring break in human history--lots of  talk about supposed priorities but few votes; lots of partisan attacks  leveled at the Republicans from a distance but little action. Over here  in the Senate, the story has been very different. We are holding  hearings. We are legislating. We are confirming nominees. With  precautions, we are manning our posts for the country.   Tomorrow, the Senate will begin considering the President's  nomination of Judge Justin Walker to fill a vacancy on the DC Circuit-- the second most important Federal bench in the country.   As my fellow Kentuckians and I can attest, Judge Walker is exactly  the kind of individual our country deserves  [[Page S2982]]  to have in such a role. He graduated from Duke summa cum laude and then  from Harvard Law magna cum laude. He clerked on the DC Circuit himself  for an impressive young judge named Brett Kavanaugh and then on the  Supreme Court.   He has built a national reputation as a leading academic scholar of  the law. It is no wonder that even the ABA rates him ``well  qualified.'' He has quickly made a name for himself as a district  judge.   A few weeks ago, when the mayor of Louisville tried to cancel drive- in Easter services with disparate restrictions that did not apply  equally to other parking lots, Judge Walker won national attention for  his eloquent defense of religious liberty. This subject becomes more  important by the day. The American people deserve to have strong  respect for their First Amendment rights, including their rights of  religious exercise and conscience, on one of our country's highest  courts. So I look forward to continuing to detail our Kentucky pride  for Judge Walker as this week unfolds, and I will take great pride in  voting to advance his nomination and to confirm him.                            ____________________     Madam President, the Senate will first pass the Great  American Outdoors Act. It will be a big step in the history of our  Nation's public lands and great news for their future.   This bill is the product of a lot of hard work by many of our  colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It has two clear purposes: It  will restore access and function to parks and facilities that have been  neglected, and it will secure a stable flow of resources to support  recreation and conservation well into the future.   I have detailed in recent days just how many Americans rely on our  Nation's public lands--from the guides and outfitters who cater to the  booming outdoor recreation economy; to the hotel workers, restaurant  owners, and gateway communities that welcome hundreds of millions of  annual visitors; to the researchers who study historic sites and unique  habitats; to the hunters, anglers, sportsmen, and American families who  explore millions of acres of open space.   It is clear that a bright economic future for America is intertwined  with this precious resource, so backlogged maintenance and delayed  upkeep are a real problem. Too often, tough budgetary choices have left  important facilities worn down and natural treasures inaccessible. I am  proud that this legislation before us will tackle these critical  missions, but you certainly don't have to take my word for it; you can  look to the list of no fewer than 60 cosponsors on both sides of the  aisle or to the 80 Senators who voted to advance consideration of the  bill last week, or you could sample from the ringing endorsements of an  impressive cross-section of American recreation and conservation  advocates.   Take, for example, the letter the Democratic leader and I received  from the last six former Secretaries of the Interior. Men and women who  served under Presidents of both parties came together to tell us that  ``the Great American Outdoors Act will help ensure a better, brighter  future for nature and for all of us.''   Hundreds of advocacy organizations, from the Sierra Club to the  American Sportfishing Association, also approve. They say the bill  ``will ensure that our parks and other public lands continue to  preserve our nation's heritage and recreation opportunities, and that  local communities and economies . . . will continue to flourish.''   It is not often that we are presented with the opportunity to take  overwhelmingly bipartisan action that will affect a monumental part of  American life for so many years to come, and the opportunity in front  of us this week comes thanks to the dedicated work of several of our  colleagues.   In particular, I would like to thank Senator Daines and Senator  Gardner once again for their extraordinary leadership. I look forward  to seeing their efforts across the finish line, and I urge all Members  to join me in supporting this bill and securing our natural wonders for  generations of Americans yet to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
