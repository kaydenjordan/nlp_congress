 Madam President, for the first time in a long time, we  are bringing appropriations bill to the floor, debating amendments, and  voting on legislation.   Shortly, the Senate will be voting on the first fiscal year 2019  spending bills. I am pleased the Military Construction and Veterans  Affairs and related agencies appropriations bills are part of this  package.   This is a bipartisan bill that funds the critical infrastructure for  our Nation's servicemembers, their families,  [[Page S4359]]  and takes care of America's 20 million veterans. This is a good step in  returning to regular order, with the Senate considering appropriations  legislation in a timely fashion.   We owe thanks to Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy for  providing leadership for the transparent, bipartisan process.   This bill was crafted in a truly open and collegial way. The  subcommittee made thoughtful decisions about how to provide maximum  readiness for the warfighter and prioritize investments to the VA so  they can take care of our veterans.   We took into account the request and preferences of all Members on  both sides of the aisle and balanced it with the administration's  budget submission. Within this framework, we have created a thoughtful  and responsible path forward for both Departments and our related  agencies.   The bill provides $97.1 billion in discretionary spending, which is  $5.1 billion over last year's level. Within that, the Department of  Veterans Affairs has provided a new record level of resources of $86.4  billion in discretionary funding, which is $5 billion over last year's  level and $1.1 billion over the President's request. These resources  will provide healthcare and other important benefits earned by U.S.  servicemembers.   The bill also provides $10.3 billion to support military construction  and family housing needs, a $228 million increase over last year's  level. This will fund a total of 169 military construction projects  that restore warfighter readiness and increase the lethality of our  installations.   A lot of time and energy has gone into putting this legislation  together. I thank my staff, Patrick Magnuson, Jennifer Bastin, Joanne  Hoff, and Carlos Elias, and, of course, Senator Schatz and his staff-- again, both groups working together in a very bipartisan manner,  working hard to address the needs of our servicemembers and our  veterans.   This is a good bill. It was reported out of committee without a  single dissenting vote, and I hope we will have unanimous support when  we vote on final passage. I ask my colleagues to support this bill.   Thank you.   With that, I yield back.    Mr. President, I wish to highlight an incident that  occurred in my home State of Arkansas that has negatively impacted  veterans and their families. A former pathologist at the Fayetteville  VA Medical Center was found to be impaired, was immediately removed  from clinical care, and has since been terminated. A thorough  independent review of all cases read by this pathologist is currently  underway. This review will be handled by entities outside of the  Fayetteville VA Medical Center to include other VA facilities and  academic affiliates. At this time, a small percentage of cases have  been found to be misdiagnosed. In total, 33,000 samples will be  reviewed using a tiered risk prioritization.   In response, I have submitted an amendment cosponsored by the entire  Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma delegation. This amendment would  require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit to the  congressional committees of jurisdiction a Departmental response plan  that can be applied in Fayetteville and in all future incidents and for  recommendations about changes necessary to prevent such incidents in  the future.   I am very concerned with the procedures and policies that allowed  this situation to occur. As the chairman of the Military Construction  and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee and member of the  Senate VA Committee, I am intent on working with the VA to ensure that  we enact policies and put in places procedures to prevent such  misconduct in the future, both here in Fayetteville and around the  country. It is clear that our veterans deserve the best care available,  and it is our duty to ensure the Department of Veterans Affairs is  providing that service. This is an issue that I will continue to  monitor, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
