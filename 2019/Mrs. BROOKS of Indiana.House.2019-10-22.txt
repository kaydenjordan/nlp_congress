 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Indiana  State Trooper Peter R. Stephan, or ``Bo,'' of Lafayette, Indiana, who  paid the ultimate price and sacrificed his life while protecting his  community.   He served with the Indiana State Police Department for 4 years and,  tragically, will never return home to his wife, Jessica, or his 5- month-old daughter.   Two weeks ago, this 27-year-old trooper was on his way to assist  another trooper who had called for assistance. On his way, Trooper  Stephan's car hit a curve and, for unknown reasons, went off the road.  The car rolled at least once and hit a utility pole, and he was  pronounced dead at the scene.   Trooper Stephan is the 44th Indiana State Police trooper to die in  the line of duty. A coworker of his said: ``He did what was right. He  wasn't pushed around by public opinion. If there were 100 people doing  the wrong thing, he would be the one guy doing it right.''   I offer my deepest condolences to his family, the Indiana State  Police Department, all Hoosiers, and all of those officers around our  country who mourn his loss and will forever cherish his memory.   We will never forget.                            ____________________
