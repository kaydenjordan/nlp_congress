 Madam Speaker, I also rise in strong support of this  measure. This is about economic survival on Main Street. This is about  helping our friends and neighbors that have plowed their lifesavings  into a small business.   Just a couple of days ago, I got a phone call from Mr. Antonio  Cagnolo, who has had a restaurant in my neighborhood for dozens of  years. He said: Lou, for 2 years, I have taken every penny that I have  to stay in business. I am at the end of my rope. If I don't get help, I  am out of business, and I am going to lay off dozens and dozens of  workers. Lou, I don't want a handout; I want a hand. I have paid my  taxpayer dollars for years and years, and now I want you, the Federal  Government, to help me stay alive.   I said: Mr. Cagnolo, we are going to be there for you. We will get  you that support.   Folks, today, I ask you to please support this measure. Please help  our small businesses on Main Street stay alive.
