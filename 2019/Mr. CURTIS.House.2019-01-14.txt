 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Chabot. I rise in  support of H.R. 246, the Stimulating Innovation through Procurement Act  of 2019. I am pleased to lead as an original coauthor and thank Ms.  Finkenauer for her collaboration and effort on this important  legislation.   Much of the country's success can be attributed to pioneering  individuals and small companies, folks wh have discovered a problem and  developed an efficient, cost-effective solution. Innovation, research,  and advancement in technology are our major drivers in today's  postmodern world, and it is critical that we continue promoting the  development of new and advanced technologies.    I am proud that in my home State of Utah we foster a thriving tech  hub and innovation marketplace where the tech industry grew last year  faster than any other State in the Nation. But there is still more work  to be done in Utah and across the country.   This bill reinforces my commitment to small business success by  stimulating technology innovation through the Small Business Innovation  Research, or SBIR program.   Through adding critical acquisition personnel into SBIR and Small  Business Technology Transfer programs, this legislation will ensure  these small businesses have a voice in the procurement process and can  compete on a level playing field and have a chance at success. It adds  zero cost to the taxpayer.   This bill is a commonsense, forward-leaning bill that protects  Federal investment into innovation and technology research by small  businesses and helps these innovators succeed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
