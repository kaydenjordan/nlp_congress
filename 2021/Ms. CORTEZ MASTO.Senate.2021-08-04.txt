 Mr. President, I join my colleague from Nebraska in  support of this bipartisan amendment.   Transparency around broadband is so important for all of our  communities, and it fits with, I think, what we are all doing to  address our broadband needs across the country and trying to ensure we  are bringing broadband into the communities most in need. So I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment.
