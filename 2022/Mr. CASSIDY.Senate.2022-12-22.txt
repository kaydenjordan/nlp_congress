 Mr. President, I commend my colleague's efforts to  ensure this bill has strong religious liberties protections. We share  that intent. I am told that the title VII religious exemption, which is  specifically referred to and which, by the way, was drafted by House  Republican Virginia Foxx. It addresses the issue.   Analysis from Senator Burr's HELP counsel shows that Federal courts  have interpreted title VII broadly beyond hiring and firing. This is  based upon decisions from the liberal Ninth Circuit and the more  conservative Fourth. I am told by attorneys that adding language to the  bill actually, paradoxically, increases the ability of a liberal court  to reinterpret previous jurisprudence.   I don't strongly oppose this, but because of the attorneys telling me  that it would increase the likelihood of changing previous  jurisprudence, which clearly is in favor of these religious employers  having abilities that we all want them to have, I will oppose.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the amendment's benefits are clear. We  include Virginia Foxx's House amendment protecting religious employers,  endorsed by the National Association of Evangelicals, the U.S.  Conference of Catholic Bishops, the March of Dimes, and the U.S.  Chamber.   It passed the Health Committee 19 to 2. It allows employers to help a  pregnant woman support herself, her family, and her unborn child. This  is pro-life. This bill does what we would want for ourselves, our  wives, our sisters, and our daughters.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.
