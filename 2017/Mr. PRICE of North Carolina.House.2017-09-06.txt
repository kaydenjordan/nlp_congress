 Mr. Chairman, I thank our ranking member  for yielding, and I thank her and our chairman for their good work.   I must still rise, however, in opposition to the fiscal 2018  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  bill, and the Republican Omnibus bill.   I want to stress, Mr. Chairman, that I am heartened, as I imagine  every Member of this body is heartened, by the bipartisan cooperation  we have been able to muster to reach out to our neighbors in Texas and  Louisiana who have been so devastated. It is the same kind of  solidarity and cooperation that I know we will muster, whatever the  need is after Irma reaches our shores. We anticipate that storm with a  great deal of concern and apprehension.   We have a history in this body of pulling together when it matters  for our neighbors whenever disasters strike. That kind of cooperation  is absolutely essential to who we are as a country and who we are as an  institution.   Mr. Chair, I want to urge that we bring that same spirit of  cooperation,  [[Page H6840]]  that same understanding of the historic cooperation that has  characterized appropriations, to our larger appropriations challenge.  After all, this is the power of the purse. This is our main  constitutional power, and history shows it works best when it is  exercised cooperatively, no matter who the President is or what the  party division is.   We need to work in a cooperative fashion to make sure that this power  is just as effectively and responsibly exercised as possible. This  eight-bill exercise in which we are engaged today is a deeply flawed  process. We need to overcome this, and I believe eventually we will,  with a bipartisan budget agreement such as we have had each of the last  4 years. This will let us cooperatively write appropriations bills that  address our country's needs. But that is not where we are today, Mr.  Chairman.   I do want to give the chairman of our subcommittee, Mario Diaz-Balart  of Florida, credit for an open and collaborative process, but he and  the subcommittee have been dealt an inadequate hand. We simply can't do  what needs to be done with this allocation.   In the case of the T-HUD bill, we have only appropriated $56.5  billion for vital transportation, housing and community development  programs, and that is $1.1 billion less than the enacted level. We have  got to do better than this. We have got to do right by our country's  infrastructure needs.   One of the most egregious omissions in this bill is funding for the  TIGER program. This is a program that has addressed infrastructure  needs across our country. Estimates are that we are addressing only 5  percent of the meritorious projects put forward under TIGER.   I can tell you about one project we are funding. I visited it last  week: Union Station in Raleigh, North Carolina, a beautiful multimodal  facility that is going to facilitate passenger rail, transit, buses,  intermodal transportation, and it is going to revitalize a landmark  downtown district.                                time  1715    That is an ideal use of TIGER funds. Communities all over this  country need that sort of investment, yet this bill zeros that program  out completely. It also cuts New Starts for transit--Capital Investment  Grants--by $659 million.   Now, I give the chairman credit for including bill language to ensure  that the FTA continues to rate and review projects in the New Starts  pipeline, but at this funding level, only a few of those projects can  actually be funded. Our cities across this country are eager to  institute transit programs. They have gone through all the steps to do  this responsibly. We need to keep faith with those communities by  improving on this aspect of our bill.   Over at HUD, the Choice Neighborhoods program--formerly called HOPE  VI--that has transformed dozens of public housing developments into  thriving, mixed-income communities, receives only $20 million in this  bill compared to $137 million in the fiscal '17 bill. Now, I recognize  this is a placeholder amount, and I look forward to working to improve  this number moving forward.    Additionally, the Community Development  Block Grant and HOME programs are each cut by $100 million in this bill  despite bipartisan calls from local elected officials across the  country to preserve those funding streams.   We are in the midst of a housing crisis nationally. Only one in four  people eligible for Federal rental assistance can receive it. We have a  huge public housing capital backlog, and our infrastructure continues  to crumble, resulting in decaying highways and bridges and congested  roads. We should be increasing our commitment to meet these housing and  transportation needs, not shortchanging them. We have done this for far  too long already.   We have returned again and again to appropriations, especially  domestic appropriations, to bear the whole brunt of deficit reduction.  The results are a disaster for our economy and for the work of our  appropriations committees.   It is truly the worst of both worlds. We are not really addressing  the main drivers of the deficit, yet we are doing untold damage to  critical national investments.   I strongly object also to several policy riders in this bill. They  unnecessarily attack high-speed rail, they roll back transportation  safety, and they harm labor rights.   No number of amendments offered today can fix this bill. I remain  hopeful that ultimately we can get a serious budget agreement. In the  meantime, I urge my colleagues to reject this omnibus bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to join the  chairman in opposition.   The amendment would decimate the salaries and expense accounts at the  Department of Transportation, Department of Housing and Urban  Development, and related agencies. There are broad consequences for  this, but I want to focus on one consequence: cybersecurity.   The inspectors general of both departments have indicated that both  agencies have a lot of work to do in addressing cyber threats. The CIOs  at DOT and HUD have been working to address these challenges. They have  had issues in hiring and staffing cybersecurity professionals in what  is a very competitive labor market.   The bill would make these challenges even more difficult by reducing  the salaries and expenses of the CIO offices by 10 percent.   We owe it to our constituents to have a safe and secure  transportation system and to safeguard personally identifiable  information. This amendment would make it harder for these departments  to do this, and I urge its defeat.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentleman  for offering the amendment. I am compelled to oppose it, in part,  because our authorizers have expressed reservations, at least on our  side, about this amendment.   No one disagrees with giving the States flexibility, but we and the  authorizers, in particular, have some questions about how the  gentleman's amendment would go about providing that flexibility.   The set-asides in the bill reflect the agreement in the FAST Act.  Therefore, before legislating on this, we need to be clear about how  this would work and whether it does, in fact, violate the premises of  the FAST Act and other questions raised by our colleagues.   I suggest a ``no'' vote. I also suggest that we could return to this  and deal with it later once some of these questions might be cleared  up.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for  yielding. I join him in opposing this amendment. It would reduce the  total amount of spending on new infrastructure projects by $474  million.   The main criticism of this bill, as the chairman has said, is that we  ought to be doing more investment in infrastructure, not less. This  amendment would make the bill's shortcomings even worse.   The Federal-State partnership for State of Good Repair program can be  used for grants along the Northeast Corridor, the Chicago to Detroit  Corridor, and publicly owned rail infrastructure throughout the Nation.  These corridors include many of the Nation's passenger rail  bottlenecks.   This amendment would take away dedicated funds to improve passenger  rail service throughout our country. It is a distraction from the  infrastructure challenges we face. We should be finding ways to invest  in infrastructure: worthy new projects, expand mobility and  opportunity. This amendment moves in the opposite direction.  [[Page H7048]]    Mr. Chairman, I urge its defeat.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the chairman for  yielding and join him in opposing this amendment.   Amtrak serves more than 500 destinations in 46 States. It is a more  and more critical component of our transportation system in North  Carolina and many States like it across the country. It connects small  communities that otherwise wouldn't have access to air service or other  first-rate transportation.   In the past 11 years, Amtrak has had ten consecutive years of record  ridership, serving over 32 million passengers last year. So this is an  irresponsible amendment. It would eliminate thousands of jobs for  Amtrak workers, and it would hurt the local economies that benefit from  Amtrak routes.   Eliminating this national network service would also harm State- supported routes, and we in North Carolina and other States take notice  when that is charged, and it is an accurate charge. They feed into  these long-distance routes. It costs the government billions of dollars  due to the violation of labor agreements. So it would be a very costly  amendment. There is no doubt about it.   Support for a robust national rail system has been reaffirmed by  members of both parties, and we can reaffirm it here tonight by voting  against this amendment.                                time  2030     Mr. Chairman, I commend my colleague for  offering this amendment, and I strongly support it. Like many Members,  I have seen the difference that NeighborWorks makes in my own district:  making available hundreds of affordable apartments, often for veterans,  for families.   The administration proposed slashing NeighborWorks by $113 million,  so I commend the committee, our subcommittee, for refusing that  proposal. But we need to bring it back to the fiscal year `16 level,  and that is what my colleague is proposing. That would be $35 million.  It would bring us to that fiscal year `16 level of funding, and it  would let NeighborWorks do even more good work in our communities. I  urge adoption of the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for  yielding time to me, and I join him in opposition to this amendment.   There are some conflicting accounts about what the underlying bill  would do. Certainly there has been an attempt to contain the damage in  the bill. Some groups like the National Low Income Housing Coalition,  however, estimate that housing vouchers would be lost under the current  bill, and then we have this amendment? This amendment would compound  many times whatever problems are involved in the legislation. It would  have a horrible impact on low-income families.   The gentleman has asserted here tonight that veterans wouldn't be  harmed, that the disabled wouldn't be harmed, the elderly wouldn't be  harmed. Read the amendment. Where is any of this stated? How can he  make such statement? All these groups and more would be harmed.   Mr. Chair, I urge this amendment's rejection.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this  amendment. The Private Enforcement Initiative provides grants to  nonprofit organizations to prevent and eliminate discriminatory housing  practices.   These organizations receive complaints. They investigate them. They  work to educate landlords and property managers on their  responsibilities under Federal fair housing law. Their work ensures  that legitimate complaints move forward and that education is provided  to housing providers when that is appropriate.   Across the country, PEI grantees are working to ensure that families  with children have access to housing. Just this May, HUD and Project  Sentinel, an organization in California, announced a conciliation  agreement with a landlord who refused to rent to people with small  children and infants. Another PEI grantee in California worked to  ensure that a person with disabilities had access to a medically  required service animal. Another grantee in Illinois worked to ensure  that a mortgage lender did not discriminate on the basis of race. This  is the kind of work that PEIs do.   It may seem expedient to some to transfer the funding and  responsibility of investigating fair housing complaints to States and  local units of government, but we would lose a lot by doing that. What  we would lose is the organizational knowledge, the years of expertise  that the PEI program has developed.   Now, if the gentleman has specific issues with the program about how  it is run, you know, the authorizing committee can hear those  complaints, not the appropriations process. This is not the place to  refine the law under which the program operates, let alone to pull the  plug on funding.   Given all of the good work that PEI grantees do across the country  and in my district, I can't support eliminating this program, and I  urge colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a pretty  good example, I must say, of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  There may be complaints here and there. There are ways to pursue those  complaints. But the good work that these organizations do, the  documented cases of discrimination, discriminatory practices, exclusion  that they have remedied, that they have made right, should be very  compelling to us.   Certainly, the blunt instrument of simply withholding of funding  isn't going to deal with that. It is going to likely do great damage to  organizations that, across the country, have had a very positive  impact.   This amendment would end their work. It would end the work of  nonprofits that use funding to ensure housing providers remain in  compliance with Federal housing law. It is a very bad idea.   Mr. Chair, let's oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I can't imagine why we  would want to micromanage Pennsylvania's transportation system. I  wouldn't want the body micromanaging North Carolina's.   We had a decision about tolling in my district a few years ago.  Tolling wasn't anybody's first choice or second choice or third choice.  But if tolling had not been instituted on a part of the loop road  around Raleigh, North Carolina, if tolling had not been instituted, we  would have waited 20 years for the road to be constructed. So we took a  deep breath and we undertook a toll project, and that is why the road  is built and serving commuters today.   Now, that decision could have gone either way, but we would have had  no business in this body coming in and dictating that decision in North  Carolina or any other State. I don't know why we should start tonight.   Federal law is very flexible about the use of Federal aid funds for  new toll facilities and even existing toll-free roads. States will make  different decisions about this.   I would say our infrastructure needs are pressing enough to require  an all-of-the-above approach, and if tolls are appropriate and are  accepted, then that is perhaps what we should do. But that is a  decision for State and local officials and their constituents in  considering these matters. We have no business in adopting an amendment  of that sort, and I very much hope we will not.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would like the clarify  that I am not the least bit interested in getting into the merits of  this project. It is none of my business, none of our business, so that  is not the point. I haven't said a word about the merits of the  project. I know nothing about it.   What I do know is that this is a decision that the State of  Pennsylvania is perfectly capable of making for itself. I am not  interested in the folks that might be on the losing side of a decision  to come to this body to carry their water. We have no business doing  that.   This is simply an inappropriate exercise of appropriations power, and  I urge the amendment's rejection.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment. Davis-Bacon is a pretty simple concept, and a fair one. It  requires that workers on a federally funded construction project be  paid no less than prevailing wages, the wages paid in the community for  similar work.   The Davis-Bacon Act ensures workers are paid decent wages, while  preventing unscrupulous contractors from undercutting competitors. In  doing this, Davis-Bacon helps protect workers and the Federal  Government.   Mr. Chairman, the House has taken numerous votes on this issue, and  on every vote, this body has maintained Davis-Bacon requirements.   Last year, we avoided including divisive language like this, and it  is my hope that we will stop attacking working people and their  organizations and defeat the amendment before us.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my  time to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Chairman, I urge defeat of the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  this amendment. I understand the concern that has led to it about the  practice of tolling or the possibility of tolling on two adjacent  highways in two States.   But the same kind of reasoning that applied, I think, to Mr.  Thompson's amendment earlier would apply to this. This is not a  decision for us to make on the floor of the House tonight. This is  clearly a local matter. We don't have any business micromanaging it.  The States involved can have their own decisionmaking processes. They  have their own ways of consulting with one another for that matter.   Federal law has been pretty flexible on this for good reason. It has  been flexible about tolling, about the treatment of existing toll-free  roads for good reason. We have pressing infrastructure needs in this  country. We have great need for flexibility in the way we fund  infrastructure improvements.   I relayed earlier the kind of decision we made in North Carolina. It  was not particularly our first choice to have a toll road, but the  alternative was waiting 20 years, so we have a toll road. Others will  make other decisions. But it is not our place to preempt those  decisions, let alone in an appropriations bill.   Mr. Chairman, I do oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  this amendment. Our colleague does make solid points about the  importance of manufactured housing, about the serviceability of it,  about the access of it, about the affordability. There are many, many  aspects about manufactured housing that lend themselves to our  constituents at various income levels.   He asks why we would possibly want any kind of consumer protections  enacted at the Federal level in this business, though. I think the  answer to that is pretty obvious: It is about safety and security. It  is about protecting consumers who put good money down for these houses.   That is not to say every rule, every protection is well-conceived.  Possibly some need to be scrutinized and some need to be revised. But  are we going to do it tonight on the floor of the House in an  appropriations bill? I would hope not. That is not a good way to  proceed.   We, for one thing, have colleagues on the authorizing committee who  have not had hearings, as far as I know, on these issues. We have not  had people who live with these regulations in to talk about them or  groups that look out for the consumers come in.   We have very limited debate here tonight, with 5 minutes on each  side. On that basis, we are going to wipe away carefully conceived  consumer protections in the area of manufactured housing?                                time  2145    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues not to go down this path. That is  not to say we shouldn't consider these things.   Congress, including the authorizing committees, and HUD should fully  examine the impact of these individual regulations before we jump the  gun and make sweeping changes to existing policy. I urge defeat of the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is news to most of us,  I expect, that consumer protections is incompatible with consumer  choice. We offer protections of all sorts. In the case of housing, it  is against predatory practices. As the houses are sold, it is against  shoddy construction, it is against a race to the bottom in terms of  quality that individual buyers may not be able to perceive.   That compatibility of basic consumer protections and consumer choice  is presented every day in our marketplace, and I certainly don't see  why it should be absent here, although, as I said earlier, some of  these rules may be up for scrutiny. It is just not that we are prepared  to do it here tonight.   I would also point out that the only type of housing that moves  across State lines is manufactured housing, so that probably provides  an additional argument as to why we should be particularly diligent in  dismantling Federal protections. I urge rejection of the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, immigration enforcement is  a Federal responsibility. Local law enforcement is not and should not  be the long arm of ICE. And if it is perceived to be the long arm of  ICE, it is going to be very difficult to work with the community to do  what needs to be done for local law enforcement and community  protection.   The end result would tear entire communities apart, would greatly  hinder the ability of local law enforcement to effectively do their  job.   Furthermore, this amendment has no place in the T-HUD appropriations  bill. The employees of the Department of Transportation, Housing and  Urban Development are not law enforcement. They do not routinely need  to interact with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This amendment  would insert unnecessary controversy into the bill. It does nothing to  improve transportation. It does nothing to provide housing for  vulnerable Americans. It doesn't change existing law, nor does it  change the way HUD and DOT programs are administered.   The underlying bill has enough challenges as written without adding  something of this moment and this divisiveness. So I urge defeat of  this needless and partisan distraction.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the facts are pretty clear  about this matter. A thousand people die on our highways each year  because of speeding trucks. The technology that limits speeding by  large trucks is already installed and successfully deployed by many  trucking companies across this country.   We know that high speeds in large trucks are a deadly combination. A  2012 study by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration found  that trucks without a speed limiting device had twice as many speed- related crashes as those who had a speed limiter installed. Those are  the facts. Pretty incontrovertible, I believe.   So on the basis of this, quite rightly, the National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Administration have a rulemaking under way, a careful rulemaking  looking at all the evidence, and the proposal is here tonight that we  upend that, that we on the floor of this House, with 5 minutes of  consideration on each side, that we abrogate unto ourselves the  decision to upend this safety rule.   This is technology that saves lives. The evidence is very clear. What  that exact rule should look like in the end, we don't know, but we do  know that to completely set aside the rulemaking process in such a  vital area is reckless and irresponsible. This amendment should be  rejected.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.   Truck crash deaths in this country have increased significantly in  recent years. That should be the backdrop of this discussion. 4,067  people were killed in crashes involving large trucks in 2015 alone.  That is a 20 percent increase since 2009. And studies show that driver  fatigue--that is what this amendment is all about, driver fatigue--is  an important part of the problem.   The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the National  Transportation Safety Board repeatedly have recommended that all trucks  and buses be equipped with ELDs.  [[Page H7063]]    In 2012, Congress decided to take strong action to address this  problem and passed a requirement for the use of ELDs with bipartisan  support as a part of the MAP-21 legislation.   Supporters of this amendment say that the enforcement community is  not ready to begin enforcement by December 18. That is really not the  case.   And it is also true that inspectors aren't going to pull truckers out  of service for noncompliance until April 1 of next year. That is a  considerable grace period. It will give the trucking and the  enforcement community ample time to adjust to the mandate.   The Department of Transportation has estimated that the benefits  adopting ELDs to be over $1 billion. So implementing the mandate makes  financial sense, and it certainly makes sense in terms of the safety of  our people, the safety on our roads.   Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford).    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of  my time to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  this needless, divisive, and, indeed, provocative amendment.   President Bush, long ago, ordered Federal agencies to comply with E- Verify. That was in 2007. I have seen no indication that the Trump  administration intends to rescind this order.   This amendment, if it only applies to hiring at Federal agencies,  would do nothing, absolutely nothing. So why is it before us? What is  the purpose here tonight? Is it possibly a political purpose?   What the amendment does do, in fact, is to insert unnecessary  controversy into this bill. It does nothing to improve transportation,  and it does nothing to provide housing for vulnerable Americans.   The underlying bill, one would think, has enough challenges, as  written, without this gratuitous amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I urge defeat of this distraction, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
