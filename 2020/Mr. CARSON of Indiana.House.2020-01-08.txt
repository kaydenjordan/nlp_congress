 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a  trailblazing public servant and an iconic Hoosier, Mayor Richard  Hatcher.   As one of the first African American mayors of a major American city,  Mayor Hatcher was a constant source of inspiration not only across  Indiana but throughout our Nation and around the world.   His history-making election in 1967 as Gary, Indiana's first Black  mayor showed the power of the possible, that even in a State once  controlled by the Ku Klux Klan, a person of color could rise above  hatred and into the halls of power.   Mayor Hatcher's example of advocating for economic justice, civil  rights, and equality for every American is why so many of my colleagues  and I are elected public servants. His death is a sad loss for all  Americans, but his legacy and his work will live on. We must all work  together to continue his quest for greater representation and rights  for all.   Mr. Speaker, I send my deepest condolences to Mayor Hatcher's loved  ones, and I thank him for a life well lived.                            ____________________
