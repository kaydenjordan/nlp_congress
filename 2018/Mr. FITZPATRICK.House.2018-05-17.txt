 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize an educator  in my district who is making a lasting difference in the lives of Bucks  County students.   Rebecca Obert-Thorn, of Pennwood Middle School in Lower Makefield,  was recently named the winner of the Axalta All-Pro Teacher of the Year  Award. For this distinction, Rebecca has secured $7,000 for Pennwood to  be used on materials that promote STEM education and opportunities for  students.   This program, which is in collaboration with the Philadelphia Eagles,  honored Rebecca due to her dedication in the classroom, along with her  work on the board of directors at Silver Lake Nature Center in Bristol  and through STEM work at the Bucks County Community College. It also  featured an event at Pennwood Middle School with Eagles wide receiver  Bryce Treggs.   I applaud Rebecca for her work in promoting STEM education and her  commitment to building our next generation of leaders in Bucks County.
