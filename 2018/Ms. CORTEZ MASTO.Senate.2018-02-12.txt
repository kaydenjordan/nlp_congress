 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.    Mr. President, last September President Trump  rescinded the DACA Program. Since that time, nearly 20,000 DACA  recipients have lost their status. That number continues to grow. I  have posted this sign outside my office so my colleagues can see that  122 Dreamers are losing their status every single day. This chart  cannot begin to tell the story of the impact this arbitrary decision  has had on Dreamers' lives.   Over the past year, I have held roundtables with Dreamers throughout  Nevada. I wanted to hear their concerns, listen to their stories, and  make sure they know their rights. Dreamers  [[Page S867]]  are not charts or numbers. They are people. They are amazing. They are  putting themselves through school, studying hard, serving in our  communities, our churches, and our military--all while working multiple  jobs to support their families.   In meeting with them, I have learned that they are their own best  advocates. Dreamers deserve the chance to speak for themselves. They  deserve better than to be used as pawns in a cynical game. They should  not be forced to choose between achieving protection in the only  country they have ever known and seeing their families attacked with  arbitrary and cruel cuts to our family reunification and diversity visa  programs. I am tired of seeing the White House pit people against one  another.   Tonight and this week, Congress is about to determine the future of  these patriotic young men and women. Before we begin this debate, we  need to take a few moments to understand who they are, what they are  doing for our country, and what the consequences will be if we fail  them. I wish to read a few letters they sent me.   Listen to this letter from Jevi. He is a freshman at Nevada State  College. Jevi said:         I was born in Mexico in March 1998 and was brought to the       United States when I was six months old. I recently started       my freshman year at Nevada State College. I am majoring in       Business Administration in the hope that I can open a small       family restaurant someday. I have grown up in Las Vegas my       entire life. It's the city I know, the city that raised me.       It is my home, my only home.    Listen to this letter from Maggie. She wrote:         I came to the United States when I was ten years old. I       faced language barriers when I started elementary school, but       I quickly learned English and excelled as a student. I       graduated from High School in 2007 with $20,000 in academic       scholarships, but couldn't use them because I was       undocumented. After receiving Deferred Action for Childhood       Arrivals in June of 2013, I was able to begin working as a       health care enrollment counselor for Nevada Health Link. In       January 2014, I was accepted to the University of Nevada       Reno, where I continued working to help people access       affordable health care while going to school full time.    That was Maggie. That was her letter to me.   Listen to Francisco. This is his letter to me.         My story is very much like others in this country. I am one       of the 1.5 million undocumented children that were brought to       the United States as minors by their parents. On September       17th, 2012, I applied for Deferred Action, hoping to be       granted a work permit. Around that same time, I learned that       I had been admitted to the University of Nevada, Las       Vegas. On November 5 my work permit arrived. My family and       I all came to tears upon learning the news. I quickly       looked for a job so that I would be able to enroll and       start paying for my school.    That was from Francisco.   Now hear from Anna, who wrote:         I came to the United States with my family, from the       Philippines, at the age of 7. My father left our family in       2001, and our visas expired soon after. I graduated from       Centennial High School in 2008 and started nursing school at       the College of Southern Nevada. I graduated in 2012 and       received my DACA acceptance a year later. I am currently       going on my third year working at University Medical Center .       . . as a pediatric ICU nurse.    These are only four of the stories that I have heard from Dreamers,  and there are hundreds of thousands more just like them.   I want to point out that just recently, I received a batch of 32  letters from seventh graders at Bailey Middle School in Las Vegas. To a  T, the concern for every single one of these seventh graders was the  same thing.   Clarisa, one of these seventh graders, wrote:         I would like to change Trump's decision and let the DACA       program stay so immigrants get to have the life they had       before. My family and friends are all I have in my life. I       don't want to see them go because they cannot go to school or       get a job. Thank you.    That was from Clarisa.   We also have a letter from Andrea G.:         President Trump's decision affects my family, the people I       know, and the community. It affects my family because my two       older siblings were brought here when they were just babies.       It affects people I know because some of my other family       members were brought here as babies. I hope President Trump       does not end DACA. Thank you.    To a T, with regard to all of these letters, all of the information,  all of the people with whom I have met both here in the Capitol and in  Nevada, these Dreamers are incredible people. They are incredible  individuals who are contributing to our communities.   When you hear these stories, you see that this fight is not about  charts and numbers or political leverage. This fight is not even about  individuals. It is about entire communities. It is not just about what  will happen to Jevi and Maggie and Francisco and Anna and all of those  families who are connected somehow to those kids at Bailey Middle  School. It is about what will happen to their customers, their  students, their patients, their employers, their parents, their  families, and their friends.   You see, Dreamers are our first responders. They serve in our  military. They drive our ambulances. They pray with us in church. They  are on the frontlines, teaching our kids and defending our country.  What happens when they are not here anymore?   The debate over immigration in this country has focused for too long  on misconceptions and stereotypes. Immigrants are not taking our jobs;  they are creating them. They are not causing crime; they are putting  their lives on the line to fight it. What do we gain by deporting them?   What do we gain when Maggie and Francisco are forced to drop out of  school? How do we gain when Anna cannot go back to work in the  pediatric ICU?   Jevi has no memory of the country in which he was born. He spent only  the first 6 months of his life there. What do we gain when we send him  back?   Living in a community means depending on the people around you. It  means having neighbors you can turn to in times of need. Dreamers are  our neighbors. This is their time of need.   I urge my colleagues to understand who Dreamers really are. Don't pit  kids against parents or neighbors against neighbors. This is bigger  than partisan politics. It is about human lives. It is time to fight  for these families and for keeping these families together, who are an  integral part of our communities.   I know many of my colleagues support the Dream Act and reasonable  border security measures. Let's get through to the finish line. The  American people are watching us, and 80 percent of them want us to help  Dreamers. Dreamers belong here, and Dreamers are American. This is our  chance to do what is right.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
