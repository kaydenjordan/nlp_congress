 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise to discuss, for just a couple of  minutes this afternoon, the issue of healthcare and, in particular, the  legislation that was unveiled today, what is referred to as a  ``discussion draft.'' It is legislative text, but it is not the final  word on this issue. So we have to begin in earnest to engage in debate  because we are going to be very limited in the time that we have.   I think the best way to describe this legislation can be very simple,  actually, in terms of the impact on a lot of Americans. Unfortunately,  I don't think this is really an effort to improve the healthcare  system. I think it is a scheme. It is a scheme that sells out the  middle class. It hurts seniors and children and devastates the  protections and healthcare for individuals with disabilities over time,  and all of that is done to finance tax breaks for the very rich. There  are other ways, of course, to describe it, but I will focus mostly on  Medicaid.   As it relates to Medicaid, this isn't a repeal and replace, or repeal  and improve, or repeal and reform. This is repeal and decimate when it  comes to Medicaid. The cuts may be stretched out, but they are, in  fact, deeper over time.   So if you are one of the 1.1 million children in Pennsylvania who  receives Medicaid or one of over 720,000 Pennsylvanians with a  disability who benefits from Medicaid, your healthcare could be at  risk. My test would be that if any of those individuals lose their  Medicaid benefits, it is a bad bill. I would hope that would be the  test for every Member of the Senate.   The other adverse consequence of this legislation is that it will  cripple efforts to battle the opioid addiction in our country. We just  had a great consensus at the end of last year where both parties came  together on two pieces of legislation--one that dealt directly with the  opioid epidemic, the so-called CARA bill, or the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act. Then later in the year, there was another  bill that provided some additional funding. All of that would be  compromised, undermined, or degraded, at least, if this legislation  went through because the biggest payer--certainly, in the top two, in  terms of our paying for opioid treatment and services--is, of course,  the Medicaid Program.   So what we have here before us is a bill that is a tax giveaway to  the wealthiest. The top one-tenth of 1 percent would receive thousands  and thousands, if not tens of thousands, of dollars. One estimate of  the earlier version of the House bill said, if you were in the top one- tenth of 1 percent, you would get $197,000 each. Those people don't  need $197,000 from a tax break from a so-called healthcare bill. They  would, I think, expect that we would take care of the people that need  healthcare: Vulnerable children. Some 40 percent of the children in  America get Medicaid. Almost half the births in the country are paid  for by Medicaid. People with disabilities are disproportionately  dependent upon Medicaid, and they should have a right to expect--and  their families should have a right to expect--that, if you have a  disability, you should get Medicaid today, tomorrow, years from now,  decades from now, and as long as you need it. You should have that  guarantee. This bill takes away that guarantee for those families with  a loved one with a disability.   One of the many stories that we get from back home are from parents.  Many of them are writing because their child has a disability or  multiple disabilities, and they are dependent upon Medicaid. Here is  just one:         My son, Anthony, was born at 25 weeks and he weighed one       tiny pound. We were overcome with medical bills which       Medicaid thankfully paid for us. Since his birth he has had       multiple health crisis, seizures, sleep disorders just to       name a few.        Most recently, Anthony was diagnosed with Autism spectrum       disorder, Tourette's syndrome, severe obsessive compulsive       disorder and Dyspraxia. He has suffered the most physically       and mentally because of his Tourette's. It's severe and he is       frequently unable to attend school due to his ``tics.'' They       are painful and debilitating. They make him unable to eat,       breathe and see at their worst. Far from what is commonly       depicted in the movies and on TV.    Then, this father goes on to say:         Two years ago I was forced to quit my job of twenty years       as a therapist to stay at home and care for Anthony because       of the amount of doctors' appointments he has and the number       of days of school he misses every year. Luckily with medical       assistance--    That is the Pennsylvania version of Medicaid--       covering his services I am still able to do so. If we lost       coverage, we would not be able to provide the support he       needs. We are sure of that.        I truly realize that unless you are actually living this       kind of life, it's easy to turn a blind eye. I can assure you       that my story is much like thousands of others that DEPEND--    And he has that word ``depend'' in all capital letters--       on funds from medical assistance to cover doctors,       medications, therapies and durable medical equipment that       children with disabilities require. Families of children with       disabilities are desperate to not lose those benefits.        My son Anthony is currently attending school almost       regularly and functioning the best he has for a very long       time thanks to the services he received from medical       assistance.    That is otherwise known as Medicaid.   So that is the reality for a lot of families. Now, I can hear some  folks in the Senate saying: Well, maybe Anthony will not be affected  because the Medicaid provisions are going to be up to the States, and  the States can handle that. We are just going to put a cap on the  dollars, and we are going to wind down the Medicaid expansion that  covered 11 million Americans at last count, and the States will handle  it.    So we are sending back these challenges and the disproportionate  burden that States will have to bear to make sure that Anthony--who has  all those challenges in his life--has the coverage of Medicaid. The  Federal Government will just wash its hands of that responsibility.   No, Medicaid is a guarantee now, based upon your eligibility. That  guarantee should remain. We are a great country. We have the strongest  economy and the strongest military in the world, and we have the  Medicaid Program. We don't have to sacrifice those kids or sacrifice  the healthcare for one child who depends on Medicaid. We don't have to  sacrifice that child in order to have another part of our budget funded  appropriately. That is an insult, and anyone who is going to choose to  support legislation that would fund tax cuts for the wealthiest, while  at the very same time and in the very same bill would result in others  losing coverage--and I am not only talking about children with  disabilities. I am talking about adults who have coverage--20 million  people in the last couple of years. Any Member of the Senate who  chooses tax cuts for the wealthy over those children and over those  individuals, I think, should examine their conscience, to use an old  expression, because this kind of policy  [[Page S3711]]  that results in the most vulnerable among us losing their healthcare  coverage is obscene. There are a lot of other words we could use--words  we can't use here--because that is the definition of an insult to our  values and to our country.   We are a better country than what we will become if this Chamber  votes in favor of a bill that will decimate Medicaid, the way this bill  will. I realize it might take a long time. I realize it might be  another Presidency or many Congresses from now, but the deed will be  done here that will lead to that kind of misery. We have no sense of  the misery that will be imposed upon those families because we have  never had this before.   We had a program in place for 50 years, and it has helped a lot of  kids with disabilities. It has helped a lot of families to be able to  hold down a job while their child gets the benefit of Medicaid because  of a disability. It has helped a lot of poor children rise up from  poverty and overcome terrible poverty because when they were kids--when  they were very, very young--they got early periodic screening diagnosis  and testing--the kind of early intervention and good healthcare that  children get on Medicaid.   A lot of seniors get into nursing homes. A lot of middle-class  seniors from middle-class families get into nursing homes solely  because they get the benefit of Medicaid, in addition to Medicare.   The last thing I would say is that I think Senators in this Chamber  should think about the basic inequity when they have healthcare.  Everyone here has healthcare. All the families here have healthcare.  All of our loved ones who are dependent upon us have healthcare. Yet  some will vote to take away healthcare from some, and, in the very same  bill, vote for gross, obscene tax cuts for the wealthiest among us-- most of whom, I would bet, don't want those tax cuts. They would rather  see us take care of the vulnerable.   So it is a basic choice. This isn't complicated. This is a very  simple choice. I hope that in the course of this debate, some will come  forward with some courage, some guts, and some compassion and do the  right thing and vote this bill down.   I yield the floor.
