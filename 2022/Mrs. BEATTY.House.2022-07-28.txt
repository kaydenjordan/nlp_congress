 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Johnson for yielding.   Let me just take point of personal privilege as a Member of this  House and salute the gentlewoman for her leadership, her experience,  and the years that she has given to this Congress.   I don't care what any colleague says on the other side of the aisle.  Today, because of the gentlewoman's leadership and all others on this  end--some on the other side--understand that this is about national  security, understand that this is about our economy, and understand  that this is about our workforce.   I am so proud to be from the great State of Ohio. It will be a game- changer with tens of billions of dollars being invested into what may  end up as the largest semiconductor manufacturing plant in the world.   I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that Democrats will stand strong  because we understand the difference from politics and posturing and  making a difference in industries that we all use and need.   Mr. Speaker, I am asking all of my delegation, Democrats and  Republicans, to stand up for what is right and vote for this bill.    Mr. Speaker, let me also end by saying that this bill  will set a path that the United States will be a leader in the economy  for the future.   I have listened repeatedly to Members on the other side of the aisle  talk about inflation, talk about investment, and talk about economics.  Now I want them to vote that way. I want them to join us and support  this bill that will make a difference for not only now but for our  future and set us up ahead of other countries that have done damage to  us.
