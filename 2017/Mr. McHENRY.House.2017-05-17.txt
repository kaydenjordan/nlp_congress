 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in recognition of  National Police Week and in honor of National Peace Officers Memorial  Day, which was this past Monday. National Police Week was established  by President Kennedy in 1962, as a day for Americans to remember police  officers who lost their lives in the line of duty over the previous  year.   This year's Peace Officers Memorial Day was especially somber in my  district in western North Carolina as it was the first time since  Shelby police officer Tim Brackeen was killed.   Officer Brackeen was a dedicated law enforcement officer who began  his career with the Cleveland County Sheriff's Office and later joined  the Shelby Police Department where, in 2012, he was honored as the  officer of the year.   Last September, Officer Brackeen was working with his canine partner  Ciko when he was killed in the line of duty, leaving behind his young  wife and his 4-year-old daughter.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Officer Brackeen and all of the  officers throughout our country who serve us so diligently every day  who lost their lives serving our communities. It is really important  for us as Americans to thank those who put themselves in harm's way so  we may live peaceful lives for our own benefit and for the benefit of  our communities.   Our men and women in blue put their lives on the line each and every  day to keep us safe. When shots are fired, they run toward the sound of  the gun while others are running away. I thank them for their dedicated  service, and I pray each day for their continued safety.                            ____________________
