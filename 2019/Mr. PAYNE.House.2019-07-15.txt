 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 582, the  Raise the Wage Act. H.R. 582 is truly long overdue.   Truly hardworking folks across this country, most of whom are first  in the door and last to leave, will benefit from this strong  legislation. Low-wage earners, manufacturing workers, healthcare  workers, construction workers, and educators will come closer to being  able to make ends meet.   Middle- and working-class real wages have remained stagnant over the  past several decades, even as the corporations and shareholders they  labor for have seen soaring profits.   In short, the Federal minimum wage has not increased since 2009.  Hardworking families have not been given a fair deal and, thus, have an  extremely tough time trying to keep up with the rising cost of living.   Madam Speaker, I will vote yes on H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act,  and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in  standing up for hardworking American people.                            ____________________
