 Mr. Speaker, I am a single mom. When I ran for Congress  last year, I spent thousands and thousands of dollars on childcare.   Running for Federal office requires 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100-hour  workweeks, and I worked nearly every single day, including every single  weekend. I also worked challenging hours, often starting at 5:30 a.m.  and ending with campaign events stretching late into the evening. I  juggled more than a dozen childcare providers for nearly 2 years,  without whom I would have never made it to Congress.   I have three children. When I started my campaign, Betsy was 6, Paul  was 9, and Luke was 11. Leaving them alone was not an option; and  bringing them on the campaign trail was impossible or inappropriate.   For the past two centuries, Congress has written many, many laws  about what women may or may not do. But until this year, women's  representation in Congress was less than 20 percent. With the election  of the historic class of 2018, we hit 23.4 percent, 102 women, and that  number is still egregiously low.                                time  1615    There are even fewer moms in Congress and even fewer moms of young  kids and even fewer single moms of young kids, as in just me.   A major barrier to women running for elected office is their  inability to afford the amount or type of childcare needed in a  campaign. That is why I introduced the Help America Run Act, which will  explicitly allow candidates for Federal office to use campaign  contributions to pay for childcare as well as other types of dependent  care, such as eldercare.   Right now, candidates can use campaign funds for a whole gamut of  expenses, from pizza for exhausted staff to cybersecurity for digital  devices. But the law does not make it clear that childcare is among  those allowed expenses.   Like so many laws, there is an assumption of a female caregiver  behind every male elected official. In part because of that, moms who  continue to shoulder the majority of childcare responsibilities also  struggle to run for Congress.   Until women are fully and equally present in Congress, women's  perspectives will continue to be underrepresented. The result is a  weaker democracy for the people.   I am proud that this bill previously passed the House as part of H.R.  1, the For the People Act. Now, with the support of my congressional  colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the House is taking this  additional step to support women and candidates with families by  passing the Help America Run Act.   Access to childcare services was a problem I faced like so many other  single parents long before I decided to run for office. Every parent,  not just those running for Congress, deserves to have access to  quality, affordable childcare. The Help America Run Act should be only  the beginning.   Today isn't just about passing legislation to open up the Halls of  Congress for single moms or single dads. It is about creating pathways  for every parent and every American, regardless of socioeconomic  status, to be able to achieve their goals. We all deserve a Congress  that reflects the diversity of families and households in our country.   This bill will help America run and, in the process, will help  America's Congress run better.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his  bipartisanship and his cooperation on this because democracy is not a  partisan value. Democracy is about letting every voice in this country  be heard. Those voices should reflect the diversity of this country,  both socioeconomically and geographically, but also in terms of family  status.   I think everyone in America should be grateful that my children were  well supervised during the campaign, and I am grateful that I was able  to piece together the childcare that I needed to run. But this bill is  not about any one of us. It is about the benefits that every one of us  here and every American will get from having a more diverse Congress,  from having voices heard that sometimes are not heard.   There are millions and millions and millions of single parents, men  and women, in this country, and there is one in the United States  Congress. Whether that will change next year or in 10 years, I don't  know, but I want every American who wants to serve in this body, who  wants to come together to work for the good of the American people, to  have the opportunity to make that happen and not to have to choose  between being a parent and being a good parent and caring about your  kids, and being a good American and being a good Congress Member.    I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, the legislation provides an opportunity and  a choice for each candidate to decide, in their own campaign and from  their own donors, whether or not they want to use these funds for  childcare.   Many people will choose not to, just like many of us choose as  candidates not to seek reimbursement for pizza or not to seek  reimbursement for any number of allowable FEC expenses. But this bill  is also going to stop the FEC from having to again and again and  again--every time a parent of young children wants to run, from having  to make that expensive and time-consuming appeal to the FEC and waste  its resources when this simply should be a clear, straightforward  policy.
