 Madam Speaker, our diversity is a strength; it is not a  weakness. We are a nation of immigrants, some voluntary, others  involuntary, but as Dr. King once observed, ``We may have all come on  different ships, but we're in the same boat now.''   We are a gorgeous mosaic of people from throughout the world. We are  White, we are Black, we are Latino, we are Asian, and we are Native  American. We are Christian, we are Jewish, we are Muslim, we are Hindu,  we are believers, and we are nonbelievers. We are gay, we are straight,  we are young, we are older, we are women, and we are men. We are  citizens, and we are Dreamers.   Out of many we are one. That is what makes America a great country.  No matter what xenophobic behavior is coming out of 1600 Pennsylvania  Avenue, we will never let anyone take that away from us--not now, not  ever.
