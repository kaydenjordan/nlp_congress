 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding  me the time.   Our friends across the aisle are nothing if not courageous. They have  got the brazen temerity to raise the question of process after running  the most closed Congress in the history of the United States of  America; the most closed House of Representatives that anyone has ever  seen.   Let's compare their H.R. 1 when they got started with our H.R. 1.  Well, their's was filed, marked up, and passed in 2 weeks with no  hearings, no amendments made in order, and no expert testimony at all.   Our H.R. 1 was filed on the first day of the new Congress for all of  the public to read. There have been hearings in five different  committees with over 15 hours of expert testimony, culminating in a  full committee markup in House Administration. Sixty days later, we are  now on the floor for consideration in an open and transparent way.   You would think they would have the decency not to raise the question  of process after running the House of Representatives like King Kong  over the last 2 years. But the people who ran it like King Kong now  want to turn it into a Quaker meeting house somehow. They should be  thanking us for the openness of our proceedings.   Their H.R. 1 blew a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit, a staggering  and unprecedented assault on the fiscal integrity of the United States  of America, to shower tax cuts on the wealthy and well-connected.   Our H.R. 1 is an effort to reclaim our democracy from the wealthy and  well-connected people who were the beneficiaries of their H.R. 1 by  creating a 21st century campaign finance system that responds to the  people.   On the substance of the matter, it is amazing to me that my  colleagues raise the question of the swamp. They got elected 2.5 years  ago campaigning against the swamp. It was a great slogan they borrowed  from Nancy Pelosi. They moved to Washington. They moved into the swamp.  They built a hotel on it, and they have turned the Government of the  United States into a money-making operation for the President, and the  President's family, and the President's friends and business  associates.   Now, what are we doing in H.R. 1? We are trying to reclaim American  democracy. This legislation is anti-gerrymandering legislation. This  legislation says that every State in the Union will have to have an  independent redistricting commission. No politicians involved.   They want the politicians to be involved. Amazingly, they embrace the  title of being the gerrymander party. They want to keep gerrymandering  because that is how they maintain their stranglehold on political  power.   The whole purpose of H.R. 1 is to liberate us from the gerrymandering  of our elections. That is why we start with independent redistricting  commissions. We move to publicly financed elections, because either the  big, wealthy, special interests are going to own the elections, or else  the people are going to own them through a small, donor-leveraged  system. And that is what we are doing. We have got ethics reform in  this legislation.     Mr. Speaker, I encourage, everyone to actually read the  terms of this landmark reform legislation, which insists upon ethics  reform at the Supreme Court, ethics reform in the executive branch,  empowering the Office of Government Ethics to have real subpoena power,  and to actually be able to ferret out the corruption which is engulfing  the Trump administration today, and to prevent corruption in the  future.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and  I rise to offer this amendment to H.R. 1.   For decades, the law prevented business corporations from engaging in  campaign spending. But the Supreme Court destroyed that prohibition  with its watershed decision in 2010, in the Citizens United case,  which, for the first time, defined for-profit business corporations as  political membership associations and, thereby, unleashed billions of  dollars in corporate treasury money into the political system.   Since then, corporations have taken advantage of this newfound  constitutional identity and political freedom by investing hundreds of  millions of dollars, perhaps billions, in campaign expenditures and the  torrent of ``dark money'' now coursing through the political system.   But who are these corporations speaking for?   Well, according to the court, they are speaking for the shareholders.  Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy took the position that  corporate political campaigning is on behalf of the shareholders, an  association of individuals who have taken on the corporate form.   But, in reality, we know that CEOs engage in political spending  without the knowledge, much less the consent of the shareholders whose  First Amendment rights are allegedly being exercised.   Anyone who has a retirement fund with money invested in corporate  equities will know that they have never been asked whether they want a  portion of their retirement money invested in Republican or Democratic  or other campaigns. The CEOs just do it without their participation.   What can be done to stop shareholders' money from being spent on  campaigns without their knowledge or consent?   Most Americans want a constitutional amendment to reverse Citizens  United and restore the definition of corporations as economic entities  barred from politics. But there is something that we can do right now,  short of that, simply by enforcing Citizens United on its own terms.  Justice Kennedy said the main check against abuse of this new right  would be exercised by the ``shareholders through the procedures of  corporate democracy.''   Justice Kennedy assumed a world of comprehensive and immediate  disclosure. He wrote: ``Shareholder objections raised through the  procedures of corporate democracy can be more effective today because  modern technology makes disclosures rapid and informative. With the  advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide  shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold  corporations and elected officials accountable . . . citizens can see  whether elected officials are in the pocket of so-called moneyed  interests.''   But the current system provides nothing like that kind of  transparency and accountability. This amendment, the Shareholders  United Act of 2019, will begin to change the secrecy, darkness, and  oligarchical implications of the current system.   It would require publicly-traded corporations to get shareholder buy- in on the front end before their money is channeled into political  campaigns. Companies would have to develop a process to assess  shareholder preferences for political spending, and make any such  spending within a year of assessing the majority's preferences.   Moreover, the amendment recognizes that some shareholders are  institutional investors, like pension funds, States, and cities, mutual  funds, universities or charities, which are categorically forbidden  from expressing partisan political preferences.   If this type of investor holds a majority of corporate shares, the  corporation would not be able to make expenditures from the general  treasury because the CEO, at that point, would paradoxically be  speaking for institutional shareholders that may not themselves speak  in politics.   Citizens are begging for this kind of commonsense regulation and  promotion of corporate democracy. People invest in the stock market to  save for retirement, or to send their kids to college, not to support  their favorite political candidates, much less their most disfavored  ones.   I know that I would be mad as hell to learn that my retirement money  was being spent, being given away to Donald Trump and the RNC; just as  I assume my GOP friends don't want their pension dollars going to the  DNC or to help Elizabeth Warren's Presidential campaign.   People who invest in the stock market should not be used as the pawns  for the political designs of CEOs. I urge my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to support this commonsense amendment called for by  Justice Kennedy's opinion in Citizens United.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for those thoughtful  comments. The ranking member of the House Administration Committee  contends that we talked about this in the House Administration  Committee which, indeed, we did, and it was precisely that discussion  which led to the formation of the amendment.   I am afraid there he is just protesting against the character of the  legislative process. We have a discussion; we learn things; we develop  new amendments. And for a moment there it sounded like he wanted to  vote for it, but then he turns to say that the problem with this  amendment is that it would politicize the corporation, which is quite  an astounding argument to make against it, when the entire purpose of  our amendment is to prevent corporations from engaging in political  expenditures and dark-money spending without the consent and the  knowledge of the shareholders.   If you object to corporations being engaged in partisan political  activity, then you should support this amendment, because it is  precisely this amendment that will prevent it from happening if the  shareholders don't want it to.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1730
