 Mr. President, as chair of the Senate Appropriations  Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and  Related Agencies, I would like to recognize an exceptional public  servant deeply committed to protecting and improving the health of the  American people, Mr. Lester Cash. Mr. Cash retired recently after a  distinguished 37-year career in the civil service, most of it spent at  the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Health and  Human Services. It is at HHS, where he was the Associate Deputy  Assistant Secretary for Budget since 2007, that I and my staff came to  depend upon Mr. Cash's expertise, wisdom, and judgement.    Mr. Cash is one of those unsung public servants whose analysis and  insights are relied upon equally by Democrats and Republicans in both  Chambers. He epitomizes the best of the professional civil service:  dedicated, credible and trusted by all who work with him. His unique  skills, starting with advanced degrees in public policy, philosophy,  and theology, have given Mr. Cash a perspective that is both broad and  sufficiently deep. His judgement on appropriations legal matters and  insight on legislative language was always sound, and his ready  responsiveness at any hour made him the vital go-to person for the  committees when time was tight. Whenever there was a complex question  that needs solving, he was the person to call, whether it was for  funding to respond to a natural disaster, meeting our obligations to  our September 11 first responders, or ensuring that unaccompanied  migrant children are treated humanely. Most recently, during the  pandemic, Mr. Cash was instrumental to removing obstacles to secure  COVID-19 tests, vaccines, and therapeutics for communities across the  country. It is not an exaggeration to say that millions of Americans  have been directly affected by his efforts and that his commitment  saved lives.    We are all better off because of Lester. His unyielding dedication  and institutional knowledge made him truly indispensable, and his  absence will be a loss for all of us who depend upon him. I am glad  that he will have more time to spend with his wife and son, Ada and  Brian, friends and family. He certainly deserves it, and I wish him the  best of luck in the future.                            ____________________
