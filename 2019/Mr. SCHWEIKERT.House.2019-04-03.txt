 Mr. Speaker, I promise not to go 60 minutes.   Continuing the series we have been trying to do on a much more, shall  we call it, wholistic policy of how to get a sort of unified theory of  what will make America's economy, opportunity, our ability to pay for  our promises, particularly over the next 30-some years, when our baby  boomers are in their retirement years.   This is, actually, sort of just another module on trying to help  sell, educate, convince, cajole, on that idea.   We always start with this particular poster now that our belief is  you sort of have five pillars on what we must do  [[Page H3062]]  almost immediately to have the economic growth and the mechanics to be  able to keep our promises.   Remember, basic math: We have 74 million baby boomers. We are now  about halfway through that 18-year cycle turning 65.   In 8\1/2\ years is the final portion of the baby boom turning 65. In  8\1/2\ years, half the spending, less interest, coming out of this  body, so 50 percent of the spending will be to those 65 and older. In  8\1/2\ years, there will be two workers for every one person in  retirement.   Understand what this means: If we don't have substantial economic  growth, substantial incentives to stay in the workplace, and also a  really disruptive cost curve in parts of healthcare, I defy you to make  the math work.                                time  1945    So we have actually sort of laid out five principles of policy, and  within those policies, there are lots of moving parts. We are going to  talk a little bit more of sort of the technology disruption, but we are  going to talk the other half of it from what we did 2 weeks ago.   But economic growth: What do you do in a tax system? What do you do  with trade? What do you do with smart regulations?   I have done presentations here about crowdsourcing data as a much  more elegant way to regulate; using block chain to collect data in  financial markets so you could actually have a much more rational, much  more reactive, much faster regulatory environment.   We also have on here, I use the term, ``population stability.''  Remember what has happened to the United States birth rates and where  we are going and where we are predicted to go.   In the last 10 years, there are 4 million children that we expected  who are not here. That is functionally 4 full years of immigration in  10. Are we willing to actually say it is time to go to a talent-based  immigration system with some flexibility in there to maximize  population stability? And on the other end, are we willing to also  adopt public policy that encourages family formation?   It is math, and it is math about the economic robustness of this  society.   Earned benefits: We are going to have to find ways that, as we keep  our promises on Social Security, if we keep our promises on Medicare,  are there inducements, incentives we can produce to say: Are you  willing to stay in the workforce longer, part-time? If you are healthy,  happy, capable, we want you. It makes a difference.   Are we able to give you certain incentives to postpone taking  benefits to actually help yourself, but also help the programs as they  function?   And then the last one under our five pillars is employment. How do we  maximize, as a society, participation in the workforce?   You know, we still have some data issues on millennial males. What  can we do to help them get into the workforce?   As you know, last December, we finally had a real breakthrough in  some of the data--we call it the U-6--employment data on millennial  females moving into the workforce. That is part of it.   We also want to encourage older Americans to stay in the workforce if  that is their choice.   But we also are starting to see something that is really exciting in  the labor statistics--I am sorry I am geeking out, and I know I am  sounding like an accountant on steroids, but these things are really  important--is our handicapped brothers and sisters. People who have  actually had substance abuse and other types of issues are actually  moving back into the workforce.   Behind this microphone I have talked about even the things going on  in Arizona right now, where we actually have private, paid-for job  training in our prisons because there is such a labor shortage, there  is such a skilled labor shortage in our community. That is actually  wonderful.   I mean, if you care about people, where we are at right now, our  ability to draw our brothers and sisters into the labor force for that  honor of work is an amazing thing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers).   Honoring the Life and Service of United States Army Sergeant Joseph P.                                  Collette     Mr. Speaker, look, those are always hard to do,  particularly, you know, when you want to reach out to the families in  your community and deal with those really difficult moments. So I  appreciate the gentleman, and I am always happy to yield. He has always  been very kind to me here.   All right. Back on to trying to help do our theme here. And I know it  is a little sarcastic, but it is sort of meant to have a little impact.  We often joke that we are operating in a math-free zone, and it is a  great frustration.   One of the neat things that has happened over these first couple of  months as we have been doing this sort of unified theory pitch--and we  keep trying to say it is not Republican or Democrat. It is math. A  number of my friends from the left have actually started to stop by the  office, particularly on the technology, which I am very excited,  because there is a revolution happening around us.    So let's actually sort of move on to one or two more boards just to  make sure that we have built the argument.   On this particular board--and I have shown this; I am going to keep  showing it--2008 to 2028, 91 percent of the increased spending--so when  you see that curve going up between that 2008 and 2028, 91 percent,  Social Security, healthcare entitlements, and interest.   Social Security, the healthcare entitlements, and interest--91  percent of the growth in spending for those 20 years.   So when we get here behind these microphones and we are often talking  about this or that, understand the vast majority of what is driving our  spending are our demographics. Our demographics are what drives Social  Security, Medicare, and the borrowing within those drives a tremendous  amount of the percentage of the debt.   So how do you build a robust enough economy and then enough  optionality in that growth with technology to also bend the cost on  healthcare?   So this particular slide is really important for us to get our heads  around, and this is the other side.   In the previous couple of weeks, we have done a series of  presentations here on the floor about the technology that is coming on  everything from wearables to autonomous healthcare to being able to  instantly have your flu diagnosed, and can we build a system, if we  would take down some of the legal barriers, where almost instantly your  antivirals can be delivered to you.   Think about blowing into something that looks like a flu kazoo. It  diagnoses you. It pings off your personal medical records and instantly  can order those antivirals.   How much healthier, how much more time do you have for your life, for  your family?  [[Page H3063]]    These are the types of disruptions we as a body--and it is not  Republican or Democrat. It is where technology is leading us, to make  our lives more convenient. That precious commodity of time is given  back to you, and we become healthier as a society while bending our  healthcare costs.   Well, this particular slide makes it very clear that we actually  believe about 75 percent of all of our spending--and we get this, I  believe, from the Centers for Disease Control. Seventy-five percent of  our healthcare spending is for chronic conditions.   Okay. So we actually know where our spending concentration is. So how  do we start to have a disruption in that?   And if you actually look at the growth of healthcare, this is  basically our spending in 2001 to 2017. But you see that line just  growing and growing and growing.   Well, a lot of that, we will immediately get people who say: Well,  that is pharmaceutical prices. Well, that is this. That is this.   It is substantially our demographics and then the procedures that  come along with that aging in society.   We will actually, in the future, if there is a request for it, we  will bring some of those boards and actually do more breakdown. But it  is just understanding we cannot survive if this line continues to grow  in that fashion.   Additionally, and just understanding these categories--and I am going  to push this back just a little bit because this particular board may  be unreadable from a distance, but it is really important.   What we are trying to explain here is, the green bars, the small  bars, think of these as chronic conditions that have never been  diagnosed; the blue are where they have been diagnosed; and the total  cost in our society.   When you look at this, what would happen if I could come to you and  say, for a number of these, there are ways to manage hypertension.  There are ways for someone like myself that is a pretty severe  asthmatic to manage my asthma. There may be cures on the very short  horizon coming for many of the diseases we consider chronic conditions.   Part of what I want to talk about tonight is the second half: How do  we finance the miracles that this body in previous years, when we did  the CURES Act, when we actually did the specialty, the financing, the  research resources for orphan diseases--it is starting to pay off. Many  of the policies, actually, the Republican Members here did in previous  years with the previous President are starting to pay off.   So think about this--and I may have my date wrong; I am desperately  hoping it is by the end of this year--a single-shot cure for hemophilia  A. So our brothers and sisters, and there are only about 8,000 in the  United States who have hemophilia, but it is a population that is very  expensive for the blood clotting factor, for the other medical  maintenance for that population, for our brothers and sisters.   How about a single shot that cures? What would we, as a society, be  willing to pay for that curative?   How do we finance it? What if it is a $1.5 million a shot? Let's just  sort of theorize here.   But in about a 5-, 6-year period of time, it has actually more than  paid for itself. Just, you know, the tyranny of basic accounting: How  do we say today we want a system where we can finance these disruptive  pharmaceuticals so we can start to change parts of these chronic  populations so we do something that is curative?   One of the discussions we have been working on in our office for  almost 2 or 3 years now is the concept of, we will call it a healthcare  bond that says we are going to reach out, do a census of the  populations of, hey, these many individuals with this particular  disease that this pharmaceutical would cure or dramatically improve  their lives--some are on Medicare; some are on Medicaid; some are on  private insurance; some are at the VA. We need to do that census and  then do sort of an assessment over time to have what would have been  their normal cost pay back that bond.   The trickier policy set here--let's go back to our hemophilia  example: 8,000 population, a single shot cures the disease. How do you  price it?   This is going to be an intellectually robust discussion we are going  to have to have. We have other things in our society we price. A  baseball player who is phenomenal, you would do certain types of  arbitration.   We could actually take a look at everything from the research costs,  to the future benefits, to the incentives to continue this type of  research, to the health benefits of having that population cured.   There has got to be a formula we can come up with as a society where  we continue to encourage these incredible miracle disruptions that are  on the horizon. We need more of them because they start to solve this  chart's problem.   Remember the previous one, the pie chart. Seventy-five percent of our  spending, functionally, is within those chronic conditions. What  happens if we start to cure them, or at least a portion of them?   It is time this body stops having the crazy debate we have had here  for the last 10 years, which is the ACA. It is even our Republican  alternative, which I believe had some great things in it.   But we have been having this debate about who gets to pay. We have  not been having the discussion, the intellectually honest discussion of  what do we do to pay less and provide more?                                time  2000    That is my goal here. If these miracle biologicals, if these miracle  genetic treatments, are coming, how do we get them adopted into our  society as fast as possible?   In many ways, as we saw in the first phase of the hep C cure--what  was the drug, Sovaldi? In that first year, year and a half, it cost  $84,000, I believe, but it cured hepatitis C, meaning you did not need  a liver transplant. But what happened? We had a number of our State  Medicaid systems that were on the verge of going bankrupt.   The difference in that sort of pharmaceutical is you had time before  someone became symptomatic where liver transplant was indicated. And  then we knew there was a second pharmaceutical with some of the same  efficacy coming.   What happens when there is not going to be a second drug, because it  is a small population or it had such stunning research costs?   We need to think through how we finance disruptions of those  pharmaceuticals and how we also get a fair pricing so the research  continues. We incentivize that, but also a fair pricing to society,  which is willing to put on debt for a quick adoption and then use the  future savings.   So understand, what is neat about this, if you actually look at these  diagnoses with serious chronic conditions, a number of them can be  partially benefited by technology.   Once again, I am a pretty severe asthmatic. We have played with a  couple of contraptions that help me manage my blood oxygen.   What happens if that contraption can talk to my phone and say: ``Hey,  David, this morning, you really need to take two puffs of your inhaled  steroid.''   ``Hey, David, we are doing some calculations. Today, you don't.''   As you have already seen, you may even have family members who are  now reading off their phones about their diabetes, because they have a  port that is reading their blood glucose.   Technology can help us manage a number of these chronic conditions to  make them so they don't crash, so they are not catastrophic for the  individual and not expensive for society.   If you have hypertension, how many of you may have an arrhythmia that  you now have a watch that will help you manage? Those are on the  technology side.   On some of these, it is the curative that I really wanted to get into  our understanding, the other half of the miracle disruption that is  coming in healthcare.   We need, as policymakers, to understand these are the benefits we are  now yielding because of a lot of really good policy decisions this body  made over the last few years.   Let's move on to a couple more boards to try to help this argument  become a little more robust.   This was the best one I had, but let's go back to the hemophilia  discussion. Can we use this example that is on our immediate horizon?   I believe they are already well in or through their phase III. They  have had,  [[Page H3064]]  apparently, just from even the latest article I pulled up a couple days  ago, amazing efficacy. It is curative for the vast majority of the  population, something we never really thought of.   Are we ready as a society to say: Can we build the box of how we  finance these disruptions?   Let's walk through a couple others.   How many of you have heard of some of the gene therapies where we can  turn on your immune system, but we turn it on in such a way--well, the  medical researchers, by understanding the type of cancer you have,  looking at that cancer and saying, hey, here are the receptors that  your immune system would do the most efficient--how do I describe it?-- the most efficient method of killing those cancers. What if that costs  $250,000, $500,000, but it cures?   How about in some of these cases? Now we are looking at this  particular one. This is from earlier in the year or late last year, a  pharmaceutical biological that changes a genetic form of blindness. You  are born with this blindness on your DNA, and it recodes your DNA and  brings back a substantial portion of your sight. What is the value of  that?   There are some unique things. I believe it may be within this gene  editing. Actually, it is really expensive. I think it may have been  $400,000 or $500,000 for a certain number of the patients. It was  almost you only paid if we hit a certain level of returning your sight.   What happens when we are able to do more of this, that it is more  than just a disease you have developed, and we are actually recoding  parts of your own personal genome to deal with a genetic blindness that  you were born with? How much does this help society? How much, as a  society, are we willing to pay?   When we pay it, is there a way we can have a financing mechanism that  the adoption of such miracles happen quickly, and we can reap the  benefits in future time? That is the concept for the healthcare bond.   Let's take one that actually is near and dear to me. I am from the  desert Southwest. I am from the Phoenix-Scottsdale area. I live in a  little community called Fountain Hills, a wonderful part of the  country. I am incredibly blessed for the community I get to represent  and live in.   But from the desert areas of California through Maricopa County,  Phoenix, Pinal, all the way down to the Tucson area, we have fungi in  the soil. We call it Valley Fever.   We believe one out of three people who go to a hospital believing  they have pneumonia actually have the fungi, have Valley Fever in their  lungs.   For a small fraction of the population, they don't just feel like  they have pneumonia for a week or 2 or 3. They get something, I believe  the term is ``undifferentiated,'' where it breaks out and ends up in  your bones.   I have a neighbor, a former Vietnam helicopter pilot, one of the  greatest human beings you can ever meet. His hands have been carved up  from when they have had to go in and remove the fungi that is growing  in his bones.    Leader McCarthy, Kevin McCarthy, because of the community he  represents, and myself in the Scottsdale-Phoenix area, a few years ago,  we started a Valley Fever Caucus for those of us who live in the desert  Southwest. We have had some amazing success.   We have been able to move some resources. We have gotten the folks  back East here to understand this very unique regional disease we have.  We were able to move some money, and all of a sudden, we now are  hearing that we may be 3 years from a vaccine for animals.   This particular disease killed my dog, Charlie, a few years ago.   But after the vaccine for our canines and our pets, it is only a  short time after that, maybe just a handful of years, that we will  collect enough data that we will have fungi vaccine for something  called Valley Fever for those of us who live in the desert Southwest.   These are examples. We believe a disease like that ultimately costs  billions in our communities for hospital visits, for sick days, for all  the things that go with that.   What is the value of a vaccine that is being developed for an orphan  disease like that that most folks back East have never even heard of?   We have succeeded at moving the resources around here in Congress  over the last few years to start these miracles of the genomic and the  other types of research that are bringing these miracles here.   Back to our primary conversation. As we age as a society, our biggest  cost driver, particularly over the next 30 years, is healthcare. We  have done presentations here the last few weeks on the technology  miracles that are coming, where you can manage your own health. You  don't have to be part of the collective. You can manage your own health  and have incredible data. But we are going to have to break down some  of the old silos, some of the old legislative barriers, some of the  barriers to entry.   The other half of that is how we continue to encourage these  disruptive biologicals, these disruptive genomics, these disruptive  drugs that are curative.   The one that was in our office a couple weeks ago, talking about ALS,  it is probably going to be a couple shots a year, but it will freeze.  You will hold steady. So it is not curative, but it stops the  regression and the progression of the disease. What is the value to  that in our society?   These are big deals. As I reach out to my Republican brothers and  sisters and my Democrats, help those of us who understand these cures  are not Republican or Democrat. We as a society must come up with the  mechanisms that bring them out, finance them, and then understand the  debate here must be about what we are doing to change the price curve  of healthcare at the same time our demographics are getting much older  very, very, very fast. We can do that.   It is a much more elegant discussion than the absolutely ridiculous  discussion that continues to go on here because it works in our  partisan format where everything here has been weaponized now  politically of let's have a fine debate on who gets to pay, how much  government subsidy should you receive.   Let's do something really creative. Let's start lowering the price by  bringing technology, by bringing other channels of exciting new  pharmaceuticals, and even down to things that are affecting the folks  in my neighborhood, a disease like Valley Fever, where I now get to go  home and say we worked on it a few years ago. We were not optimistic,  but we kept working and we kept working and we kept working. There are  brilliant people down at the University of Arizona Center for  Excellence on Valley Fever. There are researchers at NAU. There are  researchers in California who are now almost there.   There should be joy in this body when you start to think about the  cusp we are on. Will Congress be looked at by someone 10, 20 years from  now, saying they did policy that actually made these things happen  faster? Or will we continue to exist in a world where the way we  reimburse, the way we finance, the way we regulate, the barriers to  entry of the technology, we slowed down the disruption that could have  helped us lower healthcare costs?   These are the things we are fixated on, because remember our five  points: We must have the robust economic growth. We must have the labor  force participation. We must do the incentives to, if someone wishes to  stay in the labor force and delay parts of their retirement, how do we  reward that? We must do these others, but we also must push these  technologies, because our biggest fragility is the healthcare costs.   I think there are some great things about to happen. Look, that is a  portion of the presentation. Hopefully, in a couple weeks, we are going  to come back and we are going to do something much more technical--I am  sorry; I know that is really exciting--on some of those incentives to  stay in the workforce. But we need to understand, if you have a  complicated problem and someone walks up to you and gives you a really  simple solution, it is absolutely wrong, because complicated problems  require complicated solutions.   That is where we are headed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H3065]]                                ____________________
