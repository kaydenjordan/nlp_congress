 Mr. Speaker, it is clear everybody supports this  legislation. All of my police departments, all of my sheriffs, all  support this legislation.   I urge my colleagues to pass the Law Enforcement De-Escalation  Training Act, a bill I am proud to co-lead with my friend, Los Angeles'  new mayor, Karen Bass.   By funding improved training for police calls involving individuals  suffering from mental or behavioral health issues, we make our  communities safer.   Up to 10 percent of all police encounters involve a person  experiencing serious mental health issues.   This bill will equip our officers with skills that better secure the  safety of our citizens and our first responders. That is what matters.   De-escalation improves the trust between law enforcement and the  community they are sworn to protect. That is what matters.   Building safer communities and protecting lives. That is what  matters.   After passing unanimously in the Senate, this effort deserves similar  support in the House. I thank Senators Cornyn and Whitehouse, and  Representatives Bass, Chabot, and Issa for their leadership on this  bill.    Mr. Speaker, it is time we do right by our officers in our  community.
