 Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of a time in Texas when we  were at a breakfast, and we had two groups. We had a group that was  very close to Jeb Bush, the Governor of Florida, and one that was close  to George W. Bush.   Mrs. Bush was our guest speaker, and she spoke. When she opened up  for questions, one of the questions was: Mrs. Bush, a lot of us in here  know Jeb better than George; we know George better than Jeb. How are  they alike? How do they differ?   Mrs. Bush said she had been blessed to have a great family, but she  said these words: You could put all my boys together, and they would  not equal their father.   I thought that was powerful.   On November 30, 2018, America lost a great servant, and I lost a  great friend.   President Bush epitomized everything wonderful about America, and  like his country, he was tough, strong, and kind.   Over the years, I was able to get to know the President and his  family very well. My family and I had the opportunity to visit them in  Kennebunkport many summers. Our days were spent playing basketball and  sailing on the water, sharing and listening to President Bush's stories  until the sun went down.   I remember one basketball game. My daughters were playing, and they  didn't have any tennis shoes. Mrs. Bush went and got her tennis shoes  and gave them to my daughters. When they began to shoot, there were  vines that had grown up on the basketball goal, and she made the  President get hedge clippers and clip the vines down before the girls  could shoot baskets.   What a man he was. I am grateful for these priceless moments with  President Bush that exist now only as memories, and great memories.   In addition to traveling together as friends, we also shared a love  for baseball. I was proud to be awarded with his award, the George H.W.  Bush Distinguished Alumnus Award, by the National College Baseball Hall  of Fame. To this day, I wear a ring that has his name on it.   It was during our baseball days that something very interesting  happened. We were having lunch one day in his office at College  Station, and it was myself; President Bush; Jean Becker, his chief of  staff; and Drake McLane, who owned the Astros. President Bush, just out  of nowhere, said: I need to bring something up that I have gotten no  credit for.   Ms. Becker said: No, don't go there, Mr. President.   He said: No, I am going to go there.                                time  1930    And Ms. Becker said: No, don't go there, Mr. President.   And he said: No, I am going to go there. There is plenty of time  between that.   He said: I said a statement that I get no credit for, and that  statement is, ``You da man.''   He explained that he was at an Astros game--it was actually the Colt  .45s in 1961--and they had a player named Rusty Staub. Rusty Staub  wanted to meet President Bush. After the game, Staub came toward  President Bush, who then was not President, and President Bush said: I  don't know why I said it and don't know what it meant, but when he came  closer to me, I said, ``You da man.''   Drayton McLane said: Well, if you haven't got any credit for it, we  are playing the Dodgers tomorrow night, we will put on the diamond  vision your picture, and we will put, ``You da man.''   The next night, they did, and he got that credit for ``You da man.''   So I would just say to the President, and I think we would all agree:  Mr. President, you da man.   We had a relationship that was very unique and very dear to my heart.  This great man served as a mentor to me and had a huge impact on my  life. In fact, he was the reason I am standing here before all of you  today.   When I was contemplating running to represent Texas' 25th  Congressional District, I called President Bush for advice. He  encouraged me to run and gave me the push that I needed. I will never  forget it. Years ago, I announced my congressional campaign in his  office with him by my side sitting next to me, and the rest in my world  is history.   I am forever grateful to President Bush. He has been an inspiration  throughout my life. He has been like a father. Whether it be in my  faith or in my path to public service, he was very kind to me.   He was the first person to call me while I was in the hospital after  the baseball shooting back in June of 2016. He said he was praying for  me and praying for our team. Two days later, he called to check on me  again.   He has always answered the phone to offer his sage wisdom when I  called and given me his advice, and I truly miss him terribly.   Over a week has gone by now that our country has been without one of  the greatest Americans to ever live. This is an immeasurable loss for  America, but I am comforted knowing that he has been reunited with his  beloved Barbara and their daughter Robin.   It has been a true honor to experience life with President Bush in  it. Our country is better because of him, I am better because of him,  and my family is better because of him.   He once said, and we have all heard it: Public service is the most  noble calling of all. And he answered that call. Each and every day, I  am praying for the entire Bush family, as we all are, and I hope they  find peace during this difficult time.   One more story.   We were in Fort Worth one day and he spoke. He found out that one of  our civic leaders was not doing well, from a health standpoint. We got  in the car. He had his cell phone, and he dialed the number. A lady  that worked in his house answered the phone, and he asked to speak to  this gentleman. She held a minute, and the wife of this gentleman got  on the phone.   He said: This is President Bush. I would like to speak to your  husband.   She said: He cannot speak.   He said: Well, take this phone into his bedroom right now, and I want  to tell him I love him.   That is the kind of man President Bush was.   So God bless President Bush, God bless this family, and God bless  America.
