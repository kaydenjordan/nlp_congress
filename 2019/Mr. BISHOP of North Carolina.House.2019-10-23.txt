 Madam Speaker, I was unable to attend  votes between October 15 and 23 due to a long standing family  committment. While this would not have change the outcome, below is how  I would have voted on each roll call.   Had I been present, I would have voted: ``yea'' on rollcall No. 576,  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 577, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 578, ``nay'' on  rollcall No. 579, and ``nay'' on rollcall No. 580.                             personal explanation
