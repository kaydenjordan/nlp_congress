 Madam Speaker, tonight, will be the last scheduled meeting  of the partisan Committee on January 6th.   As my neighbors in middle Tennessee struggle with the skyrocketing  cost of living, I can't help but think Congress' time and energy should  be focused on the issues on most Americans' minds, not another  political witch hunt.   If the committee had any legitimacy, it would allow Leader McCarthy  to seek the Republicans of his choosing. Speaker Pelosi made the  unprecedented decision to not do so.   If it had any legitimacy, the committee would be investigating what  caused the events to unfold that day, what led to the breach of  security, and what can we do to learn from these failures to prepare  for the future.   Unfortunately, I don't think the committee has done its job to ask  these important questions.   Tennesseans are smart and see this process as what it is: a partisan  witch hunt in the form of a sham investigation.                            ____________________
