 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pallone for yielding to me and  for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, while I believe that we need to do a lot more to combat  the opioid and addiction epidemic, I am pleased with some of the  specific steps being taken today to help communities. I specifically  rise in support of legislation I coauthored with Congresswoman Lynn  Jenkins on H.R. 3331.   In order to solve the root cause of addiction, we need more access to  behavioral health in our communities, and we need to treat mental  health and substance use disorder like diseases. That means integrating  care and services for those conditions into the healthcare system. It  means treating a person as a whole person.   Physical and mental health conditions interplay and should be treated  as such. We cannot have a truly integrated system with the care  coordination we envision if behavioral health providers don't have  electronic health records. We must work to harness the power of  technology to improve the accessibility of behavioral health treatment,  particularly in underserved communities.   This bipartisan bill will incentivize behavioral health providers to  adopt electronic health record technology. The Senate version of the  bill, led by Senators Whitehouse and Portman, passed by unanimous  consent last month, so I hope that we can continue the momentum around  this legislation with the passage of H.R. 3331 today.   Before I close, I want to reiterate how important it is for my  Republican colleagues to join us in doing more. We need to protect and  expand Medicaid, build on ACA successes in terms of access to  behavioral healthcare, and fund treatment and prevention efforts in our  local communities. We have a long way to go. This is a really good  start, and I implore my colleagues to work with us as we move forward.
