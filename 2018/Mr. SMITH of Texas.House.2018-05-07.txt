 Mr. Speaker, here are some excerpts from the  book, ``Presidential Courage,'' by Michael Beschloss that might sound  familiar:   ``Andrew Jackson said, `I was born for the storm, and calm does not  suit me.' ''   ``Warned that some decision of his would risk a public clamor,  Jackson once said, `I care nothing about clamors, sir. . . . I do  precisely what I think just and right.' ''   ``Theodore Roosevelt genuinely thought of himself as a gladiator  against evil. . . . Like Andrew Jackson, he was taking a large risk by  challenging the citadels of wealth and power.''   ``T.R. boasted that the `farmers, mechanics, small tradesmen,  hardworking professional men' all considered him `their President'. . .  . ''   ``Roosevelt had always inveighed against the `lies' in the press `as  foul and dirty . . . as ever was made by any dog.' ''   To me, President Trump is carrying on the legacies of Presidents  Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt.                            ____________________
