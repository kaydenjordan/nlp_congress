 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Takano for his  leadership. I am glad that veterans can still bring this House  together.   Mr. Speaker, I was honored to work with Speaker McCarthy back in 2017  on the pilot program, which has been a resounding success to provide  veterans who serve this Nation with a technology skill so they can get  jobs when they are back in the United States.   There was an 84 percent graduation rate, 12,000 veterans have been  helped by this program, and the average salary was $65,000. These are  the types of things that we need to do in the House, bringing the House  together to actually improve veterans' lives.   I appreciate Representative Ciscomani's leadership, and I look  forward to this program being permanent and hopefully expanded so  veterans who serve our Nation, who do the highest duty, have the  opportunity to have secure livings when they are back at home.
