 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, each year, an estimated 58,000 pregnant women pass  through jails and prisons in the United States. H.R. 6878 would expand  on existing programs within the Bureau of Prisons to provide certain  health and wellness-related services for pregnant incarcerated women.  This legislation will help these women receive necessary medical care,  nutrition, and support while in Federal custody.   In addition, H.R. 6878 builds upon President Trump's leadership in  the First Step Act, which prohibited the use of restraints on pregnant  women in Federal custody.   H.R. 6878 would prohibit pregnant women in Federal custody from being  placed in restrictive housing unless their behavior poses a serious and  immediate risk of physical harm. It also would prohibit the use of  solitary confinement for pregnant women in their third trimester.   The bill also expands data reporting on the health needs of pregnant  incarcerated women and requires guidelines for the treatment of  incarcerated women during pregnancy, labor, and postpartum recovery.   We all believe that pregnant incarcerated women should be well cared  for while they are in Federal custody. However, I would like to note  the concern that the bill could require the Bureau of Prisons to  provide abortifacients to pregnant inmates. However, the word  ``contraception'' is not defined in the bill, and the internal Bureau  of Prisons policy does not define ``contraception.''   Because the word ``contraception'' is not defined, this ambiguity  leaves open the reasonable interpretation that the term  ``contraception'' could include abortifacients or other substances that  induce abortion.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment allows certain women in  Federal custody to receive counseling related to postpartum health  conditions. Postpartum women in Federal custody will be eligible to  receive counseling services related to postpartum health conditions.   After giving birth, many women struggle with postpartum depression  and other psychological and physical conditions. This amendment will  ensure that women in Federal custody have access to these services.   While many of us have concerns with some of the other language in the  bill, this amendment is a commonsense amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
