 Mr. President, before I begin my remarks concerning the  Women's Health Protection Act, I want to state for the record that  given Justice Kennedy's announcement today that he will retire, and  there will therefore be a vacancy on the Supreme Court, any nominee for  the Supreme Court must be committed to protecting the rights of all  Americans, including the reproductive rights of women. Nominees can't  just be focused on protecting corporate special interests and the  powerful few. I also continue to believe that Supreme Court nominees  should have broad support from both political parties and be able to  clear a 60-vote threshold. A strong and independent judiciary that is  above politics and is willing to stop abuses of power is more important  than ever given that our current President regularly disregards  established democratic norms and voices contempt for constitutional  safeguards.                              Women's Healthcare    Mr. President, with this attention on the Supreme Court, it is  appropriate that I rise on the 2-year anniversary of a critical victory  for women and families across our Nation.   Two years ago, the Supreme Court's ruling in Whole Woman's Health v.  Hellerstedt reaffirmed that every woman has the right to make her own  healthcare decisions and chart her own destiny. This decision preserved  women's access to critical health services and reinforced that placing  an undue burden on abortion access violates the 14th Amendment of the  Constitution.   Unfortunately, despite the fact that the Court has made this clear,  politicians in Washington and in States across our country have made it  their mission to undermine women's access to safe and legal abortions.  Here in Congress, we have seen bill after bill that marginalizes women  and restricts their fundamental rights, and my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle have confirmed Trump administration officials and  judges who are vehemently opposed to women having the freedom to make  their own healthcare decisions.   Additionally, State legislatures have pushed a number of burdensome  restrictions. Politicians have pushed these restrictions under the  guise of protecting women's health, but in the Whole Woman's Health  case, the Supreme Court called their bluff and stated that the real  point of these State laws was to deny women access to care.   Unfortunately, many States have remained persistent in their efforts.  Since that 2016 decision, State legislatures have introduced 1,039  restrictive bills and have passed 180 of them. These bills have focused  on everything from closing abortion clinics to criminalizing providers  who offer reproductive health services. No matter their ZIP codes,  women deserve equal access to care, but it is clear that there will  continue to be attempts from politicians to violate women's rights.   With all of these relentless attacks, it is evident that what we need  is Federal legislation that protects women's access to care in every  State throughout our Nation. That is why, last year, I was proud to  join with dozens of my Democratic colleagues to introduce the Women's  Health Protection Act.   This legislation is vital because it protects women from the  burdensome requirements that States are enacting. It would invalidate  laws that require women to endure unnecessary tests and procedures and  would invalidate laws that prevent doctors from prescribing and  dispensing medication that is medically appropriate. Above all, the  Women's Health Protection Act would ensure that women across the  country receive safe, medically sound care if they choose to have an  abortion.   At a time when politicians in Washington and in State legislatures  continue to marginalize women, I will continue to fight for the Women's  Health Protection Act because women deserve respect when making their  most deeply personal healthcare decisions, and they have to have the  full independence to do so.                    Tribute to Master Sergeant Lee Hirtle    Mr. President, I rise to recognize retired Air Force MSgt Lee Hirtle,  who is also a retired New Hampshire State Trooper of Northfield, NH, as  the June Granite Stater of the month for his incredible dedication to  honoring our servicemembers and veterans who have passed.   Over a decade ago, at a military funeral, Master Sergeant Hirtle  noticed that ``Taps,'' the traditional bugle call performed at military  funerals, was playing from a CD player that was hidden behind a  gravestone. When he returned home from the funeral, Master Sergeant  Hirtle went to his basement and dusted off his old trumpet--an  instrument he had not touched since he had been a college student. He  taught himself to play ``Taps'' and practiced until he was skilled  enough to play at the funerals of fellow veterans and servicemembers.   Since playing at his first funeral in 2007, he has sounded ``Taps''  over 3,650 times across the Northeast.   When asked why he continues to sound ``Taps,'' Master Sergeant Hirtle  talked about his first military funeral. At that funeral, he stood  alongside a New Hampshire National Guard member named CPL Scott Dimond.  A year later, after Corporal Dimond was killed while serving in  Afghanistan, Master Sergeant Hirtle sounded ``Taps'' at his funeral. As  the master sergeant said, servicemembers like Corporal Dimond--and all  of our veterans--deserve the live version of ``Taps.''   We can never fully repay those who have served or have made the  ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedom, but we must commit  ourselves to honoring those sacrifices. Master Sergeant Hirtle does  that and is a true embodiment of that commitment. For his dedication to  honoring those who served, I am so proud to recognize him as the  Granite Stater of the month.   I yield the floor.
