 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 366) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the  Under Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland Security  to make certain improvements in managing the Department's vehicle  fleet, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 366         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Stop Asset and Vehicle       Excess Act'' or the ``DHS SAVE Act''.       SEC. 2. DHS VEHICLE FLEETS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I stand before you in support of H.R. 366, the DHS Stop Asset and  Vehicle Excess, or DHS SAVE, Act of 2016.   In October of 2015, the DHS inspector general released a scathing  report of the Federal Protective Service's management of their vehicle  fleet, a report that reads like a laundry list of poor management  decisions. The IG found that the FPS had more vehicles than officers,  and officers were authorized to drive from home to work with  government-owned vehicles and, actually, put more miles on the vehicles  in driving from home and back to work than they did on the job, among  many other things. Additionally, the report stated that the FPS was not  in compliance with Federal and departmental compliance, which is why I  introduced the DHS SAVE Act.   This bill improves the management of DHS' vehicle fleets by  authorizing the Under Secretary for Management at the headquarters  level to oversee the components' vehicle fleets, requires the  components to evaluate their fleets on an ongoing basis, includes  penalties for the mismanagement of component fleets, and requires the  DHS to identify alternative methods for the management of component  fleets. With the second largest civilian vehicle fleet in the Federal  Government, the DHS simply must have stricter controls in place at the  headquarters level in order to rein in rogue components.   As the new administration scrutinizes the DHS' operations, this bill  will provide important authorities to root out waste, fraud, and abuse  from the Department.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague for her hard work on  this bill and for her bipartisan spirit in getting it to the floor with  me.   I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 366.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 347) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide for  requirements relating to documentation for major acquisition programs,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 347         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Acquisition       Documentation Integrity Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION                     DOCUMENTATION.         (a) In General.--Title VII of the Homeland Security Act of       2002 (6 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end       the following new section:       ``SEC. 708. ACQUISITION DOCUMENTATION.         ``(a) In General.--For each major acquisition program, the       Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary for Management,       shall require the head of a relevant component or office to--        ``(1) maintain acquisition documentation that is complete,       accurate, timely, and valid, and that includes, at a       minimum--        ``(A) operational requirements that are validated       consistent with departmental policy and changes to such       requirements, as appropriate;        ``(B) a complete lifecycle cost estimate with supporting       documentation;        ``(C) verification of such lifecycle cost estimate against       independent cost estimates, and reconciliation of any       differences;        ``(D) a cost-benefit analysis with supporting       documentation; and        ``(E) a schedule, including, as appropriate, an integrated       master schedule;        ``(2) prepare cost estimates and schedules for major       acquisition programs, as required under subparagraphs (B) and       (E), in a manner consistent with best practices as identified       by the Comptroller General of the United States; and        ``(3) submit certain acquisition documentation to the       Secretary to produce an annual comprehensive report on the       status of departmental acquisitions for submission to       Congress.        ``(b) Waiver.--On a case-by-case basis with respect to any       major acquisition program under this section, the Secretary       may waive the requirement under paragraph (3) of subsection       (a) for a fiscal year if either--        ``(1) such program has not--        ``(A) entered the full rate production phase in the       acquisition lifecycle;        ``(B) had a reasonable cost estimate established; and        ``(C) had a system configuration defined fully; or        ``(2) such program does not meet the definition of capital       asset, as such term is defined by the Director of the Office       of Management and Budget.        ``(c) Congressional Oversight.--At the same time the       President's budget is submitted for a fiscal year under       section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, the       Secretary shall make information available, as applicable, to       the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate regarding the requirement       described in subsection (a) in the prior fiscal year that       includes the following specific information regarding each       major acquisition program for which the Secretary has issued       a waiver under subsection (b):        ``(1) The grounds for granting a waiver for such program.        ``(2) The projected cost of such program.        ``(3) The proportion of a component's or office's annual       acquisition budget attributed to such program, as available.        ``(4) Information on the significance of such program with       respect to the component's or office's operations and       execution of its mission.        ``(d) Major Acquisition Program Defined.--In this section,       the term `major acquisition program' means a Department       acquisition program that is estimated by the Secretary to       require an eventual total expenditure of at least       $300,000,000 (based on fiscal year 2017 constant dollars)       over its lifecycle cost.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101 et       seq.) is amended by adding after the item related to section       707 the following new item:  ``Sec. 708. Acquisition documentation.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 347, the Department of Homeland Security  Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act. This legislation requires the  Department of Homeland Security to improve the management of its major  purchases of systems to secure the border, better screen travelers,  protect our shores, and other vital missions.   Too often, the DHS has failed to document what these programs will  cost, when they will be complete, and what they actually will deliver.  It is unacceptable to spend billions of taxpayer dollars and not  document this very basic but important information. H.R. 347 will help  our committee and congressional watchdogs hold the Department  accountable and ensure taxpayer dollars are being spent in both an  efficient and effective manner. Safeguarding Americans' hard-earned tax  dollars is why our constituents sent us here in the first place.   I commend Ranking Member Watson Coleman for her leadership on this  issue, and I ask all Members to join me in supporting this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, commend my good friend and  [[Page H791]]  colleague from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) on her hard work in  offering this viable and meaningful solution.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 347.   I yield back the balance of my time.
