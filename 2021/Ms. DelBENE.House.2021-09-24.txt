 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Women's  Health Protection Act, a historic vote which will cement the right to  abortion in the United States.   The impending cases before the Supreme Court are proof that the  assault on women and Roe are real, and Congress must step up. Women  have a right to full reproductive healthcare, including abortion.  Lawmakers have a responsibility to uphold this right.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Women's  Health Protection Act.
