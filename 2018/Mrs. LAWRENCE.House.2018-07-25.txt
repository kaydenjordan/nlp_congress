 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against H.R. 6311.   This bill does no favor for the average working American. This is yet  another bill to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and make healthcare  more expensive for those who need it the most.   Expanding these health savings accounts, which are simply investment  accounts, doesn't cover basic healthcare. It does not help the average  American who needs true healthcare.   This Republican legislation will not help my constituents in  Michigan. It does not serve the need of access to healthcare for  America's most vulnerable. The bill does not serve seniors either. It  hurts them by drawing Medicare recipients into high-cost care.   In Michigan, 92 percent of Medicare beneficiaries make under $50,000,  and 14 percent are Black seniors who live below the poverty line. We  know seniors can't afford this.   We also know this bill will drain more money from Medicare by adding  $60 billion to the deficit.   We need affordable care for everyone, not unaffordable health plans  for a few. This bill would destabilize and destroy affordable  healthcare.
