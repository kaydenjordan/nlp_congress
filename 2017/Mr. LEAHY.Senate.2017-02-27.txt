 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I have been concerned. As I read the  press and talk with officials, I learn more about the troubling  connections between the Russian Government and President Trump's  campaign and administration.   We already knew--it is very, very factual--that Russian President  Putin ordered a multifaceted campaign to undermine public faith in our  election and to help President Trump win in November. That is something  all of us as Americans should be concerned about. Whether you are a  Republican, a Democrat, or an Independent, when you have that kind of  an attack on our democracy, it is a concern to all of us.   Reports indicate that Trump officials were in repeated contact with  senior Russian intelligence officials during this time. This comes on  the heels of the President's National Security Advisor having to resign  after providing misleading details on conversations he had with the  Russian Ambassador concerning U.S. sanctions. But there is a lot we  still don't know, including the extent of the contacts, who directed  them, whether people who at one point or another left the Trump  campaign were involved, whether there was collusion, and, of course,  the obvious question: What did the President know and when he did he  know it?   The American people deserve to know the facts. They deserve a full  and fair investigation that is free from any political influence. The  White House has already demonstrated it is not going to respect the  independence of this investigation. The fact that the White House Chief  of Staff attempted to use the FBI--in violation of Justice Department  policies--to suppress news reports about Russian contacts reveals why  we really can't trust the White House to play by the rules. And, of  course, the rules are very, very clear.   For these reasons, I am calling on Attorney General Sessions to step  aside on this issue and to appoint a special counsel to conduct an  independent investigation. That is not an attack on Attorney General  Sessions. I have known him for 30 years. I just want to make sure we do  not have these continuing questions about what the President knew and  when he knew it.   Even a cursory review of the Justice Department's recusal standards  reveals that the Attorney General does not--indeed, cannot--have the  independence necessary to assure wary Americans that this investigation  will be driven by the facts, not by relationships. Certainly those who  have served as prosecutors--Attorney General Sessions has; I have--know  that there are times when the prosecutor has to step aside and let  someone else do it just so that everybody can be confident in the  investigation.   In fact, Justice Department regulations mandate that ``no employee  shall participate in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has  a personal or political relationship with . . . [a]ny person or  organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject  of the investigation.'' Of course, a ``political relationship'' is  defined as ``a close identification with an elected official . . .  arising from service as a principal adviser thereto.'' Prior to his  confirmation, when we were holding the confirmation hearings on then- Senator Jeff Sessions, I asked him whether he met the standard. It is  not really a close call. The rule perfectly describes the relationship  between Attorney General Sessions and President Trump. But he brushed  the question off, claiming that he was ``merely . . . a supporter of  the President's during the campaign.''   Well, that is an obvious mischaracterization of the role he played as  a top adviser to the Trump campaign. Attorney General--then-Senator-- Sessions was widely recognized as a central figure in the campaign. He  had his fingerprints all over the President's policies. In fact, one of  the President's top advisers, Steve Bannon, even called him the  President's ``clearinghouse for policy and philosophy.'' That is a  pretty close connection. I could hardly think of anything closer. To  suggest the Attorney General was just ``a supporter'' and that he did  not have a ``political relationship'' with the Trump campaign, when you  look at the Bannon comments, that is patently false.   If the Attorney General refuses to follow the Department's recusal  standard--now as the head of the Department, well, then, I would hope  he would follow his own recusal standards. Last year, just days before  the election, then-Senator Sessions and other Trump campaign surrogates  wrote an op-ed. He criticized then-Attorney General Lynch for not  recusing herself from matters involving Secretary Clinton. The basis of  his complaint was a ``39-minute conversation''--to use his words--that  Attorney General Lynch had with former President Bill Clinton in  Phoenix, AZ. I would hope he would set the same standard for himself  that he sets for others because it is kind of hard to talk about a  half-hour conversation and say that requires recusal when it comes to  the Clintons, but a year's worth of vigorously campaigning with and  vigorously advising does not when it comes to the Trump campaign. A  year working on the Trump campaign doesn't count, but 39 minutes  talking to former President Clinton does? Come on. If that is the  standard for recusal in one case--I won't do the math on how many times  39 minutes goes into a year, but I would say, using Jeff Sessions' own  standards, he has far, far, far more reason to recuse himself in this  matter.   During the 20 years I have worked with him, Jeff Sessions has often  spoken of his commitment to the rule of law. I know he feels strongly  about  [[Page S1432]]  that, just as I do. As Senators, every one of us should. Certainly  every one of us who has had the privilege to be a prosecutor should  have a commitment to the rule of law. Well, Attorney General Sessions'  commitment is now being tested.   Whether we apply the Justice Department's recusal standard, which is  very, very clear, or use the Jeff Sessions' 39-minute recusal standard,  it is clear that Attorney General Sessions must step aside. In fact,  nothing less than the integrity of our democracy is at stake with this  investigation. And I do not say that lightly. Nothing less than the  integrity of our democracy is at stake with this investigation. What  did everybody know? When did they know it?   It is essential that the investigation be led by someone who--in both  appearance and in reality--is impartial and removed from politics. That  does not describe someone who was in the trenches of a political  campaign with the subjects of the investigation while they were  allegedly engaged in the activity under investigation, or somebody who  has been described by Steve Bannon as a ``clearinghouse for policy and  philosophy'' for President Trump.   For the good of the country, for the good of all of us--Republicans,  Democrats, Independents--the Attorney General really has just one thing  to do: Appoint a special counsel and let the public have the answers.  What did everybody know? When did they know it? It is pretty  simple. The people of Vermont, and I suspect throughout the country,  would like to have those answers that go to the bedrock of our  democracy.    In my 42 years here, I have never seen anything that has concerned me  so much as another country that does not have the best interests of the  United States at heart trying to interfere in our election, another  country trying to determine what the United States does. This is a  country that does not have the United States' best interests at heart  but a country that wants to manipulate the United States. This U.S.  Senator, for the time I have in office, will continue to speak out  against it.    Yes, of course, I will yield to the distinguished Senator.    Madam President, if I might respond to my good friend and  senior Senator from Illinois, he has been a friend and colleague for  decades. The Judiciary Committee and the whole Senate has benefited  from his knowledge.   What the leader of Poland said to the distinguished Senator is a very  chilling thing, Madam President. He knows from his own family ancestors  how bad an area can be if it is under the domination of something like  the then-Soviet Union and now Russia. He also knows from his own  experience as an American how important it is that we have the freedoms  we have.   I was privileged, along with my wife Marcelle and several others-- Senator Cochran, Senator Udall, and Senator Bennet and Congressman  McGovern--to visit Cuba and have long discussions with people who would  like to see real democracy come, and then to go to Colombia where they  have fought for over 50 years a terrible internal civil war with  countless deaths and atrocities and to see how they were trying to  bring back the rule of law and the rule of democracy. And we just sit  there, and it is so easy for us who grew up in an era in which we  believe in our democracy and we believe in our voices being heard,  where sometimes we win elections and sometimes we lose them, but we  believe in the fairness of it. It is so easy to sit there and think:  But we do it right.   This makes me wonder. Can we continue to say that? Can we be the  beacon to the rest of the world? Can we say: Do as the United States  does because we are open, we are transparent, we are honest.   Well, this has not been open, transparent, or honest. Let's make it  so. Let's not let it drag on. Let's go to it now so people can then  start debating issues. I expect there will be areas where I will agree  with the new administration and there are areas where I disagree with  the new administration. But I want to know I am agreeing and  disagreeing with an American administration, not with Vladimir Putin's  administration.   So I am moved by what my friend from Illinois has said. I hope the  rest of the country listens because we are supposed to be the example.  We pride ourselves on being the example. We are the oldest existing  democracy in the world. Let's not do anything that will come back to  haunt us.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, today Mr. Ross joins the growing list of  billionaires appointed by the Trump administration. It is not their  wealth that concerns me, but their past conflicts with the agencies  they are promoted to lead and support, providing guidance for policy  and for administration of the laws. It is for this reason I cannot  support Mr. Ross today.   Every American has a stake in the strength of our economy. We rely on  the Department of Commerce to facilitate trade, investment, and  innovation in a direction that ensures long-term benefits for  Americans. Today while the wealthiest among us continue to profit,  middle class families are working long hours to pay their bills and put  food on their tables. The cost of living is outstripping their family  budgets, and we must get ahead of this curve.   Mr. Ross has a background of buying fledging companies, and while he  might turn around the profit margins of those companies, it is at the  cost of American jobs. He has been called fair and practical, but has  also committed his career in business by expanding in low-cost  countries like Mexico and China. The economic policies of this country  cannot be built on representing the interests of rich investors, but  must also be creative in spurring job growth in American communities  where industry has disappeared. We can shape our global trade policy in  ways that benefit the United States, without having to do so under the  assumption that the United States needs to operate in isolation in  order to realize economic success. We can build industry at home, while  partnering abroad in trade for our products. But it will take the  commitment of the next Secretary to focus on our human capital as  innovators and not as mere cost considerations.   Although America's role in the global market is expanding, our  closest trade partner remains across our northern border. Each year, we  export hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of goods and services to  Canada, making it our largest export market in the world. Vermont is an  active contributor to this flow of commerce. Supporting initiatives  that strengthen this partnership will benefit local businesses in  Vermont and across the Nation. Mr. Ross wants to renegotiate the North  American Free Trade Agreement, and while we can debate the merits of  NAFTA, the talk of renegotiating this agreement without the partnership  of Mexico and Canada has many Vermont businesses concerned about the  implications for their future and for the Vermont jobs that depend on  our export markets.   We live in a global economy, and I work with Vermont businesses every  day who rely on importing goods and materials in order to successfully  create a final products that are a combination of U.S. and foreign  made. This is the reality for many businesses today. I do not criticize  the decisions a businessowner makes for the quality of their product.  But every large corporation makes a choice between cheaper overseas  labor and materials or investing in the workforce here at home for  greater gains in the future. That is a choice that Mr. Ross has made on  several occasions for the benefit of profits not workers.   I have said it time and again, but America thrives when our middle  class is strong. As Secretary, Mr. Ross will be expected to represent  the interests of all Americans. I hope he takes this commitment  seriously and works across party lines to create new industry and  opportunity that take root in the very communities that suffer from  lack of it. The Secretary of Commerce cannot look at individuals as  statistics of profit or loss, but must understand the innovative spirit  that brings opportunity where it may otherwise be lost.
