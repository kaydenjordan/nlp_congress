 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about title XI of  divisions S of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, H.R. 1625.  Title XI of Division S, the Fair Agricultural Reporting Methods Act, or  the FARM Act is identical to the text of S. 2421, which was introduced  on February 13, 2018, and which was referred to the Senate Committee on  Environment and Public Works, where I serve as ranking member. I am  proud to be an original cosponsor of S. 2421.   The Environment and Public Works Committee held two legislative  hearings on the text of S. 2421. The first was on S. 2421 as  introduced, in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Management, and Regulatory Oversight  on March 8, 2018. The second  [[Page S1925]]  hearing was held by the full committee on March 14, 2018, on a  committee draft of legislation, the ``Agriculture Creates Real  Employment (ACRE) Act.'' The text of S. 2421 was included in the  committee draft of the ACRE Act, as section 3.   S. 2421 exempts most farms from the hazardous substance release  reporting requirements under section 103 of the Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, CERCLA, for  air emissions from animal waste, but leaves intact reporting  requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know  Act, EPCRA. The FARM Act also preserves reporting requirements and  enforcement authority under State and local laws, as neither CERCLA nor  EPCRA would preempt such requirements.   As I said during those hearings, I believe our country's  environmental laws serve our entire Nation, including our farmers,  quite well, but I recognize that sometimes environmental requirements  can be complex and confusing to those who farm, especially when these  rules suddenly change.   This is what happened in April 2017 when the DC Circuit Court of  Appeals invalidated an EPA rule from 2008, which exempted all farms in  the Nation from reporting requirements for hazardous air emissions from  animal waste under CERCLA.   That same rule also exempted many farms from reporting requirements  under section 304 of EPCRA, but left in place reporting requirements  for large concentrated animal feeding operations, known as CAFOs. This  is because EPA received numerous comments from local officials and the  public in support of having farms report these emissions. Since January  2009, EPA has required large CAFOs to report their emissions of ammonia  and hydrogen sulfide from animal waste under section 304 of EPCRA.   With the court's decision to vacate the 2008 rule, all farms that  exceeded releases of 100 pounds in a 24-hour period of ammonia or  hydrogen sulfide were now subject to reporting requirements under  section 103 of CERCLA and under section 304 of EPCRA. Farms had no  experience with CERCLA reporting, because the 2008 rule exempted all  farms from reporting under section 103 of that statute. The FARM Act  provides a statutory exemption to the reporting requirements under  section 103 because the DC Circuit found that EPA did not have the  authority to exempt farms from these releases. This restores the CERCLA  reporting exemption under which farmers have operated since 2009.   Reporting requirements under EPCRA have been quite different. As I  noted before, the Bush administration chose to only exempt some farms  from reporting releases of extremely hazardous substances from animal  waste under section 304 of EPCRA, and since 2009, large CAFOs have been  successfully reporting these releases to their State emergency response  commissions and to their local emergency planning committees. The DC  Circuit vacated the rule that exempted farms that weren't large CAFOs  from EPCRA reporting requirements under section 304.   One thing I worked hard on with Senators Fischer and Barrasso as we  were developing the FARM Act was to ensure that, at the same time we  exempted farms from hazardous substance reporting requirements under  section 103 of CERCLA, we chose to make no changes to how extremely  hazardous substances should be reported under EPCRA. We heard testimony  from multiple witnesses during both of our hearings on this point,  namely that this legislation did not change reporting requirements for  releases of extremely hazardous substances under EPCRA. We also heard  testimony from a local government official about the ways that he and  his constituents would use the information in these reports.   Another important aspect of the FARM Act is that it in no way  modifies any of EPA's response or remedial authorities under CERCLA,  nor does it in any way limit or reduce liability associated with a  release from any facility, which of course includes farms. This fact is  made explicit in section 3 of S. 2421 and in section 1103 of H.R. 1625,  division S, title XI.   I want to thank Senators Fischer and Barrasso for working with me and  agreeing to not amend EPCRA in S. 2421, and similarly in title XI of  division S of H.R. 1625. That was critical for many Members on the  Democratic side who have repeatedly heard concerns from State and local  officials, the public health experts, and other members of these  communities who have the right to know about what is in their air.   Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a  Congressional Research Service memorandum titled ``Supplemental  Analysis: Fair Agricultural Reporting Method Act/FARM Act (S. 2421).''  As I have already noted, the text of the FARM Act in division S, title  XI, of the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1625, the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, is identical to S. 2421.  Therefore, the analysis contained in the CRS memo on S. 2421 applies  equally to the language in the omnibus. There is additional analysis on  the FARM Act by CRS that is part of the hearing records on S. 2421 and  on the ACRE Act.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 Congressional Research Service Memorandum                                                     March 13, 2018.      To: Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works      Attention: Kusai Merchant.      Hon. Cory A. Booker, Ranking Member      Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Management, and Regulatory           Oversight      Attention: Adam Zipkin.      From: David M. Bearden, Specialist in Environmental Policy      Subject: Supplemental Analysis: Fair Agricultural Reporting           Method Act/FARM Act (S. 2421).        This memorandum responds to your request for a more       detailed discussion of the analysis presented in a CRS       memorandum provided on March 7, 2018. CRS prepared this       earlier memorandum to respond to your initial request for an       analysis of amendments to the Comprehensive Environmental       Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) in the       Fair Agricultural Reporting Method Act or ``FARM Act'' (S.       2421), as introduced on February 13, 2018. As discussed in       the March 7th CRS memorandum, S. 2421 would exempt air       releases of hazardous substances emitted by animal waste at       farms from reporting requirements under CERCLA, and would       have a bearing on the applicability of reporting requirements       under Section 304 of the Emergency Planning and Community       Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).        This supplemental memorandum elaborates upon the analysis       presented in the March 7th CRS memorandum to outline       circumstances in which the emergency notification       requirements in Section 304 of EPCRA would apply under       current law, and the bearing of S. 2421 on the applicability       of these requirements to air releases emitted by animal       waste. The March 7th CRS memorandum provides additional       background information in support of this analysis, and       offers a broader examination of how S. 2421 would define the       terms ``animal waste'' and ``farm'' for purposes of the bill.       I hope that this supplemental memorandum is helpful to       address your questions about circumstances in which EPCRA may       continue to apply if S. 2421 were enacted. If you need       further assistance from CRS in consideration of this       legislation or related issues, please do not hesitate to       contact me.                             Section 304 of EPCRA         As explained in the March 7th CRS memorandum, Section 304       of EPCRA outlines three situations in which the reporting of       releases of extremely hazardous substances or hazardous       substances into the environment is required. In each       situation, the person responsible for the release must notify       the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) and the       appropriate Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) that       covers the local jurisdiction where the release occurs. Two       of these situations are contingent upon the release being       subject to notification under Section 103 of CERCLA for       reporting to the National Response Center! The third       situation is not contingent upon reporting under CERCLA. The       three situations covered in Section 304 of EPCRA are as       follows.        Section 304(a)(1) requires notification of releases of       extremely hazardous substances listed under EPCRA, if the       release would require notification for hazardous substances       under Section 103 of CERCLA.        Section 304(a)(3) requires notification of releases of       other hazardous substances that are not separately listed as       extremely hazardous substances under EPCRA, if the release       would require notification under Section 103 of CERCLA.        Section 304(a)(2) requires notification of releases of       extremely hazardous substances  [[Page S1926]]       listed under EPCRA (but that are not subject to notification       under CERCLA), if three criteria are met.        In this third situation, releases of extremely hazardous       substances listed under EPCRA would require notification       under Section 304(a)(2), if the release:        (A) is not a federally permitted release as defined in       Section 101(10) of CERCLA;        (B) is in an amount in excess of a reportable quantity that       the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated       under Section 302 of EPCRA; and        (C) ``occurs in a manner'' that would require notification       under Section 103 of CERCLA.                                   S. 2421         S. 2421 would amend Section 103(e) of CERCLA to exempt       ``air emissions from animal waste (including decomposing       animal waste) at a farm'' from reporting to the National       Response Center regardless of the quantity of the release of       hazardous substances in air emissions. The bill would not       amend Section 304 or any other provisions of EPCRA. Although       S. 2421 would not amend this statute, the bill would have the       effect of eliminating reporting requirements under Section       304(a)(1) and Section 304(a)(3) of EPCRA for air releases of       hazardous substances emitted by animal waste at farms, in so       far as the terms ``animal waste'' and ``farm'' are defined in       the bill.        Both Section 304(a)(1) and Section 304(a)(3) of EPCRA are       contingent upon reporting required under Section 103 of       CERCLA. Exempting a release from reporting under Section 103       of CERCLA thereby would have the effect of exempting the same       release from reporting under Section 304(a)(1) and Section       304(a)(3) of EPCRA. The April 2017 court decision referenced       in the March 7th CRS memorandum (Waterkeeper Alliance, et       al., v. EPA) described this statutory relationship in terms       of ``a release that triggers the CERCLA duty also       automatically trips the EPCRA reporting requirements in       subsections (1) and (3)'' of Section 304.        S. 2421 would not have a bearing on the reporting of       releases of extremely hazardous substances under Section       304(a)(2) of EPCRA though, as this provision is not       contingent upon reporting required under Section 103 of       CERCLA. If the exemption from CERCLA in S. 2421 were enacted,       the applicability of Section 304(a)(2) therefore would remain       the same as in current law. An air release of an extremely       hazardous substance emitted by animal waste at a farm would       be subject to Section 304(a)(2) if all three statutory       criteria for reporting were met.        An air release of an extremely hazardous substance emitted       by animal waste would satisfy the first criterion in Section       304(a)(2)(A) if it were not a federally permitted release.       Section 101(10) of CERCLA defines the term ``federally       permitted release'' to mean releases regulated under other       specific laws. Section 101(10)(H) authorizes a federally       permitted release for ``any emission into the air'' subject       to a permit, regulation, or State Implementation Plan,       pursuant to the Clean Air Act. CRS is not aware of the use of       these authorities to regulate air releases emitted by animal       waste upon which a federally permitted release presently       could be based. If such air releases were permitted under the       Clean Air Act, the releases would be exempt from reporting       and liability under CERCLA as a federally permitted release,       and thereby exempt from reporting to state and local       officials under Section 304 of EPCRA.        An air release of an extremely hazardous substance emitted       by animal waste would satisfy the second criterion in Section       304(a)(2)(B) if the quantity of the release were to exceed       the quantitative threshold for reporting that EPA designated       in federal regulation pursuant to Section 302 of EPCRA. For       example, EPA separately listed ammonia and hydrogen sulfide       (substances commonly emitted by animal waste) as extremely       hazardous substances, and designated 100 pounds released       during a 24-hour period as the threshold for reporting under       Section 302 of EPCRA. Air releases of ammonia or hydrogen       sulfide emitted by animal waste in excess of 100 pounds       during a 24-hour period therefore would satisfy this second       criterion in Section 304(a)(2)(B).        An air release of an extremely hazardous substance emitted       by animal waste (e.g., ammonia or hydrogen sulfide) would       satisfy the third criterion of Section 304(a)(2)(C) of EPCRA,       if the release were to occur in the same manner as a       ``release'' that would require reporting under CERCLA. As       outlined in the March 7th CRS memorandum, the term       ``release'' in CERCLA is relatively broad with respect to the       manner in which a hazardous substance may enter the       environment, including spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring,       emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping,       leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment. The       term ``environment'' is defined in Section 101(8) of CERCLA       to include surface water, groundwater, a drinking water       supply, surface soils, sub-surface soils, or ambient air.       Section 329 of EPCRA defines the terms ``release'' and       ``environment'' similar in scope to CERCLA. The federal       regulations promulgated under Section 304 of EPCRA reflect       these statutory definitions. Both CERCLA and EPCRA generally       treat emissions into the ambient air as releases into the       environment.        In implementation, EPA has treated the phrase ``occurs in a       manner'' in EPCRA Section 304(a)(2)(C) to mean the nature of       the release in terms of how a substance enters the       environment, not that reporting is required under Section 103       of CERCLA. Otherwise, Section 304(a)(2) would be rendered       meaningless in covering releases of extremely hazardous       substances that do not require reporting as hazardous       substances under CERCLA, while requiring reporting under       CERCLA at the same time.        The March 7th CRS memorandum observed that the exemption       from reporting under Section 103 of CERCLA in S. 2421 may not       necessarily exempt releases of separately listed extremely       hazardous substances from reporting under Section 304(a)(2)       of EPCRA. The applicability of this provision to a particular       release would depend on whether all three statutory criteria       outlined above are met. Regardless of these criteria though,       Section 304 in its entirety may not apply to air releases       from animal waste at farms if the Trump Administration's       interpretation of the exemption for substances used in       routine agricultural operations is not challenged. S. 2421       would not have a bearing on this exemption.        Also as noted in the March 7th CRS memorandum, potential       reporting requirements under state or local laws may continue       to apply regardless of an exemption in federal law, as       neither CERCLA nor EPCRA would preempt such state or local       requirements.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are here today to discuss what we call  an omnibus bill. I know that ``omnibus'' is another funny-sounding word  that we use sometimes here in Washington, but it simply means a bill  that covers a lot of topics.   There are provisions in the omnibus legislation that deal with  everything from homeland security to the environment to veterans and  science, just to name a few. It is particularly fitting that we are  discussing an appropriations bill that covers such a wide range of  topics, as I come to the floor to recognize the service of a member of  our staff who has worked on most of the policies covered in the omnibus  legislation--maybe all of them.   Gabrielle Batkin, seated to my left, will probably wish that I wasn't  doing this right now, but there is no doubt that she deserves to be  recognized for her more than 20 years of hard work in the U.S. Senate.  For as long as I have known her, Gabrielle has been an incredibly  gracious person--kind, easy with praise, making sure that her own staff  and the staff across the aisle were appropriately recognized for their  efforts. Now I think she deserves some recognition of her own.   To all of the young staff members who may be watching this right now  or to those who aspire to be staff members of the Senate someday, I  would present Gabrielle Batkin as a shining example of what it means to  be an exceptional staffer and a true public servant.   Every now and then we hear the term ``nameless, faceless  bureaucrat.'' This is not a nameless, faceless bureaucrat. This is a  beautiful public servant. She works tirelessly and really believes in  making government work better for the people that it serves.   Gabrielle and I first started working together back in 2014, when she  came to lead my team on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Committee when I served as its chairman. Then, a little over a  year ago, she seamlessly transitioned to her current role as staff  director for the minority on the Environment and Public Works  Committee. This encapsulates just a fraction of her service.   For over a decade, Gabrielle served as an appropriations staff member  to former Senator Barbara Mikulski. I think she was the No. 2 person on  Barbara's appropriations team. Gabrielle started on the Appropriations  Committtee's Subcommittees on Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban  Development and then moved on to the Commerce, Justice, and Science  Subcommittee, where she handled everything from NASA to the grasses on  the Chesapeake Bay.   Before that, she served in the office of the late Senator from New  Jersey, Frank Lautenberg. She also worked on the House side for  Congressman Frank Pallone from New Jersey and also served on the Senate  Budget Committee.   Gabrielle has worked on everything from blue crabs to the Hubble  telescope to cybersecurity and Central America. Those who know her will  confirm that few people can shift between issues or committees as  gracefully as she does, while also delivering results every step of the  way. The day-to-day functions of the Federal Government are possible  because there are people like Gabrielle Batkin who toil away behind the  scenes making sure the hard work gets done for the American people.   She has been a tenacious and effective leader on my staff, but she  also has what I like to call the ``heart of a servant.'' Even as the  boss, Gabrielle is in the trenches when things get tough or hectic  around here, and she always takes time to make sure that those who work  hard for her are doing OK. Her incredible work ethic, combined with her  humility, means that she can be briefing Members of Congress on complex  policies one minute and helping an overwhelmed junior staffer staple  packets the next. That is just who Gabrielle is.   No matter how stressful her high-pressure career in the Senate was,  Gabrielle never let it take her away from her most important job; that  is, being the mother to three young men who are up in the Galleries  tonight:  [[Page S1929]]  Henry, Will, and Charlie. She has always said to me: ``My most  important job is being a mom,'' and she is a darn good one. All of her  family are up in the Galleries--not all of them, but some of the most  important ones--her three sons and her husband Josh of 20 years and her  sister Erin, who is, I understand, not just a sister but a great  friend, a great aunt, and just a wonderful support system for Gabrielle  during the times she has needed it.   I want to thank the three boys and Josh for sharing your mom and your  wife with all of the people of our country, and I want to thank Erin  for being just a terrific sister and supporter.   A few years back, Gabrielle brought her oldest son Henry to our staff  holiday party at the Buena Vista in New Castle, DE. At the time I was  talking with Henry, I think he was 12, and I asked him to tell us one  thing his mom taught him. Henry told us that his mom tells him all the  time that as long as they try to do their best in everything he and his  brother do, that is always good enough for her. Think about that. As  long as he and his brother do their best, that is always good enough  for their mom. She just wants to make sure they do their best.    She has always given us her best for all these years--20 years and  counting. I am immensely grateful to Gabrielle for her service to this  institution, for her service to the American people, and for her  indispensable counsel to me over the past 4 years that I have been  fortunate enough to work with her--I like to say ``to work for her.''  She is a great boss and a wonderful friend. I have learned a lot from  her and treasure her and her friendship.   While we are sad to see her go, I am excited for her new adventures  to come, and I wish her and her family--her husband Josh, and her boys,  Henry, Will, and Charlie--all the best in this next chapter of their  lives. I know her boys are her biggest fans and are so proud of the  work she has done here in the Senate. I promise you, she is going to  keep making you guys proud.   I will close with this. Every now and then throughout our lives, we  meet people and sometimes are even fortunate enough to work with them-- people who are just a joy to be with, people who make our days brighter  and our workload lighter. I know I speak for so many people when I say  that Gabrielle is just that kind of person.   We had breakfast today in the Senate Dining Room. When we walked out,  going through the Capitol Building back to our offices in the Hart  Building and the Dirksen Building, we passed so many people she knew,  people who knew her by name. I am the only person who calls her  Gabrielle, which is her real name. Everybody else calls her Gabby. The  janitors, custodians, people running the elevators, the pages--she is  Gabby to them.   Sometimes people rise to senior and leadership positions, whether  they happen to be elected or members of our staff, and maybe forget  where they came from, or maybe they are not the same person they were  when they started. She is probably smarter. She started out really  smart, but she has gotten even better informed and just a more  knowledgeable member of our team as time has gone by.   I will go back to when I interviewed her for the position of staff  director on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  when I was chairman. We talked about growing up, going to college, and  her influences as a young woman. As it turned out, she went to school  in the Midwest, Bradley in Peoria.   I said: Did you ever work while you were going to school?   I worked a couple jobs while I was going to Ohio State. ROTC.  Midshipman. I had some help from the Navy. As it turned out, she worked  full time while she was going to school at Bradley--not that she  volunteered this, but I found out later on that she worked full-time  for several of those years that she was an undergraduate--I think at  the Social Security Administration--and carried a full load and a  straight 4.0 average. I think that is amazing. As soon as she said  that, I thought, I should be working for you, sister. But she has let  me work with her, and we have had a great time and a great run.   I know I speak for the other members of the Environment and Public  Works Committee who have an opportunity to see staff--Democrats and  Republicans--and a chance to see her handiwork and the magic she  brought to the committee. She had a good 1-plus years as a staff  director when I was privileged to chair Homeland Security, and  everybody--Tom Coburn, my colleague from Oklahoma, and a whole bunch of  other people--certainly know her work and salute her.   In the Navy, when people do an especially great job, we have two  words that we say: Bravo Zulu. I certainly say those words this evening  to Gabrielle. We also have a saying when people are ready to weigh  anchor and sail off into the sunrise and go on to their next challenge  or next assignment. We always like to say: Fair winds and following  seas. I say those words this evening somewhat reluctantly but with a  great deal of affection and respect.   Gabrielle, we love you, we will miss you, and we will leave the light  on.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I  rise on behalf of the Delaware delegation to honor the exemplary  service of Tony Pratt, administrator of the Shoreline and Waterway  Management section within the Delaware Department of Natural Resources  and Environmental Control. Tony has devoted his life's work to  preserving our coastal communities and documenting its beauty through  his talented photography.   Tony, sometimes known affectionately around Delaware as the Sand Man,  is an expert on natural coastal infrastructure including beaches,  dunes, and wetlands. He has ensured that Delaware has safe, clean, and  broad beaches for its nearly 3 million visitors a year to enjoy. As a  leader of the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association, he has  an understanding of the complexities facing the coastal resources not  just in Delaware, but around our great Nation. He is so well respected  in his field that, in February 2017, he testified before the U.S.  Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works on the value of  beaches, dunes, wetlands, and other natural coastal infrastructure.   Tony has been a key figure in turning around Delaware's beaches from  being in a state of chronic erosion in the 1990s, to today serving as a  top tourist destination and providing protection during the strongest  of storms. These storms have continuously battered the coastline and  back bays; however, Delaware coastal communities have fared better than  most due to beach renourishment projects and mitigation work in the  back bays. Tony has led these efforts not only to try and prepare for  the next superstorm, but learn from past storms in order to keep our  roads, bridges, homes, businesses, and animal habitats safe from rising  waters.   You would be hard pressed to find him behind a desk, especially  during a storm. You are more likely to find him standing in the water,  investigating the environment, and possibly even taking photos of the  beautiful land and sea. He is there for Delaware any time of the day  and night, on weekends and holidays. He is personally vested in his  work and has somehow maintained that same level of passion for nearly  four decades.   On behalf of Delaware Senator Chris Coons and our Congresswoman, Lisa  Blunt Rochester, I wholeheartedly thank Tony Pratt for his service to  Delaware. His model leadership and dedication has served to improve our  coastal communities and Delawareans' quality of life. We offer Tony our  sincere congratulations on a job well done and wish him well as he  embarks on the next chapter of his career.   When people in the Navy accomplish extraordinary things in their  lives, we say, ``Bravo Zulu!'' Today we are in your debt, and we are  deeply grateful, as well, to your family for sharing with the people of  Delaware and America for all these years a very good man.                            ____________________
