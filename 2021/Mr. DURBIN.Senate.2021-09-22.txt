 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Thune  and I be allowed to complete our remarks before the vote is taken.    Mr. President, this week, the Senate will vote on  Florence Pan's nomination to the District Court for the District of  Columbia.   She is highly qualified, with more than a decade of experience on the  bench. If confirmed, she would be the first Asian-American woman to  serve on that court.   She graduated summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania and  received her law degree with distinction from Stanford.   After clerking on the Southern District of New York in the Second  Circuit, she decided to pursue a legal career in public service. In  1995, she was selected for the prestigious Bristow fellowship in the  Office of the Solicitor General. After completing her fellowship, she  served as attorney in the Appellate Section of the Criminal Division of  the Justice Department and senior advisor to the Department of the  Treasury.   Beginning in 1999, Judge Pan worked as an assistant U.S. attorney for  the District of Columbia for 10 years. In this role, she litigated  local and Federal courts at the trial and appellate level.   In 2009, President Obama nominated her to serve on the DC Superior  Court. She was confirmed with unanimous support by the Senate.   Years later, President Obama nominated her to serve on the DC  district court, and her nomination was reported out of the Republican- controlled Judiciary Committee by a voice vote. Unfortunately, she  didn't receive a floor vote in time, though lawmakers on both sides of  the aisle recognized that she was eminently qualified.   Since 2009, Judge Pan has presided over more than 650 trials:  criminal cases, family court cases, civil cases. She was unanimously  rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association. She has the  strong support of Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, who submitted a  statement for the record and described her as an exceptional nominee.   Last month, she was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a  bipartisan vote of 18 to 4.   What is more, the historic nature of Judge Pan's nomination will help  build a Federal bench that reflects full diversity.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting her.                            ____________________     Mr. President, less than 2 miles from this Capitol, there  are 666,000 small white flags stretching across the National Mall like  a sea of suffering and loss. Each of these flags represents an American  life lost to COVID--666,000. Let me tell but one of them. Her name was  Candace Ayers. She lived in my hometown of Springfield, IL.   Early last March, as soon as they could, Candace and her husband  Terry received their second coronavirus vaccinations. That was a day of  joy and relief for the family because Candace lived with rheumatoid  arthritis, which weakened her immune system.   In July, she traveled to Mississippi--a State, sadly, with one of the  lowest vaccination rates--to console a friend who had lost her husband.  At the time, COVID infections were at a low point, and the Delta  variant was just starting, so Candace thought she would be safe, having  been vaccinated.   Soon after the trip, she tested positive for COVID. She was  hospitalized and moved to an ICU, and she spent the last few weeks of  her life on a ventilator.   She died on September 3 at the age of 66, leaving behind her husband,  their son and daughter and 5-year-old triplet grandchildren.   In the obituary in my hometown paper, her family wrote: ``She was  vaccinated but was infected by others who chose not to be. The cost was  her life.''   I read that to my wife the morning it was printed and said I have  never seen a sentence or two like that in any obituary.   Experts call what took Candace Ayers' life a ``breakthrough'' COVID  infection, meaning an infection that occurs after an individual has  been vaccinated. Breakthrough infections are typically mild, but can be  devastating for immunocompromised people like Candace.   With the rise of the Delta variant, it is not just the elderly or  immunocompromised who are at risk. Children made up only 3 percent of  COVID cases at the start of this pandemic. Today, children account for  27 percent of new COVID infections, and the school year is just  starting.   We are in the midst of yet another wave of this pandemic. COVID is  once again overwhelming America's health system, and the rate of COVID  infections and deaths are dramatically higher in the areas of lower  vaccination.   An article in last Friday's Chicago Tribune tells the story in  Illinois. Last Thursday was the fourth day in a row that every ICU bed  in Southern Illinois was filled. In a 20-county area--home to 400,000  people--there were no ICU beds available.   Doctors, nurses, and first responders are working around the clock to  care for sick patients, but after 18 grueling months, they are reaching  a breaking point. And with our healthcare system pushed to the brink,  everyone is feeling it.   If you live in Southern Illinois and you have a heart attack, a  stroke, a serious accident, or a life-threatening condition, bad news:  There are no ICU beds available for you. Hospital staffs in those areas  have to call hospitals sometimes hundreds of miles away in Nashville,  TN; St. Louis, MO; Kansas City, MO, to try to find a bed.   Compare the situation to Chicago, some 300 miles away but a world of  difference. COVID infection rates are starting to decrease. Public  health officials are hopeful they are finally turning a corner.   Why the great disparity between the Chicago regional area and  Southern Illinois? One reason: vaccinations. In Chicago, two in three  adults are fully vaccinated against COVID. In Southern Illinois, the  figure is only one in three.   So much of the suffering and expense could be avoided if we could  take the politics out of the COVID debate and stop the spread of  misinformation that is literally killing people. As Candace Ayers'  family would tell you, the most important thing is that more people get  vaccinated. Vaccines are safe, effective, and free--and widely  available to anyone over the age of 12.   Here is a statistic that should trouble everyone. The New York Times  tracks COVID vaccinations around the world using figures supplied by  national governments. Where do you suppose the United States of America  ranks globally compared to other countries on vaccination rates? Well,  you would guess the top three, right? The top 10 for sure. How about  top 20? You would be wrong. Last week, the United States ranked 55th  globally for the percentage of people vaccinated. We are just behind  Cambodia.   And in the wealthiest Nation on Earth and in the country that led the  research and development in finding these vaccines, that is sad; it is  inexcusable; and it is deadly.  [[Page S6599]]    Now, listen, all Americans respect individual rights, but the only  way to end the pandemic is for everyone to accept the personal  responsibility for our shared well-being. That is why I support  President Biden's recent action to strengthen America's defense against  COVID and bring this pandemic finally to an end.   Many responsible employers, large and small, have already decided on  their own to require that their workers get vaccinated. I encourage  more to do it. A strong majority of Americans support this policy.  President Biden's decision to extend that policy to much of the Federal  workforce and to private employers with 100 or more workers means that  two out of three American workers will be required to get vaccinated.   We even have a situation in the Federal Bureau of Prisons where the  infection rate of Federal prisoners is six times the national average.  Yet fewer than half of Federal prison guards have been vaccinated-- fewer than half. That is inexcusable.   Other nations have already instituted policies which encourage  vaccinations. It is time for us to do the same. If we are ever going to  see this pandemic come to an end, kids get back in school, and life  return to normal, more Americans have to roll up their sleeves and face  the reality that vaccination is the pathway to that result.   Now, sadly, while this debate is going on nationally, politicians in  two dozen States, with vaccination rates below the national average,  are threatening to sue the Biden administration over its new COVID  policy. In other words, these Governors are saying to the President:  Stop any requirement for masks; stop any requirement for vaccinations.  In the war against COVID, these lawmakers in these two dozen States are  siding with the virus. Their actions, if they follow through on these  threats, will result in more illness, more death, and more harm to the  economy.   Now, how can I say that? Well, I will tell you how--by taking a look  at the numbers. Take a look at the numbers from the 24 States  threatening lawsuits. The infection rate is 3,471 for every 100,000  people. How about the other States that are not filing a lawsuit  against President Biden? Coincidentally, COVID death rates in those 24  States where these attorneys general are threatening lawsuits against  President Biden is 31 per 100,000. The COVID death rates in the rest of  the country: 11 per 100,000.   Vaccination rate: 49 percent in those States, 57 percent in the  States that are not suing the President. That tells a story.   They are exalting liberty over life. This notion that we don't have a  responsibility to ourselves and our family and innocent people to step  forward is exactly the point that was being made by Candace Ayers'  family. We do. We bear that responsibility, and we should accept it.   Since June, the average rates of COVID infections in the 24 States  threatening to sue President Biden have been double the rates of COVID  infection in the other 26 States. COVID death rates in those States  have been nearly three times worse than the rest of the country. These  reckless political actions have deadly, real-world consequences.   President Biden's actions are reasonable; they are necessary; and a  majority of the American people believe it. Politicians hoping to gin  up their base by suing the President should stop and start fighting the  virus instead of the President's ambitions to bring this pandemic to an  end. The sooner we do that, the sooner we can end this pandemic once  and for all.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.

In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I will object to further proceeding en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed  to executive session to consider Calendar No. 174.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all without  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to  the nomination; that any statements related to the nomination be  printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action and the Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Armed Services be discharged from further consideration and the  Senate now proceed to S. Res. 357.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.

Mr. President, I further ask that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9 a.m., Thursday,  September 23; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Pan nomination; further, that all time on the Pan  nomination expire at 10 a.m.; finally, that if any nominations are  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:28 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, September 23, 2021, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
