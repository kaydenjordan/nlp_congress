 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my colleague,  Representative DelBene's bill, the Improving Seniors' Timely Access to  Care Act. I have heard from countless patients in my southern  California district whose care has been delayed for weeks and, in some  cases, outright denied because of countless barriers and archaic  approval methods. And I have heard directly from physicians who are at  their wits end, unable to provide the care they know will help their  patients because of endless red tape.   The Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act makes thoughtful and  much-needed improvements to the Medicare system to correct these  problems. The bill before us today will promote modernization of the  prior authorization system to speed up approvals of routine procedures.   It moves the system of prior authorization into the 21st century,  away from fax machines and toward electronic approval methods. By  shortening the window by which insurance plans must respond to a prior  authorization request, the bill will ensure patients get the care they  need when they need it.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.
