 Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the Brazoswood  High School band was awarded one of the highest honors: the Sudler Flag  of Honor by the John Philip Sousa Foundation.   The Sudler Flag of Honor is given to distinguished high school bands  that have demonstrated particularly high standards of excellence in  concert activities over a period of several years. There is a 7-year  minimum process, with countless documents, recordings, letters of  recommendation, and performances at not only the State but the local  level as well.   Of the nearly 50 Sudler Flags that have been awarded since 1983,  almost 30 of them have gone to Texas high school bands. The Brazoswood  Buccaneer Band is the most recent addition to this prestigious group,  and they are the only band to have been awarded the Sudler Flag in  2017.   My sincere congratulations to the students; the alumni; the band; Mr.  Brian Casey, the band director; and the principal, Rita Pintavalle, on  this outstanding achievement.                            ____________________
