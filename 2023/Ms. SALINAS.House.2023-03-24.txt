 Mr. Speaker, the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde  Community have always been stewards of Oregon's land and natural  resources. Like so many other indigenous peoples, they have faced  tremendous injustices  [[Page H1414]]  at the hands of the Federal Government.   That is why I rise today in support of my very first bill in  Congress, the Grand Ronde Reservation Act Amendment of 2023, to correct  those past injustices.   In 1994, the Tribes sought to fix a survey error, which led to the  Federal Government making yet another error that removed Grand Ronde's  right to pursue any further land claims even if more mistakes are  discovered.   No other Tribe in Oregon faces this kind of restriction. The  Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde shouldn't either.   We are not responsible for the ills of the past, but we are  responsible for remedying them today. My bill contributes to that, and  I thank my Oregon colleagues for supporting it.                            ____________________
