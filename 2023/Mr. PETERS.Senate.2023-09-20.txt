 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in the mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh, a  humanitarian crisis is unfolding. Azerbaijan's blockade of the Lachin  corridor has left over 100,000 ethnic Albanians cut off from the  world--deprived of the food, the water, fuel, and medical care that  they need to survive.   Last week, one resident made a plea. She asked:         How many more people will have to die before the world       takes notice?    Today, that question carries new meaning as the Armenian people not  only confront dwindling resources but heavy bombardment. On September  19, Azerbaijan violated the fragile peace and began attacking Nagorno- Karabakh. While a cease-fire was announced this morning, we cannot  ignore the violence, and we must stand with the citizens of Nagorno- Karabakh.   This conflict systematically targets the Armenian people. It is  cruel; it is calculated; and it is inhumane--further demonstrating that  the Armenian people are facing an existential threat. Experts from the  International Criminal Court say there is reason to believe it amounts  to an act of genocide. That word would always sound an alarm, but it  creates a particular weight with the Armenian people and evokes a  devastating chapter of their history.   The government of Azerbaijan has orchestrated a humanitarian  disaster, only to further their political and their territorial claims.  The blockade of the Lachin corridor has kept essential supplies out of  the region since June. Pregnant women are being forced to walk miles to  a medical clinic. Fuel shortages have shut down schools and sidelined  emergency vehicles. People get sick from untreated water and then visit  pharmacies with empty shelves.   Food shortages run rampant. Officials in Nagorno-Karabakh estimate  that 95 percent of residents are suffering from malnutrition. Starving  citizens are lining up for bread in the streets and wondering how they  will find their family's next meal. The use of military force by  Azerbaijan will only further endanger citizens who have already endured  so much.   The Biden administration has provided some crucial assistance, and  the Azerbaijani Government has announced a theoretical agreement to  open the Lachin corridor once again. But that deal has yet to bring the  Armenian people out of harm's way. The  [[Page S4622]]  bombardment began after it was reached, and this increasing military  aggression has only deepened the humanitarian crisis.   The Aliyev regime has now demanded that Nagorno-Karabakh's government  be dissolved and the ethnic Armenian troops be removed. The Azerbaijan  Government has made it clear their goal is to erase the historic  presence of Armenians in this region.   Until it is proven that this cruel campaign has ended, we must be  vigilant. Until the people of Nagorno-Karabakh have what they need to  survive and to walk freely in their home once again, we cannot stand to  the side.   In the midst of these unthinkable conditions, residents have taken to  the streets, calling for an end to the blockade. We must join their  chorus--shedding a light on Azerbaijan's actions and addressing the  immediate threat of ethnic violence. And I encourage the Biden  administration to remember these crimes against humanity when  considering where to send aid and to apply diplomatic pressure.   If we continue to let this crisis devolve, then we are complicit in  the violence. I call on my Senate colleagues and the Biden  administration to stand against the cruelty of the Azerbaijan  Government and stand by the side of the Armenian people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
