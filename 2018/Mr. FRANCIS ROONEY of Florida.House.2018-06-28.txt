 Mr. Speaker, our inability to pass  either of the immigration bills yesterday was a disappointing failure  to solve two of the largest problems we face: routine illegal border  crossing and abuse of the asylum system.   In addition to wall-building and border security bills, I have  sponsored legislation to get the workers we need to drive a growing  economy:   Change our system of immigration from family-based to skill-based,  like Australia and Canada. We need legal, verifiable, and skilled or  the educatable to be workers coming in all ranges of skills. This is  the RAISE Act.   I have also introduced a bill to prevent claiming amnesty from anyone  who is already inside our borders. Amnesty is supposed to derive from  ``credible fear'' of persecution, not flight because the country of  origin is dangerous, lawless, or offers little economic opportunity to  its citizens--not our problem.   These proposals would go a long way to solving the immigration crisis  and creating a workforce to drive a growing U.S. economy in the 21st  century.                            ____________________
