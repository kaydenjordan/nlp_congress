 Mr. President, today I join my close friend and  colleague, Senator Dick Durbin, to honor one of the magnificent  landmarks of Illinois, Chicago's Navy Pier.   Since Chicago architect Daniel Burnham first established his vision  of a public pier to transform Chicago's landscape and draw visitors to  experience the lakefront, what opened as Municipal Pier in 1916 has  been a gathering point for the community. In World War I and World War  II, it became central to the war effort and Navy Pier got its name to  honor the sailors who served and continued to serve in defense of our  Nation.   Many institutions of Chicago began in Navy Pier before finding their  home elsewhere in the city, like the University of Illinois' Chicago  campus, the Taste of Chicago, and the trade shows that continue to come  through Chicago to take advantage of the city's commercial  infrastructure. Navy Pier has been a place for people to meet and  experience the Great Lakes, city skyline, and various attractions that  have sprung up and grown through the city.   Locals, Illinoisans, Americans, and international visitors alike  experience the Midwest through the lens of the pier, and it reflects  back on our city the multicultural, historical aspects of our city and  this Nation. You only have to look at the iconic ferris wheel to see  how it has transformed Chicago's skyline and become such an integrated,  iconic part of the city.   As a public venue for culture and commerce, Navy Pier continues to  revitalize so that it can be sustainable, universal, and accessible to  all. I am proud to come before this body with Senator Durbin and honor  Navy Pier as it celebrates its centennial anniversary.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
