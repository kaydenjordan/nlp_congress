 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the situation in Gaza today is a  disaster. Congress must take action. The administration must take  action. The world must take action.   Today, 3 weeks after Hamas's barbaric attack against civilians in  Israel, which began this war, many hundreds of thousands of innocent  men, women, and children in Gaza are on the brink. Over the past 3  weeks, it is estimated that some 8,000 people in Gaza have been killed  in bombings, including more than 3,000 children, and far more have been  wounded.   More than a million people in Gaza have been displaced from their  homes, and some 670,000 are sheltering in U.N. installations, where  they are down to 1 liter of water per person per day. They lack  sufficient food, water, medical supplies, or fuel. The hospitals and  medical facilities there are in nightmarish conditions, with hundreds  of  [[Page S5273]]  babies in incubators and patients on life support at risk of death  should the generators that sustain them run out of fuel. Corridors are  lined with injured and displaced people, and overwhelmed doctors must  turn patients away or operate without anesthesia or antibiotics.   The humanitarian crisis is dire and getting worse by the minute.  There must be a humanitarian pause now so that sufficient supplies-- food, water, medicine, fuel--can reach the people of Gaza. If not,  thousands more will die needlessly. We cannot allow that to happen. A  stop to the bombing is critical to save innocent lives and secure the  safe return of hostages.   Let us never forget the lives of all children--all people--are  sacred, whether they are Palestinian children, Israeli children, or  American children, and we must do everything we can to protect them.  But if we are going to make any real progress in addressing this never- ending conflict between Israel and Hamas--there have been five wars in  the last 15 years--we need to understand somewhat as to how we got to  where we are today. If peace is to come to that troubled region and if  the Palestinian people are ever going to be able to enjoy lives of  security and dignity, there must be a vision of where we go in the  future.   So, let us be clear, the living conditions in Gaza before October 7  were horrific and inhumane, and that is before Hamas ignited the latest  war. Before this conflict, in Gaza, nearly 80 percent of people there  lived in poverty, and two-thirds were reliant on humanitarian  assistance. Almost half the population and over 70 percent of young  people were unemployed in Gaza. What kind of life could they look  forward to? Electricity there was intermittent, with 11- to 12-hour  blackouts every day. Water and sanitation systems were inadequate, and  there were constant shortages of all basic necessities.   Gaza was mostly cut off from the world, with Israel and Egypt  severely limiting the number of people and types of goods that could go  in or out. In fact, many observers described Gaza as ``an open-air  prison''--and all of that is before October 7.   If we are serious about bringing freedom and dignity to the  Palestinian people, that is a situation that can never be allowed to be  returned to. The Palestinian people are entitled to much more than  that.   In Gaza, Hamas, an authoritarian terrorist organization, ruled by  force, stockpiling arms and war materiel, taxing the desperately poor  population, and stealing resources to build tunnels and rockets. Make  no mistake about it, Hamas is a terrorist organization bent on the  destruction of Israel, and long before this horrific attack, they had  killed countless innocent people, including Americans. They advance a  fundamentalist ideology which treats women as inferior, second-class  citizens and which threatens to kill people who are gay.   Hamas is an authoritarian nightmare, repressing dissent and stealing  from Gazans not just many materials of life but the dream of a better  future. And that was the situation before October 7.   And what was going on in Israel before Hamas's terrorist attack? What  was going on there? That country had the most rightwing government in  its history, a Cabinet that included outright racist Ministers who  consistently dehumanized the Palestinian population. Benjamin  Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, was under indictment for a litany of  corruption charges, and many believe that Israel's intelligence--or  lack of intelligence--on October 7 had everything to do with his  government's preoccupation with his political problems.   Before the war, this rightwing Israeli Government had systematically  undermined the prospects of peace. Netanyahu and his extreme partners  in the Cabinet had worked to marginalize Palestinian voices committed  to peace, pursued settlement policies designed to foreclose the  possibility of a two-state solution, stymied economic development in  Palestinian areas, and passed laws that entrenched systemic inequality  between Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel.   This last year saw record Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank,  where more than 700,000 Israelis now live in areas the United Nations  and United States agree are occupied territories. Despite that, the  Israeli Government authorized thousands of new homes for settlers and  opened up new areas to construction, while bulldozing thousands of  Palestinian homes and schools and further restricting Palestinian  movement.   Legal experts agree, these policies constituted nothing less than  illegal annexation. All of these policies and more greatly increased  tension in the West Bank. Before October 7, 179 Palestinians had been  killed in 2023--179 Palestinians in the West Bank--which made it the  deadliest year in two decades. Since October 7, 121 more Palestinians  have been killed in the West Bank, including some by settlers.   These tensions were part of why so much of the IDF, the Israel  Defense Forces, was deployed in the West Bank rather than the border  with Gaza.   And then came October 7 and Hamas's atrocities that began this latest  and horrific war. The Hamas attack was unspeakable. Over 1,300 innocent  men, women, and children in Israel were killed; over 200 Israelis and  Americans taken hostage, including young children and grandparents.  Young people were gunned down in cold blood at a music festival, babies  and older people brutally murdered in their homes.   And let's remember that Hamas did not primarily target the military-- no. They intentionally targeted civilians. Their goal was to kill  civilians. Their attack was designed to provoke a response, and in that  they succeeded.   Many Israelis are now understandably furious, and they want to strike  back forcefully. I think we can all understand that. But rage and  revenge do not make useful policy. And here in the United States, after  the attack on 9/11 in this country, we acted with rage and revenge, and  I think many people now understand that that was a horrific mistake.   Killing innocent Palestinian women and children in Gaza will not  bring back to life the innocent Israeli women and children who have  been killed by Hamas. Like any other country, Israel has the right to  defend itself and destroy Hamas terrorism, but it does not have the  right to kill thousands of innocent men, women, and children in Gaza.   Israel does not have the right to endanger the lives of millions of  Palestinians--half of whom are children--by shutting off water, food,  fuel, and electricity. That type of action against a helpless and  impoverished population is morally unacceptable and in violation of  international law.   Israel does not have the right to bomb an entire neighborhood to  target one Hamas leader or installation, but that is what the Israeli  Government is doing. One need only look at the satellite imagery and  photography of Gaza to see that this is not a carefully calibrated  campaign. These are not surgical strikes.   Yesterday, Israel struck the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp  and killed a Hamas commander, but they also killed some 50 other people  and injured hundreds more, although the exact toll is not yet known.  That was actually the fourth airstrike on that community. An October 9  airstrike killed 60, an October 19 airstrike killed 18, and an October  22 airstrike killed 30, according to outside researchers.   UNRWA reported yesterday that their head of security--that is the  United Nations Relief Agency--their head of security was killed, along  with his wife and eight children. In total, 67 United Nations Relief  Agency workers have been killed, and 44 United Nations facilities have  been damaged since October 7.   The current Israeli strategy must end. Israel must begin the process  of restoring water and electrical services to areas where they are  still operable. The international community must also rush generators  and solar capacity to Gazan medical facilities to address acute needs  and reduce Israeli fears of diversion to Hamas.   Israel will not stop going after Hamas, but it must do it in a very,  very different way, and additional pauses will be needed.   Let me conclude by saying that Israel must also begin the process of  laying out a political strategy. It cannot bomb its way to a solution.  Such a strategy must include as minimum first steps a clear promise  that Palestinians displaced in the fighting will  [[Page S5274]]  have the absolute right to safely return to their homes; a commitment  to broader peace talks to advance a two-state solution in the wake of  this war; an abandonment of Israeli efforts to carve up and annex the  West Bank; and a commitment to work with the Palestinian Authority to  build genuine governing capacity.   The United States must make it clear that these are the conditions of  our solidarity. Just as we want justice for the Israelis murdered by  Hamas, we also want justice for the Palestinian people, and that is not  going to happen with Hamas. Palestinians need a state of their own,  contiguous, with the freedom of movement and access that can sustain a  vibrant economy.   This will be a long and difficult road. It will take concerted U.S.  and international support and a doubling down of our political  commitment to a two-state solution. But the first step right now must  be to stop the bombing and bring in as much humanitarian aid as  possible.   I think Secretary Blinken said it well when he said:         Providing immediate aid and protection for Palestinian       civilians in the conflict is a necessary foundation for       finding partners in Gaza who have a different vision for the       future than Hamas--and who are willing to help make it real.    This is a dreadful situation. It is part of a very, very long-term  conflict between Israel and its neighbors. But the immediate crisis is  to save lives, to stop the bombing, to bring forth a humanitarian  pause, and then to go forward to bring peace and stability to the  region.   I yield the floor.
