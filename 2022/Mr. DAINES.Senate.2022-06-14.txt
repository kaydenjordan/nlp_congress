 I want to thank the Senator from Kansas for his work on  this bill.   Madam President, the price at the pump has skyrocketed. Let's do a  quick trip down memory lane. When President Biden was inaugurated, the  weekly average price for gas was about $2.30 a gallon. In fact, when we  introduced the bill that we are trying to pass today, the Gas Price  Relief Act, that was on March 31 of this year, the weekly average was  $4.02 a gallon. The weekly average today is $4.84. In fact, other  studies show it is now at $5 and climbing. We think these numbers will  keep going up. Most analysts agree. We may be facing $6-a-gallon gas by  this summer.   I filled up my pickup in Belgrade, MT, Friday night. My wife and I  pulled into a gas station. And when the tank was full, the price tag  was $138.   The pain at the pump that Montana families are feeling today is  because of  [[Page S2929]]  the Democrats' anti-American energy policies.   When President Biden killed the Keystone Pipeline 6 hours after being  sworn in--by the way, that had tremendous benefits for the State of  Montana. They help our impoverished Eastern Montana counties with tax  revenues, not to mention providing nearly a million barrels of oil a  day for the United States. By stopping and eliminating oil and gas  leases, removing essential relief for small refiners, and then building  an administration of, frankly, some far-left anti--anti--oil and  natural gas ideologues, this administration has gone above and beyond  to hinder traditional American energy development.   And what is the solution that we are hearing from President Biden?  Turn to foreign dictators for more oil, tap into our oil reserves, beg  OPEC to increase production, and perhaps the most out-of-touch solution  I have heard, simply suggest families buy electric vehicles. I can tell  you that won't work in a State like Montana.   The real solution is to unleash American energy and encourage  American energy investment. This bill I have with Senator Marshall is  simple. It prevents the Biden administration from imposing any new  rules or regulations that would decrease oil, gas, or renewable fuel  production, which would, therefore, increase gas prices of hard-working  Montanans.   I am urging my colleagues across the aisle to think about hard- working families across this country, how are they trying to make ends  meet, to think about their constituents who depend on affordable gas  prices to get to work or drop kids off at school.   I am urging my colleagues across the aisle who say they support  American energy development, and they want to lower gas costs, to  support this bill.   We need to pass this bill for American families.   I yield back my time to the Senator from Kansas.    Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Carole Johnson of Mineral County for her dedication to the  Forest Service and her 50-plus years of public service to the people of  Montana.   Raised in Superior, MT, Carole graduated from Montana State  University--``Go Cats!''--and joined the U.S. Forest Service in 1971.  Carole started as a seasonal recreational employee on the Superior  Ranger District of the Lolo National Forest and has since worked in  nearly every facet of the Forest Service including firefighting,  logistics, silviculture, surveying, mining, and conservation education.  In 2015, Carole was named Superior District ranger, the post she held  until retiring earlier this spring. According to most accounts, at the  time of her retirement, Carole was the longest tenured federal employee  in the State of Montana.   Anyone who knows Carole will tell you that she exemplifies the  definition of a public servant. For more than 50 years, she served her  community with unmatched institutional knowledge and professionalism.  She has been a voice of reason in debates over public lands management  emphasizing that forest management and conservation go hand in hand. As  district ranger, Carole worked tirelessly to increase the timber output  on the Superior District to help benefit the local economy and support  wildfire mitigation in the community.   Outside of her role with the Forest Service, Carole is active in her  community. She serves on many boards including the Mineral Community  Hospital Board, Mineral Fair Board and the Glacier Country Tourism  Board. Through her commitment to public service, it is clear that  Carole has long been a well-respected and beloved member of the Mineral  County community.   It is my honor to recognize Carole for her dedication to the Forest  Service and her 50-plus years of public service to the great State of  Montana. Carole, thank you for your many years of public service and  commitment to improving our public lands and forests. I wish you all  the best in your retirement. You make Montana proud.                            ____________________
