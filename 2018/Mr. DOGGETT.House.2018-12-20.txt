 Mr. Speaker, millions of American families will be  enjoying the bounty of our great Nation at this very special time of  the year without realizing that their tax dollars are subsiding Saudi  war crimes in Yemen.   It is estimated that every 10 minutes, another Yemeni child dies from  starvation, disease, or bombs made in America. President Trump has  basically delegated his policy in this region to the Saudis, even after  the murder and dismemberment of an American resident directly linked to  the crown prince. That has not been enough to alter American policy.   So today, once again, a number of us are calling directly and  respectfully on Speaker Paul Ryan to stop the blockade on behalf of  President Trump and allow this House to vote--vote now--on what has  already been approved by the United States Senate on a strong  bipartisan basis, a resolution to withdraw U.S. support from the Saudi  forces in the murderous war in Yemen.   Let's stop America's role in the worst humanitarian disaster in the  world today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the voters told them: The party's over. Go  home.   But before going home, they want to go big with another big,  irresponsible national debt-busting bill. Republicans are struggling to  stuff just a little more silver in their donors' pockets as they get  pushed out the Capitol door.   Republicans are ending this session the very same way they began it  in January of last year, with arrogance, with duplicity, with total  indifference to the needs of working families across our country.   And this bill comes from the ``Great Cover Up Committee,'' the  committee that covers up as much of its tax work as possible from the  public; the committee that secretly changes the tax law to directly  benefit the Trump family; and the committee that refuses to even  review, under existing law, the Trump tax returns; the committee that  believes in overlook, not oversight of the corruption that pervades  this Trump administration.   Since Trump took office, the Republicans have feverishly pursued two  goals: Take away healthcare from the many, and award the few with more  tax benefits.   Last Friday, a Republican judge in Texas ruled that they can take  away the coverage. He declared the entire act of the Affordable Care  Act unconstitutional.   And so what is the response today from the actions of our indicted  Texas  [[Page H10472]]  Attorney General colluding with the Trump administration that refused  to defend the act? Are they here to protect Americans on preexisting  conditions? No. They are here to reward those in the healthcare  industry with more billions of dollars of tax breaks.   Today's Republican parting shot adds almost $100 billion to our  national debt, saddling existing and future Americans with that debt.   We need, in a new Congress, genuine tax reform. Today's bill does not  provide it.
