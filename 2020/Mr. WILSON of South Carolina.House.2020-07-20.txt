 Mr. Speaker, as the world has been  challenged over the past few months, we see success. As America  recovers from the Wuhan virus pandemic, I am grateful to see job  growth.   The June jobs report showed inspiring improvement. With 4.8 million  jobs added, this job growth has exceeded expectations by nearly 2  million and shows the economy continues to recuperate.   In South Carolina, over 105,000 people have rejoined the workforce,  and we now have over 2 million people employed in the Palmetto State.  It is great to see the jobs return as small businesses work to fully  recover for families.   America is resilient. I am confident, with President Donald Trump's  business-savvy leadership and proven record of creating jobs, our  citizens will come out of this stronger than ever.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our sympathy to the family of Congressman John Lewis.                            ____________________
