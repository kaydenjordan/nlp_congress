 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn Azerbaijan's  blockade of the Lachin corridor, the only humanitarian lifeline  connecting the people of Artsakh to the Republic of Armenia.   For over nearly 2 months, the region's 120,000 Armenians have been  denied food, fuel, medicine, and other essentials as a result of this  cruel and inhumane blockade.   Azerbaijan's goal is clear, to force the ethnic Armenians of Artsakh  from their homeland by imposing conditions that make life impossible.  We must hold Azerbaijan accountable for its aggression. I continue to  call on the administration to take immediate steps to end this  blockade.   We must end all U.S. military assistance to Azerbaijan. American  taxpayers shouldn't be subsidizing Azerbaijan's constant aggression  against the Armenian people.   I continue to stand in solidarity with the Armenian people and the  Armenian-American community.                            ____________________
