 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Ellen Murphy and Ms. Katie Orrel, who will retire at the end of the  year after more than 40 combined years of volunteer service at the  Southern Technology Advocacy Research Foundation, known as STAR, in  Brunswick, Georgia.   Ms. Murphy and Ms. Orrel created the STAR Foundation in 1997 to help  area citizens gain meaningful and rewarding employment opportunities  through career training classes. The training classes at STAR include  how to balance a checkbook, to use a computer, and how to write a  resume.   Ms. Orrel teaches personal financial management and interviewing  skills, and pushes her students to do their very best every day. At the  same time, Ms. Murphy has been the executive director at STAR since its  inception over  [[Page H6280]]  20 years ago, and has done a great job to grow the organization and  reach more students.   I would like to thank Ms. Murphy and Ms. Orrel once more for helping  south Georgians to advance their careers.                            ____________________
