 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Jose Hernandez, a beloved letter  carrier and local hero who was killed on the job in 2019, while trying  to resolve an argument along his route.   Residents who live along his route remember Jose as the type of  letter carrier who would go above and beyond the call of duty. His  shocking death was devastating for our community, and more than a year  later, we continue to mourn the loss.   To honor his legacy, I introduced a bill to rename his old workplace  in his honor.   Jose Hernandez has served proudly in the Army. He has four beautiful  children and a loving wife, Nikki. He served the Albuquerque area U.S.  Postal Service for 12 years.   Our letter carriers and postal workers shouldn't have to worry about  their safety when they go to work. Those who will see Jose's name on  the Five Points Post Office will remember him as the hero that he was  who went above and beyond his duty.   For these reasons and many more, I am thankful first for the entire  New Mexico delegation for their support, and for Chairwoman Maloney's  and Chairman Raskin's swift work to move my bill that will name the  post office at 1050 Sunset Road Southwest in Albuquerque to the floor,  and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 813 honoring Mr.  Hernandez.
