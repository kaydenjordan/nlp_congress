 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concern about  DNA from invasive silver carp found in the St. Joseph River, which runs  through my district.   Silver carp have overtaken watersheds across the country and would  pose a significant challenge to preserving the health of the Great  Lakes and its tributaries.   This news increases the urgency to take commonsense steps to protect  the Great Lakes from invasive species.   That is why I have continued to support bipartisan efforts that will  maintain a healthy Great Lakes ecosystem through securing funding for  the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and why I continue to support  efforts like the Brandon Road Lock and Dam to fight invasive species.   I will continue to closely monitor the additional testing conducted  by the Fish and Wildlife Service and pursue long-term solutions to keep  the Great Lakes healthy.                            ____________________
