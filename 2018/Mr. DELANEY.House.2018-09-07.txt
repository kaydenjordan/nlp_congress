 Mr. Speaker, this week we have seen firsthand another  example of how government inaction is failing the American people.   With preexisting conditions at risk, hospitals are being forced to  take on drug companies alone without any action from their Congress,  and we continue to have a staggering mental health crisis in this  country.   The Kaiser Family Foundation found that 75 percent of the American  people want preexisting conditions to be protected, conditions like  asthma, mental health, cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's, MS, Crohn's,  colitis, surgery, and pregnancy--yes, pregnancy.   Are we really going to allow women to be charged more for their  healthcare because they want to be mothers?   With out-of-control drug prices, 90 percent of the American people  agree that we should be allowing the government to negotiate with  pharmaceutical companies to lower those prices and stop the wealth  transfer from the taxpayers of the U.S. to the shareholders of these  companies. But that is not taking place.   I, for one, am tired of Congress' inaction. This week, I introduced a  letter, a bipartisan letter, to ask for additional funding to expand  programs for mental health education, treatment, and suicide  prevention.   Mr. Speaker, 87 percent of the American people believe more mental  health support should be provided to our youth, and the funding  requested in this letter will do just that.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for joining me in  their work and strongly encourage the rest of the Congress to start  acting on these important issues.                            ____________________
