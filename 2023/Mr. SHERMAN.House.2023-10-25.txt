 Mr. Speaker, I thank Hakeem Jeffries for his speech in  favor of the importance of this resolution.   The scenes from Gaza are horrendous and some cry out for a cease- fire. Hamas cannot follow a cease-fire. They exist and it is in their  charter to kill every Jew in the Middle East. If they agreed to a  cease-fire, they would fall apart. They had a cease-fire on October 6,  which is why they killed 1,400 civilians on October 7.   We can get a cease-fire when Hamas agrees to disarm and release the  hostages. The loud voices demanding a cease-fire should be shouting at  Hamas demanding those two actions.   We hear quotes from the Gaza Ministry of Health. The Gaza Ministry of  Health counts in their death counts the terrorists who are killed and  mixes them with the civilians. The Gaza Ministry of Health is under the  control of Hamas.   Hamas brutally murders Palestinians who dare to dissent. It forces  innocent Palestinians to act as human shields, and it steals aid meant  for civilians. Thirty percent of the time when it shoots a rocket in an  effort to kill an Israeli civilian, the rocket never leaves Gaza and it  falls down to Earth where it may kill Palestinians, including those who  died at that hospital in Gaza.   Israel is characterized as somehow a European colony. Keep in mind,  the majority of Israeli Jews are there from Arab States and Iran from  which they have been expelled or persecuted. This is a Middle Eastern  country of Middle Eastern descent from people who, 2,000 years ago,  lived there but also lived there right until the Arab States expelled  them or persecuted them.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to a time when we can have a two-state  solution, that begins with the destruction of Hamas.
