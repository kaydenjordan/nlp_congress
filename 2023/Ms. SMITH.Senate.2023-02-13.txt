 Madam President, thank you to my colleague Senator  Klobuchar for those very personal words about our shared friend,  Senator Dave Durenberger.   I rise today with my colleague Senator Klobuchar to honor the life of  Senator Dave Durenberger, whom we lost, as Amy said, on January 31.   Archie and I send all of our support to the Durenberger family--to  Susan, Charlie and Lois, Dave and Heather, Michael and Margaret, Daniel  and Jennifer--and to all of the family who loved him so well.   When he was first elected to the Senate in 1978, Senator Durenberger  became the first Republican Senator from Minnesota in 20 years, but his  political affiliation never defined him. Throughout his 16 years in  service in the Senate, Senator Durenberger measured his success by  doing work that helped people, not by scoring political points for  himself or his party.   Long before arriving in Washington, Senator Durenberger was committed  to public service and committed to improving the lives of Minnesotans.  He was, as Amy said, a proud graduate of St. John's University and the  University of Minnesota Law School. He also spent 2 years as an Army  officer and 7 more in the Reserves. Later, he served as chief of staff  for Gov. Harold LeVander.  [[Page S342]]    When I became chief of staff to Gov. Mark Dayton in 2010, Dave  quickly called me up to offer his advice and support, with his  characteristic understatement and dry sense of humor.   In Minnesota, Senator Durenberger was respected as a volunteer, a  thinker, a doer. He was always ready to pitch in and help with a wide  array of organizations that he saw were doing good work, from those  dedicated to environmental protection to conservation, to children's  health.   In the Senate, Dave built a reputation as a powerful advocate and  expert on healthcare reform. He was instrumental in passing the  landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, which recognized the civil  rights of people living with disabilities, and he was an effective  leader on legislation to protect our air and water, to clean up  Superfund sites, and to protect public lands so that all of our  children and grandchildren could enjoy them forever.   After he left the Senate, he continued to advocate for the things  that he cared about, from improving healthcare to protecting the  environment. He became one of the Nation's leading health policy  experts at the University of St. Thomas and helped to mentor the next  generation of health policy leaders.   When I came to the Senate and won a seat on the Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee, a committee that Dave also served on, he  immediately reached out to me to offer support and ideas. Every year,  he organized a group of young healthcare leaders, through the Health  Policy Center at St. Thomas, to come to Washington, and I always made  time to sit down and talk with them. It was so great to see how Senator  Durenberger continued to instill in these policy fellows the mission of  diving in beneath the headlines to figure out exactly what would help  to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for everyone.   When Dave was elected to the Senate, he was an Independent  Republican, as the Minnesota State party was then called. He later  dropped the Republican part and was a proud Independent--always willing  to work with both Democrats and Republicans to solve problems. He was  an outspoken critic of President Trump, and he lamented the extremism  in the Republican Party today. Dave always stood for bipartisanship,  pragmatism, and politics that was about improving people's lives. He  proudly called himself a progressive Republican. I love that.   If I had to name one thing that characterized Senator Dave  Durenberger, it would be his determination to find solutions to the  problems that hold people back in their lives, especially problems with  healthcare. He didn't care whether an idea came from Republicans or  Democrats. He just cared about what was going to make a difference.   As I reflect on his life and his time in the Senate, I am reminded  that his Midwestern brand of bipartisan, commonsense, pragmatic  politics still lives on in the Senate today. Beneath the headlines and  the division and extremism, many of us on both sides of the aisle still  carry on his legacy by working together to try to find common ground  and solve problems.   Today, as we mourn the loss of Senator Durenberger, let us take  inspiration from his example of thoughtful, pragmatic, and results- oriented politics. May his memory be a blessing.   Madam President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for Annette  Christie, Holly Hajare, Sindhu Nathan, and Mary Parrish, all fellows in  my office, to have floor privileges for the rest of the current session  of Congress.
