 Madam Speaker, for the first time in over 3 years,  California is drought-free.   This year's rainfall has helped to replenish depleted groundwater and  reservoirs, but we have missed an opportunity to capture and store more  of this valuable resource.   Since October of 2022, over 28 million acre-feet of water has been  sent to the ocean, enough surface supply to sustain our agriculture  producers for an entire year. We can and must do better so our  communities are prepared for both dry and wet years.   Last week, the House passed my bill, the WATER for California Act as  part of the Energy and Water appropriations bill.   This bill makes additional funding available for raising Shasta Dam,  extends authorization of the successful water storage project program  established by the WIIN Act, and codifies the 2019 biological opinions.   These actions aim to provide a clean, reliable water supply to our  communities and farmers who grow one-quarter of the country's food.   If California's water problems continue to go unaddressed, the entire  Nation's food supply is at risk.   Madam Speaker, I urge the Senate to keep these provisions in the bill  and get this bill across the finish line.                            ____________________
