 Mr. Speaker, since 1997, the Children's Health  Insurance Program, or CHIP, has provided low-cost health insurance for  millions of children across the United States of America.   Unfortunately, in another apparent sabotage to our Nation's  healthcare system, Congress failed to reauthorize CHIP funding before  it expired on September 30. Without immediate action, States will soon  have to curtail care for our neediest children.   In my home State of Illinois, alone, over 295,000 children rely on  CHIP for everything from routine checkups to immunizations. Congress'  continued failure to reauthorize this critical program is jeopardizing  the well-being of millions of America's children.   Congress will be going into recess again next week without taking any  action to reauthorize this bipartisan and essential program for  children. Meanwhile, millions of kids could go without care because of  our failure to act. We must do better.                            ____________________
