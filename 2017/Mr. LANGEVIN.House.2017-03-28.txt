 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution of  disapproval, which would repeal broadband privacy rules being  implemented by the FCC.   As co-chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, I hope I can  offer some additional perspective on this debate. Studying the many  threats our country faces in cyberspace, I have become deeply aware of  how ingrained the internet is in every aspect of our lives and our  economy. And that has also helped me understand the unique role of  broadband service providers to grant access to the great potential of  the Information Age.   By necessity, ISPs see every bit of traffic that leaves your network  for the broader internet. Even when you use encryption, ISPs can still  capture data about whom you are talking to or what sites you are  visiting. These data are sensitive, and consumers have a right to  decide whether or not they can be shared or monetized. Unfortunately,  the resolution of disapproval under consideration would strip consumers  of that right and presumptively allow sharing and selling without your  permission.   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today that the Republicans have  proposed is downright creepy. It is going to allow potentially  unprecedented abuse of personal or private information be shared  without your permission. This cannot stand. I urge my colleagues to  oppose it.
