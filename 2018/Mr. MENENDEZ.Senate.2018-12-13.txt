 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  the U.S.-Saudi Arabia relationship in the broader context of America's  interests in the Middle East.   I want to begin by responding to an op-ed Secretary of State Pompeo  published in the Wall Street Journal in which he called the U.S.-Saudi  Arabia partnership ``vital.'' That statement reflects a distorted view  of the U.S.-Saudi Arabia relationship that has permeated the Trump  administration in which the United States is somehow dependent on the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for regional stability and security  cooperation. It is a view perhaps best articulated by the President's  own unhinged pre-Thanksgiving statement in which he suggested that  selling weapons to the Saudis was more important than America's  enduring commitment to human rights, democratic values, and  international norms, or the President and Secretary Pompeo's continued,  incredulous insistence that we still don't know whether the Crown  Prince is directly responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.   Desperate to justify this myopic view, Trump officials whimper that  Saudi Arabia's military operations in Yemen are the only means to  ``root out'' Iranian influence and defend the status quo of U.S.  support for the Saudi-led coalition.   To put it another way, these morally blindered and blinded  individuals believe that to advance America's interests in the region,  there is no other option than dependence on Riyadh and no other way  than business as usual. So the United States should just stay the  course, resign to accept, with a so-called ``vital'' partner, a  government that lures a Washington Post columnist--an American resident  with U.S. citizen children--to its consulate in a third country with  the express intent of eliminating his dissenting views from public  discourse in the most gruesome way possible.   I, for one, reject Secretary Pompeo's false choice. We can be tough  on Iranian aggression, and we can continue our efforts to eliminate al- Qaida and ISIS. At the same time, we can have a reality-based debate on  the strategic utility of the U.S.-Saudi partnership. Our security  interests and our values demand such a debate.   I believe that we can pursue an effective strategy to counter  terrorism and Iranian aggression while also demanding better from the  U.S.-Saudi Arabia partnership. That means standing up for transparency,  accountability, and truth when our partners flagrantly violate American  values, disregard international norms, and take actions that undermine  our broader strategic interests and run counter to regional security.   The Trump administration has cynically framed this vote as a binary,  zero-sum choice: You are either for Iran, or you are for Saudi Arabia.   Well, my answer to that is, I am for the United States of America. I  am for America's security interests. I am for American values. And I am  for partnerships and alliances deeply rooted in both.   I can't imagine that any one of my colleagues on either side of the  aisle would put me in the pro-Iran camp. I take a backseat to no one in  the Senate in taking the lead to end Iran's pathway to a nuclear weapon  and to end its nefarious promotion of terrorism across the world.   To be clear, the vote on S.J. Res. 54 is not about the totality of  the U.S.-Saudi relationship; it is a vote about whether U.S. support  for the Saudi-led coalition's actions in Yemen are in our national  interests.   We do indeed have important security interests with the Saudis. Both  of our nations benefit from cooperation in confronting threatening  forces. Yet we cannot sweep under the rug the callous disregard for  human life and the flagrant violations of international norms the  Saudis have shown. That is why, as ranking member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, I continue to look for the opportunity to continue  to examine components of the U.S.-Saudi relationship and determine  whether that relationship requires a course correction.   Beyond Saudi Arabia, I do not want any of our security partners to  interpret our relationship as a blank check. Unfortunately, whether due  to the President's possibly unconstitutional financial entanglements or  his family's overly cozy relationship with the Crown Prince, this  administration is putting the Saudi Government on a pedestal that  stands above America's values. They continue to extend a blank check to  certain players within the Saudi Government, no matter how brazen their  actions, rather than meaningfully seeking to influence Riyadh or ensure  that U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia is properly balanced and in line  with our strategic interests, not directed by the personal and  financial motives of select individuals in our government.   This refusal to stand up for American values, to assert true  leadership, is part of the Trump administration's willful adherence to  a misguided understanding of the most effective ways to bring stability  to the Middle East. It is an outgrowth of the President's reckless,  morally bankrupt approach to foreign policy and a love affair with  authoritarian strongmen.   Mr. President, I hope today to frame some critical questions about  the U.S.-  [[Page S7561]]  Saudi relationship in the context of America's long-term interests in  the region. Let's start with taking stock of actions taken by Saudi  Arabia over the last 2 years--the 2 years that, according to Secretary  Pompeo, the Trump administration has been ``rebuilding'' the U.S.-Saudi  partnership while we here in the ``salons of Washington'' were  caterwauling about human rights.   In June of 2017, a quartet of Arab countries announced a full  blockade of a fellow Gulf Cooperation Council member, Qatar. The Saudi- led bloc justified this blockade by accusing Qatar of transgressions  that, while seriously concerning, are not unique to Qatar or even to  some members of the Saudi-led bloc, such as financial support for  terror.   This blockade tosses out decades of investment by Republicans and  Democratic U.S. administrations to partner with the entire Gulf  Cooperation Council--Qatar included--on security challenges ranging  from Iran, al-Qaida, missile defense, maritime security, and cyber  threats.   Put another way, the Saudi-Qatar dispute has translated into a lot  more work for our military professionals and diplomats for the past  year as the gulf Arabs have fought amongst each other and have  interrupted critical priorities like defeating ISIS and countering  Iranian aggression. It has also complicated the coordination with our  Arab partners on U.S. foreign policy priorities, like stabilizing Libya  and Syria, and, potentially, deeply undermined U.S. objectives, like  stability in the Horn of Africa.   Who is the winner of this rift that has been constructed by our  Saudi-led partners? Iran.   Mr. President, in turning to Yemen, the Saudis and their partners  have continued their brutal air campaign in Yemen, often  indiscriminately. Tens of thousands of innocent Yemenis have died, and  millions more are on the brink of starvation. Meanwhile, Iran's  influence has increased within the country, and al-Qaida has taken  advantage of the chaos to expand its reach and control of Yemeni  territory.   The winners of this fruitless war? Iran and al-Qaida.   Then, in November 2017, Mr. President, the Prime Minister of Lebanon  traveled to Saudi Arabia for what he reportedly believed was to be a  friendly visit with the Saudi Crown Prince.   Instead, the Crown Prince detained Prime Minister Saad Hariri and, on  TV, forced him to resign from his position. Let that sink in for a  moment. A newly minted Crown Prince effectively hoodwinked and  intimidated a sitting Prime Minister into publicly resigning his  position. This entire stunt was reportedly intended to push back on  Iran's expanding influence in the region.   After days of high drama and uncertainty, including a refusal by  Lebanon's President to accept the Prime Minister's resignation, Hariri  left Saudi Arabia via Paris and returned to a Lebanon where Iran's  proxy Hezbollah remains not only a part of the Lebanese Government but,  arguably, in a stronger position for rallying public support behind  Hariri.   The winner of this foolish plunder? Iran.   Mr. President, that very same month of November 2017, Crown Prince  Muhammad bin Salman directed the detention of hundreds of Saudi princes  and executives at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. While this effort was  spun as a crackdown on corruption, it was clearly a crackdown on the  Crown Prince's political competitors. Reports from this dark period in  the gilded prison of the Ritz indicate that Saudi Government-directed  forces tortured detainees and coerced them into transferring money to  the government or giving up real estate and shares in companies.   Now, I don't know how they obtained those resources, and I am, in no  way, condoning any graft and exploitation in the Kingdom, but this  opaque process--outside any semblance of the rule of law and driven  purely by the will of the Crown Prince--is not actually a sustainable  approach to promoting transparency and accountability. In fact, it  should and did send chills down the spines of investors and American  companies that seek to expand commercial and economic ties in the  Kingdom. A strong respect for the rule of law is an essential condition  for doing business.   So when Trump points to the value of business ties with Saudi Arabia  as a reason for not imposing consequences for Khashoggi's murder, let's  remember that in the hands of the Crown Prince, anyone can be shaken  down, locked up, or tortured at a five-star hotel in Muhammad bin  Salman's Saudi Arabia. Let's also continue asking who exactly is  benefiting from potential business ties.   Mr. President, Secretary Pompeo mentioned in his op-ed last week that  the Crown Prince has ``moved the country in a reformist direction, from  allowing women to drive and attend sporting events, to curbing the  religious police and calling for a return to moderate Islam.''   What the Secretary did not mention, however, are the deeply  disturbing reports that, at the same time MBS was granting Saudi women  the right to drive, he also detained many female activists who were  themselves calling for the rights of women, including their right to  drive. Now we are hearing reports that these women are being tortured  and sexually harassed, bound to iron beds, electrocuted, and beaten.   Is this the kind of reform that Secretary Pompeo believes the United  States should endorse?   As for calling for a return to moderate Islam, the Anti-Defamation  League reports that Saudi state television hosted several hour-long  programs this Ramadan that featured a preacher who called for God to  destroy the Christians, Shiites, Alawites, and Jews. Other analyses  published by the Anti-Defamation League this November found that Saudi  Government-published textbooks for the 2018-2019 academic year promote  incitement to hatred or violence against Jews, Christians, women, and  homosexual men.   As ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said:         The United States must hold its ally Saudi Arabia to a       higher standard. The U.S. cannot look the other way while       Saudi Arabia features anti-Semitic hate speech year after       year in the educational material it gives its children.    Mr. President, let's take stock of Saudi Arabia's contributions to  regional stability. It seems a fitting time to ask if an approach that  involves bullying another U.S. regional partner, holding the Prime  Minister of Lebanon hostage, torturing female activists, business  executives, and other princes, and carrying out a military campaign in  Yemen that will result in the death of millions more civilians by  year's end is an approach that is in line with U.S. values or  priorities.   Has Iran been weakened by these actions? Is the focus still on al- Qaida and defeating ISIS? I don't think so.   Mr. President, the President has made it clear that no U.S. foreign  policy objective, especially human rights, is as important to him as  securing tens of billions of imaginary dollars to create million  fantasy jobs through weapons sales to the Saudis.   Congress has long and well established the overseeing of the sale of  weapons as part of U.S. foreign policy. We have learned throughout our  history that selling weapons is a complex matter and that without close  attention to the human rights practices of foreign buyers, the United  States can easily find itself in the situation that we are now in with  Saudi Arabia.   U.S. arms, today, are being used irresponsibly, tragically, and in  possible violation of international law in the deaths and injuries of  tens of thousands of innocent civilians, including of helpless  children. The United States must elevate human rights concerns in all  aspects of its foreign security assistance, including arms sales.  Otherwise, the abuses that result will do more to foment the conditions  of unrest and despair that are the breeding ground of conflict, war,  and terrorism.   Secretary Pompeo also suggested that if the United States in any way  reassesses its relationship with Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom will rush  into Russian arms.   I would suggest, Mr. Secretary, that most countries in the Middle  East are already hedging against perceptions that the United States is  not invested in the region and that those assessments are based on the  President himself--how else to explain Putin's high five with the Crown  Prince at the G20 in Argentina? Is it from the parade of gulf rulers in  Russia who are doing deals on the margins of the World Cup  [[Page S7562]]  earlier this year or by the announcements by several U.S. partners of  talks to purchase the Russian S-400 system, despite the prospect of  congressional sanctions under the CAATSA law?   Given not just the war in Yemen but also the murder of Khashoggi and  the blockage of Qatar, I believe we need to take steps to recalibrate  the future of the U.S.-Saudi relationship.   That is why I am disappointed that the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee did not take up the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act  of 2018, which is legislation that I am leading, along with Senators  Young, Reed, Graham, Shaheen, Collins, and others. We will continue to  work on this legislation next year. It does not seek to tear down the  entire Saudi-U.S. relationship. Instead, it is carefully calibrated to  force a rebalancing in priorities.   The United States should no longer be selling weapons to the Kingdom  that will be used to kill women and children in Yemen. We should,  however, continue to support Saudi Arabia's legitimate defensive needs,  like intercepting Houthi missiles coming from Yemen.   The United States should no longer refuel Saudi coalition aircraft  for operations in Yemen, which is clearly correlated with a rise in  civilian casualties.   The United States must now take a stand against all stakeholders in  this conflict that are blocking humanitarian access, preventing forward  movement under the U.N. peace process, or receiving weapons from Iran.   Our bill also ensures that Congress right-sizes its oversight over  this relationship. The Trump administration must follow the letter of  the Global Magnitsky Act, and it must take a firm stand in support of  human rights when it comes to Saudi Arabia.   This is not caterwauling or the media piling on. This is Congress  doing what the American people elected us to do--ensure that the U.S.  Government conducts foreign policy in a manner that protects the United  States and the American people. We are not doing our job if foreign  governments believe they can murder journalists and dissidents with  impunity and disregard international norms without damaging their  relationships with the United States.   Saudi Arabia has joined a sinister clique, along with North Korea,  Russia, and Iran, in its assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. A few more  weapons purchases cannot buy our silence, and they should not buy our  silence. If the President will not act, Congress must.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object, I do not intend to  object. I just want to say that on this resolution, there is a central  reason why I am not going to object.   I don't agree with some of the language that speaks about the  economic interests we have with Saudi Arabia. I think their behavior is  more than concerning, but what the distinguished  [[Page S7566]]  chairman on the Foreign Relations Committee is trying to do here at the  core of it is the critical element.   I am going to be supportive because of this one singular statement  under the resolved clause by the Senate and the House of  Representatives that the Senate ``believes Crown Prince Mohammed bin  Salman is responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.''   Regardless of all of my other concerns about language, that is the  central essence of what the chairman is going to do. I think it is  incredibly important for the Senate to speak on that issue and,  hopefully, speak with one voice.   With that, I withdraw my objection.
