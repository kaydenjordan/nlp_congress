Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                time  1330                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule,  House Resolution 145, providing for consideration of H.R. 8, the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, and H.R. 1112, the Enhanced  Background Checks Act of 2019.   The rule provides for consideration of each bill under a structured  rule. The rule also provides 1 hour of general debate on each bill  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on the Judiciary.   The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 and the Enhanced  Background Checks Act of 2019 arrived at a time of emergency for  America--a real emergency. Every year 120,000 Americans are shot in our  country, and 35,000 of them are shot dead. Seventeen thousand of the  people wounded or killed each year are children or teenagers, their  families devastated, their lives forever changed.   In 2017, gun deaths in America hit the highest level in 40 years,  with 40,000 Americans killed.   We have lost more Americans to gun violence in our own communities  than to the Vietnam war, the Revolutionary  [[Page H2120]]  War, the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean war, the Iraq  war, and the Afghan war, combined. This war at home never stops. Each  day--yesterday, today, and tomorrow--another 100 people in America are  shot and killed by gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, this is not a global problem; it is an American problem.  While 35,000 Americans are killed by gunfire here each year, it is 146  people in the United Kingdom, 142 in Portugal, and 30 in Japan.   We lose more people to gun violence in a single weekend than England  loses all year. We lost more people in the Las Vegas massacre alone, in  one bloody night, than the nation of Japan lost to gun violence in 8  years.   No other developed, high-income country's lethal gun violence even  comes close to the American carnage allowed by our loophole-ridden gun  laws. The gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times  higher than the average of other high-income countries and hundreds of  times higher than some of them.   Now, the good news is that we know what to do to begin to end this  crisis. We must close the loopholes.   In 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act went into effect  and required licensed firearm dealers to contact the FBI to run a  background check through NICS, the National Instant Criminal Background  Check System.   The Brady Act made it illegal to sell a firearm to felons, to  fugitives, to people who had been committed to mental institutions, to  drug addicts, to domestic abusers, to undocumented immigrants, and to  other disqualified categories.   The Brady Act worked as far as it went. It stopped more than 3  million illegal purchases of firearms by convicted felons, violently  abusive partners, fugitives, the mentally ill, and so on. But there are  gaping loopholes in the law because unlicensed gun sellers, the people  who sell guns online today or at gun shows or in other private  transactions, can sell firearms without having to run any background  check whatsoever.   More than one-fifth of U.S. gun owners acquired their most recent  firearm without any background check at all, which means that millions  of people obtained millions of firearms without going through the Brady  system, and people who commit gun crimes overwhelmingly obtain their  firearms from the unlicensed sources. A 2013 study found that 80  percent of all firearms acquired for criminal purposes were obtained  from sources that were not required to go through the background check.   The criminals are not stupid. They follow the loopholes. They go to  the internet. They go to the gun shows. They go to the convenience  store parking lots to get their weapons of mass destruction without any  background check at all.   Our legislation will close these dangerous loopholes by guaranteeing  that there is a thorough NICS background check on every gun sale or  transfer, with only a few carefully defined exceptions for intrafamily  gifts and a few other cases.   Mr. Speaker, there are three primary things you need to know about  this legislation:   First, it is backed by more than 90 percent of the American people-- fully, 97 percent of Americans, including 97 percent of gun owners, 97  percent of Republicans, and 99 percent of Democrats. It is the very  essence of common sense, the sense we all have in common, to make the  background check system comprehensive and universal, leakproof,  foolproof, and not ridden by the loopholes.   A background check doesn't work if criminals know that there are  massive and lawful ways to cheat and get around it. So America, today,  stands up to close the loopholes, and that is why this is a day of  great triumph for the gun safety movement that has swept America in  response to Parkland, Las Vegas, Newtown, and the other massacres that  our people have endured.   Second, this legislation is perfectly constitutional. As Justice  Scalia found for the Supreme Court in the District of Columbia v.  Heller decision, the Second Amendment permits reasonable regulation to  exclude from gun ownership violent felons, the mentally unstable, and  so on.   Despite all of the solemn invocations of the Second Amendment that we  continue to hear bouncing off of the walls of Congress, the opponents  of this legislation could not muster a single witness to actually argue  that this legislation is unconstitutional, and that includes the George  Mason University Antonin Scalia School of Law professor of  constitutional law and the Second Amendment who was brought in and just  expressed her policy misgivings about the bill without articulating any  constitutional analysis at all and rejected the opportunity to say that  this legislation is unconstitutional.    The reason 97 percent of Americans favor this legislation is because  it is perfectly consistent with the letter and spirit of the Second  Amendment, and it sweepingly advances public safety at the same time.   Third, this bill will dramatically lower gun violence in America.  More than 90 percent of Brady background checks take less than 90  seconds to complete. But these checks have literally stopped more than  3 million illegal gun purchases by felons, fugitives, domestic  offenders, the violently mentally ill, undocumented aliens, and so on.  Every day, background checks stop 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers  from purchasing a gun. Imagine how much more effective this system will  be when we close these gaping loopholes.   Yet, even in the face of the shocking death toll which distinguishes  our society from the other wealthy societies on Earth, despite the  overwhelming public support for this legislation, and despite its clear  constitutionality, our friends across the aisle oppose closing the  internet, the gun show, and the private sale loopholes.   Instead of getting on our side to close the loopholes, what do they  give us? More loopholes. They brought us dozens of amendments to try to  suggest more loopholes to the current law.   That is obviously not the direction that America needs to go in, and  you will hear some more about that today, Mr. Speaker. They have given  us a veritable loophole factory. But now is the time to close  loopholes, not reproduce them.   Let's focus on the public safety, which is the cardinal purpose of  law in the social contract in a democratic society. Let's pass this  excellent bill, and let's pass H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background  Checks Act of 2019, which closes the Charleston loophole, the loophole  that made it possible for a guy to go out and get a gun because the  dealer decided to give him a gun after 3 days because they were still  doing a background check.   This loophole says that if it has taken 3 days or more, you have a  right to go ahead and get your gun. We are going to close that one, the  so-called default proceed provision. We are going to close that one,  too, so that we don't see any repeat massacres like the one that took  place in June of 2015 at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church  in Charleston, South Carolina.   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement by the National Task  Force to End Sexual & Domestic Violence, which is in favor of this  legislation and against any weakening amendments.           National Task Force To End Sexual & Domestic Violence         The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic       Violence, a coalition comprising federal, state, local and       tribal organizations and individuals who have fought for  [[Page H2122]]       federal protections for survivors of domestic violence,       dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, oppose any       amendments to H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of       2019, that exempts any persons from the firearms background       check requirement. This includes amendments exempting victims       and survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault,       including those with protective orders.        Firearms pose a significant danger to victims of domestic       violence, and this is true no matter who owns the firearm.       Research shows that a male abuser's access to a firearm       increases the risk of intimate partner femicide fivefold and       does not support the contention that firearm possession is a       protective factor for the victim. The testimony of Christy       Salters Martin, a professional boxer and experienced gun       user, to the Senate Judiciary Committee illustrates this.       Despite her boxing prowess and familiarity with firearms, her       abuser was able to take her gun from her and shoot her with       it, narrowly missing her heart. Firearms do not make victims       of domestic violence safer; firearms put victims at greater       risk.        Furthermore, domestic abusers are adept at using the       justice system against victims. Abusers often accuse the       victim of being the perpetrator of violence, making police       reports and seeking protective orders. Abusers are also adept       at finding loopholes. If persons with protective orders are       exempted from the background check requirement, many abusers       who are prohibited from possessing firearms would seek       protective orders in order to circumvent the background check       requirement to obtain firearms to terrorize their victims.        Moreover, requiring a victim to undergo a firearms       background check is not a hurdle to obtaining a firearm. Most       firearm background checks are completed in under a minute. A       victim seeking to purchase a firearm would still be able to       do so quickly, unless the victim was legally prohibited from       possessing firearms.        Rather than adding dangerous exemptions to a law that is       supposed to protect victims and survivors of domestic       violence, Congress should focus on ensuring that adjudicated       domestic abusers do not possess firearms. This includes       ensuring federal firearms prohibitors protect all victims of       intimate partner violence, including dating partners, and       ensuring that domestic abusers who are prohibited from       possessing firearms relinquish their firearms. The best way       to protect victims is to disarm abusers.     Just to quote a small part of it: ``Firearms pose a  significant danger to victims of domestic violence, and this is true no  matter who owns the firearm. Research shows that a male abuser's access  to a firearm increases the risk of intimate partner femicide fivefold  and does not support the contention that firearm possession is a  protective factor for the victim.''   And there is more in here of interest.   I would like to thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona for her  thoughts on the question of sexual and domestic violence.   We, indeed, have a provision within the legislation which allows for  an exemption from the background check requirement in cases of an  imminent threat of great bodily harm.   The question has been raised: Does that include sexual assault,  dating partner violence, stalking, and so on? We thought it was self- evident that it did, but, in any event, Representatives Horn from  Oklahoma and Murphy from Florida are introducing a clarifying amendment  to be very specific that it is included.   At that point, perhaps we could welcome the support of the  distinguished gentlewoman from Arizona, because we are being very clear  at that point that our exception for imminent bodily harm and violence  includes sexual assault and so on.   I am certain that the gentlewoman's intentions are good, just as are  the intentions of the offerers of the amendment in the bill.   Let me just address, in case the gentlewoman hasn't decided to come  over to our side now, some of the general points that were made against  the legislation.   The gentlewoman articulated an argument we have been hearing a lot of  from our counterparts, which is that criminals don't follow the law  and, therefore, there is no reason to get rid of the loopholes and  strengthen the law, because criminals won't follow the law.   Now, the fallacy of that argument is plain to see. It is an argument  against all law.   It is an argument against the law against murder because murderers  obviously don't follow the law against murder.   It is an argument against the law opposed to theft because thieves  don't follow the law against theft.   But I think anyone who takes time to really study what law is  understands that the purpose of the law is to deter people from  negative, socially harmful action, the way that the Brady Act has  deterred more than 3 million people--felons, fugitives, the mentally  unstable, and other unauthorized categories--from accessing a weapon.   Now, that argument sweeps so broadly that it is an argument against  having the Brady Act that we have now, and perhaps that is the  intention, simply to take down the law that we have got now.   Another purpose of law, of course, is to punish people who violate it  and then, again, to send a moral message about what the social norms  are.   And we have got social norms about driving, for example. Would we say  we are not going to have driver's licenses in America because people  who drive without a driver's license ignore the law requiring you to  have a driver's license?   It is a completely nonsensical argument.   Let's come back to reality and talk about what the Brady Act actually  requires the gun dealers to ask people.   Here are the basic questions that are being asked:   Are you under indictment for or have you ever been convicted of a  felony?   Are you a fugitive from justice?   Are you an unlawful user of a controlled substance?   Do you suffer from mental illness?   Have you been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces?   Are you subject to a court order restraining you from harassing,  stalking, or threatening your child or an intimate partner?   Have you ever been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic  violence?   Have you renounced your United States citizenship?   Are you unlawfully present in the United States?   Mr. Speaker, those questions have created a dragnet that has allowed  us to stop more than 3 million people from getting weapons who  shouldn't have them.   But there are these big, gaping loopholes out there that they can go  on the Internet and get one, or they can go to the parking lot of a  convenience store in a private sale and get one, or they can go to a  gun show and negotiate a private sale and get one without having to  answer those questions.   Well, the American people have spoken on this. That is really why  this is the first legislation advocating gun safety to hit the floor of  the House of Representatives in a quarter of a century.   This is a great day for the gun safety movement that has overtaken  America, rejecting the unconscionable toll of 100 people dead every  single day in communities across the land.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson), the sponsor of the underlying bill, H.R. 8, who has done  such a magnificent job advocating this cause through thick and thin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I suppose that we are in a rush to do anything, something, anything  that works in order to curb the terrible toll of gun violence on our  society.   In the last Congress it is true there was other legislation that was  brought to us. One was a proposal to legalize silencers in America,  which sounds to me more like an agenda of organized crime than it is of  the U.S. Congress trying to seek public safety.   But there was this bipartisan Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which  was a massive assault on federalism and States' rights. It would have  destroyed every State's concealed carry law in the country to a level  at the lowest common denominator. So if you could get a license to  carry a concealed loaded weapon in one State--and in some States there  are more than a million people who have been able to get them through  completely permissive and lax laws--then you could go anywhere in the  country. That is their proposal. That is what is coming out of the  loophole factory.   I just would like to assure my friend that we have a provision in our  legislation, if you read it carefully, which says that you can  temporarily transfer a gun at a shooting range, at a shooting gallery,  or for purposes of hunting, so he doesn't have to worry about this.   Our friends are either not reading carefully enough or they are  overlooking very clear passages in our legislation which deal with  commonsense concerns.   This is bipartisan legislation. It is backed by more than 90 percent  of the American people, and it is going to advance common safety. So  rather than searching for mysterious reasons to oppose it, why  shouldn't everybody get together to say this is something that will  promote the public safety?   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Castor).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank my colleague for advancing our discussion here  because I think now we are really starting to get somewhere.   The gentlewoman suggested an amendment which allows for the transfer  of a firearm to a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault who has  an order of protection issued by a court. That is an extremely narrow  exception.   Most women who are enduring domestic violence don't have a civil  protection order. Part of that is because of the incompetence of the  laws in a lot of States, and part of it is because they haven't had the  wherewithal to go and get one.   But our legislation and our amendment sweeps much more broadly. It  allows any woman who is a victim of domestic violence, who faces a  threat from their attacker, to be loaned a gun by a family member or be  loaned a gun by a friend until the threat is resolved.   My friend suggests that there is something ambiguous about the words.  I just don't see the ambiguity. Their original argument attacked the  utility of all criminal law, saying we shouldn't have criminal laws,  essentially, because criminals won't follow them.   This seems like an attack on law itself. Law depends upon language.  But the language is clear here that if there is a threat and if you are  suffering from the threat of domestic violence, sexual assault and so  on, then you can get the gun.   Who interprets it? Well, you have got the right to go out and get it.  If someone were to prosecute you for doing that, the prosecution would  clearly lose.   So I am afraid that our friends are looking for problems in this  bipartisan legislation which simply don't exist.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, to clarify one thing, this is bipartisan  legislation. We have at least five Republicans who are cosponsoring and  supporting this legislation. I assume my friend doesn't mean to read  those five Republican Members of the House of Representatives out of  her caucus.   I am not quite sure what happened in Maine, but I know that there are  around a dozen States and the District of Columbia that have already  gotten rid of the loopholes that we are going to get rid of today in  this Federal legislation.   My friend also invokes Second Amendment rights. I thought that we had  put that red herring to rest in 2008 in Heller v. District of Columbia.  Justice Scalia said that reasonable regulation to screen out felons and  fugitives and the mentally unstable is perfectly consistent with the  Second Amendment.   Everybody on both sides of the aisle favors the Second Amendment,  along with the rest of the Bill of Rights. If you are going to oppose  this legislation, you have to base it on some public safety rationale  and not pretend like anybody has made a constitutional argument,  because nobody has made a constitutional argument.   Finally, on the question of the domestic violence amendment, I would  invite my friend to come on over, and we would gladly have unanimous  consent to have her added to the amendment, which is the broader  amendment she is talking about. Of course, her amendment was the narrow  one, which required you to have a civil protection order before there  would be an exception from the provisions of the legislation.   She said she was misdirected by the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee. All I can say is the legislative process is a treacherous  place and a rocky road for people in the minority. I have been dealing  with that for several years. In any event, we would love to have you  join the amendment now. Mr. Speaker, I make that offer to my friend.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), who is the great and distinguished  chairman of the Committee on Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, far from trying to turn law-abiding citizens into  criminals, our legislation will save law-abiding citizens from  criminals, simply by expanding the successful Brady law, which has been  in effect for decades now.   The gentlewoman introduces a constitutional argument at the last  minute here, saying that our legislation is unconstitutional because  there may be undue fees imposed. Of course, those are the fees that are  currently imposed under the Brady law, so I am afraid that my friend  has just made an argument for the unconstitutionality of the current  law, which has saved us from more than 3 million felons, fugitives,  mentally unstable people, drug abusers, and undocumented aliens from  acquiring firearms in the country.   Mr. Speaker, our country is a social contract. I know we have got a  lot of young people here today. We are a social contract. If you go  back and read any of the social contracts--there is Thomas Hobbes, John  Locke, or Thomas Jefferson--any of them say, we leave a state of  nature, which is a state of war and a state of violence, in order to  live in a civilized way.   But how civilized is it when tens of thousands of Americans, every  year, are being killed in firearm violence? Every day, another hundred  Americans are killed with guns.   In 2017, the highest level in 40 years, nearly 40,000 Americans died  from gun violence. That is not a civilized state. That is a state of  war. That is a state of violence.   We know what the loopholes are, and we are going to close the  loopholes with our bipartisan legislation, which has support from  Republicans and it has support from Democrats. The public opinion polls  show that more than 95 percent of the American people support what we  are trying to do here--close the gun show loophole, close the private  sale loophole, close the internet loophole--make sure that everybody  who purchases a gun in America is purchasing it only with the universal  comprehensive mental and criminal background check.   We have amendments for the discrete exceptions that are necessary,  including in cases of imminent violence, including rape and sexual  assault via domestic violence. We think that this legislation is  excellent legislation that every Member of Congress should feel proud  voting for.   Mr. Speaker, I submit both H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Check  Act, as well as the bill to close the Charleston loophole, so that  criminals are not given guns after 3 days. We are able to delay that  process in the event that more investigation is needed.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
