 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this veto override  resolution to support the Michigan and American workers and to hold  those who violate U.S. trade laws accountable.   Let me be clear: I am proud to have worked with President Biden and  his administration on important new laws, new laws like the CHIPS and  Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, which I had a hand in  writing. These legislative victories have helped to bring back critical  manufacturing and to create good-paying American jobs.   However, on this particular issue, the President and I disagree.   For far too long, bad trade deals and unfair trade practices from  other countries have hurt American workers. I believe that we need to  enforce our current trade laws and strengthen our ability to fight  unfair trade practices.                                time  1415    When companies explicitly endeavor to evade, to circumvent our trade  laws, there is no choice. We have to hold them accountable. That is why  Congress, with strong bipartisan votes in both the House and the  Senate, acted on our legislation.   The Biden administration's own Commerce Department investigation  found that companies are evading U.S. tariffs on solar imports by  circumventing those provisions. Yet, the administration has suspended  enforcement on this matter. That is not acceptable to the specific  workers that I represent because, let's keep in mind, we have to be  thinking about the entirety of the supply chain when it comes to solar  energy production, including polysilicon production.   By suspending tariffs on those that violate our trade laws, we are  rewarding the worst behavior and penalizing those companies that choose  to follow the law. Failing to act will mean that other countries will  think they can simply take advantage of American business and the  American worker, making us more reliant on foreign manufacturing and  supply chains, including for our clean energy needs.   Climate change is real. Addressing climate change is important, and  fair trade is important. We can't be shortsighted in our efforts and  rely on foreign companies and countries to meet our energy goals,  especially when they have been found to be in violation of U.S. trade  laws. It is a false choice. It is a false choice to suggest that we can  either choose to combat climate change or protect American  manufacturers and American workers. We can do both.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to override  this veto and to hold those companies, those bad actors, accountable.  This is not simple. It is difficult, but we do need to make sure----    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to finish my  point.   There will always be an argument to look the other way, to get  cheaper products by looking the other way when it comes to some of the  worst practices in manufacturing on this planet. Of course, it is going  to be cheaper to look the other way when workers are being exploited,  when intellectual property is being stolen, when child labor is being  utilized. It will always be cheaper, but it is wrong.   We can do both. We don't have to make the sacrifice of one principle  in the name of the other. We can't take the position that for only 24  months, we are going to look the other way, and then we are going to go  back to adhering to both of these principles.   We can do both. I encourage my colleagues to join me in doing so.
