 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for introducing this  important measure, of which I am a proud cosponsor.   This resolution is especially timely as we reckon with the legacy of  discrimination in our country. In that process, we must consider how  housing policy has contributed to systemic inequality.   For decades in this country, we allowed a Federal agency to  legitimize racial discrimination by creating those color-coded maps  indicating where investments would be profitable, ``greenlined,'' or  where it would not be, ``redlined.''   We built institutional obstacles for Black families trying to  purchase a home, and that resulted in devastating, intergenerational  financial disadvantages.   Redlining prevented access to the single most important wealth- building tool an American has access to, that is, owning a home. The  result? Black families have a median net worth of $17,000, compared to  $171,000 for White families. In fact, homeownership by Black families  is 44 percent, and by White families, 74 percent.   We have a responsibility to do everything we can to correct this.  After all, we created it.   Yet, in the middle of a pandemic that has made racial disparities all  the more pronounced, the OCC rushed out a final rule that undermined  the legislation that made redlining illegal, and they even did it  without the support of the Federal Reserve or FDIC.   The OCC's vague definitions and overly simplistic metrics do not do  justice to what a crucial role homeownership and housing policy have  played in racial inequality.   Their approach takes us backward. If you don't want to go backward,  vote ``yes'' on this measure. If you believe homeownership should be  available to all Americans, regardless of skin color, vote ``yes'' on  this matter. If you oppose redlining, vote ``yes'' on this measure. If  you want to stand for racial justice, vote ``yes'' on this measure.
