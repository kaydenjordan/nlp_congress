 Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss the impact of our  economy on our American workers and on our American manufacturers.   The headlines are real. We are in a technical manufacturing  recession, as measured by productivity and output.   As we know, and as it has been stated many times tonight, the Tax Cut  and Jobs Act of 2017 was a permanent tax giveaway for the wealthiest  corporations, not our suppliers, not our workers, but the wealthiest  among us, at the expense of everyday Americans.   We have the benefit of hindsight to point out what many experts at  the time cautioned; that this would ultimately not lead to significant  job gains or raise workers' wages.   $1.5 trillion added to our deficit. The levels are alarming. The  facts are out today.   Madam Speaker, it is clear. We must do better. We must continue to  work for the people.
