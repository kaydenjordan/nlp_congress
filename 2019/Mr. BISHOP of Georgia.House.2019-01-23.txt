 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, last fall we were very close to finishing this bill and  bringing it up for a vote; had we passed it then we would not be in the  mess we are in today. But we can't go back in time. We are now in the  33rd day of the shutdown. Vital services are eliminated or stretched to  the breaking point. The shutdown must end. It can end if we pass this  excellent bill.  [[Page H1153]]    I want to address my colleagues who objected to voting for the  Senate-passed bill a few weeks ago because they said it did not protect  House priorities. This bill does and was negotiated with all four  sides, House and Senate majorities and House and Senate minorities.  Each side had an equal voice.   Former Chairman Aderholt, Chairman Hoeven, Senator Merkley, and I,  along with our staffs--committee staffs and personal staffs--worked  together on the bill. I certainly would like to thank them for the very  respectful and collegial way we worked through the various issues of  agreement and disagreement to arrive at this bipartisan product.  Additionally, we look forward to working with Mr. Fortenberry, the new  ranking member of the subcommittee.   House priorities were protected whenever possible. Here are some  examples: the bill is at the House level of $550 million for rural  broadband expansion, above the Senate level. House language barring  Chinese poultry in school meals is included. House language setting  aside funding for persistent poverty counties is included. The House  position to continue funding construction of Federal agriculture  research buildings is maintained, where the Senate bill provided no  funding. The higher House level for healthy foods financing, and the  higher House level for rural housing assistance grants to help rural  elderly and low-income homeowners stay in their homes is included.   Most importantly, this bill is good for the country. It provides over  $23 billion in discretionary funding equal to the FY18 level. It  reflects the more than 1,000 requests for agricultural research funding  that we received from House Members, providing $3.4 billion, an  increase of $388 million above the fiscal year 2018 level.                                time  1430    The farm production and conservation mission area, which includes the  Farm Service Agency, is well funded at $2.75 billion.   I thank the Secretary, Secretary Perdue, and, most importantly, the  Farm Service Agency employees for coming back to work for 2 weeks, and  part-time thereafter, in order to process critical emergency loans,  assist with additional administration services, and help with tax  documents. But they need to be paid.   The bill also makes significant investments in rural development by  providing $41 billion in loans and grants, including the House level of  $550 million for rural broadband.   Domestic food programs are well funded. I am proud of the fact that  the bill includes $110 million, a 72 percent increase over the normal  funding level, to help our Nation's food banks handle the high volume  of commodities that will become available as a result of the USDA's  trade mitigation plan.   On the international side, the bill provides $1.7 billion for Food  for Peace and funds the McGovern-Dole program at $210 million.   Finally, it provides FDA with $3 billion in discretionary funding,  $269 million above fiscal year 2018. It includes more funding for House  priorities than the Senate bill we considered a couple of weeks ago and  includes important investments to fight the opioid epidemic that were  not in the House bill.   This good bill will end the shutdown at USDA and FDA. Funds for  economic development loans and grants for rural areas will begin to  flow again. It will ensure the continuation of the National School  Lunch Program, WIC, and SNAP without interruption.   It will allow some 8,400 USDA meat and poultry inspectors to be paid  for the work that they have been doing for free and will allow FDA to  conduct food safety inspections at the necessary level instead of the  bare minimum.   As I have said before, this bill touches the lives of every American.  I implore Members on both sides to support this bill. Reopen the  government. It is time that we restore the services Americans count on  and pay the people who provide them.
