 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. Senator Durbin's question is directed  to the House managers:         Would you please respond to the answer that was just given       by the President's counsel?    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, the  President sought Ukraine's help in investigating the Bidens only after  reports suggested Vice President Biden might enter the 2020  Presidential race and would seriously challenge President Trump in the  polls. President Trump had no interest in Biden's Obama-era Ukraine  work in 2017 or 2018 when Biden was not running against him for  President.   None of the 17 witnesses in the impeachment inquiry provided any  credible evidence--no credible evidence--to support the allegation that  former Vice President Biden acted inappropriately in any way in  Ukraine. Instead, witnesses testified that the former Vice President  was carrying out official U.S. policy in coordination with the  international community when he advocated for the ouster of a corrupt  Ukrainian official.   In short, the allegations are simply unfounded. President Trump's own  handpicked special envoy to Ukraine, Ambassador Kurt Volker, knew they  were unfounded too. He testified that he confronted the President's  attorney, Mr. Giuliani, about these conspiracy theories and told him  that ``it is simply not credible to me that Joe Biden would be  influenced in his duties as Vice President by money or things for his  son or anything like that. I've known him a long time. He's a person of  integrity, and that is not credible.''   Giuliani acknowledged that he did not find one of the sources of  these allegations, a former Ukrainian prosecutor, to be held credible.  So even Giuliani knew the allegations were false.   Our own Justice Department confirmed that the President never spoke  to the Attorney General about Ukraine or any investigation into Vice  President Biden. If President Trump genuinely believed that there was a  legitimate basis to request Ukraine's assistance in law enforcement  investigations, there are specific formal processes that he should have  followed. Specifically, he could have asked the DOJ to make an official  request for assistance through the mutual legal assistance treaty.    It is worth noting, the President only cares about Hunter Biden to  the extent that he is the Vice President's son and, therefore, a means  through which to smear a political opponent. But President Trump  specifically mentioned Vice President Biden in asking for the removal  of the former prosecutor on that July 25 call. That is what he wanted,  not an investigation into Hunter Biden. This is yet another reason you  know that there is no basis for investigating Vice President Biden.   Can we get slide 52 up?   The timing shows clearly that despite the fact that this conduct  occurred in 2015, it wasn't until Vice President Biden began  consistently beating Trump in national polls in the spring of 2019 by  significant margins that the President targeted Biden. He was scared of  losing. The President wanted to cast a cloud over a formidable  political opponent. This wasn't about any genuine concern of  wrongdoing. The evidence proves that. This was solely about the  President wanting to make sure that he could do whatever it took to  make sure that he could win. So he froze the critical money to Ukraine  to coerce Ukraine to help him attack his political opponent and secure  his reelection.   The President of the United States cannot use our taxpayer dollars to  pressure a foreign government to do his personal bidding. No one is  above the law.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from South Carolina.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator Durbin asks the House managers:         If President Trump were to actually invoke executive       privilege in this proceeding, wouldn't he be required to       identify the specific documents or communications containing       sensitive material that he seeks to protect?    Mr. Manager NADLER. As stated before, executive privilege is a very  limited privilege that must be claimed by the President. He has at no  time claimed executive privilege. Rather, he has claimed absolute  immunity, a nonexistent concept that every court that has ever  considered it has rejected. Instead, he has simply said: We will oppose  all subpoenas. We will deny to the House all information--all  information. Whatever they want, they can't have. This is way beyond  the pale, and it is intended to be because he fears the facts.   The facts are, he tried to extort a foreign government through  withholding military aid that this Congress had voted--he broke the law  to withhold the aid that this Congress had mandated be sent to them in  order to pressure them into announcing an investigation of his  political opponent. Those are the facts. Those facts are proven beyond  any doubt at all.   So what do we have? We have a diversion after diversion, diversions  about what Hunter Biden may have done in Ukraine--irrelevant, whatever  he did in Ukraine. The question is, Did the President withhold foreign  military aid in order to extort a foreign government into helping him  rig an American election?   We hear diversions about privilege. We hear questions about  witnesses. We know he is telling the Senators don't allow witnesses.  Why? Because he knows what the witnesses will say.   We hear arguments from his counsel: Well, we have taken enough time  with witnesses. The House shouldn't have voted if it didn't have proof  positive. We had proof positive. We voted it. It  [[Page S681]]  doesn't mean we shouldn't have more proof if it comes forward.   There is no argument that Mr. Bolton shouldn't be permitted to  testify. He is not going to waste our time. He has told us he will  testify with a subpoena.   So all of these questions are diversions. They are diversions by a  President who is desperate because we have proven the facts that he  threatened a foreign government--not just threatened them, did, in  fact, withhold mandated American military aid from them in order to  blackmail them into serving his political purposes, for private  political purposes. We know that. Everything else is a diversion.    No witnesses--because maybe those witnesses will testify in a way he  doesn't want.   Privilege--when you are dealing with accusations of wrongdoing  against the President, the Supreme Court told us in the Nixon case,  privilege yields.   So all of these arguments are diversions. Keep your eye on the facts.  The facts we have proven. And let's see if the additional witnesses-- and as Mr. Schiff said, witnesses should not be a threat, not to the  Senate, not to anybody else. And it is not going to waste too much time  because the Chief Justice can rule on relevant questions--questions of  relevancy or privilege or anything else.   But the facts are the facts. The President is a danger to the United  States. He has tried to rig the next election. He has abused his power  and he must be brought to heel and the country must be saved from his  continuing efforts to rig our elections.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Utah.
