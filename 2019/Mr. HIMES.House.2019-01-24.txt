 Mr. Speaker, on January 24, 2019, I was unable to be  present for the vote on the motion to recommit on H.J. Res. 31, offered  by Rep. Granger of Texas. Had I been present for roll call No. 50, I  would have voted ``nay.''   I was also unable to be present for the vote on passage of H.J. Res.  31, offered by Rep. Lowey of New York. Had I been present for roll call  No. 51, I would have voted ``aye.''                            ____________________
