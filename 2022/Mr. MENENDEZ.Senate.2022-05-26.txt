 Mr. President, I am rising to ask unanimous consent to  consider the nomination of Leopoldo Martinez. This body should confirm  him today to serve as Executive Director of the Inter-American  Development Bank.   From the world's highest per capita COVID infection and death rates  to the largest economic contraction anywhere in the world, Latin  America and the Caribbean are still struggling to recover from  devastating waves of the pandemic.   The region also faces historic refugee and migration movements that  stretch across the continent. And added to this, many of these nations  must confront longstanding poverty and inequality as well as climate  change and threats to the environment.   Given the significant economic social and development challenges in  Latin America and the Caribbean, we urgently need Senate-confirmed  leadership at our hemisphere's most important multilateral development  bank. The Inter-American Development Bank is essential to addressing  these issues.   It is critical that we have strong U.S. leadership at the Bank. Mr.  Martinez brings decades of experience in the public and private sector,  as well as academia, and he will provide exactly that.   He has advised Fortune 500 companies and private equity funds. He has  helped international business and nongovernmental organizations, and he  has committed to work with the Senate to support a much needed capital  increase for the Bank, which we approved as part of the U.S. Innovation  and Competition Act last year.   This nomination has been pending for 9 months--9 months. It is time  for the Senate to act, especially when we have China--and I know my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent a lot of time  talking about China and whether we were strong enough in meeting the  China threat. Well, China is all over the Western Hemisphere making  huge investments.   I talked to one foreign leader this past week from the hemisphere. He  said to me: Listen, what is the United States offering? Because I am  being offered $800 million, 1 percent, over 30 years. I am not taking  it, but at some point, we need to have engagement in the hemisphere  economically.   That is what the Inter-American Development Bank can do without  costing U.S. taxpayers money. But for that, you need leadership that is  focused on getting the IDB to build the partnerships and the programs  that can help us have a presence to counter China in the first place  and also to promote prosperity, security, and stability.   And for all of those of my colleagues who are concerned about the  southern border, well, let's get an organization that can help create  greater prosperity and stability in the hemisphere so people won't be  fleeing from the circumstances.   I don't understand why this has taken 9 months, but that is what  draws me to come to the floor. So I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee be discharged and the Senate proceed  to the following nomination: PN1028, Leopoldo Martinez Nucete, to be  United States Executive Director of the Inter-American Development Bank  for a term of three years, vice Eliot Pedrosa; that the Senate vote on  the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that no further  motions be made in order to the nomination; and that any related  statements be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I am going to be honest here. This isn't  really about Mr. Martinez, his experience, his views. It is just  another thinly veiled attempt to block another of the President's  nominees and to do so at a time in which China is eating our lunch.   So the next time one of my colleagues gets up and talks about China,  I am going to remind them of the position that they have taken to block  one of the critical nominees who could help us meet that challenge in  the Western Hemisphere.   Mr. President, let me turn to another nominee who has been pending  before the Senate, who did pass the committee, by the way, favorably-- not on a tie vote but favorably. I am going to, in a moment, ask  unanimous consent to confirm Dr. Monde Muyangwa to serve as Assistant  Administrator for USAID's Africa Bureau. This body should confirm her  without delay.   The promotion of democracy, a key goal for USAID, is threatened  throughout Africa. In just the past 2 years, there have been coups in  Sudan, Chad, Guinea, Burkina Faso, and two in Mali.   Authoritarians across Africa have new tactics to subvert democratic  movements. They have modern tools to silence dissenting voices. They  deploy disinformation campaigns and sophisticated surveillance  technology coming from China to stay in power. And from Mali to the  Central African Republic, dictators are turning to Russian mercenaries  for support.   Democracy advocates, human rights offenders, and civil society  leaders across the continent are courageously working to realize their  aspirations and goals. They need a reliable partner at USAID to keep  the struggle for democracy in their countries, and that is why we have  to advance this nominee today.    Dr. Muyangwa is eminently qualified to lead USAID's Africa Bureau.  She brings extensive professional and academic experience in Africa.  She is a Zambian-born immigrant to the United States, where she has  held senior positions at the Wilson Center, the Africa Center for  Strategic Studies, and the National Summit on Africa. She was a Rhodes  Scholar, a Wingate Scholar for her scholarship at Oxford, the  valedictorian for her graduating class at the University of Zambia, and  she holds a doctorate in international relations from the University of  Oxford. Do you think she is well qualified? In short, her  qualifications are exceptional.   Finally, let me say that while Africa faces many challenges, it is  also a land of tremendous opportunity. But here, again, China is all  over Africa in precious minerals and other precious materials, in  subverting nascent democracies by their debt-trap diplomacy. And where  are we? Absent, because we don't even have somebody who can focus on  the hemisphere--a hemisphere that we should have gotten a lot more  votes at the United Nations when we were pursuing the sanctions against  Russia. But guess what. We don't have anybody talking to these  countries. So I see no reason, with somebody with  [[Page S2723]]  such a stellar background, to ultimately be objected to.   So I will I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the  following nomination: Calendar No. 815, Monde Muyangwa, to be an  Assistant Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International  Development; that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening  action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table; and that any statements related to the nomination  be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, through the Chair, would my colleague  say that--have you not been provided three rounds of documents that  have been requested?    Through the Presiding Officer, has my colleague not  been offered a briefing by USAID to try to answer the rest of his  questions?   This is an extraordinary amount of information being offered for  someone who is not even a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.  But, nonetheless, in order to accommodate him, we want to get to a  point that he feels comfortable to do so. Have you not been offered a  briefing, which you have not yet accepted?    Well, my understanding is that there has been, Mr.  President, an offer of a briefing made to the Senator.   And, by the way, this has nothing to do with Dr. Muyangwa. She has  nothing to do with any of this. She is nominated to be the Assistant  Administrator for Africa, nothing to do with China, nothing to do with  Wuhan, nothing to do with anything else.   I would urge my colleague, if you have all this information about  illicit activities, please bring it forward. The committee would like  to consider it. But I haven't seen any of it. It is time to put up or  shut up.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise in support of Marcia Bernicat to  be the Director General of the foreign service at the U.S. Department  of State. Our foreign service must have a leader that knows how to  tackle the challenges of the 21st century. We need someone that  understands the importance of modernizing the State Department  workforce. We need someone who will prioritize diversity, equity,  inclusion, and accessibility to reflect our Nation's wide range of  backgrounds. Ambassador Bernicat is that person. She is an experienced  career member of the Senior Foreign Service who has a deep  understanding of the inner-workings of the Department and valuable  overseas experience. She has served as Ambassador to Senegal and Guinea  Bissau and as Ambassador to Bangladesh. Both times before, this body  confirmed her by voice vote.   While serving as Ambassador to Bangladesh, she survived a terrorist  attack on her motorcade, an experience that strengthened her resolve to  keep Foreign Service Officers safe while serving abroad. She has also  worked as the Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Human  Resources. She speaks French, Hindi, and Russian and is a recipient of  the Secretary of State's Distinguished Service Award. She has a  master's degree in the science in foreign service at Georgetown  University and a bachelor's degree from Lafayette College. As a former  Deputy Assistant Secretary working on human resources, she understands  the personnel challenges facing the Department. Last but not least,  Ambassador Bernicat was born in the great State of New Jersey.   In short, Ambassador Bernicat is without a doubt the right person for  this position. It is unacceptable that someone as qualified as her has  been languishing on the Senate floor for more than 7 months. Her  nomination comes at a critical time as the Department needs leadership  that will address key issues like attrition, training, morale, and  mental health. We need our best people in position to ensure we are  recruiting, retaining, promoting, and training the next generation of  leaders. It is long past time to confirm Ambassador Bernicat.   I enthusiastically support Ambassador Bernicat, and I respectfully  urge my colleagues to join me in confirming her immediately.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

The total estimated program cost is $385 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist our ally in developing and maintaining a       strong and ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale will improve Australia's capability to       meet current and future threats, and will enhance       interoperability with U.S. forces and other allied forces.       Australia will use the capability to strengthen its homeland       defense and provide greater security for its critical       infrastructure. Australia will have no difficulty absorbing       this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Lockheed Martin Inc.,       Bethesda, MD; Chelton Inc., Marlow, United Kingdom; and L3       Harris Corp., Melbourne, FL. The purchaser typically requests       offsets. Any offset agreement will be defined in negotiations       between the purchaser and the contractor(s).        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of two (2) U.S. Government and five (5) U.S.       contractor representatives in Australia for a period of one       year.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-28    Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section                  36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)       is a C-130 transportable wheeled launcher mounted on a 5-ton       Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles truck chassis. HIMARS is       the modern Army-fielded version of the Multiple Launch Rocket       System (MLRS) M270 launcher, and can fire all of the MLRS       Family of Munitions (FOM) including Guided Multiple Launch       Rocket System (GMLRS) variants and the Army Tactical Missile       System (ATACMS). Utilizing the MLRS FOM, the HIMARS can       engage targets between 15 and 300 kilometers with Global       Positioning System (GPS)-aided precision accuracy.        2. The M31A2 GMLRS Unitary is the Army's primary munition       for units fielding the M142 HIMARS and M270Al MLRS Launchers.       The M31 Unitary is a solid propellant artillery rocket that       uses GPS/Precise Positioning Service (PPS)-aided inertial       guidance to accurately and quickly deliver a single high-      explosive blast fragmentation warhead to targets at ranges       from 15-70 kilometers. The rockets are fired from a launch       pod container that also serves as the storage and       transportation container for the rockets. Each rocket pod       holds six (6) total rockets.        3. The M30A2 GMLRS Alternative Warhead shares a greater       than 90% commonality with the M31A1 Unitary. The primary       difference between the GMLRS-U and GMLRS-AW is the       replacement of the Unitary's high explosive warhead with a       200-pound fragmentation warhead of pre-formed tungsten       penetrators which is optimized for effectiveness against       large area and imprecisely located targets. The munitions       otherwise share a common motor, GPS/PPS-aided inertial       guidance and control system, fusing mechanism, multi-option       height of burst capability, and effective range of 15-70km.        4. The M57 ATACMS-Unitary is a conventional, semi-ballistic       missile that utilizes a 500-pound high explosive warhead. It       has an effective range of between 70 and 300 kilometers, and       has increased lethality and accuracy over previous versions       of the ATACMS due to a GPS/ PPS aided navigation system.        5. The Extended Range (ER) GMLRS provides a persistent,       responsive, all-weather, rapidly deployed, long range,       surface-to surface, area- and point-precision strike       capability. The XM403 Alternative Warhead (AW) carries a 200-      pound fragmentation assembly filled with high explosives       which, upon detonation, accelerates two layers of preformed       penetrators optimized for effectiveness against large area       and imprecisely located targets. The XM404 Unitary variant is       a 200-pound class unitary with a steel blast-fragmentation       case, designed for low collateral damage against point       targets. The ER GMLRS maintains the accuracy and       effectiveness demonstrated by the baseline GMLRS out to a       maximum range of 150 km while also including a new Height of       Burst (HOB) capability.        6. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        7. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        8. A determination has been made that Australia can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        9. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Australia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

Transmittal No. 21-0M       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(B)(5)(C), AECA)        (i) Purchaser: Government of Egypt        (ii) Sec. 36(b)(l). AECA Transmittal No.: 20-81        Date: February 16, 2021        Military Department: Navy        Funding Source: Foreign Military Financing (FMF)        (iii) Description: On February 16, 2021, Congress was       notified by Congressional certification transmittal number       20-81 of the possible sale, under Section 36(b)(l) of the       Arms Export Control Act, of up to one hundred sixty-eight       (168) RIM-116C Rolling Airframe Missiles (RAM) Block 2       tactical missiles. Also included were RAM Guided Missile       Round Pack Tri-Pack shipping and storage containers; operator       manuals and technical documentation; U.S. Government and       contractor engineering, technical and logistics support       services; and other related elements of logistical and       program support. The estimated total program cost was $197       million. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $182       million of this total.        This transmittal notifies the addition of four (4) MK 49       MOD 5 RAM Guided Missile Launching Systems (GMLS) (MDE). The       following non-MOE items will also be included: support       equipment; sparing; U.S. Government and contractor technical       assistance; and U.S. Government non-technical support. The       overall MDE value will increase to $282 million and the       overall total value will increase to $347 million.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided to       report the inclusion of MDE items not previously notified.       The inclusion of this MDE represents an increase in       capability over what was previously notified. The Egyptian       Navy will replace the RAM MK 49 MOD 3 launchers on its Ex-      Oliver Hazard Perry (OHP) Frigates with these Mod 5       launchers. This potential sale will improve Egypt's       capability to meet current and future threats and provide       significantly enhanced area defense capabilities over Egypt's       coastal areas and approaches to the Suez Canal.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States by helping to improve the security of a Major Non-NATO       Ally that continues to be an important strategic partner in       the Middle East.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The RAM MK 49 GMLS is the       launcher for the RAM Guided Missile Weapon System (GMWS) that       was approved under the original 36(b)(l) notification,       Transmittal No. 20-81. The RAM GMWS is a high fire power,       dual mode, fire and forget weapon system, which provides ship       self defense against anti-ship missiles. The RAM MK 49 GMLS       is comprised of a 21-round launcher guide, which is capable       of firing tactical or telemetry RAM missiles.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       UNCLASSIFIED.

Pastor McKinney has served as pastor of Calvary  Baptist Church of North Jersey since 1972.   Pastor McKinney's ministry is guided by Teaching and Growing a  Praying People of God, whether at home in New Jersey, across our  Nation, or around the world. His ministry has taken him throughout  Africa, Europe, Asia, Central America, and the Caribbean Islands. Of  his many accomplishments, Pastor McKinney's most memorable preaching  opportunity was during the centennial session of the National Baptist  Convention, U.S.A., Inc., in Birmingham, AL, in 1980.   In September 2009, Pastor McKinney was elected general secretary of  the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., Inc. He served as the youngest  moderator in the history of the North Jersey District Missionary  Baptist Association from 1986 to 1990, and served from 1996 through  2000 in an unprecedented tenure as one of the youngest presidents in  the history of the 300,000-member General Baptist Convention of New  Jersey, Inc. He was named president emeritus in recognition of his  exemplary leadership.   In 2003, under the visionary leadership of Pastor McKinney, Calvary  started on a journey to build a $10 million, 1,500-seat sanctuary along  with  [[Page S2750]]  educational, fellowship, and administrative facilities. On March 19,  2006, the congregation of Calvary moved into their new home.   Pastor McKinney's extraordinary pastoral leadership is matched by his  extraordinary role as a community leader. For 50 years, he has touched  the lives of countless people and communities. In addition to lifting  and guiding their spiritual formation, he has met the needs of his  local community through the Calvary Community Development Center, CCDC.  Since 1998, CCDC has empowered people and the community in order to  knock down economic and social barriers. It is a resource for those who  are need of food, clothing, and emergency assistance.   Pastor McKinney finds time to serve in a multitude of ways. He  presently serves as chair of the Commission on Faith-Based Initiatives  for the State of New Jersey. He serves as chairman of the Board of  Trustees of the U.C.C. Day Care Center No. 100; trustee, Passaic County  Community College; a board member of the Bergen County Urban League,  NJ; an executive board member of the Garfield/Lodi Branch of the NAACP,  NJ; and a member of Mt. Zion Lodge No. 50, F. & A.M. (PHA) of  Hackensack, NJ.   Pastor McKinney is the embodiment of a spirit-filled and joyful life.  His greatest joy comes from his beautiful family. He and his wife  Brendalyn are the proud parents of three children: Terence Lamar, Gina  Lynelle, and Calvin James; and the proud grandparents of Terence  Laquan, Timothy Lamar, and Mason James.   In the Book of Matthew 5:16 we are taught, ``In the same way, let  your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and  glorify your Father in heaven.'' For 50 years, Pastor McKinney has been  more than just a shining light; he is truly a beacon of faith, hope,  and love. His ministry blesses us all.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Joshua  Kretman, a detailee from the State Department to the Foreign Relations  Committee, be granted floor privileges for the duration of the 117th  Congress.
