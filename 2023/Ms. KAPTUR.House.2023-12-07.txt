 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the Federal Railroad  Administration's selection of the Cleveland-Sandusky-Toledo-Detroit  corridor for a critical passenger rail grant. What a congested corridor  it is.   This Federal funding is but the first step toward expanding passenger  rail in northern Ohio, which has long suffered from underinvestment in  rail infrastructure.   To this day, our region continues to lag daytime passenger service  due to congested rail service on the same tracks.   Improving the connection to Detroit will also bolster our region's  already strong ties with our Michigan and Canadian neighbors on the  other side of the Great Lake we share, Lake Erie.   Still, there is so much more to be done. We must find ways to advance  passenger rail improvements in the Cleveland-Toledo to Chicago  corridor, which despite the tireless efforts of Grace Gallucci and  others at the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency, was not  awarded Federal planning funds.   For our neglected region to be excellent at this planning opportunity  for efficient passenger rail in view of freight congestion, Federal  funding is needed to establish a transportation planning center of  expertise in northwest Ohio.   Let's not have any more East Palestine or Sandusky accidents. We need  real rail planning in our region.                            ____________________
