 Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand up for  the 15,000-plus New Yorkers and thousands of Americans who have lost  their lives due to the coronavirus and to stand up for the tens of  thousands of healthcare and essential community workers whose lives are  on the line as I stand here.   Today, we are voting on a $480 billion interim relief package that  includes $370 billion for small business loans and grants, $60 billion  of which will go to mom-and-pop, underbanked, and cash-and-carry, $75  billion for hospitals and healthcare facilities and $25 billion for a  national testing strategy.
