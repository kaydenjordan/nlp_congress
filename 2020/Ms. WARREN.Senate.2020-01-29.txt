 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for  House managers and counsel to the President.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The House managers will respond first  to this question from Senator Warren.         If Ukrainian President Zelensky called President Trump and       offered dirt on President Trump's political rivals in       exchange for President Trump handing over hundreds of       millions in military aid, that would clearly be bribery and       an impeachable offense. So why would it be more acceptable--      and somehow not impeachable--for the reverse, that is, for       President Trump to propose the same corrupt bargain?    Mr. Manager NADLER. Bribery is obviously an impeachable offense.  Bribery is contained within the accusation at the House level of abuse  of power.   We explained in the Judiciary Committee report that the practice of  impeachment in the United States has tended to envelope charges of  bribery within the broader standard of other high crimes and  misdemeanors. That is the historical standard.   The elements of bribery are clearly established here. The abuse of  power is clearly established. When the President of the United States  offers something--extorts a foreign power to get a benefit for himself,  withholds military aid in order to get that foreign power to do  something that would help him politically--that is clearly bribery, it  is clearly an abuse of power, and there is no question about it.   Now, by the way, the question was raised earlier as to what the  proper standard of proof is. People pointed out the Constitution  doesn't say. But the highest standard of proof is beyond a reasonable  doubt, and these facts have been proven not beyond a reasonable doubt,  beyond any doubt.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question.   I think what this hypothetical shows, what Manager Nadler shows, is  this is an effort to try to smuggle into Articles of Impeachment that  do not mention any crime the idea that there is some crime alleged  here. There is not, and I went through that earlier.   The Articles of Impeachment specify a theory of the charge here that  is abuse of power. They do not allege the elements of bribery or  extortion. They don't mention bribery or extortion.   If the House managers had wanted to bring those charges, they had to  put them in the Articles of Impeachment, just the way a prosecutor, if  he wants to put someone on trial for bribery, he has got to put it in  the indictment.   If you don't, and you come to trial and then try to start arguing  that, ``well, actually, we think there is bribery going on here,'' that  is impermissible. It is prosecutorial misconduct.   And so a hypothetical that is contrary to what the facts were here,  to try to suggest that maybe there is some element of bribery, that is  all beside the point. We have specific facts. We have evidence that has  been presented in the record. We have a specific Article of  Impeachment. It doesn't say bribery. It doesn't say extortion. And  there is no way to get that into this case at this point because the  House managers had the opportunity to frame their case. They had every  opportunity to frame it any way they wanted because they controlled the  whole process. They controlled all the evidence that went in. They  controlled all the evidence with the witnesses that were called, and  they could frame it any way they wanted, and they didn't put in any  crime. There is no crime asserted here. It is not part of the Articles  of Impeachment, and it can't be considered now.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Kansas.
