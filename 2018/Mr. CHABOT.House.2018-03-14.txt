 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Majority Leader  McCarthy, and Congressman Rutherford for their leadership on this  important legislation.   Over the years, our Nation's schools have become soft targets for any  would-be killer who has gotten access to a gun. We need to do a better  job of protecting both students and faculty from these increasingly  frequent threats.   This legislation combines school safety provisions included in two  bills, one originally introduced by Mr. Rutherford, and the other by  me. Together this proposal represents a collection of commonsense  solutions to better help protect our students, our teachers, and other  faculty in our schools.   H.R. 4909 reauthorizes the COPS Secure Our Schools grant program and  more than doubles its annual budget from $30 million to $75 million  annually. Of that $75 million, not less than $50 million per year will  be made available for evidence-based strategies and programs to prevent  violence in public or private schools over the next decade.   Among the security measures for which these grants may be used  include additional training to ensure the health and well-being of  students, the development of more robust threat reporting systems, and  investments in more advanced security technologies.   Additionally, the COPS Secure Our Schools grants can be used in  conjunction with the COPS Hiring Program to ensure that our schools  have both the security measures and personnel in place to prevent  future violence. On Monday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions  announced that the Department of Justice will use the COPS Hiring  Program to increase the number of school resource officers nationwide.  The legislation we are considering  [[Page H1562]]  today could help that effort by allowing schools to hire retired police  officers to provide security if the Department of Justice determines  that such plans would provide a significant improvement in school  security.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Dan Hils, president of the  Cincinnati FOP, for actively engaging on the issue of school safety and  for bringing these types of forward-thinking solutions to my attention.  He has been a tremendous resource throughout this process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleague to support this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for  yielding.   First of all, I am glad that the gentlewoman isn't talking about Wall  Street this evening. The gentlewoman always wants to talk about Wall  Street, and I am glad we are talking about Marcy Kaptur this evening  because she is really special.                                time  1930    This, of course, is in recognition of a fellow Ohioan, Marcy Kaptur,  who will become the longest serving woman in the history of the United  States House of Representatives. That is quite an accomplishment. She  will be breaking the record currently held by Congresswoman Edith  Nourse Rogers, a Republican from Massachusetts, who served from 1925 to  1960.   I think I speak for most Ohioans, regardless of party, when I say we  are proud that Marcy has brought this prestigious milestone back home  to Ohio.   Marcy has been a stalwart supporter of her constituents, fighting for  jobs and fair trade agreements. That is why her constituents continue  to elect her to represent them in this body every 2 years, even though  we have been trying every 2 years to knock her off. We just haven't  been able to do it, she is that good.   Like me, Marcy grew up in a working class family. She was the first  member of her family to attend college, earning degrees from the  University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan. Graduating from  these two universities, one of which is not even recognized in some  parts of Ohio, had to be a tremendous hurdle to overcome when first  running to represent Ohioans. Yet Marcy continues to earn the trust of  her constituents, and that says a lot about who Marcy Kaptur is as a  person.  [[Page H1597]]    As the son of a World War II veteran myself, I would submit that  perhaps Marcy's most enduring accomplishment was her 17-year battle to  get a World War II Memorial built on The National Mall.   I just wish that it had been completed in time for my father to have  seen that. I know he would have been really excited about it.  Unfortunately, he passed away in 1998, before that wonderful memorial  was completed, but I know he is looking down and sees it. I really  appreciate all the other World War II veterans that do get to see it.   Through a number of setbacks, Marcy Kaptur never wavered in her  support for that memorial. Every time I meet with a group of World War  II veterans who have flown in on an honor flight--which was another  Ohio creation, I might add--to visit the memorial, I am reminded of  Marcy's dedication and determination to make that happen. We truly owe  her a great deal of credit for the beautiful tribute to the Greatest  Generation that the World War II Memorial has become. As dean of the  Ohio Republican delegation, I would like to express how proud the  Members in this Chamber are for this historic accomplishment.   Even though we do not agree on everything--or, I guess, even very  much sometimes--and have been known to have a few disagreements here  and there, I am proud that she is not only breaking the record for the  longest serving woman in this body, but she is doing so as a  Representative of our great State, the great State of Ohio.   We are really proud of Marcy. We are happy that she has accomplished  this. We hope she will be around here for many years to come. I hope I  am here, as well, to continue to serve with her. Obviously, all of our  constituents get to make that decision every 2 years.   Congratulations, Marcy. I speak on behalf of all my colleagues within  the Ohio delegation as well as on behalf of an awful lot of other  Republicans in the House who respect you greatly.   Congratulations.
