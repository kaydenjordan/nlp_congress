 Mr. Chair, I want to first thank my  colleague from California for her work to undo the damage the President  has done to transgender servicemembers and our Armed Forces.   This ban endangers transgender soldiers and tells all transgender  Americans that they are not fit to serve their country. The Harry  Truman amendment will reverse the President's harmful ban and protect  transgender soldiers from further discrimination.   Though the administration cited concerns over readiness, unit  cohesion, and medical costs to justify its ban, it has been unable to  back up its claims.   Mr. Chair, transgender troops have served openly at home, overseas,  and in combat zones since 2016 without incident, a finding supported by  the Chief of Staff of every service branch.   The Truman amendment extends Federal protections to transgender  soldiers and makes it unlawful to exclude anyone from service based on  their gender identity.   Transgender servicemembers, as my colleague noted, testified in the  House that serving openly dramatically improved their quality of life  and their service to our country.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise today to support the  amendment offered by my colleague from California (Ms. Speier). It  provides our servicemembers with medically accurate educational  resources to help prevent unintended pregnancies and the spread of  sexually transmitted infections.   The courageous Americans who put their lives on the line for our  country deserve the best wellness education we can offer, and keeping  them healthy helps maximize our military's readiness.   This commonsense amendment is recommended by the Pentagon's  nonpartisan Defense Department Advisory Committee on Women in the  Services, and, therefore, there should be broad bipartisan support. I  encourage my colleagues who support our troops to vote for it.
