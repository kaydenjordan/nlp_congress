 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about service by  recognizing individuals and organizations who have stepped up when  their fellow citizens needed them most. Through their actions, they  have shown what it means to put others before self.                           Dr. Saturnino Rodriguez     Mr. Speaker, I begin by rising today to honor Dr.  Saturnino Rodriguez, a good friend and devoted servant of the Latino  community in Lansing.   Over the years, Dr. Rodriguez, or Nino as he is known around town,  has had many titles. In each role, he has left a profound impact on the  students, faculty, parents, and community residents that call greater  Lansing home.   Dr. Rodriguez has spent his entire professional life working in  schools--first in Peru, then in Grand Rapids, and then Lansing, where  he has worked tirelessly for the past 50 years to improve the lives of  children through education. His career has taken him from being a  counselor at C.W. Otto Junior High, an assistant principal at Gardner  Junior High and Eastern High School, principal at Pattengill Middle  School, and finally as deputy superintendent of the entire school  district.   He was an innovator in the classroom, developing a clustered teaching  approach that is still being used today. In addition, he led the  adoption of guidelines proposed by the Youth Violence Prevention  Coalition, which brought about significant positive changes in student  and community relations.   Since 2009, he has been an elected member of the Lansing District  Board of Education, a role that he carries out with joy because it  allows him to continue his service to Lansing students.   Dr. Rodriguez' passions extend beyond education. He is an officer  with the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Ingham County  Health Department's Board of Health. But to really know Dr. Rodriguez,  you only need to read his monthly magazine Adelante Forward.   Published in both English and Spanish, Adelante Forward has been an  instrumental source of information for the Lansing community,  advertising new businesses and spreading word about resources from Head  Start classes to COVID vaccine clinics. It has been a key way to reach  Latino and Hispanic residents, bridging the language gap in order to  improve community relations. And, as I am sure Dr. Rodriguez is proud  to know, it is even being used by some Spanish language teachers as  part of their lesson plans.   The publication wouldn't be possible without the special partners  that work to put it together: Danny Layne, Allena Tapia, Patricia  Briones, and Dr. George Mansour. In addition, no tribute to Dr.  Rodriguez would be complete without mention of his wife of 30 years,  Margarita, as well as their two daughters and two grandchildren.   It is my privilege to represent Dr. Rodriguez in Washington. I am  grateful for his willingness to always speak to me about Lansing's  needs. Every time we are able to connect, it is a pleasure to hear  about the good work being done to improve the lives of others. I am  appreciative of his commitment to serving others, and it is my honor to  recognize him today in the permanent Record of the people's House.                                time  1315                            Honoring Lisa Brinker     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Lisa Brinker, a  resident of Lake Orion, who has been there for her community when it  needed her most.   Ms. Brinker has faced adversity in her life. Three years ago, her  husband passed away from brain cancer. Out of that pain, she found  purpose. Over the course of the last year, she has devoted her time to  the New Day Foundation for Families, a local nonprofit that supports  those fighting cancer and their loved ones.   The financial cost of a cancer diagnosis goes beyond just medical  care, as I know well. Beyond the loss of income, the increase in  expenses, and emotional distress, it is a diagnosis that can consume us  entirely. And that is where the New Day Foundation for Families comes  in. With an army of local volunteers like Ms. Brinker, they provide  resources to give cancer patients hope through financial assistance and  emotional support.   When her husband was in the hospital, Ms. Brinker was surrounded by  family, friends, and churchgoers who helped lighten the load. For her,  she wouldn't have known what to do without that help. And it is why she  works so hard to make someone else's load a little lighter. During the  pandemic, when family members of immunocompromised patients saw a trip  to the grocery store as a fraught experience, Ms. Brinker was there to  provide for their essential needs.   Since the program began last spring, volunteers like Lisa made more  than 300 deliveries helping 125 families in total. They were a godsend  during COVID, and not just for their food deliveries. By demonstrating  that service doesn't stop, not even during a once-in-a-generation  pandemic, Ms. Brinker was a source of inspiration and strength. With an  infectious attitude that brightens the days of all she serves, we are  lucky to have her in our community.   Ms. Brinker has persevered through adversity and loss, and it has  magnified her service. With the powerful perspective that comes with  experience, she has used it to better her Lake Orion community. As a  humble spirit, she prefers that any recognition focus on making a  difference. An article in the local paper ended with her asking readers  to get themselves involved. And true to form, for this recognition, she  indicated that credit should go to the good people of the New Day  Foundation for Families.   It is a rare soul who can reduce pain and hardship in others,  especially when they themselves have been in that position. For her  work to honor the loving memory of her husband and her tireless service  to community, it is my privilege to recognize Lisa Brinker on the House  floor today.                             Honoring Lisa Kocab     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize another Lisa, the  ultimate champion and advocate for the disability community in  Brighton, Michigan, Ms. Lisa Kocab.   Put simply, Lisa is a powerhouse. As a teacher and a mother of five,  including an incredible 10-year-old boy, PJ, who has Down syndrome, she  has built and created an incredible circle of support since moving back  to Michigan in 2016.  [[Page H2922]]    At first, when she was scouting schools for PJ, she had to push  through being told ``no.'' The family wanted to move back to be nearer  to the kids' grandparents, but the first school district that they  called referred to students with special needs as ``those kids.'' Other  schools gave similar responses when asked if PJ could be placed in  general education.   That is, until she called Brighton's special education director, who  told Lisa that PJ could absolutely go to school with the other  students; that if they moved to Brighton, she would work with them. So  that is what Lisa and her husband did.   Now, Lisa will be the first to tell you that it wasn't always smooth  sailing. She has had to overcome plenty of challenges from PJ's  struggles with development to the hurt of hearing intolerant words and  from other families.   Lisa has been tested in too many ways to count, but she has turned  her pain into purpose by deciding to open Gigi's Playhouse in  Southfield, Michigan. With more than 45 locations nationwide, Gigi's  Playhouses are now ``achievement centers'' for individuals with Down  syndrome. They are spaces that are specifically designed for kids to  interact and play with each other while offering free programs to learn  how to read, improve their health, develop career skills, and reach  their greatest potential.   Lisa was the driving force behind fundraising, searching for a  location, and pulling resources together. Now, with her dream a  reality, she strives every day to realize the vision of Gigi's  Playhouses, to see a world where individuals with Down syndrome are  accepted and embraced in their families, schools, and communities.   In its first year of operation, Gigi's served 383 people with Down  syndrome, more than half of whom were adults. Since then, they have  expanded their offerings and, in order to help more residents, even  adapting during the pandemic by switching to virtual programs.   Mr. Speaker, I am a firm believer in finding your people, those who  will have your back and stay by your side through ups and downs,  failures and successes. Without a doubt, Lisa Kocab has found her  people in Brighton and at Gigi's Playhouse; and the disability  community in Michigan has found its person in Lisa.   She is an inspiration to us all, and I am so proud to represent her  here in the Halls of Congress. It is my honor to speak these words into  the Congressional Record so that her story can inspire all who read it.                         Recognizing the Wong Family     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a staple of the  community, the Wong family of Wong Express House in Brighton.   Before moving to Michigan, Xueqi Wong worked as a fisherman and a  security officer for his town while raising his family with his wife,  Mei, in Fujian province, China.   They immigrated to the U.S. in 1991, moving to Brighton 10 years  later, where they have built a successful business with a loyal  following for the last two decades. Mr. Wong, known as Ed around town,  is known for his work ethic and attention to detail. His employees rave  about the culture he brings to the team. ``Extremely flexible and  supportive,'' ``Very welcoming and inspiring,'' ``I feel honored to  work with such excellent people'' is some of what they have said.    Mr. Wong's character truly came through in his devotion to keeping  his customers and employees safe during COVID-19. At a time when  restaurants and dining establishments were particularly hard hit by the  public health restrictions, Mr. Wong put a plan in place to allow Wong  Express House to stay afloat.   After closing for 9 weeks, they reopened on May 29, 2020, as a model  for safe service. With a separate enclosed area inside the restaurant,  the dining area was transformed into a contactless pickup window for  customer convenience. Instead of dine-in, the restaurant trained staff  to fully transition into drive-thru and carry-out only.   The changes were not easy, but the space was turned into a safe,  simple, and effective process that limited customer-to-staff  interaction, keeping everyone safe from infection. That ability to  adapt, to work through the challenges in order to keep customers  satisfied, is why I am proud to recognize Mr. Wong; his wife, Mei;  their son, Jian on the floor of the House today.   Their pride in their restaurant is evident as soon as you walk in the  door, and their resilience can be found in their dedication to each  other and our community. During the shutdown, when Jian had to travel  back to Brooklyn to support his wife and two kids, Mr. and Mrs. Wong  stayed in Brighton holding down the fort to make sure that their staff  would be taken care of.   It is no surprise that on their first day back in business they were  so overwhelmed with support to the point that they completely sold out  of food. Now, as they chart a course for the weeks and months ahead, I  know that the Wong family will continue to demonstrate the toughness  and grit that Michiganians are known for during uncertain times.   On behalf of a grateful community, it is my honor to recognize the  leadership and staff at Wong Express House by inserting their story of  resilience into the permanent Record so that it may last for years to  come.                      Recognizing Peckham, Incorporated     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an organization  in my district that goes above and beyond by providing job training  opportunities for folks with significant disabilities and other  barriers to employment.   A nonprofit based in Lansing, Peckham, Incorporated, provides a  platform for people to demonstrate their unique abilities by learning  new skills and enjoying the rewards of an honest day's works. From  career planning to vocational training, to employer services, Peckham  offers more than 30 different programs that create opportunities for  every single individual they work with.   Named after the former rehabilitation services director of the State  of Michigan, Ralf Peckham, they began serving the greater Lansing  region in 1976. Today, they have grown into one of the largest  community rehabilitation programs in the entire State.   With core values of compassion, community, and collaboration as a  foundation, Peckham has broken the mold of what a human services agency  can be. They go beyond just matching skills to places of employment.  They treat each person, no matter their ability, with respect and  dignity. Their holistic approach to each situation allows them to build  an environment of trust, where each person they work with can thrive.   A physical, cognitive, behavioral, or socioeconomic challenge should  never get in the way of someone realizing their full potential. To that  end, Peckham makes our district and our State a better place to live.  At a fundamental level, they help folks to earn economic and personal  independence by creating, sustaining, and improving employment  opportunities in our community.   Peckham is a leader of workplace culture, from how employers view  mental health to how to safely reopen as we see a light at the end of  the tunnel in COVID-19. For their efforts, they have been featured in  Fortune Magazine's Great Places to Work List, and recognized by the  U.S. Department of Labor with the Gold Hire Vets Medallion Award.   Mr. Speaker, accessibility and diversity are cornerstones of a modern  workplace. They make our economy stronger, bring our communities  closer, and demonstrate what our country is all about: Equality of  opportunity.   Today, I am proud to congratulate Peckham on 45 successful years  harnessing the power of acceptance. They develop potential, work with  purpose, and deliver results. With these remarks on the House floor,  may their contributions to our Nation live on in the Congressional  Record.             Recognizing Livingston County Medical Reserve Corps     Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, in Livingston County,  there is a group of retired medical professionals and volunteers that  answer the call to serve by staying in action and continuing to train  in the event of emergencies.   In 2006, the Livingston County Medical Reserve Corps was founded as a  public health volunteer team. Today, I am proud to honor them on the  House floor during their work during the COVID-19 pandemic.   As one of the 762 Medical Reserve Corps units in the Nation, they are  [[Page H2923]]  part of a network of locally organized groups that strive to improve  the health and safety of our communities.   In Livingston County, our reserve corps is composed of 194 members,  with an extra 80 volunteers, dedicating their time at the clinic. These  folks are registered nurses, pharmacists, physician's assistants, nurse  practitioners, paramedics, licensed professional nurses, EMTs,  firefighters, veterinarians, chiropractors, social workers, teachers,  public health professionals, and others with nonmedical backgrounds.   They come from all walks of life, but they are motivated to their  cause, which is a healthier Livingston County. And their work during  the pandemic is nothing short of heroic. They helped with mask  packaging and distribution, staffing a COVID hotline, contact tracing,  and vaccine support. Without the reserve corps, the county would not  have been able to respond as effectively.   Since the beginning of last year, temporary staff have logged almost  7,000 hours on duty, with volunteers adding another 5,000 hours. These  hours represent shots in arms, questions answered, fears put at ease,  and more.   When our people need it the most, the Medical Reserve Corps stepped  up. Their training designed for full-scale emergencies meant the  difference when Livingston County was tested like never before.   I am so grateful for each and every member who has proudly worn the  yellow vest of the Medical Reserve Corps.   Mr. Speaker, I especially want to recognize Jennifer Kramer, the  Medical Reserve Corps coordinator, who has certainly personally put in  incredibly long hours in service to others.   With their motto of Partner, Provide, Prepare, and Protect, the  Medical Reserve Corps makes the extraordinary seem ordinary. I have  seen them in action myself when I visited a vaccination clinic in  January. They are organized, efficient, and wholly devoted to the  cause.   It is my great honor to speak these words into the official Record so  that future generations can read about these heroes who were there when  we needed them most.                   Recognizing Cristo Rey Community Center     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Cristo Rey  Community Center, a nonprofit organization that has been meeting the  needs of the Lansing community since 1968.   As a comprehensive, basic-needs service center, Cristo Rey is an  invaluable source for residents, no matter their station in life. The  center's health clinic serves the uninsured and underinsured while  offering counseling to those struggling with substance abuse and  addiction. Their financial counselors help folks develop healthy  spending and saving habits, and their community kitchen serves free hot  breakfast and lunch Monday through Friday.   In 2018 alone, Cristo Rey served over 56,000 members of their  community. They distributed over 357,000 pounds of food, and provided  more than 21,000 meals to the hungry. Their family health center cared  for nearly 2,800 unique patients, empowered 1,500 individuals to manage  their finances, and helped families save over $700,000 in prescription  drug costs.                                time  1330    In addition to these programs, Cristo Rey served as an essential  warming center during harsh winters and as a cooling center during  sweltering summers for the roughly 5,000 individuals who are homeless  in the Lansing area.   Every day, Cristo Rey staff live up to their motto: ``Serving  individuals, serving families, serving communities. Always with  compassion. Always with respect.''   Wherever there is a need, whether it is a basic need, a spiritual  need, or a societal need, Cristo Rey is there. Yes, they offer support  and care, but they also focus on self-sufficiency and honoring the  dignity of every person who walks through their doors.   For the poor and vulnerable, immigrants and migrants, and all people  in need, regardless of language or culture, Cristo Rey is instrumental  in the work to break the cycle of poverty and lift the community up. As  a trusted organization, they are crucial to building bridges between  different parts of the city.   In 2019, during the search for a new police chief, Cristo Rey hosted  the first community meet-and-greet for Daryl Green, who became  Lansing's chief of police. When our community was rocked by COVID,  Cristo Rey was one of the first to retool its programs and offerings in  order to start adapting to changing times.   These days, with a grant from the Dart Foundation, the center has  been able to offer vaccinations to residents, particularly in  underserved and hard-to-reach communities, which is essential for  bringing down the rates of infection and reopening Michigan's economy.   For their 50 years of service to Lansing, it is my great honor to  recognize the men and women who truly do God's work at Cristo Rey  Community Center. May they continue to live out their mission for the  next 50 years and for as long as these words remain in the Record of  the people's House.                              Recognizing LACASA     Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize LACASA, a  nonprofit in my community that has stood out as a beacon of hope for  thousands of vulnerable women and children in mid-Michigan.   In 1979, LACASA was founded as the Livingston Area Council Against  Spousal Abuse. With just $40 in donations and a part-time director at a  desk in a borrowed office space, the organization first relied entirely  on volunteers, selfless local residents who opened up their own homes  so that survivors of domestic violence could find refuge.   Later on, as it grew, LACASA was able to rent, then buy, and finally  expand to a permanent shelter where women and children can access  counseling services, legal advocacy, and wraparound support.   In addition to sanctuary, LACASA offers 24-hour crisis response with  trained staff who are able to intake and serve the diverse needs of  survivors of child abuse, domestic abuse, and sexual assault. For so  many in our community, the folks at LACASA are directly responsible for  giving them the tools and strength to begin the road toward a better  future.   However, pandemics don't stop abusers. In fact, when outside  stressors occur, abuse historically tends to escalate. So when shelter- in-place orders took effect last year, closing LACASA and its around- the-clock facility was not an option. Record numbers of victims seeking  help and refuge contacted them, and their ability to adapt is nothing  short of heroic.   In 2020 alone, LACASA provided 1,170 overnight stays in hotel rooms  and over 3,500 off-site meals for victims and their families. They  expanded capacity to handle a 230-percent increase in child forensic  interviews.   LACASA saw the number of calls to their 24/7 helpline nearly double  when the number of individuals seeking personal protection orders more  than tripled compared to an average year.   Mr. Speaker, I have had the chance to personally visit LACASA,  touring their shelter and working with their president, CEO, and  badass, Bobette Schrandt, on several occasions. I am so thankful for  her leadership and for the entire organization's tireless support and  work to provide a port in the storm for local residents.   They are a model for similar nonprofits, earning national  accreditation from the National Children's Alliance as a children's  advocacy center just last week. Bobette told me herself. It is their  highest level of membership, an honor that says everything about  LACASA's dedication to addressing childhood abuse in southeast  Michigan.   Today, I am proud to lift up their trauma-informed procedures and  practices as a shining beacon of hope in Michigan's Eighth District.   On behalf of a grateful community, thank you for the work that you  do, and may you continue to lead the way.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
