 Mr. Speaker, I have walked with   John Lewis at least 15  times across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where, with courage and  commitment, he made a seminal difference in the life of our country.   Many of us walked with him. As we followed in   John Lewis'  footsteps, I suspect my colleagues saw, as I did, that the man we knew  to be a veteran legislator and a person of wisdom and experience still  carried in his heart the same energy, optimism, and determined spirit  that he bore in his youth.   John never stopped being the young man who dreamed of change and knew  it could be achieved. In that springtime Alabama Sun, he beamed with a  passion for justice and shone that light back on all of us who marched  with him.   Even at 80, John Robert Lewis had the heart and fiery soul of a young  protestor for a righteous cause, an organizer for the community and the  country he served.   Every day of his life, John marched for justice, civil rights, peace,  and equality. On every step of his journey, he brought all of us and  this country he loved with him.   On Friday, John's march on Earth came to an end, and he was revered  as a good and faithful servant. Now, Mr. Speaker, he rests in the bosom  of God.   He made sure that we know the way forward:   Toward racial justice;   Toward communities safer from gun violence;   Toward a cleaner and healthier planet;   Toward an America where everyone can access quality, affordable  healthcare and where no child goes to bed hungry;   Toward a world where peace and plenty replace conflict and scarcity;   And toward an America whose people heed Dr. King's call to sit  together at the table of brotherhood and sisterhood.   Mr. Speaker, we have a long way to go on that march. But if we  continue to walk in   John Lewis' footsteps, we will make it. He would  say we must make it.   Our struggle to realize the beloved community was his vision and our  mission. Surely, he will be with us as we continue that mission of the  movement.   Where he was the veteran at our side, now John will be the wind at  our backs and, as the song says, beneath our wings. With his guidance  and inspiration, we can, as he did, walk with the wind as we march on  towards justice, equality, and peace until victory is won.   He was our inspiration; he was our guide; he was our friend; he was  our colleague. As I said on Saturday morning, there is a hole in the  heart of America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, Mr. Smith, for  yielding. I thank Mr. Thornberry, the ranking member, for his efforts  and partnership in bringing this bill to the floor in a bipartisan  fashion.   I join the previous speaker in the premise that she posited with  respect to forward-leaning, ready and able to engage and to participate  as leaders of the free world in securing the benefits of freedom and  liberty to our globe.   I want to thank Chairman Smith and the Armed Services Committee for  ensuring a fair and bipartisan process as the House worked to craft a  defense authorization bill that strengthens our national security and  reflects our Nation's highest principles.   I want to thank, as I said, Mac Thornberry and Chairman Smith, who  have worked together throughout this process.   I know that Democrats and Republicans on the committee and, indeed,  in this House share a strong determination to do right by our troops  and those they serve.   Let me also thank Chairman McGovern and the Rules Committee for  working to ensure that this bill comes to the floor under a process  that allows for Members to offer amendments they feel will make our  national defense stronger, while making certain that our defense  policies reflect the best of America and helps address our long-term  challenges.   We consider this bill in a challenging environment. COVID-19 has  attacked our people, our economy, and our country in a way unknown to  any Member who serves in this body today. None of us are old enough to  remember, of course, the Spanish flu, but we know that it did not have  the same consequences in America that COVID-19 has had. It is a  reminder that we are afflicted, not only by those who would cause us  harm through armed might, but also through illness, climate change, and  other natural disasters.   I regret that we were unable to include every item the Democrats  supported as part of the compromise that will enable us to get this  bill passed. But, of course, that is what a compromise is.   It is unfortunate that we could not take up an amendment rejecting  the Trump administration ban on transgender Americans serving in our  military. As John McCain once said so correctly: I don't care whether  they are straight; I just care that they can shoot straight.   We look at conduct and character, not differences that are not  relevant to our ability to respond and to serve. Ending that ban will  continue to be a priority for House Democrats.   While not all amendments that were proposed will end up becoming part  of the final bill we vote on, in their offering, Mr. Speaker, they  played an important role in shaping the House's legislation and will  surely continue to add to important policy discussions that we need to  have in our country.   One observation I would make, Mr. Speaker, is that one of the aspects  of COVID-19's assault on our country has been to have a somewhat  attenuated debate and discussion. I have discussed with Mr. Smith and  Mr. Thornberry on numerous occasions the need to have a very deep dive  into the fiscal viability of our defense budget, as well as our  domestic budget, so that we can ensure, in the future, that operations,  training, and acquisitions do not suffer because of the lack of  resources.   I am hopeful that the final bill we vote on tomorrow and send to the  Senate will reflect a positive vision for our Nation's national defense  and that it can pass with bipartisan support. I urge my Members to  support it.   Our national security challenges are many, and they are serious. That  is why the Democratic-led House will continue to do its job responsibly  and to work bipartisanly to ensure that our Nation is kept safe and  that those who serve on the front lines in its defense have all the  resources they need to carry out their missions safely and effectively.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith and the ranking member and  all those who worked hard, including the committee staff who worked  long hours under very stressful and unprecedented circumstances.   I urge, in closing, Mr. Speaker, all Members to support this  legislation.
