 Mr. Speaker, last month, I had the  opportunity to meet with Diann Shaddox of North Augusta, South  Carolina, founder of the Diann Shaddox Foundation for Essential  Tremors.   Essential tremor is a neurological condition that causes the  trembling of the hands, head, voice, legs, or body and affects nearly  10 million people in the United States. Despite its prevalence, it  wasn't until 2013 that essential tremor was given its own specific  diagnosis apart from other tremors.   Diann Shaddox was diagnosed with essential tremors in her early  twenties. Since then, Diann has acted as an advocate for awareness and,  for over 35 years, has dedicated her life to finding a cure for  essential tremors.   The mission of the Diann Shaddox Foundation for Essential Tremors is  to educate and increase awareness about people afflicted with essential  tremor, which is the largest movement disorder in the world. The  foundation also collects donations for medical research in the hope of  discovering the cause and a cure, and I wish them continued success on  their important mission.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.  [[Page H3753]]                                ____________________
