 Mr. Speaker, there they go again. Donald Trump and Paul  Ryan are dusting off a familiar Republican playbook.   I will break it down for you:   Step one, slash taxes for millionaires and billionaires;   Step two, explode the deficit;   Step three, use rising deficits to justify cuts to Medicare and  Medicaid;   Step four, accuse Democrats of being irresponsible for opposing said  cuts;   Step five, repeat. Repeat as the rich get richer, repeat as the  deficit grows larger, repeat as working families struggle, and repeat  as the social safety net disintegrates.   We saw it a decade ago under President Bush, and we are seeing it  again right now.   But you don't have to take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. The  Republican tax bill will add $1.5 trillion to our national debt over  the next decade, yet Paul Ryan is already claiming that we need to cut  entitlements to get America's finances under control.   Last week, Ryan warned: ``We're going to have to get back next year  at entitlement reform. . . . Frankly, it's the healthcare entitlements  that are the big drivers of our debt . . . that's really where the  problem lies.''   Not true, Mr. Speaker.   Our problem doesn't lie with lifesaving healthcare programs like  Medicare and Medicaid. Our problem lies with this monstrosity of a tax  bill.   What if we tried a different approach?   What if, instead of slashing Medicare to pay for tax cuts for Trump's  cronies, we said no to this scam of a tax bill?   What if we said no to raising taxes on middle class families?   What if we said no to hurting students to help the largest companies  in the world?   What if we said no to a tax bill written by high-paid lobbyists for  wealthy donors behind closed doors?   What if, just once, the Republican majority actually passed a bill to  make life easier for Americans living paycheck to paycheck?   It is a crazy idea, right?   But if Republicans come to their senses and want to work on real tax  reform for working Americans, they know where to find us, but I won't  hold my breath.                            ____________________
