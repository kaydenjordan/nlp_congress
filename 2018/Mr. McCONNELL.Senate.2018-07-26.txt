 Mr. President, I would like to talk this morning about  the President's qualified nominee for the Supreme Court. A number of us  have already met with Judge Kavanaugh. Four Senators from both sides of  the aisle have meetings scheduled. By all accounts, including my own,  he is a fair and thoughtful jurist with a brilliant legal mind, but  some Senators have a different view than their colleagues and different  from the experts.   Here is how the junior Senator from New Jersey characterized this  nomination with the senior Senator from Massachusetts right beside him.  Here is what he said:         We are walking through the valley of the shadow of death.        You are either complicit in the evil, you are either       contributing to the wrong, or you are fighting against it.    This is from a member of the Judiciary Committee. He hasn't even met  with Judge Kavanaugh. He hasn't heard a word of testimony, and he is  citing Scripture. He is proclaiming that this nominee is pure evil of  Biblical proportions. He is claiming that the Senators and the American  people who have an open mind on this nomination are complicit in the  evil. This is truly outrageous.   Not a single Democrat has come forward to condemn what he had to say.  Our friends on the left are locked in this bizarre competition to wear  out the volume knob and outdo each other with this angry nonsense.   Before the President even selected Judge Kavanaugh, the junior  Senator from California, another member of the Judiciary Committee,  declared that whoever he nominated would bring about ``the destruction  of the Constitution of the United States.'' She made up her mind before  any hearings or any testimony and before there was even a nominee, in  fact.   Less than 24 hours after Judge Kavanaugh was announced, the senior  Senator from Connecticut followed suit. He said: ``Judge Kavanaugh is  your worst nightmare.'' This is another member of the Judiciary  Committee.   So for those keeping score at home, Democrats want you to believe  that Judge Kavanaugh is your worst nightmare, who will put the American  people in the valley of the shadow of death and destroy the  Constitution all by himself. Oh, and don't forget that anyone who  doesn't agree with them is ``complicit in evil.''   Whom do they expect to believe this stuff?   Here is another quote: ``This is a nominee who wants to pave the path  to tyranny.'' That was our colleague, the junior Senator from Oregon,  at a rally with far-left special interests.   Here is another quote: ``The nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh will  threaten the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come.'' That  was a quote of the former Democratic Governor of Virginia, who actually  used to chair the Democratic National Committee.   It is hard to keep a straight face when you hear this hysteria.  Really,  [[Page S5394]]  you can't keep a straight face at all when our Democratic colleagues  say these things and then turn around and insist they need extra time,  extra information, and extra documents in order to make up their minds.   Do the people making these comments sound like they are openminded?  Do they sound persuadable?   The Democratic leader has insisted that Judge Kavanaugh's long and  extensive judicial record isn't enough and that Democrats need to see  practically every scrap of paper from the Bush White House before they  can decide. But about 2 weeks ago, when the ink was barely dry on Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination, he himself told a national television  audience--this is the Democratic leader--that he will ``oppose him with  everything I've got.'' That doesn't sound undecided to me. It doesn't  sound like a guy who needs documents to make up his mind.   Let's be clear about what this is all about. Judge Kavanaugh has been  a judge for over a decade. He has written over 300 opinions. He just  produced over 6,000 pages of documents as part of his questionnaire,  and many more documents will be produced in the coming weeks. In fact,  it is likely that more documents will be produced with respect to his  nomination than for any Supreme Court nomination in our entire history.   But it is becoming pretty clear that none of this will really matter.  I am sorry to say that for most Senate Democrats, I am afraid it would  not matter if there were a million pages of documents or 10 million or  100 million. It wouldn't make any difference. No matter how many  documents are produced, many of our Democratic colleagues are making it  abundantly clear that they are never going to support this nominee.   The complaint about documents is not about assessing his record in an  openminded, fair, and dispassionate way. It is all about the desire to  obstruct and delay. The American people will give this demagoguery and  these delaying tactics the short shrift they deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, later today Vice  President Pence will visit Wheeling, WV, to discuss Republicans' pro- growth agenda. For the better part of a decade, the people of West  Virginia heard a lot of talk from Washington.   During the 2008 Presidential campaign, then-Senator Biden told a  crowd in Charleston, WV, that he supported the coal industry and that  the Democrats' policies would help West Virginia's economy. ``This is  about jobs,'' he said.   But the Obama-Biden administration turned out to be a crash course in  the difference between rhetoric and results. Across the entire private  sector, fewer Virginians were employed the day President Obama left  office than on the day he was sworn in. According to the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, the State's manufacturing workforce shrunk by more  than 13 percent from 2009 through 2016, and its mining and logging  workforce collapsed by 37 percent.   Let's be clear. Public policy is not the only factor at work in our  economy, but there is no denying that Washington can make life harder  for job creators or make it easier. The Obama economy was a tough pill  to swallow--tax hikes and burdensome regulations. Their policies cut  against the rhetoric, and the outcome was disappointing.   That was then. This is now. When Vice President Pence lands in West  Virginia today, he will be able to share a different story. He will be  able to say that, thanks in part to regulatory relief and generational  tax reform, the number of Americans saying that now is a good time to  find a quality job hit a 17-year high just 2 months ago.   He will be able to say that West Virginia's unemployment rate has  been lower in every month of this unified Republican government than it  was during any month of the Obama Presidency.   It is the American people who are achieving all of this. Republicans  are just happy that our policies are helping to create conditions for  workers and job creators to thrive.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week, the Senate has continued our  regular appropriations process. We are considering four important  funding measures that will account for about an eighth of discretionary  spending.   This bill will keep resources flowing to a long list of key  government functions. We are talking about everything from food safety  inspections to anti-drug enforcement, to child nutrition, to the Forest  Service. It attends to a number of specific policy priorities that we  all hold in common, like providing major resources to rebuild America's  infrastructure and to fight against opioid abuse.   My constituents in Kentucky will benefit from new funding for rural  development grants and loans and more resources to fight everything  from illegal drugs to invasive species like Asian carp. Communities in  every single State will win because of this work.   I want to express gratitude to Members on both sides of the aisle:  our subcommittee chairs, who helped to shape the bills in this minibus,  Senators Murkowski, Collins, Hoeven, and Lankford; all of our  colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and their fearless leaders,  Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy, for keeping this process  bipartisan and for keeping it moving; and Senator Murkowski, once more,  for her work in managing this legislation here on the floor.   I am proud of the regular appropriations process we are rebuilding  together. I am proud that we have been able to process several  amendments and hope we can continue to process even more. But I am  especially proud of the good things this legislation will do for  families and communities nationwide.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there are two bills  at the desk that are due for a second reading en bloc.
