 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 461, legislation  that formally condemns the use of public elementary and secondary  schools as shelters for illegal migrants.   The safety and security of America's children should be the number  one priority of lawmakers here in Washington, and placing illegal  migrants within earshot of students presents serious threats to the  safety of our children and the safety of our communities.   In New York, when Mayor Eric Adams attempted to house migrants in  nearly 20 public schools, everyday New Yorkers stood up to city hall,  rejected this attempt to threaten our students, and stopped the mayor  from housing migrants in schools. Instead of learning from his mistakes  and ending New York's sanctuary city status, Mayor Adams then decided  that housing migrants in an abandoned warehouse at JFK Airport would be  a better alternative. Placing migrants at a dilapidated warehouse in  the heart of one of the largest transportation hubs in this country is  both inhumane and presents a serious national security threat.   I keep hearing over and over again about trafficking and about being  inhumane. You are correct. Seeking asylum is not illegal, but we ask  that they come through the front door, and I would be confident that no  asylum seeker comes to this country to live in a vacant warehouse at  JFK Airport with no bathrooms and no showers.   We cannot allow politicians like Eric Adams to sacrifice the safety  and security of this Nation to uphold their radical sanctuary city  policies and compensate for President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas'  failing border security initiatives and their dereliction of their  duties.   Our Nation's public schools should be places of learning for local  students, not housing illegal migrants. I strongly urge my colleagues  to support this measure to block illegal migrants from being housed in  school facilities.
