 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise in commemoration of Constitution  Day, celebrated nationwide yesterday, the date, September 17.   Two hundred thirty-two years ago, our Founding Fathers gathered at  Independence Hall in Philadelphia and signed a document that remains  the supreme law of the land today. In those 232 years, the United  States has become the most powerful, the most prosperous Nation in the  history of the world, and that success has come as a result of the  framework set by our Constitution.   The genius of the Framers was their determination to maximize the  freedom of the individual while recognizing the need for a central  government limited in size by our Constitution. The Founders understood  the nature of man. The Founders understood that power corrupts.   Under the framework of federalism, we created a divide between the  States and the Federal Government, allowing for powers to be shared. In  fact, the 10th Amendment states:         The powers not delegated to the United States by the       Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are       reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.    At the Federal level, we established three coequal branches of  government, which established a system of checks and balances to offset  the concentration of power. To complement the laws established, our  Founders put in place the Bill of Rights as a safeguard to protect the  individual from the threat of government tyranny. Our sacred rights and  freedoms endowed by our Creator are recognized as inherent and  untouchable because of our Bill of Rights.   As the Father of our Constitution, James Madison, stated:         In Europe, charters of liberty have been granted by power.       America has set the example . . . of charters of power       granted by liberty.    Our constitutional system of government is the envy of the world and  has served as a model for countries worldwide that are seeking to  create representative governments. That is why it is so important for  us to observe days like Constitution Day. Americans of all ages should  be learning and should be studying our Constitution. They should be  taking in what makes our Constitution so uniquely successful in  nurturing a free and a prosperous society. Our grand experiment has  stood the test of time, yet we must continue to be vigilant in the  preservation of this most important part of our American legacy.   So, today, I encourage every Montanan and every American to read the  Constitution. Discuss it at the dinner table. Discuss it with your  family members. Discuss it in your classrooms. Discuss it with your  friends. Discuss it with your neighbors.   As the preamble states, ``We the People'' established our  Constitution, and it remains up to ``We the People'' to ensure its  success.   May God continue to bless this great Nation.   I yield the floor.
