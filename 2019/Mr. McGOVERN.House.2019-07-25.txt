 Mr. Speaker, I am here this afternoon to raise strong  concerns about a rule that the Trump administration recently announced  on eliminating broad-based categorical eligibility.   If implemented, this rule will cut 3 million people off of SNAP, 13  percent of whom are elderly and 7 percent of whom are children. In  addition, 500,000 kids will lose access to free school meals.   I will put it simply: This will increase food insecurity and hurt  working families.   President Trump wants to, literally, take the food off the table of  working families so that he can give tax breaks to the well-off and the  well-connected.   This proposed rule is against the will of Congress. Last year, we  worked on a bipartisan farm bill, and despite some discussion on this,  Congress agreed to let States maintain their flexibility to accommodate  low-income households.   That is why I encourage my colleagues in the House and Senate to join  me and fight every battle this administration wages against those who  struggle.   Let us demand an end to this President's cruelty, and let us work to  end hunger now.
