 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the University of  Rochester Medical Center, which has just been awarded a $3.75 million  grant for their Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program.  [[Page H4443]]    This significant award recognizes their world-class medical and  educational expertise, while helping to cement their position as a  leader in the geriatrics field.   Investments like this are essential to strengthening health outcomes  and ensuring a high quality of life for our loved ones as they age. The  grant will support the Finger Lakes Geriatric Education Center, helping  to fund specific education and training for Alzheimer's disease and  related dementias. It will support the broader goal of creating a  comprehensive age-friendly health system and work toward making  Rochester and the Finger Lakes region a dementia-friendly community.   I am so grateful to the University of Rochester for their continued  dedication and commitment to supporting the needs of older adults. I  congratulate them on receiving this exciting grant award and look  forward to continuing our work together to provide high-quality care to  everyone who calls our community home.                            ____________________
