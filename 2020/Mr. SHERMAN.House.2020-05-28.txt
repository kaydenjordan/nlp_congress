 Madam Speaker, our work now is to negotiate a new relief  bill. So far we have spent trillions of dollars bandaging our economic  wounds, yet less than one-half of 1 percent has gone to beat the  disease through research on therapeutics and prophylaxes.   All hands should be on deck. Every reasonable idea should be tested.  But our professional medical researchers are today sitting at home  because their non-COVID research has been suspended and our COVID  research funding has been modest.   The HEROES Act provides $5.5 billion to do this medical research.  That is the most important one-quarter of 1 percent of that bill, and  we need to fight to expand it in negotiations.   Medical research is the best investment we can make for America. It  is also the only way we are likely to provide major help for the  billions of people who live in poor countries, and it is the best  investment that we can make in America's standing in the world.

We need to test 3,000  different combinations of compounds, and we don't have 2 years.                            ____________________
