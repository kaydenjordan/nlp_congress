 Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor this  morning to thank and to support my colleagues, Senator Portman and  Senator Nelson, who have led the effort here before us, an effort that  would end sex trafficking over the internet or certainly work to reduce  it.   As we think about the scourge that is brought upon our children  through a means and a way--we like to think of the internet as a  powerful tool, but to know that it can be a powerful tool that truly is  devastating to our children and devastating to our families calls for  action. So I am pleased to be able to join my colleagues today in  urging passage of the sex trafficking bill that we have before the  Senate.   I think we all know there are many, many reasons why we need to deter  the use of internet resources by predators. The wisdom of this is  pretty apparent on its face. This legislation is for the protection of  our children--the most vulnerable among us.   I have an additional reason for urging the adoption of this  legislation, and that is the protection of Native women and girls from  predators. I have been talking about the trafficking of Native women  and girls for as long as I have been here in the Senate--now some 15  years. At first, the evidence was perhaps anecdotal. FBI agents who  were familiar with trafficking patterns would come to us, and they  would say that Alaska Native women were a highly desirable commodity.  Even using that terminology is just so offensive, but that is how they  were viewed--as a desirable commodity for sex trafficking because they  could be trafficked either as White women or as Asian women.   There is a body of evidence that when many Alaska Native women or  girls left their villages to go into town or to go to the city, they  would literally be stalked by predators waiting to recruit them. We  certainly see a prevalence of sex trafficking in Covenant House, which  is our youth homeless shelter. We have reports that one in four  homeless youth in Anchorage are victims of sex trafficking, and 42  percent of them are Alaska Natives.   As I have been here in the Senate over these years, the way these  women and girls have been recruited, have been trafficked, has changed.  No longer do you have the predators who are lurking, hanging out on the  street corners, but it is the internet. Again, it is this powerful tool  that is available to do so much good that is now being used for a  predatory purpose. While we don't have the internet coverage in Alaska  that you have in the big cities of the lower 48, the internet is used  to recruit girls for sex trafficking all over, and I certainly had that  confirmed in my last visit when I met with the FBI agents in charge in  Anchorage.   It wasn't too many weeks ago that the Senator from North Dakota, Ms.  Heitkamp, and I came to the floor to talk about the urgency of  addressing the growing number of missing and murdered Native women in  America. Senator Heitkamp characterizes the problem as epidemic, and I  agree with her. I do think it is an epidemic. Native women are victims  of violence in unprecedented proportions. Not all of these victims are  trafficked, but some are trafficked, and then they go missing. When  their services are no longer needed or they find themselves controlled  by a particularly violent predator, they never become ``unmissing''  until their bodies may be coincidently found, at which point they are  finally regarded as murdered, gone.   I say today that there is an urgency to keep Native women and girls  away from predators. While turning off the  [[Page S1859]]  internet on-ramp to recruitment may not completely solve the problem,  it is a worthy effort in its own right. It is one tool that we need to  ratchet back.   We hear from the sponsor of this bill and from so many that enough is  enough. It is no longer tolerable. It is time we attack the problem of  sex trafficking at the source, and that means doing all we can to make  the internet a very inhospitable place for sex traffickers and those  who enable the immoral and disgusting trade of our fellow human beings.
