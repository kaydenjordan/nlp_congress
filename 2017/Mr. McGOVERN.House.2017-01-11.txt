 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the  incredible work of Kevin Concannon, Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition  and Consumer Services at the United States Department of Agriculture.   Kevin's dedication to public service is admirable. Throughout his  distinguished career, Kevin has not only served in Federal Government,  but he also led Health and Human Services departments in his home State  of Maine and in Oregon and in Iowa. Kevin also helped to advance our  knowledge of social policy as a graduate professor at several  universities across our country.   Since 2009, Kevin has capably led FNS, the division of USDA  responsible for administering and overseeing SNAP, the National School  Breakfast and Lunch Programs, the Summer Food Service Program, WIC, The  Emergency Food Assistance Program, and several other nutrition  programs.   Under Kevin's leadership, we have made significant progress in  ensuring our most vulnerable neighbors have  [[Page H307]]  healthy options to feed their families. He helped to spur a dramatic  increase in the number of farmers markets accepting EBT cards, thereby  allowing SNAP recipients greater access to fruits and vegetables while  also supporting local farmers. He also oversaw the creation of USDA's  Farm to School Program, an effort focused on incorporating local foods  in our school meal programs.   During his tenure, we enacted the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act,  legislation that, for the first time in over 30 years, made much-needed  improvements and increased access to our school meal programs.   Kevin oversaw our Nation's premier antihunger program, SNAP, as it  provided millions of our neighbors with food assistance during the  height of the Great Recession and the recovery that followed, and he  has been a fearless advocate for the food and nutrition programs he  oversees. When it comes to the nuances of SNAP or WIC or school meals,  Kevin's knowledge and expertise is simply unmatched. He knows the  issues impacting vulnerable families, and he is passionate about  addressing hunger in this country.   Mr. Speaker, during the past several years, I have had the privilege  to collaborate with and learn from Kevin as we worked to address hunger  and food insecurity in the United States. I am particularly  appreciative of the time he took away from his office in Washington to  join me on two summer meal tours in my home State of Massachusetts.  Together, we visited a number of schools, parks, camps, and community  centers supported by USDA's Summer Food Service Program that ensures  children and teens in low-income areas have access to healthy meals  during the summer months.   I was always impressed by how he connected with my constituents and  his passion for the work he does. He is, truly, a remarkable public  servant, and he has made a real difference in the lives of millions and  millions of people in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for Under Secretary Concannon's efforts on  so many levels, but I especially appreciate all he has done to try to  end hunger in our country. There are too many people in the United  States of America, the richest country in the history of the world, who  are hungry; and, quite frankly, we could all do more in this Chamber.   Sadly, Congress too often in the past has voted in ways and advocated  for policies that have actually made hunger worse in this country. In  all candor, I am concerned about the future of some of these programs  that provide food and nutrition to vulnerable citizens. I am concerned  based on the rhetoric of leaders in this House of Representatives, and  I am concerned by the rhetoric of the President-elect and his potential  Cabinet. Time and time again, we have heard them talk about those in  poverty with disdain and contempt. We have heard them denigrate the  plight of those struggling in this country. We have heard them belittle  their struggle. Quite frankly, that is unacceptable.   I urge my colleagues to learn from Kevin Concannon, to be inspired by  his example, and to do what we can all do together to try to end hunger  now.   I ask all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing his incredible  accomplishments. We wish him well in his next chapter, but we will  certainly miss his expertise and passion at FNS.                            ____________________
