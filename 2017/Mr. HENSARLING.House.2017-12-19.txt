 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 667, I call  up the bill (H.R. 3312) to amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act to specify when bank holding companies may be  subject to certain enhanced supervision, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 3312, the  Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2017.   This very important piece of legislation was introduced by my friend,  Mr. Luetkemeyer, who serves as chairman of the Financial Institutions  and Consumer Credit Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee,  and is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of Members of the House. In  fact, Mr. Speaker, the bill was approved in October by the Financial  Services Committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 47-12, so  strong, Mr. Speaker, that even a majority of Democrats on the committee  voted to support the bill.   This bill reforms what Republicans and now many Democrats acknowledge  is a flawed and arbitrary framework under the Dodd-Frank Act to  designate so-called systemically important financial institutions, also  known as SIFIs. In fact, one of those Democrats who acknowledges that  it is a flawed and arbitrary framework is none other than former  chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, the  very Frank of Dodd-Frank, the coauthor of the Dodd-Frank Act. He,  himself, has said that this provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that many  of us are trying to reform today is ``arbitrary'' and ``a mistake.''  Those are his words, Mr. Speaker, not mine.   That arbitrary and mistaken provision is Dodd-Frank's one-size-fits- all standard that subjects banks with $50 billion or more in assets to  the same costly and cumbersome SIFI regulatory standards as trillion- dollar global systemically important institutions.   We should take note that this flawed standard has now been criticized  by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, former Federal Reserve Board  Governor Dan Tarullo, former Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry,  and many other Obama appointees. In other words, Mr. Speaker, it is  that bad.   Mr. Luetkemeyer's bipartisan bill--again, very strong bipartisan  bill--replaces this inflexible, flawed, $50 billion threshold that has  been criticized by so many with a series of well-established, critical  standards that more accurately measure systemic importance.                                time  1515    Specifically, his legislation requires the Federal Reserve to review  a financial institution's size, interconnectedness, global cross- jurisdictional activity, and complexity, before determining whether the  institution should be subject to heightened SIFI regulatory standards.   In other words, this bipartisan bill tailors regulations based on a  bank's  [[Page H10222]]  actual level of risk, instead of Dodd-Frank's one-size-fits-all system  that ensnares smaller regional and midsize banks that, essentially,  have simple community bank lending models. These banks are not globally  complex Wall Street banks and shouldn't be treated the same.   It simply doesn't make sense to subject small regional and midsize  banks with only $50 billion in assets to the same expensive and  cumbersome SIFI regulatory regime as a bank like JPMorgan Chase, which  has $2.5 trillion in assets. Based on size alone, the $50 billion bank  is just 2 percent, 2 percent of JPMorgan Chase's size.   What does make sense, Mr. Speaker, is to base the regulation of these  financial institutions on their actual risk profile rather than their  asset size alone, which is exactly what Mr. Luetkemeyer's strongly  bipartisan bill will do.   Now, while I personally do not support the SIFI architecture at all  and do not believe any financial institution in America should be  designated too big to fail, it is important that we always continue to  work to find bipartisan reforms where we can find them and improve  current law, and the legislation before us today represents a good  faith effort to do exactly that.   Let's keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, this is simply not a debate over an  arcane definition in law. It is about the real world effect these  regulations have on the U.S. economy and the working men and women whom  we represent.   Let me share with my colleagues what the Small Business and  Entrepreneurship Council has to say about the importance of the bill  that we are debating today: ``Access to working and growth capital  remains a challenge for many entrepreneurs and small businesses. H.R.  3312 would improve the lending environment and unleash capital by  alleviating inappropriate requirements imposed on regional and midsize  banks under Dodd-Frank. Midsize and regional banks, which many startups  and small businesses have counted on for lending, have been negatively  affected by this Dodd-Frank arbitrary trigger.''   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better. They deserve a  healthy economy with growing paychecks, better jobs, and a brighter  future. It is time to restore economic growth fueled by capital flowing  from America's banks to American communities across our Nation.   So I urge my colleagues to correct this widely acknowledged mistake  in Dodd-Frank, even acknowledged by former Congressman Barney Frank  himself, and put into place real, discernible, critical standards, and  help our struggling small businesses on Main Street. Let's pass H.R.  3312.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), who is the Republican sponsor of the  legislation and the chairman of our Financial Services Subcommittee on  Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the chairwoman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, in order to better balance the time on  each side, may I inquire if my colleague anticipates having speakers on  the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, is the gentleman prepared to yield me  time?    Is the gentleman prepared to yield me time?    How much time does the gentleman yield me?    I inquire of the gentleman how much time is he  yielding? I don't wish to be cut off.    I am going to respectfully decline the opportunity.    Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a member of the Financial  Services Committee and our Republican whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arkansas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a very hardworking member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I might point out to the ranking member  that she should read her mail, since I responded to her letter.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson), a hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I happen to have the letter in my hand.  I would be happy to share it with the ranking member if she has  misfiled it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  GOTTHEIMER), a Democratic colleague.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Texas, for  coming to the floor. I know how busy he is with his impeachment  activities, so we are glad he has had an opportunity to come and share  his views on this particular bill.   He spent a lot of time telling us who wasn't for the bill, but he  didn't tell us who was for it. And I would, once again, inform my  friend, my colleague from Texas, that not only is every single  Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee for this  bill, but a majority of the Democrats on the committee are for this  bill. Perhaps that is why he could find so few Democrats to speak out  against it.   So what we have heard, Mr. Speaker, is my colleague and the ranking  member vociferously defend the whole idea that there should be  institutions that are too big to fail. As they defend the Dodd-Frank  Act, Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that, yet again, the big  banks have gotten bigger. Under their regulatory scheme, the big banks  have gotten bigger and the communities banks have become fewer.   And now what they are telling us is: Oh, no, we have got to protect  this regime.   Well, I don't believe in it. But what I do believe in, Mr. Speaker,  and what Mr. Luetkemeyer believes in, is that we need to try to find  some bipartisan solutions, some common ground, to try to make some  common sense out of some of these regulations.   What is fascinating to me is so many of the Obama-era regulators have  said this $50 billion threshold makes no sense. Usually, my Democratic  colleagues will quote Mr. Tarullo, they  [[Page H10229]]  will quote Janet Yellen, or they will quote Mr. Curry. Well, all of  them have said that the $50 billion threshold is essentially arbitrary  and does not work.   So, at the end of the day, what it is doing, Mr. Speaker, is putting  in an additional regulatory burden on banks that pose no systemic risk  to our economy, making it more difficult to extend credit to  hardworking Americans who need it. But for people who just voted  against tax relief for hardworking Americans, I guess that is what I  would expect.   Now they want to make sure that they don't have tax relief, they  don't have mortgages, and they don't have credit cards. That is what  they are defending, Mr. Speaker, and it is wrong.   On a bipartisan basis, today, I believe we are going to vote for H.R.  3312 and make some sense out of this SIFI rule, and we will have a  better America tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
