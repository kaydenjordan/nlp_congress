 Mr. Speaker, I rise for several reasons; first  and foremost, to honor the life and legacy of my friend and colleague,  Congressman John Lewis.   Long before he brought his talents to the halls of Congress, John was  a young leader in the Civil Rights Movement. Together with his SNCC and  CORE brothers and sisters, they waged a war for the heart and soul of  this Nation and changed history. I feel truly honored to have served  with him, and I will be forever changed.   From the Edmund Pettus Bridge to the House floor, John is or was the  conscience of the Congress and truly of our Nation, and he will be  missed.   Likewise, we lost another civil rights leader, Reverend C.T. Vivian,  a Freedom Rider who worked alongside Dr. King. Reverend Vivian was also  a member of the Atlanta community, and my heart is with that great city  at this difficult time.             Challenging The United States Senate To Do Their Job     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to challenge the  Senate to do their job.   The American people are suffering from the coronavirus pandemic.  Hospitals remain flooded, small businesses remain shuttered.  Restaurants are trying to get by on take-out only, and bills are piling  up on the kitchen table.   Yet, the Senate, controlled by the GOP, does nothing but confirm  questionable judges.   Have they had a debate on the House-passed HEROES Act? No.  [[Page H3594]]    Have they discussed providing resources to communities so they can  pay the salaries of our brave first responders, our community heroes?  No.   Have they considered how out-of-work parents will pay their bills  when the emergency unemployment insurance expires? No.   And that is because this Republican Party, most clearly, Donald Trump  and Mitch McConnell, do not care about the American people. They do not  care about you, the bills that are piling up because you can't work, or  the kids who are going hungry every day.   Time and time again, my colleagues on the other side of this aisle  and across the building have shown nothing but disregard to the  challenges of the American people, the same people they claim to serve.   Look at the record. The GOP Senate has dragged its feet time and time  again, while more than 100,000 Americans died from coronavirus.   Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly 2 months since the people's House  passed our Nation's fifth COVID-19 bill. We called it the HEROES Act in  honor of all the men and women putting their lives and health on the  line to protect and serve our families and our communities.   The HEROES Act is focused on three things: Testing, testing, testing;  and it ensures that testing, including contact tracing, is conducted in  areas with the highest rates of infection.   It also provides another round of direct payments to American  families to help them weather this economic storm. I can't tell you how  many families told me that the first $1,200 was spent before it hit  their bank accounts.   We need to be frank about our current economic situation. Our GOP  colleagues shoved through their GOP tax scam in order to juice our  economy. Right now, this is the only economic leverage available to  Congress or the Fed.   It is time to put money directly into the pockets of American  families and business owners. They will spend it, and our economy will  continue. But that's basic math and economics, something often lost on  the other side.   Mr. Speaker, it is not hard to turn on FOX or MSNBC and hear the  talking heads arguing this or that point. But I want to talk about the  rest of America, places like Lansing and Bourbonnais.   I am proud to represent more than 40 cities and towns. It is no  secret that State and local revenues have plummeted due to COVID-19.  Yet, these dollars pay for critical government services like first  responders, trash collection, teachers, and public health workers; and  COVID-19 has shown us how truly indispensable they are.   The HEROES Act includes billions in Federal investments in our  States, cities, and towns, the places we call home.   Under the HEROES Act, Lansing, in my district, will receive more than  $13 million over the next 2 years; more than $18 million for Calumet  City, and nearly a half a million dollars for Chebanse. Think about  what those resources can do for our communities. Every cent pays for  our firefighters and teachers, health educators, and essential bus  drivers.    HEROES Act funds will ensure that our kids keep learning despite  COVID-19. It provides $90 billion to ensure schools can cover the cost  of the digital transition and that they will be safe and sanitary when  students return.   And finally, the HEROES Act prioritizes ensuring American families  can eat by increasing the maximum SNAP benefit.   After working to ensure the needs of Illinois families are addressed  in the HEROES Act, I know this bill is about America's heroes and our  families. That is why it came from the people's House.   The HEROES Act is not about the President or any one party; it is  about doing the right thing because American families are struggling.  Small businesses are on the edge of closing, and our communities are  struggling to pay our EMTs and firefighters, the very people we rely on  during this pandemic. My mayors have told me they will have to start  furloughing and laying people off.   The Senate must act. The ball is in Mitch McConnell's court. Do the  right thing. Do your job.   By the way, Mr. President, if you want to help Chicago, the Nation  needs safe gun reforms, investigations of illegal sales, more spending  on community-based outreach and development. We don't want Portland  repeated in Chicago.                            ____________________
