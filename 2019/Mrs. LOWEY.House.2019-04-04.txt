 Mr. Speaker, as a staunch supporter of the U.S.-Israel  relationship, I am disgusted by the Republicans' ongoing attempts to  politicize serious issues related to anti-semitism and support for the  U.S.-Israel partnership. The vast majority of members on both sides of  the aisle in this chamber oppose BDS. But that's not what this vote  today on the motion to recommit was really about.   What actually occurred here today was a political stunt to sink a  bill addressing the world's worst humanitarian crisis, which is why I  voted against the Motion to Recommit. Twenty four million--let me  repeat: 24 million--desperate Yemenis are in need of humanitarian  assistance.   Families are displaced. Children are starving. Lives are in imminent  danger.   But instead of working with Democrats to stop U.S. support for the  Saudi and Emirati coalition that is perpetuating this suffering,  Republicans politicized the U.S.-Israel relationship in a vote intended  to ensure this bill cannot pass in the Senate and reach the President's  desk.   We know it would kill the bill, of course, because the Senate already  rejected a similar measure attached to this bill the first time we  considered it. That measure sought unsuccessfully to create political  division among Democrats based on anti-semitism. It is particularly  heinous to politicize hate given the rise in all forms of bias-based  violence in recent years.   I have consistently worked to combat BDS and will partner with House  leadership to ensure that real legislation opposing this divisive  political movement is brought to the House floor. But I will not give  legitimacy to these Republican attempts to threaten bipartisan support  for the U.S.-Israel relationship and leave millions of men, women, and  children in danger of starvation and death.
