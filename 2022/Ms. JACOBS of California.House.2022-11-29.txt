 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 922) condemning the use of hunger  as a weapon of war and recognizing the effect of conflict on global  food security and famine, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 922         Whereas, in 2021, 193,000,000 people experienced crisis       levels of food insecurity, with nearly 139,000,000 people       living in environments where conflict was the main driver of       this crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened rising       global food insecurity;        Whereas conflict acutely impacts vulnerable populations       such as women and children, persons with disabilities,       refugees, and internally displaced persons;        Whereas armed conflict's impacts on food security can be       direct, such as displacement from land, destruction of       livestock grazing areas and fishing grounds, or destruction       of food stocks and agricultural assets, or indirect, such as       disruptions to food systems, leading to increased food       prices, including water and fuel, and the breakdown of a       government's ability to enforce regulations or perform its       judiciary functions;  [[Page H8630]]         Whereas aerial bombing campaigns targeting agricultural       heartlands, scorched earth methods of warfare, and the use of       landmines and other explosive devices have direct impacts on       the ability of vulnerable populations to feed themselves;        Whereas effective humanitarian response in armed conflict,       including in the threat of conflict-induced famine and food       insecurity in situations of armed conflict, requires respect       for international humanitarian law by all parties to the       conflict, and allowing and facilitating the rapid and       unimpeded movement of humanitarian relief to all those in       need;        Whereas efforts to restrict humanitarian aid and the       operational integrity and impartiality of humanitarian aid       works and distribution efforts, including through blockades,       security impediments, or irregular bureaucratic requirements       is another means by which combatants employ starvation and       food deprivation as a weapon of war; and        Whereas the United States Government has the tools to fight       global hunger, provide and protect lifesaving assistance, and       promote the prevention of conflict, including through the       Global Fragility Act of 2019 (title V of division J of Public       Law 116-94), the Global Food Security Act of 2016 (Public Law       114-195), and the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public       Law 115-334), and has the potential to hold accountable those       using hunger as a weapon in conflict through the Global       Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (subtitle F of       title XII of Public Law 114-328) and other means: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns--        (A) the use of starvation of civilians as a weapon of       warfare;        (B) the intentional and reckless destruction, removing,       looting, blocking, or rendering useless objects necessary for       food production and distribution such as farmland, markets,       mills, food processing and storage areas, such as ports and       hubs containing grain terminals, foodstuffs, crops,       livestock, agricultural assets, waterways, water systems,       drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation       works;        (C) the denial of humanitarian access and the deprivation       of objects indispensable to people's survival, such as food       supplies and nutrition resources; and        (D) the willful interruption of market systems to affected       populations in need in conflict environments by preventing       travel and manipulating currency exchange;        (2) calls on the United States Government to--        (A) prioritize diplomatic efforts to call out and address       instances where hunger and intentional deprivation of food is       being utilized as a weapon of war, including efforts to       ensure that security operations do not undermine livelihoods       of local populations to minimize civilian harm;        (B) continue efforts to address severe food insecurity       through humanitarian and development response efforts,       including in-kind food assistance, vouchers, and other       flexible modalities, and long-term programming focused on       agriculture support and resilient livelihoods;        (C) ensure existing interagency strategies, crisis response       efforts, and ongoing programs consider, integrate, and adapt       to address conflict by utilizing crisis modifiers in United       States Agency for International Development programming to       respond to rapid shocks and stress such as the willful       targeting of food systems; and        (D) ensure that the use of hunger as a weapon in conflict       is considered within the employment of tools to hold       individuals, governments, militias, or entities responsible       such as the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act       (22 U.S.C. 2656), where appropriate, and taking into       consideration the need for humanitarian exemptions and the       protection of lifesaving assistance.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Res. 922, as  amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 922 to condemn  the use of hunger as a weapon of war and recognize the effect of  conflict on global food security.   I thank Chair Meeks for his support and my colleagues,  Representatives Peter Meijer,   Bobby Rush, and Tracey Mann, for co- leading this with me.   Even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we have seen how climate  change, the pandemic, and conflict fuel food crises around the world in  Yemen, Syria, Ethiopia, and South Sudan, and now this war has  exacerbated all of these crises.   In Ukraine, Russia's unprovoked war has left one in three families  without enough food and disrupted critical supply chains in the country  and around the world.   But we also have to recognize that we shouldn't only sound the alarm  and mobilize aid and attention when and where humanitarian crises  affect people who look like us. Around the world, especially in some of  the poorest countries, millions of people are hungry and suffering as a  direct result of Putin's relentless crusade for power.   In the Horn of Africa, the combined effects of climate change,  conflict, and rising food prices from Russia's invasion of Ukraine have  all exacerbated the rising food crisis, with more than 37 million  people, including 7 million children, on the verge of famine as the  region endures the longest drought in more than 40 years.   Afghanistan continues to face an acute humanitarian crisis this  upcoming winter, where over 95 percent of the population cannot afford  to feed themselves or their families.   Haiti imports 70 percent of its food, mainly from Russia and Canada,  and is experiencing catastrophic hunger levels, with 4.7 million of the  population facing acute hunger.   In Ethiopia, over 20 million people in Tigray, Amhara, and Afar are  in dire need of humanitarian assistance and rely on wheat imports from  Ukraine and Russia.   In South Sudan, where I traveled earlier this year, 8.3 million  people are experiencing severe food insecurity, the most extreme level  of food insecurity in the country since it became independent in 2011.   But we have also seen the power of the U.N., diplomacy, and global  cooperation in alleviating this crisis. The historic Black Sea Grain  Initiative, which was recently extended, has facilitated the export of  millions of tons of agricultural exports from Ukraine's Black Sea  ports.   I commend Ukraine's new humanitarian initiative, Grain from Ukraine,  that came out of the first International Summit on Food Security. It  will ship grain to African countries most in need. Governments around  the world have already contributed $150 million, with hopefully more to  come.   The crisis in Ukraine has made clear why it is so important that we,  as a body, recognize the consequences of war on food security, condemn  starvation of civilians as a weapon of war, and call on the United  States Government--here in Congress and in the administration--to  continue addressing these crises and hold perpetrators accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to lead this important resolution today, and  I urge my colleagues to support it. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 922 is an important piece of legislation to put  this body on record as condemning the weaponization of hunger around  the world and the impact conflict has on global food security.   As the world works together to alleviate multiple crises, this  resolution serves as an important reminder of the cost of war and the  need to hold perpetrators of starvation accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me and support this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 744) condemning the Government of  Iran's state-sponsored persecution of its Baha'i minority and its  continued violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and  the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 744         Whereas in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996,       2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017,       2018, and 2020, Congress declared that it deplored the       religious persecution by the Government of Iran of the Baha'i       community and would hold the Government of Iran responsible       for upholding the rights of all Iranian nationals, including       members of the Baha'i faith;        Whereas since 1979, Iranian authorities have killed or       executed more than 200 Baha'i leaders, and more than 10,000       have been dismissed from government and university jobs;        Whereas the Baha'i International Community documented a       more than 50-percent increase in hate propaganda directed       against the Baha'is in the 12-month period ending in August       2020, compared to prior years, with more than 9,500 such       articles, videos, or web pages appearing in Iranian       government-controlled or government-sponsored media;        Whereas, on December 16, 2021, the United Nations General       Assembly adopted a resolution (A/C.3/76/L.28) criticizing       Iran for human rights abuses and calling on Iran to carry out       wide-ranging reforms, including--        (1) ``ceasing use of the death penalty and commuting the       sentences for child offenders on death row'';        (2) ``ensuring that no one is subjected to torture or other       cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment'';        (3) ``ceasing the widespread and systematic use of       arbitrary arrests and detention'';        (4) ``releasing persons detained for the exercise of their       human rights and fundamental freedoms'';        (5) ``improving conditions inside prisons'';        (6) ``eliminating discrimination against women and girls'';       and        (7) ``eliminating discrimination against ethnic,       linguistic, and other minorities'';        Whereas in the 2022 Annual Report of the United States       Commission on International Religious Freedom issued in April       2022, it is reported that the Government of Iran--        (1) ``arrested scores of Baha'is across Iran, many of whom       were held incommunicado or taken to undisclosed locations'';        (2) ``sent Ministry of Intelligence agents to search the       home of a Baha'i citizen and confiscated her belongings'';  [[Page H8632]]         (3) ``continued to deny university education to Baha'is on       account of their faith'';        (4) ``closed six Baha'i businesses'';        (5) ``demolished the homes of three Baha'is without       warning'';        (6) ``announced the auction of thirteen Baha'i farms''; and        (7) ``continued to deny Baha'is the right to bury their       deceased in empty plots at the Golestan Javid cemetery       outside Tehran which the community has used for decades.       Instead, Baha'is are being forced to use the Khaveran mass       grave site where victims of the 1988 prison massacres are       buried'';        Whereas the Iran section of the Department of State's 2021       Report on International Religious Freedom issued in June 2022       provides, in part--        (1) ``Security forces in Shiraz and Mazandaran Province       conducted multiple arrests of Baha'is in their homes or       workplaces in the last week of September without providing       reasons or charges.'';        (2) ``Authorities continued to confiscate Baha'i properties       as part of an ongoing state-led campaign of economic       persecution against Baha'is. Authorities issued an order in       April denying Baha'is permission to bury their dead in empty       plots at the Tehran-area cemetery designated for Baha'is,       forcing them to bury them at a mass grave site.'';        (3) ``Authorities reportedly continued to deny the Baha'i,       Sabean-Mandaean, and Yarsani religious communities, as well       as members of other unrecognized religious minority groups,       access to education and government employment unless they       declared themselves as belonging to one of the country's       recognized religions on their application forms.''; and        (4) ``Government officials continued to disseminate anti-      Baha'i and antisemitic messages using traditional and social       media.'';        Whereas, on July 4, 2022, the Baha'i International       Community noted ``The Iranian government's systematic       campaign to persecute the Baha'i religious minority       accelerated again this past week with the arrest, court       hearing or imprisonment of at least 18 more Baha'i citizens       across the country, bringing the June total to 44 people.       Hundreds of others, meanwhile, also await summonses to court       or to prison.'';        Whereas, on July 21, 2022, the Baha'i International       Community announced ``More than 20 Baha'is in Shiraz, Tehran,       Yazd and Bojnourd, have been arrested, jailed or subjected to       home searches and business closures since the beginning of       July. Last month 44 Baha'is were arrested, arraigned or       imprisoned, suggesting an escalating crisis in the Iranian       government's systematic campaign against the country's       largest non-Muslim religious minority. . .'';        Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations and a       signatory to both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights       and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,       among other international human rights treaties, without       reservation;        Whereas section 105 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions,       Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8514)       authorizes the President to impose sanctions on individuals       who are ``responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for       ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission       of serious human rights abuses against citizens of Iran or       their family members on or after June 12, 2009''; and        Whereas the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights       Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-158) amends and expands the       authorities established under the Comprehensive Iran       Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public       Law 111-195) to sanction Iranian human rights abusers: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the Government of Iran's state-sponsored       persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued       violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)       and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights       (ICCPR);        (2) calls on the Government of Iran--        (A) to immediately release the imprisoned or detained       Baha'is and all other prisoners held solely on account of       their religion;        (B) to end its state-sponsored campaign of hate propaganda       against the Baha'is; and        (C) to reverse state-imposed policies denying Baha'is and       members of other religious minorities equal opportunities to       higher education, earning a livelihood, due process under the       law, and the free exercise of religious practices;        (3) calls on the President and the Secretary of State, in       cooperation with responsible nations, to immediately condemn       the Government of Iran's continued violation of human rights,       and demand the immediate release of prisoners held solely on       account of their religion; and        (4) urges the President and the Secretary of State to       utilize available authorities to impose sanctions on       officials of the Government of Iran and other individuals       directly responsible for serious human rights abuses,       including abuses against the Baha'i community of Iran.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Res. 744, as  amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 744.   I thank Ted Deutch, an esteemed former Member of this House and the  former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Middle East,  North Africa, and Global Counterterrorism Subcommittee, for  reintroducing this important legislation that has passed the House  multiple times.   I know that every member of our committee hopes the Iranian  Government will immediately cease the abuse of its own people and  specifically end its longtime persecution of the Baha'i people.   The last several years have been especially difficult for Iran's  Baha'i community, as the regime in Tehran has ramped up its persecution  of the community.   The resolution before us today calls on the Iranian Government to  release all Baha'i prisoners, end its campaign of state-sponsored  persecution, and stop discriminatory policies against the Baha'i  community.   As many of us know, those who practice the Baha'i faith have been  persecuted in Iran since the religion's founding but have suffered the  most acute harassment since the Iranian revolution in 1979.   Hundreds of Baha'is have been executed and tortured. To this day,  Iran denies Baha'is access to higher education, government jobs, and  permits to work in 25 professions, and Iran subjects them to arbitrary  harassment, arrest, and imprisonment.   Mr. Speaker, it is long past time for this religious persecution to  end, so I strongly urge all Members to vote in support of this critical  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, the Baha'i people of Iran have suffered enough at the  hands of Iran's regime since the revolution. The brutality of Iran's  Government has unfortunately been on display now for weeks for the  entire world to see.   This body will always defend human rights in Iran and around the  world, and we stand in solidarity with the people of Iran who are  calling for justice, dignity, and respect. Women, Life, Freedom.  [[Page H8633]]    Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me and support this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 4785) to support the human rights of Uyghurs  and members of other minority groups residing in the Xinjiang Uyghur  Autonomous Region and safeguard their distinct identity, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4785         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Uyghur Policy Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The People's Republic of China (PRC) continues to       repress the distinct Islamic, Turkic identity of Uyghurs and       members of other minority groups of the Xinjiang Uyghur       Autonomous Region (XUAR) in northwestern China and other       areas of their habitual residence.        (2) Uyghurs, and other predominantly Muslim ethnic       minorities historically making up the majority of the XUAR       population, have maintained throughout their history a       distinct religious and cultural identity.        (3) Human rights, including freedom of religion or belief,       and respect for the Uyghurs' unique Muslim identity are       legitimate interests of the international community.        (4) The People's Republic of China has ratified the       International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural       Rights and is thereby bound by its provisions. The PRC has       also signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political       Rights. Article One of both covenants state that all peoples       have the right to self-determination.        (5) An official campaign to encourage Han Chinese migration       into the XUAR has placed immense pressure on those who seek       to preserve the ethnic, cultural, religious, and linguistic       traditions of the Uyghur people. Chinese authorities have       supported an influx of Han Chinese economic immigrants into       the XUAR, implemented discrimination against Uyghurs in       hiring practices, and provided unequal access to healthcare       services.        (6) The authorities of the People's Republic of China have       manipulated the strategic objectives of the international war       on terror to mask their increasing cultural and religious       oppression of the Muslim population residing in the XUAR.        (7) Following unrest in the region, in 2014, Chinese       authorities launched their ``Strike Hard against Violent       Extremism'' campaign, in which dubious allegations of       widespread extremist activity were used as justification for       gross human rights violations committed against members of       the Uyghur community in the XUAR.        (8) PRC authorities have made use of the legal system as a       tool of repression, including for the imposition of arbitrary       detentions and for torture against members of the Uyghur       community and other populations.        (9) Uyghurs and Kazakhs who have secured citizenship or       permanent residency outside of the PRC have attested to       repeated threats, harassment, and surveillance by PRC       officials.        (10) Reporting from international news organizations has       found that over the past decade, family members of Uyghurs       living outside of the PRC have gone missing or been detained       to force Uyghur expatriates to return to the PRC or silence       their dissent.        (11) Credible evidence from human rights organizations,       think tanks, and journalists confirms that more than       1,000,000 Uyghurs and members of other Muslim ethnic minority       groups have been imprisoned in ``political reeducation''       centers.        (12) Independent accounts from former detainees of       ``political reeducation'' centers describe inhumane       conditions and treatment including forced political       indoctrination, torture, beatings, rape, forced       sterilization, and food deprivation. Former detainees also       confirmed that they were told by guards the only way to       secure release was to demonstrate sufficient political       loyalty to the PRC Government and the Chinese Communist       Party.        (13) Popular discourse surrounding the ongoing atrocities       in the XUAR and advocacy efforts to assist Uyghurs remains       muted in most Muslim majority nations around the world.        (14) Both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Former       Secretary of State Michael Pompeo have stated that the PRC       government has committed genocide and crimes  [[Page H8634]]       against humanity against Uyghurs and other ethnic and       religious minorities in the XUAR.        (15) Government bodies of multiple nations have also       declared that PRC government atrocities against such       populations in the XUAR constitute genocide, including the       parliaments of the United Kingdom, Belgium, Czechia,       Lithuania, the Netherlands, and Canada.       SEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.         Congress--        (1) calls upon the Government of the People's Republic of       China to open the XUAR to regular, transparent, and       unmanipulated visits by members of the press, Members of       Congress, congressional staff delegations, the United States       Special Coordinator for Uyghur Issues under section 4, and       members and staff of the Congressional-Executive Commission       on the People's Republic of China;        (2) calls upon the Government of the People's Republic of       China to recognize, and seek to ensure the preservation of,       the distinct ethnic, cultural, religious, and linguistic       identity of Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious       minority groups in the XUAR;        (3) calls upon the Government of the People's Republic of       China to cease all government-sponsored crackdowns,       imprisonments, and detentions of people throughout the XUAR       aimed at those involved in the peaceful expression of their       ethnic, cultural, political, or religious identity;        (4) commends countries that have provided shelter and       hospitality to Uyghurs in exile, including Turkey, Albania,       and Germany; and        (5) urges countries with sizeable Muslim populations, given       commonalities in their religious and cultural identities, to       demonstrate concern over the plight of Uyghurs.       SEC. 4. UNITED STATES SPECIAL COORDINATOR FOR UYGHUR ISSUES.         (a) In General.--There is authorized to be within the       Department of State a United States Special Coordinator for       Uyghur Issues (in this section referred to as the ``Special       Coordinator''), to be designated by the Secretary of State in       accordance with subsection (b).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4785.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4785, the Uyghur Policy  Act of 2021, sponsored by my committee colleague, Representative Young  Kim.  [[Page H8635]]    The world has watched in horror as the People's Republic of China has  continued its genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and  members of other religious and ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang  region.   The size and scale of the PRC's human rights abuses is horrific. As  many as 1.8 million people have been arbitrarily detained in mass  internment camps, prisons, and detention centers. They have shown no  limits to their cruelty and depravity--subjecting people to forced  labor, torture, political indoctrination, suppression of religious  practices, forced sterilizations and abortions, family separation,  sexual abuse, and so much more.   While we have seen graphic images and heard testimony revealing the  truth of these camps, the PRC continues to hide behind disinformation.   We know that the PRC is actively trying to stamp out the unique  ethnic, cultural, religious, and linguistic traditions of minorities in  the Xinjiang region.   Despite outrage from the global community, these gross atrocities  have only increased in their severity and cruelty.   Evidence collected from journalists, human rights defenders, and  scholars, as well as harrowing firsthand accounts from survivors and  their families, point to the continued oppression of Uyghurs and  Muslims.   During this Congress, this body has taken multiple steps to condemn  these atrocities and hold the PRC accountable for perpetrating these  heinous crimes. But we need to do more to protect the millions of  Uyghurs and their way of life.   By passing this important bipartisan legislation, we would strengthen  U.S. Government efforts to protect and promote the distinct ethnic,  religious, cultural, and linguistic identity of the Uyghur people.   This legislation furthers a whole-of-government approach to combat  the PRC's egregious human rights violations. It also takes steps to  bolster international support towards promoting greater respect for  human rights in the Xinjiang region.   Most importantly, this legislation signals that the U.S. Congress  unequivocally stands with the Uyghur people and will continue speaking  out until this genocide and crimes against humanity ends.   I thank Representative Kim for authoring this important bipartisan  legislation, which I was proud to vote for in the Foreign Affairs  committee.   I support swift passage of this timely and urgent bill, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of  the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, passing H.R. 4785, the Uyghur Policy Act of 2021, would  send a message loud and clear that the PRC's inhumane policies to  dilute and destroy the identity of the Uyghur people have no place in  today's world.   The United States stands firmly with the Uyghur people and we will  continue pushing to end the PRC's horrific and inhumane behavior.   We need to show strong bipartisan House support to the administration  to use its tools to help protect the Uyghur culture and identity and  promote respect for human rights and religious freedom of Uyghurs and  members of other minority groups in China.   The House also stands in strong solidarity with the Chinese people  protesting all over China in recent days.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise to recognize my friend, mentor, and  predecessor, Congresswoman Susan Davis, and her decades of public  service to Rolando and the San Diego community.   From serving on the San Diego Unified Board of Education to the  California State Assembly to the Halls of Congress, Congresswoman Davis  worked tirelessly to advocate and deliver for her constituents.   As chairwoman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Military  Personnel, she championed our servicemembers, leading the repeal of the  discriminatory Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, increasing military pay  and benefits, expanding access to mental health care, and shining a  light on military sexual assault. She didn't forget about military  families. She fought to ensure they had housing that was safe and  affordable and quality healthcare.   Everyone who knows Susan knows that she doesn't give up. Term after  term, she re-introduced legislation to expand women's access to  healthcare. Because of her unwavering dedication, women across the  country no longer need prior approval or a referral to receive OB/GYN  care. For young women like me, that is essential because for years, my  OB/GYN was the only doctor I saw.   Susan cared so deeply about our Nation's children and introduced many  bills to protect children and ensure they have every door open to them,  so they have a successful, thriving future.   She pushed to address child hunger, expand access to childcare and  early learning opportunities, and strengthened our education programs.  Through her work on the Education and Labor Committee, she advocated  for more registered apprenticeships and for making college more  affordable and accessible.   For me, Susan has been one of my biggest cheerleaders. When I wasn't  sure I was ready to run for Congress, she called me every day to  convince me that I was. She has always strived to bring more people to  the leadership table and make way for people with new voices and  experiences to lead.   For all these reasons and so many more, I am proud to honor  Congresswoman Susan Davis' decades of service to the Rolando community  and all of San Diego by naming the Rolando post office after her.   I am so grateful to have the support of all of my California  colleagues and many more who served with Susan. This is the culmination  of a community-led effort, powered by the people of Rolando and Council  President Sean Elo-Rivera's office.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Davis for all she has done for San  Diego and all she continues to do. Her kindness, selflessness,  leadership, and service continue to be an inspiration to all of us.
