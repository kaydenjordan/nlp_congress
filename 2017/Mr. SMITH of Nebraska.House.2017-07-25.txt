 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Arrington for  yielding. It is great to join him and others here this evening to  really celebrate rural America.   A lot happens in rural America. Oftentimes, it kind of flies under  the radar. That is okay. That is generally the way rural Americans like  it. It is interesting. As I represent the 75 counties of Nebraska's  Third District, it is part of two different time zones and just a  diverse perspective there of many different Nebraskans.   I would say that anecdotally, at least, the most common request among  my constituents is to be left alone. And it is interesting that when we  talk about policies like waters of the U.S. or various--healthcare,  interestingly, you know, a lot of promises were made there that haven't  panned out, and so I am grateful that I can represent so many  Nebraskans who are focused on solutions, and I seek to really reflect  their ideas as solutions here in Washington.   Obviously, there is a lot happening now. I would say all too much or  all too often there is so much bickering that we can't get to the  solutions that we know will help the American people.   I am proud to represent the top producing agriculture district in the  country, and of course, with 75 counties, we have a lot of production,  whether it is livestock, whether it is row crops. I am happy to have  helped start the Modern Agriculture Caucus, and I am grateful for  colleagues participating in this effort to focus on new ways of doing  things in terms of agriculture.   We know that, obviously, agriculture has been around a long time, and  things change. Resources can change oftentimes, but I am glad that we  can focus on new ways of doing things that we know are good for the  environment. We conserve resources, natural resources and others, as we  focus on research that has led to increased yields for our crops so  that we can help feed the world.   We know that many countries around the world look to America as  leaders in agriculture, especially production agriculture, and so I am  glad to help reflect to those successes, help celebrate those  successes.   Who would have thought that not so long ago, who would have thought  that today, we can have record yields amidst a drought. That not only  helps producers, that helps consumers, and that literally helps every  person around the world.   And America is a big country, we know that, and oftentimes there  seems to be somewhat of a disconnect between rural America and urban  America.   Interestingly, I like to share this story. There was a very well- meaning civil servant who visited rural Nebraska a while back, and we  were touring part of Nebraska. We turned onto a gravel road, and this  well-meaning individual said it had been about 20 years since he  traveled on a gravel road.   I don't think there was any intended disrespect at all, but certainly  a difference of perspective. And so here we are, literally raising the  awareness of all of America in terms of what we can do in rural America  as we do focus on helping feed the world, helping feed America,  certainly, but applying biotechnology out across the fields and across  the prairies of rural America.   And when it comes to trade, we know that we are good at producing  agriculture products. We want to sell our products around the world,  especially when 96 percent of these customers reside outside our  country. So that is why I hope that we can focus on trade policies  moving forward so that we can bring some prosperity to the home front  amidst a struggling ag economy.   Let us be honest about that. Crop prices are not what they were, but  property taxes are still high, input costs are still high, and we want  to do what we can to bring stronger market prices to agriculture.                                time  1815    That is why we want to and we need to focus on the global economy  that is so important.   I am grateful to have the opportunity to stand here and really  celebrate rural America, as we do have so many of the solutions that  our country needs right now.
