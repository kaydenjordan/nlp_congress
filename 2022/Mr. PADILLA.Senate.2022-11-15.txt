 Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by title for  a second time.   The bill clerk read as follows:         A bill (H.R. 8987) to amend the Justice for United States       Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act to authorize       appropriations for catch-up payments from the United States       Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.     In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.   The bill will be placed on the calendar.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
