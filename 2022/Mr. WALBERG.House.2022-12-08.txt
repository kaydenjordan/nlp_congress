 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to what I believe is  the inappropriately named Respect for Marriage Act because if what my  colleagues have just said were actually all that was here, it would be  a different story to some degree. But that is not what we are talking  about.   The bill betrays our country's commitment to the fundamental right of  religious liberty by depriving religious and faith-based organizations  of their tax-exempt status and depriving individual people of faith of  being able to carry out fully their faith without repercussions.  Licenses and government contracts are also put at risk here with this  legislation.   As a result, religiously affiliated and faith-based organizations  will be at risk of being compelled to make hiring decisions in  contradiction to their tenets. And I am not just talking about  Christian religions. We are talking about all that are impacted by  this.   It puts us at risk for Catholic Charities' ability to find foster and  adoptive homes for children in need; or a gospel rescue mission's  ability to serve the homeless; and it would likely be the end of the  school choice initiatives that rely on religious schools--schools of  faith--to serve at-risk children trapped in failing schools.  Additionally, businessowners across the country who conduct their  businesses based on their sincerely held faith, beliefs, and principles  would be subject to lawsuits simply because they have a traditional  view of marriage.   Again, if all that my colleagues have just even recently said were  the only thing about this legislation, it would be another story; but  it isn't, it goes way beyond. A deep appreciation for and commitment  to following science in the positive endeavor of continuing the human  race is important.    Mr. Speaker, I ask for opposition to this legislation and a more  thoughtful approach.    Mr. Speaker, we learned this morning of a prisoner swap  with the Kremlin: basketball star Brittney Griner for the merchant of  death, Viktor Bout.   Left behind once again by this administration was Michigander Paul  Whelan.   While we rejoice with the Griner family, Paul's parents, constituents  in my district, will soon have their fourth Christmas without their  son.   Paul's family is doing their best to stay upbeat and is genuinely  happy for the Griner family, as we all are. But it is hard to fathom  the magnitude of disappointment with this latest lopsided swap.   We are keeping the Whelans in our prayers, just as we are keeping up  the pressure. For years now, I have spoken about Paul's wrongful  imprisonment on this floor. I was hoping the next time would be to  celebrate his release. Sadly, it is not.   Today, once again, it is time for Paul Whelan to come home.                            ____________________
