 Reserving the right to object, this endeavor started with a  resolution that the majority put forward that was intended to be a  bipartisan resolution commemorating the life and service of Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg. That follows the bipartisan tradition this body  has followed in commemorating Justices when they have passed.    Unfortunately, the Democratic leader has put forth an amendment to  turn that bipartisan resolution into a partisan resolution.  Specifically, the Democratic leader wants to add a statement that  Justice Ginsburg's position should not be filled until a new President  is installed, purportedly based on a comment made to family members  shortly before she passed.   That, of course, is not the standard. Under the Constitution, members  of the Judiciary do not appoint their own successors. No article III  judge has the authority to appoint his or her own successor. Rather,  judicial nominations are made by the President of the United States,  and confirmations are made by this body, the U.S. Senate.   I would note that Justice Ginsburg was someone whom I knew  personally. I argued nine times before Justice Ginsburg at the Supreme  Court. She led an extraordinary life. She was one of the finest Supreme  Court litigators to have ever practiced. She served 27 years on the  Court, leaving a profound legacy. Justice Ginsburg understood full well  that the position being put forth by the Democratic leader is not the  law and is not the Constitution. Indeed, I will quote what Justice  Ginsburg said just 4 years ago.   Reported in the Washington Post on September 7, 2016, Justice  Ginsburg is reported to have said:         The president is elected for four years not three years, so       the power he has in year three continues into year four.       Maybe members of the Senate will wake up and appreciate that       that's how it should be.    Now, of course, when Justice Ginsburg said that, that was when  President Obama had made the nomination of Merrick Garland to the  Supreme Court, and the Senate had declined to consider that nomination.  Without even a hint of irony, every Democrat who is now screaming from  the ramparts that we cannot consider a vacancy on the Court during this  election year was screaming equally as loudly from the ramparts that we  must consider a nomination during a Presidential election year just 4  years ago.   Joe Biden vociferously called for the Senate to consider that  nomination. Barack Obama called for the Senate to consider that  nomination. Hillary Clinton called for the Senate to consider that  nomination. The Democratic leader said the Senate was not doing its job  if we didn't consider that nomination. To my knowledge, every  Democratic Member of this body, likewise, decried the decision not to  take up that nomination and insisted the Senate was not doing its job.   Well, today, obviously, the situation has changed, whereby all of  those Democratic Members who demanded the Senate take up a nomination  to the Supreme Court are now demanding the Senate not take up a  nomination to the Supreme Court.   To be sure, the Republican majority that declined to consider that  nomination is now going to take up President Trump's nomination to this  vacancy, but I would note the circumstances are markedly different, and  history and more than two centuries of precedent are on the side of  what this Senate will do.   The question of whether a President should nominate a Supreme Court  Justice to fill a vacancy that occurred during a Presidential election  year has occurred 29 times in our Nation's history. This is not new--29  times. Of those 29 times, Presidents of both parties, Democrats and  Republicans, have nominated Justices 29 times. Every single time there  has been a vacancy during a Presidential year, a President has  nominated a Justice to that vacancy. Of the 44 individuals who served  as President of the United States, 22 have done so. Fully one half of  the Presidents who have ever served this country have made Supreme  Court nominations during Presidential election years.   So what is the difference?   Well, there is a sharp difference in our Nation's history depending  upon whether the Senate is controlled by the same party as the  President or a different party from the President. So, of the 29 times  in history, in 19 of those times, the Senate and the Presidency were  controlled by the same party. When that happened, the Senate took up  and confirmed those nominees 17 of the 19 times.   Do you want to ask what history shows this body does when the  President and the Senate are of the same party and a nomination is made  during a Presidential election year? This body takes up that nomination  and, assuming a qualified nominee, confirms that nominee.   On the other hand, what happens when the President and the Senate are  of different parties? Well, that has happened 10 times in our Nation's  history. In all 10 times, the President has made a nomination, but in  those circumstances, the Senate has confirmed those nominees only  twice, and 2016 was one of those examples.   Now, the Democratic leader gave a passionate speech, which I know he  believes, about what kind of Justice he would like to see on the Court.  Democratic Members of this body have long championed judicial activists  who would embrace a view of the Constitution that, I believe, would do  serious damage to the constitutional liberties of the American people.   The interesting thing about the Democratic leader's speech is that  the argument was presented to the voters, and the voters disagreed. In  2016, Hillary Clinton promised to nominate Justices just like the kind  the Democratic  [[Page S5742]]  leader said he wanted to see, and President Trump promised to nominate  Justices ``in the mold of Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas.'' The  American people had that issue squarely before them, and the voters  chose that we wanted constitutionalist judges nominated to the Supreme  Court. It was not only regarding the Presidential election but the  Senate majority. The American people voted for a Republican majority in  the Senate in 2014. The American people voted for a Republican majority  again in 2016, and, in 2018, the American people grew our majority.   In all three of those elections, the question that the Democratic  leader has put forward was directly before the voters. What kind of  Justices do you want? The voters clearly decided and had given a  mandate.   The President has said he is going to nominate a Justice this week.  That is the right thing to do. This body, I believe, will take up, will  consider, that nomination on the merits, and I believe we will confirm  that nominee before election day. That is consistent with over 200  years of Senate precedent from both parties.   There is, however, something that the Democratic leaders and  Democratic Members of this body are threatening that is not consistent  with history or precedent or a respect for the Constitution, and that  is, namely, a threat to pack the Supreme Court. We have heard multiple  Democrats say that, if the Senate confirms this nominee and the  Democrats take the majority next year, they will try to add two or  four--or who knows how many--Justices to the Supreme Court. Well, you  know, there was another Democratic President who tried to do that--FDR.  Even though he had a supermajority, the Democratic Congress rejected  his efforts as an effort to politicize the Supreme Court.    Since the Democratic leader believes we should follow the wishes of  Justice Ginsburg, I think it is worth reflecting on what Justice  Ginsburg said about this. She was asked about this in an interview with  NPR, and her statement was as follows:         Nine seems to be a good number. It's been that way for a       long time. I think it was a bad idea when President Franklin       Roosevelt tried to pack the court.    Well, unfortunately, it seems the Democratic leader and Democratic  Senators are repeating the partisan mistakes of their predecessors in  threatening the Court and threatening to pack the Court, which would be  truly a radical and bad idea, as Justice Ginsburg explained.   Accordingly, what I am going to do is propose modifying the  Democratic leader's resolution to delete his call that we leave this  vacancy open, that we leave the Court with just eight Justices, which  opens up the possibility of a 4-to-4 tie, not able to resolve a  contested election, and leaving this country for weeks and months in  chaos if we have a contested election in November. Instead, let's  replace in the resolution the quote from Justice Ginsburg that packing  the Court is a bad idea and have the Senate agree that packing the  Court is a bad idea.   I am confident that, when I ask the Democratic leader, he is going to  reject this because we are, sadly, seeing one side of the aisle embrace  more and more dangerous and radical proposals, including trying to use  brute political force to politicize the Court. That is neither  consistent with the Constitution nor is it consistent with two  centuries of this body's precedent.   Accordingly, I ask that the Senator modify his request and, instead,  take up my resolution at the desk. I further ask that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    I object.
