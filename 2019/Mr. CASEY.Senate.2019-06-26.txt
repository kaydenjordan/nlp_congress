 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about the  horrific humanitarian crisis at our southern border--the inhumane and  truly despicable conditions under which migrants, including children,  are being held by the U.S. Government. Children are being held for  prolonged periods of time in facilities that are woefully inadequate,  and that is an understatement.   On my left is a chart with some pictures. I want to walk through each  of these pictures to talk about these children by name. Since September  of 2018, these children have died while in United States Government  custody.   I will start at the lower right-hand corner of the chart as you are  facing the chart: Carlos Hernandez Vasquez, 16 years old; up here on  the left top of the chart, Wilmer Josue Ramirez Vasquez, 2 years old;  Darlyn Cristabel Cordova-Valle, age 10; Juan de Leon Gutierrez, right  here on the other side of the chart, just 16 years old; Jakelin Caal  Maquin--many know her name from the time when she passed away--just 7  years old; and finally, Felipe Gomez Alonzo, just 8 years old.   These six deaths occurred in the span of less than 1 year and are the  first deaths in at least a decade. Mourning their deaths is not enough.  I think we can at least agree on that. As much as anyone can mourn  their deaths, that is not enough. We must act in light of this terrible  darkness that these children experienced and that their families are  living with and that our country is experiencing as well.   In recent weeks we have heard some of the reporting. There have been  reports of children held without adequate medical attention, without  food or water or sanitation.   Just by way of one searing example, Warren Binford, a law professor  at Willamette University, who spoke with children at the Texas  facility, said:         Basically, what we saw are dirty children who are       malnourished, who are severely neglected. They are being kept       in inhumane conditions. They are essentially being       warehoused, as many as 300 children in a cell, with almost no       adult supervision.    This is a lawyer who is trained to understand and to explain these  kinds of conditions. This isn't some casual observer. This is an expert  in her field who is telling us this. She is not a Member of Congress.  She is not an employee of the U.S. Government. She is a lawyer who saw  this with her own  [[Page S4554]]  eyes--children who are malnourished, neglected, living in inhumane  conditions, warehoused, with 300 children in a cell with no adult  supervision.   This same law professor reported witnessing a 14-year-old--a 14-year- old--caring for a 2-year-old without a diaper, lack of medical care,  with flu outbreaks and lice infestation.   Law Professor Binford said:         It's the worst conditions I have ever witnessed in several       years of doing these inspections.    That is what a trained professional is telling us about what is  happening in these conditions.   A Senate colleague of mine talked about going into a facility where  children were housed. This is a Senator with a lot of experience in the  Senate. He said, usually when you walk through any kind of facility or  any kind of environment in the United States of America where children  are, you can hear them laughing and playing and having fun--that  beautiful noise of children playing. He said you couldn't hear any of  it. He talked about the eerie and disturbing quiet in that place. There  was no noise, no laughing, no happiness, I guess, is probably the best  way he described it.   Then this one Senator talked about making eye contact with a child.  As soon as he or she made eye contact, the child would turn away.   I am sure we have other examples from colleagues here and in the  House and within our government, but when a law professor who has been  in a lot of these circumstances tells us this, we should listen, and we  should act.   Another lawyer reported speaking with young mothers and children--all  of whom were claiming asylum at a Texas facility. The mother reported a  lack of proper medical care, or clean clothes, or sufficient cups or  baby bottles, forcing reuse and sharing of those same cups and bottles,  as well as mothers wiping their children's runny noses or vomit with  their own clothes because they have nothing else--not even a paper  towel--to clean with when they are experiencing these conditions. This  particular lawyer was quoted in the Texas Tribune, just in case anyone  wants a source.   These reports of overcrowding and lack of medical care, sanitation  problems, and lack of food or water are an abomination. This is not  America. It is not the America we grew up with. It is not the America  we tell the world we are. We have told the world for generations that  we care about each other; that we welcome people to our shores and try  to treat them fairly. We can't say that when we have these kinds of  insults.   Just imagine the fear a child experiences in these circumstances--the  fear that comes from being alone, the fear of not having their mother  or their father or some loved one nearby, in many circumstances. Some,  I guess, might have an older sibling with them, but just imagine how  frightened they are. Then, to compound that, they don't have basic  necessities. I can't even imagine the fear.   There is a great hymn in my faith that talks about being a servant. I  will not go through all the lyrics. The song is named ``The Servant  Song.'' I will take the sacredness out of it for purposes of where we  are speaking today. One of the lines of ``The Servant Song'' says: ``I  will hold the . . . light for you in the night time of your fear.''   I can't imagine any other circumstance that anyone here could  describe to better fit that description--in the night time of the fear  of children who may have survived, but others, as this chart depicts,  lost their lives because of failures of our government. A 2-year-old, a  10-year-old, a 7-year-old, a 16-year-old, an 8-year-old, and another  16-year-old who were in government custody of the United States of  America lost their lives. I can't even begin to imagine that fear.   We all have to ask ourselves a lot of questions, but one question we  have to ask ourselves in both Houses of Congress and the administration  is, Will this government be there in the night time of the fear  experienced by these children or not? It is readily apparent, from all  the reporting month after month, that we are in no way meeting that  test for too many children. Maybe some are in better conditions, but  there are a lot of children--I don't even know the number. I hope it is  only in the hundreds, but many people believe it is a lot more than  that. There may be thousands or more who are in the night time of their  fear.   Our government is not only part of creating the fear, we are doing  next to nothing to alleviate it. We should ask ourselves, will we be  there for them in the night time of their fear?   The administration's response to all of the reporting of this horror  has been an insult to the United States of America. It is an insult to  the taxpayers who send money to the government and say: Make sure that  when a child comes to our borders, we treat them humanely; make sure  the system works. It is an insult to our values, of course.   It is an insult to the proclamations we make as Americans to the  world that we are a beacon of light for the world in so many ways.  Thank goodness we are in some other facets of our government and of  course the lives of our people. On this issue, we are bringing darkness  not only to the lives of those children, but we are bringing darkness  to the world.   We are less safe as a country when this happens. We empower people  around the world--very bad actors around the world--who have been  perpetuating this narrative for generations that America allows this to  happen. When you do that, you empower the bad guys to recruit and to  marshal their forces against you. When you treat children this way, who  then lose their lives in government custody, we are less safe. It hurts  our national security. It doesn't just undermine our values. It is not  just immoral. It makes us less safe. It is a national security threat  as much as it is an insult to our values or at least the values we  claim to have as a government in the executive and legislative  branches.   This administration has sought to increase family detention. They  sought to relax the standards under which children are held. The  administration recently canceled English classes, recreational  programs, and legal aid for unaccompanied minors at shelters across the  country.   Recently, an attorney for the Department of Justice argued that the  government should not be required to give a detained migrant child--or  in this case children--toothbrushes, or soap, or towels, or showers,  and probably goes on from there. It is hard to comprehend how insulting  that is to our values; how cruel and inhumane that is. If our  government can't provide that to a child, how can we call ourselves a  government? How can we say we have the values that we claim to have as  a government? This person was a lawyer for the U.S. Government from the  U.S. Department of Justice. A lawyer said that, not some low-level  employee of some department in the Federal Government. A lawyer in a  courtroom said our government shouldn't have to provide toothbrushes or  soap or towels.   We should not be relaxing standards when, according to the American  Academy of Pediatrics, the Department of Homeland Security facilities  already don't meet the basic standards for care of children in  residential settings. Moreover, the Academy of Pediatrics stated that  detention itself, even for short periods of time, can cause  psychological trauma and induce long-term mental health risks for  children.   I made this point to the administration months ago; that when you are  setting up your protocols about how to deal with a child, please  consult with the American Academy of Pediatrics--which is probably the  leading organization in the whole country--about how best to care for a  child and what not to do. I think we should listen to them, and I hope  the administration would not only be listening to the American Academy  of Pediatrics but would be incorporating their expertise and protocols.   Conditions for migrant adults are also completely unacceptable and an  insult to our values. Last month, the Department of Homeland Security  Office of the Inspector General issued a report. This isn't just a  routine report. I will read the headline: ``Management Alert--DHS Needs  to Address Dangerous Overcrowding Among Single Adults at El Paso Del  Norte Processing Center.'' This is a management alert sent by one part  of the government--not just the executive branch but one department to  the other--the inspector  [[Page S4555]]  general to the management of the Department of Homeland Security. That  is how bad it is.   I will read just one line on page 9 of the report:         Recommendations.        We recommend the Acting Secretary of DHS:         1. Take immediate steps to alleviate the overcrowding at       the El Paso Del Norte Bridge Processing Center.    They didn't say work on it for a couple of months and try to get  something done. Their own inspector general is saying take immediate  steps.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have at least the body of  this report, if not the attachment, printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Management Alert--DHS Needs to Address Dangerous Overcrowding Among      Single Adults at El Paso Del Norte Processing Center (Redacted)                                 May 30, 2019       Memorandum for: The Honorable Kevin K. McAleenan, Acting           Secretary, Department of Homeland Security.      From: John V. Kelly, Acting Inspector General.      Subject: Management Alert--DHS Needs to Address Dangerous           Overcrowding Among Single Adults at El Paso Del Norte           Processing Center.        For your action is our final management alert, Management       Alert--DHS Needs to Address Dangerous Overcrowding Among       Single Adults at El Paso Del Norte Processing Center, the       purpose of which is to notify you of urgent issues that       require immediate attention and action. Specifically, we are       recommending that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)       take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding at       the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center (PDT). Issuance of       this management alert is consistent with our duties under the       Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, to conduct       inspections and recommend policies to promote economy,       efficiency, and effectiveness in DHS programs and operations.        We have incorporated the formal comments provided by your       office on the draft management alert and appended them       verbatim. Your office concurred with the recommendation we       made to alleviate overcrowding at PDT, but gave a target       completion date of November 30, 2020. Because DHS's       corrective action is critical to the immediate health and       safety needs of detainees, who cannot continue to be held in       standing-room-only conditions for weeks until additional       tents are constructed, we consider the recommendation open       and unresolved. We will continue our spot inspections of the       southern border facilities and may revisit El Paso sector       sites to monitor overcrowding.        Consistent with our responsibility under the Inspector       General Act, we will provide copies of our alert to       congressional committees with oversight and appropriation       responsibility over DHS. We also will post the alert on our       website for public dissemination.        Please call me with any questions, or your staff may       contact Diana Shaw, Assistant Inspector General for Special       Reviews and Evaluations, at (202) 981-6000.                                  background         In May 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and       Border Patrol leadership jointly testified before Congress       that they are experiencing an unprecedented border security       and humanitarian crisis along the southwest border. According       to CBP statistics, the number of southwest border migrant       apprehensions during the first seven months of FY 2019 has in       general already surpassed that of the total apprehensions for       each of the previous four fiscal years. At the sector level,       El Paso has experienced the sharpest increase in       apprehensions when comparing the first seven months of FY       2019 to the same period in FY 2018. Table 1 shows the total       number of apprehensions by category and the percent increase       for the El Paso sector.

We reviewed compliance with CBP's Transport, Escort,       Detention and Search (TEDS) standards, which govern CBP's       interaction with detained individuals, and observed dangerous       holding conditions at the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center       (PDT) Border Patrol processing facility, located at the Paso       Del Norte Bridge, that require immediate attention.       Specifically, PDT does not have the capacity to hold the       hundreds currently in custody safely, and has held the       majority of its detainees longer than the 72 hours generally       permitted under the TEDS standards (TEDS 4.1).   Overcrowding and Prolonged Detention at the PDT Border Patrol Facility                  Puts Detainees and DHS Personnel at Risk         According to PDT Border Patrol processing facility staff,       the facility's maximum capacity is 125 detainees. However, on       May 7 and 8, 2019, Border Patrol's custody logs indicated       that there were approximately 750 and 900 detainees on site,       respectively. TEDS standards provide that ``under no       circumstances should the maximum [cell] occupancy rate, as       set by the fire marshal, be exceeded'' (TEDS 4.7). However,       we observed dangerous overcrowding at the facility with       single adults held in cells designed for one-fifth as many       detainees. Specifically, we observed:        a cell with a maximum capacity of 12 held 76 detainees;        a cell with a maximum capacity of 8 held 41 detainees; and        a cell with a maximum capacity of 35 held 155 detainees.        PDT's seven general cells and three small isolation cells       are unable to accommodate the number of detainees currently       being held at the processing facility within TEDS standards.       Further limiting available space is the need to separate       detainees with infectious diseases, such as chicken pox,       scabies, and influenza, from each other and from the general       population.        Border Patrol agents told us some of the detainees had been       held in standing-room-only conditions for days or weeks.       According to Border Patrol's custody logs, there were 756       detainees on site when we visited PDT on May 7, 2019. Of       those, 502 detainees (66 percent) had been held at PDT for       longer than 72 hours, with 33 detainees (4 percent) held       there for more than two weeks. On May 8, 2019, we returned to       PDT for another unannounced spot inspection and observed that       some family units and adult females had been transferred, but       overall numbers were even higher as additional detainees had       arrived for processing. According to Border Patrol staff, on       May 8, 2019, the total number on site was approximately 900.        During our visits, we observed the triage of hundreds of       detainees outside in the PDT parking lot. There were       approximately 75 people treated for lice, hundreds of family       units waiting in the tented area to be processed, and       hundreds of detainees in line to surrender their valuables,       such as money and phones, to DHS staff. Figure 4 depicts some       of the outdoor lines we observed on May 7, 2019, and May 8,       2019. We also observed staff discarding all other detainee       property, such as backpacks, suitcases, and handbags, in the       nearby dumpster. Border Patrol personnel told us that these       items might be wet, have bugs, and be muddy, and, therefore,       presented a ``biohazard.''        We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention       represent an immediate risk to the health and safety not just       of the detainees, but also DHS agents and officers. Border       Patrol management on site said there is a high incidence of       illness among their staff. Border Patrol management at PDT       and other sites also raised concerns about employee morale       and that conditions were elevating anxiety and       affecting employees' personal lives. They noted that some       employees eligible for retirement had accelerated their       retirement dates, while others were considering       alternative employment opportunities.        In addition, Border Patrol management on site said there is       an ongoing concern that rising tensions among detainees could       turn violent. We observed that staff must enter crowded cells       or move large numbers of detainees for meals, medical care,       and cell cleaning. For example, at the time of our visit, 140       adult male detainees were crowding the hallways and common       areas of the facility while their cell was being cleaned. We       observed staff having difficulty maneuvering around this       crowd to perform their duties,  [[Page S4556]]       and were told that staff feel they have limited options if       detainees decide not to cooperate.        The overcrowded conditions also complicate efforts to       ensure compliance with TEDS standards. For example, CBP was       struggling to maintain hygienic conditions in the holding       cells. With limited access to showers and clean clothing,       detainees were wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks.       Although TEDS standards do not require a change of clothing       for adults, Border Patrol agents said they were nevertheless       trying to obtain clean clothing for adult females because the       lack of clean clothes was ``wearing down on them.'' We also       observed detainees standing on toilets in the cells to make       room and gain breathing space, thus limiting access to the       toilets. Border Patrol agents said detainees who were not ill       were raising medical complaints to obtain temporary release       from the cells, adding to the medical staffs burden.   DHS Needs a Coordinated Approach to Managing Long-Term Detention during                      Sharp Increase in Apprehensions         Although CBP headquarters management has been aware of the       situation at PDT for months and detailed staff to assist with       custody management, DHS has not identified a process to       alleviate issues with overcrowding at PDT. Within DHS,       providing long-term detention is the responsibility of U.S.       Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), not CBP. El Paso       sector Border Patrol management said they are able to       complete immigration processing for most detainees within a       few days, but have not been able to transfer single adults       into ICE custody quickly. Border Patrol managers at the       stations we visited said they call ICE daily to request       detention space for single adults. They said in some       instances ICE officers tell them they cannot take the       detainees. In other instances, ICE initially agrees to take       some adult detainees, but then reverses the decision.        ICE has the infrastructure to transport and detain aliens       nationwide, but its current ability to do both of these tasks       is also strained. ICE senior managers stated that ICE does       not currently have sufficient detention bed space to take all       of Border Patrol's adult detainees, and explained that Border       Patrol has the authority to decide which detainees are the       highest priority to transfer to ICE custody. ICE managers       also stated that ICE prioritizes requests from CBP over any       other requests for bed space and, when possible, uses its       national transportation system to fly and transport detainees       to available detention beds.        When we discussed the situation at PDT with ICE, ICE       officials suggested the El Paso sector could develop a single       point of contact to better prioritize requests for adult       detention beds. They said with individual Border Patrol       stations making requests to ICE, the highest priority       detainees may not be transferred to ICE. Prioritization could       alleviate the situation at PDT and in the El Paso sector in       the short term, but would not contribute to a coordinated DHS       approach to managing long-term detention during this sharp       increase in border apprehensions.                               Recommendations         We recommend the Acting Secretary of DHS:        1. Take immediate steps to alleviate the overcrowding at       the El Paso Del Norte Bridge Processing Center (PDT).                  DHS Management's Response and OIG Analysis         DHS management provided written comments on a draft of this       alert. We included a copy of DHS' management comments in       their entirety in appendix A. We also incorporated DHS'       technical comments in the final alert, as appropriate.      DHS Response to Recommendation #1        Concur. CBP has constructed a 500-person holding capacity       soft-sided structure at El Paso Station, will construct an       additional tent by July 31, 2019, and will open a Centralized       Processing Center within 18 months. CBP will continue to       review the number of migrants in custody at Border Patrol       stations to determine available space and transfer subjects       accordingly. The Border Patrol, through its single point of       contact at El Paso Sector, will continue to communicate with       ICE to improve the migrant transfer process.        The estimated completion date is November 30, 2020.      OIG Response        We observed conditions at the El Paso Del Norte Processing       Center (PDT) Border Patrol facility that represent an       immediate risk to the health and safety of detainees and DHS       employees. Specifically, Border Patrol agents told us some       single adults had been held in standing-room-only conditions       for days or weeks. Border Patrol management on site said       there is an ongoing concern that rising tensions among       detainees could turn violent. Dangerous overcrowding among       single adults in PDT requires immediate action.        While we consider the actions outlined in DHS' response to       be partially responsive to the recommendation, the       recommendation will remain unresolved and open until DHS       offers an immediate corrective action plan to address the       dangerous overcrowding at PDT.     Appendix A--DHS's Management Comments to the Draft Management Alert                                May 28, 2019       Memorandum for: John V. Kelly, Acting Inspector General      From: Jim H. Crumpacker, CIA, CFE for Director, Departmental           GAO-OIG Liaison Office.      Subject: Management Response to OIG Draft Management Alert:           ``DHS Needs to Address Dangerous Overcrowding Among           Single Adults at El Paso Del Norte Processing Center           (PDT)--For Official Use Only'' (Project No. 19-039-SRE-          CBP).        Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on this       draft report. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)       appreciates the work of the Office of' Inspector General       (OIG) in planning and conducting its review and issuing this       report.        DHS performs an essential role in securing our Nation's       borders at and between ports of entry, and enforces U.S.       immigration law within the interior of the country. U.S.       Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and       Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and agents continually       uphold the utmost professionalism while performing essential       border security operations. DHS is devoted to the care and       processing of the individuals in our custody with the utmost       dignity and respect.        The current situation on the border represents an acute and       worsening crisis. Our immigration system is not equipped to       accommodate a migration pattern like the one we are       experiencing now. Previous patterns--somewhat predictable in       composition and predicated on seasonal variations--are no       longer the norm, Through April 2019, CBP enforcement actions       along the southwest border are 84 percent higher than the       same period last fiscal year; this includes a 117 percent       increase in U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) apprehensions.       Additionally, the speed with which illegal migrants are       transiting through Mexico to reach our southern border is       frustrating our best efforts to respond quickly.        The current migration flow and the resulting humanitarian       crisis are rapidly overwhelming the ability of the Federal       Government to respond. In March 2019, CBP encountered over       103,000 illegal border crossers and inadmissible aliens. In       April 2019, that number exceeded 109,000--the highest monthly       levels in more than a decade.        DHS has taken steps to ensure an elevated standard of care       in response to the current humanitarian crisis and has       directed additional personnel and resources to the border.       CBP has constructed a weatherproof and climate-controlled       soft-sided structure in the El Paso Sector. The structure       will allow Border Patrol agents to expedite, process, and       transport migrants to ICE or the U.S. Department of Health       and Human Services. The structure provides areas for eating,       sleeping, recreation, and personal hygiene for up to 500       people. There are also separate areas for processing, medical       evaluations, bathroom facilities, laundry, trailers, sleeping       mats, kitchen equipment, personal property storage boxes,       office space, television, and lockers.        Additionally, a modular facility that is capable of holding       up to 800 people is projected to be in use by July 2019.       Construction of a permanent Centralized Processing Center       (CPC) in El Paso is planned to further alleviate       overcrowding. The CPC is expected to be operational in       approximately 18 months, with a holding capacity of       approximately 1,800. Congress can also help by working on       targeted solutions to restore integrjty to our immigration       system and remove the incentives for families and children to       cross our border illegally.        The draft report contained one recommendation, with which       the Department concurs. Attached find our detailed response       to the recommendation. Technical comments were previously       provided under separate cover.        Again, thank you for the opportunity to review and comment       on this draft report. Please feel free to contact me if you       have any questions. We look forward to working with you again       in the future.    Attachment: Management Response to Recommendation Contained in 19-039-                                 SRE-CBP         The OIG recommended that the Acting Secretary of DHS:        Recommendation 1: Take immediate steps to alleviate the       overcrowding at El Paso Del Norte Processing Center (PDT).        Response: Concur. In an effort to alleviate the       overcrowding at the PDT brought on by the unprecedented       increase in the number of families and children arriving at       the Southwest Border, CBP has implemented a multi-layered       approach.        CBP has constructed a 500 holding capacity soft-sided       structure at El Paso Station that has been operational since       May 2, 2019. CBP will construct an 800 holding capacity       modular facility at El Paso Station to be operational by July       31, 2019. In addition, a permanent CPC with a holding       capacity of approximately 1,800 is planned to further       alleviate overcrowding in El Paso. It is scheduled to be       operational within 18 months.        CBP will continue to review the number of migrants in       custody at USBP stations within El Paso Sector to determine       available space and transfer subjects accordingly. USBP,       through its single point-of-contact at El Paso Sector, will       continue to communicate with ICE's Enforcement and Removal       Operations to improve the migrant transfer process.        In an effort to supplement staff, CBP will continue to       temporarily detail Border Patrol  [[Page S4557]]       Agents and CBP Surge Force personnel to El Paso Sector, as       well as utilize personnel from the U.S. Department of       Defense.        Due to capacity issues, USBP will continue processing non-      criminal family units for immediate release under an order of       recognizance.        Estimated Completion Date: November 30, 2020.                  Appendix B--Management Alert Distribution                      Department of Homeland Security         Secretary        Deputy Secretary        Chief of Staff        General Counsel        Executive Secretary        Director, GAO/OIG Liaison Office        Under Secretary Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans        Assistant Secretary for Office of Public Affairs        Assistant Secretary for Office of Legislative Affairs        Commissioner, CBP        CBP Component Liaison                       Office of Management and Budget         Chief, Homeland Security Branch        DHS OIG Budget Examiner                                   congress         Congressional Oversight and Appropriations Committees     This report details dangerous overcrowding for a prolonged  basis at this detention center and the dangers it creates. According to  the report, a facility with maximum capacity of 125 detainees is  holding approximately 900. Some migrants were held in standing-room- only-conditions for days or weeks with limited access to showers or  clean clothing. Migrants, many of whom are asylum seekers, were  observed standing on toilets themselves to make room and gain breathing  space. These conditions not only violate Custom and Border Patrol's  transport, escort, detention, and search standards but are an affront  to our values as a nation. Asylum seekers who have fled violence and  suffered through an arduous journey should not be subjected to  unhealthy, unsanitary, unsafe conditions under any circumstances.   Asylum seekers are coming to our shores because of violence in their  home countries. Everyone knows this. This isn't a theory; it is fact.  Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador rank in the top 10 countries in  the world for homicide. Why do we think they are coming? Would any one  of us journey hundreds or thousands of miles? I don't think so.   According to a report issued from Doctors Without Borders in 2017,  Northern Triangle countries--the countries I just mentioned--are  experiencing ``violent displacement, persecution, sexual violence, and  forced repatriation akin to the conditions found in the deadliest armed  conflicts in the world today.'' That is not some Member of Congress  just talking.   For asylum seekers, the decision to move is not a choice; it is a  necessity. The journey can further subject them to violence, danger,  and other abuses along the way.   Once they arrive at our shores, it is critical that they are treated  with compassion and human dignity and receive a fair opportunity to  present their claims.   That is the America that we believe in. That is the America we were  taught to believe that we are--a nation that respects human life, human  values, and gives people a fair chance when they present themselves for  asylum.   The only good news that we can report tonight is that the Senate  passed a bill to provide nearly $4.6 billion in humanitarian aid,  including $2.88 billion to the Office of Refugee Resettlement to care  for migrant children and to help minimize the time they are held in  Federal facilities, in Federal custody. The House also passed a bill,  which I support. We must quickly conference these bills to provide the  needed resources while we also ensure there are protections for  migrants and greater accountability and transparency from DHS to ensure  the funds are appropriately spent.   The faster we get this done, the better, and maybe we can reduce the  likelihood that six more children will die in the next couple of months  in the custody of the U.S. Government.   I end with this note: I talked about what we are as a nation and what  we believe that we should be and the standard we are not meeting now.  We must be a nation that respects people who come to our shores and  treats them with a measure of human dignity and compassion and  fairness.   What we must not be is a nation that refuses asylum seekers who flee  persecution and violence from the murder capitals of the world. We must  not be a nation that separates children from their families. We must  not be a nation that gives migrants, including children, who are in  squalid and inhumane conditions, no hope of getting out of that  circumstance.   We are, indeed, when we are at our best, a nation of opportunity, a  nation of immigrants, and, of course, a nation of laws. It is  imperative that we fix our broken immigration system more broadly so  that it, once again, reflects these American values.   As we work on a broad response to a broken immigration system, let us  at least be there for those children in the nighttime of their fear-- No. 1, not to create that fear and, No. 2, not to perpetuate it for  these children. At a minimum, we should make a pledge in our government  to never have six deaths of children who are in the custody of the U.S.  Government.   I yield the floor.
