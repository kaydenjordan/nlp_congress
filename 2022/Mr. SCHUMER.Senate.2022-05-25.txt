 Madam President, there is a plague--a plague--upon this  Nation, a plague of gun violence that has taken over this country. Two  weeks ago, that plague claimed the lives of 10 Black Americans who were  massacred in broad daylight while shopping at a grocery store in  Buffalo. They were Black, and they were in a grocery store. That is the  reason they were shot by an 18-year-old with an AR-15.   And then, yesterday, just 10 days after Buffalo, that plague struck  again in Uvalde, TX, where 19--19--innocent children and 2 teachers  were gunned down at Robb Elementary in the middle of the school day,  just before the start of summer when these kids were looking forward to  having such a wonderful time with their family and friends.   Gone. They are gone.   The shooter crashed his truck near the school, overpowered the police  already at the scene, and reportedly began shooting inside a fourth  grade classroom. Nineteen kids, two teachers, forever gone in the blink  of an eye.   America's gun epidemic is unmatched by any of our peer nations in the  world. No American is safe from it, and the American people are sick  and tired of it. But we also have a problem--a big problem--here in the  U.S. Senate--a big problem in the U.S. Senate. The problem in the  Senate is simple: Too many Members on the other side of the aisle are  disconnected from the suffering of the American people. Too many  Members on that side care more about the NRA than they do about  families who grieve victims of gun violence.    As I said, the American people are sick and tired of mass shootings.  They are sick and tired about active shooter alerts. They are sick and  tired of children--children: 9-year-olds, 10-year-  [[Page S2676]]  olds, 11-year-olds--being shot, gunned down in their schools.   When I read the news of yesterday's shooting, I ached for the  families and then thought: What if it was one of my children? I  imagined what I would feel if this happened to one of them. The mere  thought--just thinking about it--was a gut punch in my stomach. The  fear sent ripples down my spine.   To my Republican colleagues: Imagine if it happened to you. Imagine  if this was your kid or your grandkid. How would you feel? Could you  ever forgive yourself for not supporting a simple law that would make  these mass shootings less likely?   Please, please, please--damn it--put yourself in the shoes of these  parents for once. Maybe that thought, putting yourself in the shoes of  these parents instead of in the arms of the NRA, might let you wriggle  free from the viselike grip of the NRA, might free you to act on even a  simple measure for the sake of these children--these 9-year-olds, these  10-year-olds, these 11-year-olds, these beautiful children. Please-- damn it--think if it were your child or grandchild.   Now, Madam President, it wasn't always this way in Congress. Nearly  30 years ago, I was proud to be the author of the Brady Bill and a  leader of the assault weapons bans. These were major legislative  accomplishments, and they worked because they were good, commonsense  laws, and they passed because both sides of the aisle worked together.  And because they became law, tens of thousands--hundreds of thousands,  perhaps--of lives were saved: children, elderly people, people of  color, you name it, people now walking the streets who might have been  dead had we not passed these laws. But today the NRA has made it all  but impossible for even the bare minimum to move forward in Congress,  and the other side is all too ready to bow in obeisance to the NRA, in  service of their whims.   Madam President, these types of shootings used to be rare--so rare,  in fact, that each occurrence stood apart as a singular event. But now  these shootings happen so frequently that the Nation can barely keep  up, barely mourn the 10 people shot in the grocery store in Buffalo  before being rocked to our collective core by the slaughter of 19  elementary schoolchildren in the predominantly Latino community of  Uvalde, TX.   These shootings happen everywhere: movie theaters, churches,  synagogues, concerts, nightclubs, grocery stores, college campuses,  high schools, elementary schools--elementary schools, with beautiful  children getting ready to move out into the prime of life.   Honestly, I thought Sandy Hook 10 years ago would be the breaking  point. I thought that that would be the tragedy that forced Republicans  to examine their conscience and think: Oh, God, we can't allow  schoolchildren to be slaughtered.   Well, I was wrong. The slaughter of 20 elementary schoolchildren in  Sandy Hook didn't move them. We heard about their thoughts and their  prayers--but no action. Then came Aurora. And the Navy Yard. Then,  after Charleston, I thought: Maybe this--maybe this is the moment. Nine  Americans shot in a church during Bible study? This has to move the  Republicans here in the Senate.   Nope. It didn't. They gave a few more thoughts, a few more prayers,  no real effort to solve the problem.   So, Madam President, it continued on and on and on: San Bernardino;  Orlando; Las Vegas; Sutherland Springs; Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School; Thousand Oaks; the Pittsburgh synagogue; Santa Fe, TX; the El  Paso Walmart; Dayton; Virginia Beach; Boulder; Buffalo; and now Uvalde.   When will it end? We must act to have it end, not thoughts and  prayers--action.   After the shootings in El Paso and Dayton 3 years ago, the Republican  leader promised that red flag laws and background checks would be front  and center in a Senate debate. He was then majority leader, but then  the Republicans did nothing. They ensured there was no debate, just as  they wanted. They don't want to debate this issue. Indeed, all we hear  from Republicans are thoughts, prayers. And now there is a new phrase.  Now some of my Republican colleagues want to ``lift up'' the community.  That sounds heartening, but it does absolutely nothing--nothing--to  prevent the next family from having to grieve their loss, and it won't  do a single damn thing to prevent another life from being taken. It  won't do a single damn thing to prevent another child from being shot  at school--a 9-year-old, a 10-year-old, an 11-year-old--beautiful  children.    Madam President, you may have noticed that when they aren't offering  thoughts and prayers to distract from their inaction, many of my  Republican colleagues focus on the motives of the shooters instead of  focusing on the obvious common denominator. They talk about the real  villain being mental illness and say nothing of the fact that we are a  nation suffocated by firearms. Rates of mental illness are more or less  the same across the developed world. The United States is not an  outlier on mental illness, but we are an outlier in the sheer number of  guns available in this country. That is why we have so many shootings  and other Western countries don't. If mental illness were the simple  cause, you would see mass shootings happening all over the developed  world, but you don't.   What you do see here in America are enough guns to give every man,  woman, and child in this Nation a firearm and still have nearly 70  million guns left over. What you do see is that it is far too easy for  people to access weapons in this country and then to use them to  slaughter people, to slaughter children by the dozens--by the dozens.   Again, America doesn't stand out when it comes to the rate of mental  illness, but we are unique among the world's developed nations in that  today, the leading cause of death among children is no longer a car  accident; it is no longer illness or malnourishment. The leading cause  of death among children is a firearm. The leading cause of death of  children--do you hear that, my Republican colleagues?--is a firearm.   Clearly, many of these shooters had different motives, but at the end  of the day, does the motive really matter to the family with an empty  seat at their dinner table? Children who lost parents don't just care  whether the shooter was mentally ill; they care that the shooter had  ready access to a gun. Spouses who lost their partners don't just care  that the shooter had a grudge or an agenda or a grievance; they care  that the shooter had ready access to a gun. Americans who lost friends  and coworkers and parishioners, who lost fellow worshippers don't just  care whether the shooter wrote a manifesto; they care that the shooter  had ready access to a gun. They care that their loved ones had been  taken from them by someone who had access to a gun--taken from them  while some Members of this body refuse to do what it takes to prevent  those losses, refuse to focus on the denominator to every single one of  these shootings, refuse to even do the bare minimum as they bow in  obeisance to the wretched NRA.   What do we do about it? If the slaughter of schoolchildren can't  convince the Republicans to buck the NRA, what can we do? There are  some who want this body to quickly vote on sensible gun safety  legislation--legislation supported by the vast majority of Americans,  Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike. They want to see this  body vote quickly so the American people can know which side each  Senator is on--which side each Senator is on.   I am sympathetic to that, and I believe that accountability votes are  important. But, sadly, this isn't a case of the American people not  knowing where their Senators stand. They know. They know because my  Republican colleagues are perfectly clear on this issue, crystal clear.  Republicans don't pretend that they support sensible gun safety  legislation. They don't pretend to be moved by the fact that 90 percent  of Americans, regardless of party, support something as common sense as  background checks, that the vast majority of gun owners support the  background checks bill. They don't pretend that they want to keep guns  out of the hands of those who might use weapons to shoot concertgoers  or movie watchers or worshippers or shoppers or children. They don't  pretend at all.   Just listen to them when they show up in obeisance to the NRA at the  NRA's convention in Houston--the same State as Uvalde--on Friday. They  [[Page S2677]]  will offer their thoughts and prayers. They will say they want to lift  up the community. And then they will go back to their smoke-filled  rooms and ensure the NRA and gun manufacturers that nothing will  change, that they have the NRA's back.   No, Madam President, no, this isn't a case of Republicans hiding  their position. They proudly tell the American people which side they  are on, and America is much worse off for it. And if nothing does  change, we are condemned to find ourselves right here once again very,  very soon.   As I was reading the reports of the tragedy in Texas, I saw that  Amanda Gorman, the young woman who mesmerized the Nation at President  Biden's inauguration, tweeted:         The truth is, one nation under guns.    ``One nation under guns.'' That is simply heartbreaking-- heartbreaking--to think that this is the legacy that older generations  are leaving behind for young Americans: ``one nation under guns.''   It doesn't have to be that way. Our parents don't need to drop their  kids off at school and wonder if their kid will be next. That is in the  thoughts of millions of moms and dads right now. Our citizens don't  have to endure the fear of getting groceries while constantly keeping  an eye behind their backs. Again, millions of Americans are worried  about that right now.   Americans can make a choice. Americans can reject the Republican  ``guns at all cost'' doctrine, obeisance to the NRA, not even voting  for the most simple, sensitive, positive, and popular gun legislation.  Americans can cast their vote in November for Senators or Members of  Congress who reflect how he or she stands with guns, with this issue-- this issue--at the top of the voters' lists.    In the meantime, my Republican colleagues can work with us now. I  know this is a slim prospect--very slim, all too slim. We have been  burned so many times before. But this is so important, and I have such  a firm belief--taught to me by my late father, who passed away in  November--that if you do the right thing and persist, justice will  eventually prevail. But you have to keep persisting, and we will.   For that reason alone, we must pursue action and even ask Republicans  again to join us--maybe, maybe, maybe. Unlikely. We have been burned in  the past. But their hearts might see what is happening and join us and  do the right thing. They know it is the right thing. They can work with  us to craft legislation that would prevent needless loss of life. It is  their choice.   As majority leader, I haven't been shy about putting bipartisan  legislation on the floor for a vote, but bipartisan means both parties  must engage in crafting a bill, like what happened in the House and  Senate 30 years ago with the Brady law and the assault weapons ban.   Democrats have been trying to work hard with Republicans--Senator  Murphy, Senator Manchin--on legislation that will eventually pass and  become law. The other side has refused. There are so many options  available to us, so many ideas. We just need some brave Republicans to  stand before history and yell ``stop,'' to think, if it was your child,  your grandchild, how you would feel. Would that move you to do  something--something--about this plague of guns?   Like my colleague Senator Murphy, I refuse to believe that we cannot  find a path forward. Make no mistake about it, if we can't find a good,  strong bill that has bipartisan support, we will continue to pursue  this issue on our own. We have no choice. It is too important. Lives  are at stake.   I accept the fact that most of my Republican colleagues are not  willing to do what it takes to prevent this needless loss of life. The  NRA will have a hold on them. That is just a reality, unfortunately.  But it is unacceptable to the American people to think that there are  not 10 of my Republican colleagues, just 10--1 out of 5 over here--who  would be ready to work to pass something that would reduce this plague  of gun violence.   It is unacceptable that there are not 10 Members of the Republican  caucus willing to save lives, find a way to do it. Yet that is where we  are. That is where we are. Another week, another American community  devastated by a mass shooting. All of us thinking of these 9- and 10-  and 11-year-old children just shot, gone. Another American community,  Uvalde, which will never recover, like the other communities before it.  Will it be yet--Uvalde--another example of Republicans unwilling to do  what it takes to keep Americans safe?   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I understand there are five bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place these bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding en bloc.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I just had heard the minority leader  say he was sickened by what happened in Uvalde.   Tomorrow, we have a bill coming to the floor that addressed the last  shooting, the one in Buffalo. Will he join us in allowing a debate and  amendments to that bill that will address the gun plague in America?   Thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need action.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object.    Madam President, the American people have had to endure  two of the worst mass shootings in recent history in just the span of  10 days. One of them happened to be in my home State of New York in the  dear city of Buffalo; the other happened yesterday in Texas, the worst  school shooting since Sandy Hook, and we can't get out of our minds--I  can't--the picture of 10, 11, and 9-year-olds being shot, killed, just  ready to burst into the adolescent and adult phases of their lives.   What the American people want is real solutions to our Nation's gun  violence epidemic. We have had too many moments of silence, too many  thoughts and prayers. Americans are sick of it. Many in this Chamber  are sick of it.   Here is the sad truth about what happened yesterday and why I plan to  object to my colleague's UC: hardening schools would have done nothing  to prevent this shooting. In fact, there were guards and police  officers already at the school yesterday when the shooter showed up.  One was a school police officer, two were from the Uvalde Police  Department. The shooter got past all of them with two assault weapons  that he purchased. They couldn't stop him.   The bill would not have protected those children. More guns won't  protect our children. That is the wrong answer. There are too many guns  and too many options for the wrong people to get guns.   So I plan to object to passing this measure today through consent,  but I would tell my colleague from Wisconsin, tomorrow we can begin  voting on a bill that will take us--that will let us take action on  guns, and we could consider amendments like this then, along with  others.   Tomorrow, the Senate is scheduled to take the first step--the first  step--in responding to the shooting that happened in my home State of  New York 2 weeks ago and so many other mass shootings over the years  that have been motivated by race.   The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, which I set in motion earlier  this week, is a necessary and timely step to honor the memories of the  dead in Buffalo and to make sure mass shootings motivated by race don't  happen again.   I urge all my Republican colleagues to vote to get on the bill. All  we are asking is a vote ``yes'' on the motion to proceed.   I urge my colleague from Wisconsin to vote yes on that bill.   If Senator Johnson helps us get on the domestic terrorism bill, we  could consider amendments related to guns--his and others' who have a  different point of view. If Republicans can vote with us to get on that  bill, we can have a debate on considering commonsense, strong gun  safety amendments, hopefully with bipartisan support. The Senator from  Wisconsin says his bill is bipartisan. There are five Republican  sponsors.   The bottom line is, if you want to have bipartisan debates, you don't  just say: My bill must pass by unanimous consent, and no other bill can  pass. I am providing a path that we can have a debate on these  amendments.   Let me be clear. We are going to vote on gun legislation, and the  Republicans could let us start doing that as soon as tomorrow if they  simply vote yes on the motion to proceed, and I give them a pledge that  we will then start debating gun amendments--Senator Johnson's and many  others' who have a different point of view. I repeat, though, we are  going to vote on gun legislation. The American people are tired of  moments of silence, tired of the kind words offering thoughts and  prayers.   We can use the domestic terrorism bill tomorrow to begin--I repeat,  to begin--considering gun safety amendments, and we can consider the  proposal he brings to the floor today. So we won't just have this  amendment; we will have a lot of amendments to debate. That seems  perfectly fair and, in fact, bipartisan. Alone, the Johnson bill is not  in any way, shape, or form a sufficient solution, and so I object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now vote on the motions to invoke cloture on the Jacobs-Young and Loyd  nominations; that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be  considered expired on these and the Gomez nomination, and the Senate  vote on the confirmation each at a time to be determined by the  majority leader or his designee, following consultation with the  Republican leader.    It is a unique moment. I fully support Senator Paul in  his motion.    Once again, I support my colleague, the junior Senator  from the great Commonwealth of Kentucky.    Mr. President, there has been a good agreement--Senator  Paul, Senator Stabenow, myself, Senator Murphy, Senator Brown--and so  here is what--we are only going to have one more vote because we are  vitiating--I think it is six cloture votes.   So listen, one and all. It is good news.                          Cloture Motions Withdrawn     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the  cloture motion on the Harper, Bagenstos, Huie, Baker, and Hartley  nominations, and the Senate vote on confirmation at a time to be  determined by the majority leader or his designee, following  consultation with the Republican leader.    Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Committee on Finance be discharged from  further consideration and the Senate proceed to S. Res. 134.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Lee  substitute amendment to the resolution be considered and agreed to.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the  resolution, as amended.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Lee  amendment to the preamble be considered and agreed to; the preamble, as  amended, be agreed to, the Lee amendment to the title be considered and  agreed to, the title, as amended, be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 923, Jane Hartley, of  New York, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the  United States of America to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and  Northern Ireland; that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; that any statements related to  the nomination be printed in the Record; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate now vote on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 717, the  nomination of Cathy Ann Harris, as provided under the previous order.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, May 26, and that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that upon the conclusion  of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to Calendar No. 371, H.R. 350, Domestic Terrorism Prevention  Act; further, that at 11:30 a.m., the Senate vote on the motion to  invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 350; that if cloture is  not invoked, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No.  396, S.J. Res. 46; that the joint resolution be considered read a third  time and the Senate vote on passage of the joint resolution; that upon  disposition of the joint resolution, the Senate proceed to executive  session to consider the Bernicat nomination, as under the previous  order; that the Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination at 1:45  p.m.; finally, that if any nominations are confirmed during Thursday's  session, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 10:17 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, May 26, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
