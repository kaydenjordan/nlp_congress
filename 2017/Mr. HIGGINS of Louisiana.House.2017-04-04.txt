 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas, Chairman Smith, for yielding me time to highlight my support for  H.R. 353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017.   This past weekend, deadly storms ravaged Louisiana's Third District,  my district, tragically taking the lives of Francine Gotch and her 3- year-old daughter, Nevaeh Alexander, when their singlewide trailer  flipped during high winds produced by a tornado.   The United States was once at the forefront of weather forecasting;  however, that ability has diminished over the years with the  capabilities of some other countries now paralleling or even exceeding  our own.   I do not know if a better weather forecasting service would have made  a difference this past weekend. However, as elected officials, we must  make it a priority to protect American lives and property to the  fullest extent.                                time  1500    We must never waver in this most significant responsibility. This  legislation will put America back on track to lead the world in  accurately predicting severe weather events with a renewed focus on  increasing weather research and placing new technologies into  operation.   More specifically, this bill also creates a tornado forecasting  improvement program to develop more accurate, effective, and timely  tornado forecasts that will allow for increased tornado warning lead  times, which is crucial to saving lives and would perhaps have saved  the lives of that mother and her young daughter this past weekend.   Mr. Speaker, with the number of hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes  that have hit Louisiana in the last few decades, my constituency knows  all too well the danger that mother nature can pose, as well as the  need for reliable information to adequately prepare for such  occurrences.   Constituents in my district need good, commonsense legislation like  this to protect their families and their property. I applaud the  efforts of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Smith  and Representative Lucas for leading this effort to protect Americans  from severe weather.
