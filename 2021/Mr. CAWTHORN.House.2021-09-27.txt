 Madam Speaker, I thank my esteemed colleague for his  leadership.   Madam Speaker, this is my generation's long-form death certificate.  You endorsed it. You own it, and you will pass it. But I will be the  one to pay for it.   My generation, and if America still stands, my grandchildren, will  pay for this Trojan horse of a socialist proposal, $3.5 trillion in  unhinged, unconscionable, irredeemable spending.   It is the final nail in the coffin of the American Dream. Karl Marx  would even call this bill radical.   Look at this. This is a pallet of $100 million and, for scale, beside  that is me. And behind all of that is what the Democrats propose to  spend.   You have stolen my generation's checkbook, and, Madam Speaker, we  want it back. No American who votes for this trash should ever see the  inside of a legislative chamber ever again. They should never take  another oath of office for Congress, for statehouse. Hell, they  shouldn't even be able to get on the mosquito control board because  they have endorsed the demise of the country they swore to protect.                                time  2100    This is what crushing, overwhelming, unrecoverable debt looks like.  And we haven't even talked about the substance. This proposal is  legislative malfeasance on the lifeblood of our country: energy  independence, and more importantly, energy dominance.   You show me a nation's energy policies, and I will show you the  future of that nation. Under President Trump, our energy independence  carved out our standing in the world. We were the captains of our  destiny, not Middle East kingdoms. We augmented our national security  through America First energy independence, not foreign reliance.  America was leading the world. When Joe Biden took office, our soaring,  thriving energy independence came crashing down.   Failed policies, fatal spending: that is your legacy, Madam Speaker.  You have put before us a death wish for America.   You stand guilty of financial treason, Madam Speaker. But the  sentence will be served out by my generation.
