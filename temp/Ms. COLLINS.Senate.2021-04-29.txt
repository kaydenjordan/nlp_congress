 Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator  [[Page S2322]]  Shaheen's amendment. I urge its adoption.   Representing, as I do, a State where there are a great number of  people who receive their drinking water from wells, it is really  important that we extend this program to identify contaminants there.    Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my  friend and colleague from Delaware, Senator Chris Coons, to reintroduce  the Reach Every Mother and Child Act of 2021. Our legislation would  make it the policy of the United States to lead an effort to end  preventable deaths of mothers, newborns, and young children in the  developing world by 2030.   For years Sen. Coons and I have led efforts to ensure robust funding  for the U.S. Agency for International Development's maternal and child  health programing, which have formed the backbone of the U.S.  commitment to help end preventable child and maternal deaths globally.   Due in part to American leadership and generosity, many lives have  already been saved. Nevertheless, far too many mothers, newborns, and  young children under the age of five continue to succumb to disease and  malnutrition that could easily be prevented. The impacts of COVID-19  are exacerbating these gaps and disproportionately affecting the  world's most vulnerable, undermining decades of progress.   Nearly 300,000 women die annually from causes related to pregnancy  and childbirth. In addition, a significant proportion of deaths of  children under the age of five occur in the first 28 days after birth,  with newborns accounting for nearly 50 percent of all under-five  deaths. In 2019, 5.2 million children under the age of five died from  mainly preventable and treatable diseases.   Our bill aims to reach these mothers and children with simple,  proven, cost-effective interventions that we know will help them  survive. A concentrated effort could end preventable maternal and child  deaths worldwide by the year 2030, but continued U.S. leadership and  support from the international community are critical to success.   To achieve this ambitious goal, our bill would require the  implementation of a strategy focused on bringing to scale the highest  impact, evidence-based interventions, with a focus on country and  community ownership. These interventions would be specific to each  country's needs and include support for the most vulnerable  populations. We do not have to guess at what interventions will work-- the reality is that thousands of children die each day of conditions we  know today how to treat.   These life-saving interventions include clean birthing practices,  vaccines, nutritional supplements, hand-washing with soap, and other  basic needs that remain elusive for far too many women and children in  developing countries. This must change.   In addition, our bill proposes the establishment a Maternal and Child  Survival Coordinator at USAID who would focus on implementing the five- year strategy and verifying that the most  [[Page S2359]]  effective interventions are being scaled up in target countries. The  bill would improve government efficiency across several agencies that  would collaborate with the Coordinator to identify and promote the most  effective interventions to end preventable maternal and child deaths  globally.   To promote transparency and greater accountability, our bill also  would also require detailed public reporting on progress toward  implementing the strategy.   Other bipartisan initiatives, such as the successful President's  Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which was started by  President George W. Bush, demonstrate that results driven interventions  can turn the tide for global health challenges. Applying lessons  learned from past initiatives, our bill would provide the focus and the  tools necessary to accelerate progress toward ending preventable  maternal and child deaths.   I urge my colleagues to join Senator Coons and me in supporting this  legislation that will save the lives of mothers and children around the  world.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):   S. 1459. A bill to provide for the protection of and investment in  certain Federal land in the State of California, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
