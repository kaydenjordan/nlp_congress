 Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by  saying that the issue of climate change is very personal to me. I have  a 5- and a 7-year-old at home, and like any parent, there is a lot that  I worry about for their future. One of the things I worry most about is  the planet that we are going to leave behind for them and for their  future children.   The path we are on right now leads to a grim future for our planet.  We have burned fossil fuels like coal and oil at unsustainable rates,  releasing extraordinary amounts of greenhouse gas emissions into the  air. We have destroyed forests and other carbon sinks around the world  that previously absorbed some of those emissions.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a collection of 1,300  independent scientific experts from countries all over the world,  concluded there is a more than 95 percent probability that human  activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet.   As a result, the last 5 years were the hottest ever recorded,  according to the Trump administration's own weather and space agencies.  Over the past century, average global temperatures have increased  steadily. Sixteen of the last 17 years have been the warmest ever  recorded by human observations.   In my home State of California, the indicators of our rapidly  changing climate are unmistakable. Our summers are hotter, our droughts  are more severe, and our land is drier, creating fuel for year-round  wildfires that have wiped out entire communities.   According to the Trump administration's own report on climate change  compiled by more than 300 experts across 13 Federal agencies, the  impacts of climate change are already being felt in communities across  the country and will become increasingly devastating over a short  period of time.   The President would be well served to read the report of his own  agencies.   We are having more frequent and extreme weather, like hurricanes and  floods. We are experiencing sea-level rise and coastal erosion. Our  national security agencies have warned us that unless we take  aggressive action to combat climate change, we will see a deterioration  in global stability caused by food and water insecurity, worsening  public health, economic distress, and damage to military infrastructure  as a result of sea-level rise and more extreme storms.   Climate change is a defining issue of our time. If we don't take bold  action to address this crisis now, our children and grandchildren will  suffer the worst consequences.   Unfortunately, this President and many in the Trump administration  are content with inaction or worse. In fact, some refuse to admit  climate change is real, instead pushing policies that would exacerbate  the problem, catering to the fossil fuel industry and corporate  polluters at the expense of our air, land, and water.   While we should be taking aggressive action to combat climate change  and pushing countries around the world to do the same, the White House  gladly surrenders our standing as a global leader.   My colleagues and I are here to say that we will lead. We will  continue to fight for action. My colleagues that you will hear from,  they are leading right now.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Hill),  my friend from California's 25th District.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Hill,  and I very much appreciate her leadership.   Over the next several days, the eyes of the world will turn to the  climate crisis with the Youth Global Strike for Climate set to take  place in over 150 countries just before the United Nations holds a  Climate Action Summit in New York City.   While millions of people across the globe call for action on climate  change and world leaders come together to show how they will honor  their commitment to the Paris Agreement, it is safe to say that the  White House won't step up to lead, let alone take any meaningful  action. Instead, the Trump administration is pulling us out of the  Paris Agreement, which nearly 200 countries from Afghanistan to  Zimbabwe and all in between have signed.   Where President Obama created a leading role for the United States on  the world stage, the Trump administration has retreated.   The U.N. Secretary General has called on all leaders to come to the  Climate Action Summit with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their  nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing  greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent over the next decade and to net  zero emissions by 2050.   The United States has an important opportunity to show leadership and  to push other countries to follow us, and that is how we should  evaluate all of these measures, on the basis of followership. That  requires that we lead.   That is critically important, the work that we do. The amount of  collective action that will be needed must start with leadership from  the United States. That is the only way we are going to combat the  climate crisis.   I was very proud to help introduce, among other bills, the Climate  Action Now Act, the first major climate change legislation that we had  in the 116th Congress, in fact, that we have had for a number of years  in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill would prohibit the  administration from withdrawing the United States from the Paris  Agreement and would also call on the President to develop and make  public a plan for how the Nation will meet the pollution reduction  goals in the Paris Agreement.   The bill isn't just about staying in Paris. It is about creating  good-paying, green jobs right here in America. It is about public  health. It is about protecting our air. It is about protecting our  water. It is about defending our national security from the threats  that climate change poses. It is about again leading in the world.   That is how the United States should be leading. We should set the  example.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore),  my friend.                                time  1815     Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Moore  for those powerful words.   Madam Speaker, I also want to address something that has been in the  news, and that is the President's announcement yesterday that he will  revoke California's waiver under the Federal Clean Air Act to set its  own auto emissions standards. This is something, as a native southern  Californian, that is near and dear to my heart.   So many southern Californians have had to endure poor air quality  over the years, and this, honestly, is something that has never been  partisan. Since the late 1960s, California has been able to set its own  air quality standards, because the standards that we set when Ronald  Reagan was Governor of California in the late 1960s exactly preceded  those standards set by the Federal Government.   Clean air is not a partisan issue. This is absolutely ridiculous that  the administration would want to go after California once again in this  manner.   So another thing to refute are the claims made by the President about  vehicle safety and cost--completely baseless. Fuel-efficient cars meet  the same exact safety standards as any other passenger vehicle and have  proven to be more cost-effective. The auto manufacturers want to  accelerate the transition to more electric vehicles, more sustainable  vehicles.   Everybody wants California to be able to have its own standards, with  two exceptions: President Trump and Big Oil. Those are the only two  exceptions. So it is pretty clear to see whose direction the President  is taking when it comes to this decision.   We also need to acknowledge that his decision here flies in the face  of established climate science. Transportation is the largest source of  greenhouse gas emissions in our country. The science tells us that  greenhouse gas emissions are driving climate change, so we should be  doing everything we can to reduce those emissions from transportation.   The Clean Air Act clearly gives California the authority to set its  own emission standards, and this authority has been repeatedly  confirmed by the courts, the Congress, and previous administrations,  Republicans and Democrats alike.   Again, this is not a partisan issue. Even the auto companies want to  see this happen.   So why are we still here? Why are we fighting over this ridiculous  assumption by the President that he can roll back five decades of  progress for cleaner air in California?   We are not going to let it stand. I will do everything in my power as  a Member of Congress, as I know my colleagues will, and California will  prevail.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Huffman), my friend and the Representative from California's Second  District.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Huffman  for his friendship, for his mentorship, and for all the work that he  does. He is a true environmental champion. I am really, really grateful  to call him a friend. We have got a lot of work to do.   I think it is really important that, as we think about this issue, we  begin to address some of the myths and the misconceptions that are out  there. One of the biggest that I hear from my friends across the aisle  is that we cannot combat climate change without destroying our economy,  when exactly the opposite is true.   If we invest in the clean energy jobs of the future, we will see  incredible economic growth and we will protect the environment at the  same time. Nowhere has that been more true in the United States than in  our State of California, where I am proud to tell you that we have the  most clean-energy jobs in the United States.   If you look at this chart, there are over 500,000 jobs in the clean  tech sector. I am proud to have come from the clean tech sector. I am  proud to have started a trade association in Orange County, California,  which historically has been seen as one of the most conservative places  in the United States. We created a booming clean tech industry that is  growing stronger than ever before. The same is true in San Diego  County, where we have some of the leading clean energy companies in the  United States. We can protect the environment and we can grow the clean  tech economy at the same time.   In California, it has never been a partisan issue. When we passed AB  32 in 2006, Arnold Schwarzenegger was the Governor, Republican  Governor. Then when we passed cap and trade, we had nine Republican  legislators who helped get that passed in the California legislature.   Governor Schwarzenegger and those Republican legislators at the time  understood that if we made climate change a primary focus, if we  reduced greenhouse gas emissions, that not only was it the right thing  to do for our State and for the planet, but it was the right thing to  do for our economy. That is exactly what has happened.   My friend, Marshall Burke, is a researcher at Stanford University, my  alma mater. He has studied the costs of action on climate change, but,  more importantly, the costs of inaction. There is an inherent cost to  doing nothing. My friends across the aisle always like to tell you  about the cost of doing something. They will say bold and aggressive  measures will cost too much. Well, Mr. Speaker, the costs of inaction  are even greater.   My friend, Marshall Burke, has said that if we don't take substantial  action to mitigate the climate crisis, it will cost the U.S. economy  $25 trillion to $35 trillion over the coming decades. That is with a T:  $25 trillion to $35 trillion.   The good news is that we can take the steps we need to in order to  act. We can combat the climate crisis, and we can create those clean  energy jobs.   I have introduced bipartisan legislation to reduce our dependence on  fossil fuels by promoting development of renewable energy on public  lands.   We can expand those technologies that grow our economy and protect  the environment by extending important tax credits like the solar  investment tax credit, which drives job creation, reduces greenhouse  gas emissions, and helps level the playing field for clean energy. And  we need it for things like battery storage, as well.   I have introduced legislation that presents an ambitious plan for  transitioning the United States to 100 percent zero-emission vehicles,  which will also have an enormous health benefit to the United States of  America.   According to a 2016 report issued by the American Lung Association,  transitioning to zero-emission vehicles would deliver $33 billion in  total health and climate savings by 2050. The 90 percent reduction in  the pollution that causes smog and soot would translate to 195,000  fewer lost work days, 96,000 fewer asthma attacks, and 2,200 fewer  premature deaths.   And I have introduced legislation, as well, to expand electric  vehicle charging on public lands across the United States and convert  National Park Service and United States Forest Service fleets to zero- emission vehicles.   This commitment will also help the United States lead the world in  developing and manufacturing innovative zero-emission vehicle  technology.   Since California first instituted a zero-emission vehicle requirement  in 1990, the overall economy has flourished, cutting-edge companies  like Tesla have generated billions of dollars in economic activity for  our State, and leading automotive companies across the country and the  world have done everything they can to invest in the cleaner technology  of the future zero-emission vehicles.   Alternatively, if we fail to act, if American car companies don't  lead, and if we don't have a supportive Federal Government helping them  to lead the way in these zero-emission vehicles of the future, we will  allow other countries to take the lead. China, India, and nations in  Europe will reap the economic rewards that should be staying right here  in the United States of America. We will find ourselves purchasing  foreign vehicles that should have been made right here in the USA.   Many of my colleagues are doing great work. They have introduced or  passed legislation that addresses the climate crisis in many different  ways and promotes the clean energy jobs of the future. You just heard  from a few of them.   Mr. Speaker, I want to wrap up here by pointing out one more key  fact. The American people overwhelmingly support aggressive action to  combat climate change.   Public opinion polling shows that the majority of Americans say that  it must be addressed, and it has got to be addressed now. The majority  of Americans overwhelmingly believe this is a crisis, and they are  right to believe that.   Unfortunately, our President right now calls climate change a hoax.  He says that it was brought on by China to undermine American economic  competitiveness. He is not willing to listen to the science. He should  listen to the scientists from his own agencies. He should just take the  half hour necessary to even read the executive summary from his own  scientists' report. That is all I would ask.   He should think about climate change when he makes appointments.  Unfortunately, he has been appointing climate science deniers like  William  [[Page H7823]]  Happer, a gentleman who once said that if the plants could vote, they  would vote for coal. He said that more CO2 in the atmosphere  is a good thing. This is a person advising the President of the United  States on climate science.   And it is not that the administration is too close to the oil and  coal industry, it is that they are the oil and coal industry. It is  literally a revolving door between 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, those coal  companies, and those oil companies. The American people demand better  than that.   This complete rejection of established science is dangerous, and it  is irresponsible.   It is dangerous and irresponsible for the White House to pressure the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, into  supporting the President's false claims about Hurricane Dorian. You  don't see any Sharpies on this chart.   It is dangerous and it is irresponsible that the White House refuses  to accept climate science and act on it. It is dangerous. It is  irresponsible. We must embrace science. We must embrace facts.   As I said in the beginning of this, this is about our children and  our grandchildren. I am thinking today about my own two children: my  daughter, Elizabeth, who is 5, and my son, Jonathan, who is 7. Maybe my  wonderful wife, Chrissy, will cue up C-SPAN and play this for them.   My son, who is 7, just started second grade. We have 12 years. By the  time my son is ready to graduate high school, according to the best  science, we better have gotten this crisis figured out or we are going  to have irreparable damage as a result. It is on us.   When I am done with my service in the House of Representatives, which  I hope comes many years from now, I want to be able to look back, as I  know so many of my colleagues do, and know that we gave it everything  we had to try to address what we believe is the most pressing issue  facing the United States of America and the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).                         Tribute to Michael Preadmore     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative  Schakowsky for coming.   It is a great honor to sit on the new Select Committee on the Climate  Crisis under the chair, Kathy Castor from Florida. I serve with many  other great Members, and we have an honest dialogue about the action  that we are going to need to take to combat this crisis.   Of course, I thank our great Speaker Nancy Pelosi for creating that  select committee as part of the 116th Congress.   Governor Jay Inslee said: ``We're the first generation to feel the  sting of climate change, and we're the last who can do something about  it.''   I couldn't agree more with Representative Schakowsky. We have to  [[Page H7824]]  listen to the children, our own children and the children we see here  in Washington. When we go back home to our districts, we have to listen  to those voices. We have to make those changes. They are counting on  us.   In these walls, right here, they are counting on the 435 people who  are so honored to serve as United States Representatives to get this  right for future generations.   I am honored to be one of those Members trying to fight the good  fight. We have so much work to do.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
