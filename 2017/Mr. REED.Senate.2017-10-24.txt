 Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Congressional  Review Act resolution repealing the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau's forced arbitration rule. At a time when millions of Americans  are suffering the consequences of abusive practices by major financial  institutions--including the massive consumer fraud by Wells  [[Page S6730]]  Fargo and the exposure of up to half of the national population's  personal information due to inadequate cyber security by Equifax--it is  simply wrong to give immunity to bad corporate actors against lawsuits  by the very customers they harmed.   I urge my colleagues to think about the millions of Americans who  still don't know all the facts about whether they are victims of one of  these or other major banking scandals. They deserve the chance to  gather the facts and hold the responsible parties accountable. This  anticonsumer resolution strips away those victims' constitutional first  line of defense against lending fraud and permits corporations more  opportunities to take advantage of consumers.   We have known for years that forced arbitration clauses harm the  financial security of those who are most vulnerable to lending scams.  Companies slip these clauses into the fine print of contracts for  everything from loan applications to purchases on a smartphone. Let's  be clear. Even if every American had the time to read and understand  the fine print of every contract they sign, most of these contracts by  major financial institutions are one-sided, and the consumer has no  power to bargain the terms in the fine print.   With these in place, consumers who learn their bank or lender has  overcharged or defrauded them also learn quickly that they have signed  away their right to take the corporation to court. Instead, they must  choose between dropping their claim or going it alone in an arbitration  process that is clearly and notoriously stacked in favor of the  corporation.   Forced arbitration makes it easier for predatory lenders to avoid the  consequences for taking advantage of consumers. This reality is even  more outrageous when we consider the fact that predatory lenders view  servicemembers, military families, and veterans as prime targets for  financial scams. The CFPB has noted that servicemembers are attractive  targets because, among other things, they are required to maintain good  finances, their pay is consistent, they often relocate, and many are  just starting to make significant financial decisions. The Department  of Defense is also well aware that military bases draw predatory  lenders selling bad or illegal loans, which is one reason why the  Department of Defense recently issued new rules banning forced  arbitration for many loans covered by the Military Lending Act. But  these rules still don't cover the full range of financial products that  may be used to take advantage of military consumers and their families.  That is why I have worked for years with Senator Lindsey Graham on  legislation to ban forced arbitration clauses that waive or limit  rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The CFPB rule bans  many of these and other forced arbitration clauses that  disproportionately harm servicemembers and their families.   While the CFPB has provided data to support the arbitration rule's  positive effects for servicemembers, we should also listen to the  servicemember community. Their strong support for this rule speaks  volumes. The CFPB rule's supporters include the Military Coalition,  which consists of 32 military advocacy groups, including the Veterans  of Foreign Wars, and associations representing the interests of members  of the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps. Moreover, in August,  the National Convention of the American Legion adopted a resolution  opposing legislation to repeal the CFPB forced arbitration rule  because, among other reasons, it ``is extremely unfair to bar  servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers from joining together to  enforce statutory and constitutional protections in court.'' Simply  put, servicemembers and veterans don't want this CRA, and they are  watching this vote closely.   Mr. President, forced arbitration is the prime example of a rigged  system whereby powerful corporations and interests play by different  sets of rules than average Americans. When a normal person defrauds  another person, that person is entitled to seek a resolution in court.  It is wrong for us to allow major corporations to create their own  justice system that serves their own interests at the expense of  American consumers, families, servicemembers, and veterans.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution and to permit the CFPB  arbitration rule to go into effect.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
