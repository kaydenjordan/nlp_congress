 Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise this evening to introduce  legislation with my friend and colleague from Delaware, Senator Chris  Coons, called the Reach Every Mother and Child Act of 2019. I am  delighted to say that we have 22 bipartisan cosponsors for our  initiative. Our legislation would make it the policy of the United  States to lead an effort to end preventable deaths of mothers,  newborns, and young children in the developing world by the year 2030.   Due in part to American leadership and generosity, many lives have  already been saved. Since 1990, the annual number of deaths of children  under the age of 5 has been cut in half. Nevertheless, far too many  mothers, newborns, and young children under the age of 5 still succumb  to disease and malnutrition that could easily have been prevented.   Every day, approximately 800 women die from preventable causes that  are related to pregnancy and childbirth. In addition, more than 15,000  children under the age of 5 die every day from treatable conditions,  such as prematurity, pneumonia, and diarrhea, with malnutrition being  the underlying cause in nearly half of those deaths.   Our bill aims to reach these mothers and children with simple,  proven, cost-effective interventions that we know will help them  survive. A concentrated effort could end preventable maternal and child  deaths worldwide by the year 2030. However, continued American  leadership and support from the international community are critical to  success.   To achieve this ambitious goal, our bill would require the  implementation of a strategy to scale up the most effective  interventions to save as many lives as possible. This idea is central  to our bill. We do not have to guess at what interventions will work.  The reality is that more than 15,000 children die each day of  conditions that we know how to treat right now. These lifesaving  interventions include clean birthing practices, vaccines, nutritional  supplements, handwashing with soap, and other basic needs that remain  elusive for far too many women and children in developing countries.  This is what must change.   In addition, our bill would establish a Maternal and Child Survival  Coordinator at the USAID, who would focus on implementing the 5-year  strategy and verifying that the most effective interventions are being  scaled up in target countries.   The bill would improve government efficiency across several agencies  that would collaborate with the Coordinator to identify and promote the  most effective treatments to end preventable maternal and child deaths  globally. To promote transparency and greater accountability, our bill  would also require detailed public reporting on progress toward  implementing this strategy.   Finally, our legislation would encourage the USAID to help pay for  successful programs that are run by nongovernmental entities. The  message that we want to send to all of our partners in the private  sector, the nonprofit sector, the faith community, and in local and  international civil society groups is this: If you can figure out an  effective way to increase the likelihood that mothers and their  children will survive childbirth in those first 5 vulnerable years of  life, we want to acknowledge your contributions.   We realize that the government does not have all of the answers and  that if we and our partners in the private sector all work together,  whether they be nonprofits, foundations, the faith community, local and  international government-sponsored organizations, or civil society  groups, we can solve this problem.   Improving the health and well-being of mothers and children around  the world have far-reaching social and economic benefits as well. The  USAID estimates and identifies examples of the return on our  investments in numerous priority countries. For example, in  Afghanistan, Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, South Sudan, Rwanda, and Yemen, the  USAID estimates that its health investments may yield a 9-to-1 return  in economic and societal benefits by the year 2035.   The USAID also estimates its return on investment in the form of  resources mobilized, which is a measure based on additional dollar  investments that are made by country governments or local organizations  or by cost savings within a health system from increased efficiencies.  In Senegal, for example, the USAID estimates $204 million in resources  mobilized by 2025, which is a 656-to-1 return on the USAID's  investment. In India, it estimates that a $25.5 billion investment by  the year 2025 is a striking nearly 3,000-to-1 return on the USAID's  investment.   Other bipartisan initiatives, such as the successful President's  Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which was started by  President George W. Bush, demonstrate that results-driven interventions  can turn the tide for global health challenges. In applying lessons  learned from past initiatives, our bill would provide the focus and the  tools necessary to accelerate progress toward a goal that we should all  be able to embrace, which is to end preventable maternal and child  deaths.   I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Coons and me and our 22  cosponsors in supporting this legislation that will literally save the  lives of mothers and children around the world by doing what we know  works.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Capito, Ms. Duckworth, and Ms.          Murkowski):   S. 1770. A bill to improve the identification and support of children  and families who experience trauma; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.
