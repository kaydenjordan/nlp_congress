 Madam President, in Nashville, we have a saying: It  all begins with a song. That is the truth, but that is not where the  story ends. It is where it begins.   Every record that makes it out into the world is backed by a team of  hard-working and creative individuals whose job is to bring the music  to the masses: the songwriters, who find a way to express feelings that  we mere mortals could never hope to put down on paper; the studio  musicians, whose refined techniques satisfy even the most sensitive  microphones; the producers, whose vision and intuition can turn a song  into a hit cut; and the label heads, whose job it is to take a chance  on new artists in hopes of discovering the next country music  superstar.   Each year the music industry's movers and shakers come together to  decide who among them is worthy of a place in the industry's most  sought-after circle: the Country Music Hall of Fame.   The Country Music Association inducted their first Hall of Fame class  in 1961. Since then, the CMA has welcomed some of the most well-known  and beloved members of Nashville's entertainment community into the  Hall's ranks. This year's inductees have made their mark on both sides  of the studio glass.   Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn--we know them as Brooks & Dunn--started  out as solo singer-songwriters, but rocketed to stardom as a duo.   Their first album produced four No. 1 singles and sold almost 3  million copies, all in the pre-smartphone, pre-streaming era. Since  then, Kix and Ronnie's over 40 top 10 hits, 20 No. 1 singles, and 12  platinum-plus albums have earned them the distinction of being one of  the most successful country duos of all time. They have done it all  while writing their own songs, designing their own shows, and  supporting the art of up-and-coming performers.   This dedication to the future of country is why Brooks & Dunn will be  inducted into the Hall of Fame in the ``Modern Era Artist'' category.   Ray Stevens--when we think about country music, many times, we are  thinking about steel guitars and broken hearts, but this year's second  Hall of Fame inductee really just wants to make you smile.   Ray Stevens is one of the most successful comedy recording artists of  all time, but he made his mark in Nashville as a songwriter, studio  musician, producer, and gospel singer, in addition to being a star  comic and country entertainer.   If you look at his catalog, there really is something for everyone.  His work spoke to fans in need of a laugh or sometimes spiritual  guidance or a song to sing along to after a hard day's work.   Ray's wonderful sense of humor, open heart, and commitment to  entertainment as an art form made him a Music City standout and the  perfect choice to earn the distinction of ``Veterans Era Artist'' in  the Country Music Hall of Fame.   Jerry Bradley--this year's third and final inductee--may not have  invented country music, but no one on Music Row would deny the impact  his work has had on the success of generations of country stars. Jerry  Bradley began his career in music as Nashville was on the brink of  transformation. He understood that fans and artists alike were looking  to explore a new sound, and he gave them exactly what they were looking  for. He gave them the Nashville sound. He signed bands no other label  would take a chance on, he mixed records no other producer could match,  and he embraced the importance of the crossover artist as the  ambassador of this new Nashville sound. His tendency to ignore  conventional wisdom more than paid off. He achieved commercial success  and earned the attention of Nashville's tastemakers before becoming one  of them himself. This year, the Country Music Association will induct  Jerry into the Hall of Fame as a nonperformer but also as one of the  most influential people in the history of the entertainment industry.   Today, I encourage all of my colleagues to take a moment to think  about their favorite song--whether it is a country song, a pop song, a  classic rock hit, it is the soundtrack of our lives--and to remember  how it made them feel the very first time they heard it and how many  times they have enjoyed singing it when a memory pops into their heads.  This year's Country Music Hall of Fame inductees--Kix Brooks, Ronnie  Dunn, Ray Stevens, and Jerry Bradley--are responsible for making  millions of people feel that exact same way about their very own  favorite song. The body of work these men represent is more than just a  series of accomplishments; it is a gift to all of us who enjoy the  music they have made.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
