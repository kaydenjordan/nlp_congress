 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2353. This bill  will reform our career and technical education system, and strengthen  the programs in my district in Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, there are jobs available in my district right now, but  there aren't enough trained workers. This bill will help businesses and  schools partner to prepare students for jobs in today's in-demand  industries.   We need to accommodate the needs of many different types of students  like Steve Nunemaker from Ephrata, Pennsylvania, who, at the age of 47,  graduated from Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology with a degree in  engineering computer-aided drafting.   CTE programs are vital to training workers for new careers. The jobs  that are available are good, family-sustaining jobs. So many people in  this country are ready to learn and eager to work.   I would like to thank again Representatives Thompson and  Krishnamoorthi for their leadership, and I rise to urge my colleagues  to support this bill.
