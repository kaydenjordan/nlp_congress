 Madam President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for  his clarion call for the U.S. Senate to assert its constitutional  responsibility  [[Page S20]]  when it comes to the prospect of a war with Iran.   He has referenced, many times, the War Powers Act. The War Powers  Act, students of history will remember, was passed by the U.S. Congress  after the end of the Vietnam war so Congress would assert, with  specificity, its authority when it came to the execution of a war. The  President at the time, Richard Nixon, opposed the War Powers Act and  vetoed it, and because of what the United States had endured during the  course of the Vietnam war, Congress overrode the veto of President  Nixon to make it clear, with the War Powers Act, that we would never  ever, by design, find ourselves in the same moral predicament we did  with the war in Vietnam.   Almost 50,000 American lives were lost in that war in Vietnam, a war  which was not a declared war under the Constitution but one which still  exacted a heavy, incalculable price on American families--families I  know and everyone knows, whose lives were touched by that Vietnam war,  whose sons and daughters may have served or may have given their lives  in service. The decision was made in Congress never again. We are not  going to let this happen again. We are not going to find ourselves  backsliding into a war.   The American people, through their elected men and women representing  them in Congress, will make the decision as to whether it is time for  us to go to war and will make the decision as to whether our men and  women in uniform are going to risk their lives at war. The decision  will be made by the American people through their elected  representatives in Congress. It was not a novel idea. We find it in  this little Constitution, which we are all handed when we take the oath  of office.   As Senator Kaine from Virginia has noted, article I, section 8, in  just a few words, says: The Congress shall have the power to declare  war. It is not equivocal. There are no footnotes, asterisks, or  question marks. The Congress shall have the authority to declare war.   Now, at this moment in time, with the assassination of General  Soleimani and the escalation of the conflict between the United States  and Iran, Senator Kaine and I come to the floor and ask this Congress,  Republicans and Democrats alike: Do these words count? Do we have a  constitutional responsibility to stand up and speak up and to challenge  this President or any President of either political party when they  start moving us toward a moment of war which could easily claim the  lives of many Americans?   That is the purpose of our resolution. It is simple and  straightforward, but it really goes to a fundamental question. The men  and women who serve this country in uniform--God bless them for their  sacrifice and their courage. We know that when they take the oath to  serve, they are prepared to risk their lives in service. Many of us  have attended the funerals of servicemembers who gave their lives in  Iraq and Afghanistan and so many other places. It is a heartbreaking  experience to see that emotional family leaving a church or a synagogue  after a service honoring someone in uniform who has given their life  for this country. That is so fundamental.   Senator Kaine and I have come to the floor today to say we are  finding ourselves now moving, day by day, closer and closer to a  confrontation with Iran that could result in a war. What Senator Kaine  has catalogued and gone through is this long buildup under the Trump  administration that brings us to this moment.   To think President Trump inherited from President Obama an  international agreement that included the signatories of not only our  traditional European allies but also China and Russia to stop Iran from  developing a nuclear weapon; to think that that agreement was being  monitored by international overseers who reported back to us that they  had ready access throughout the nation of Iran when it came to making  certain that the JCPOA agreement was lived up to; to think that that at  least gave us the assurance that Iran would not develop a nuclear  weapon--and then this President, with a series of tweets and actions,  swept it away and said we are going to ignore this treaty, we are going  to walk away from it, and we are going to confront the Iranians in a  variety of ways, as Senator Kaine has spelled out.   So we come to the floor this afternoon to really appeal to our  colleagues on both sides of the aisle. On behalf of the American  people, let us learn the lessons of history--a lesson bitterly learned  during the Vietnam war--that if Congress does nothing, a war can  develop and continue at great human cost.   I know the moments of great decision that are made in the U.S.  Congress, and I have been fortunate to be part of some of them. I  remember October 16, 2002, as if it were yesterday. I remember that  well, at that place that I point to, where in the early morning hours,  three of us--three Senators stood and spoke to one another as we left  to go home. There had just been a vote for an authorization for use of  military force in Iraq. The three of us had gathered in the well,  including Senator Paul Wellstone from Minnesota and Senator Kent Conrad  from North Dakota, and we looked at one another, having all three voted  against the invasion of Iraq, and realized we were headed home to face  the electorate on that decision. It was an emotional moment.   I remember saying to Senator Wellstone, who had voted against the  invasion of Iraq, as I had: Paul, I hope this doesn't cost you the  election. He said: Dick, if it does, it is all right because that is  what I was elected to do, to come here and to vote on issues. Is it  possible there is any issue more important than the issue of asking  American families to give their children in service of this country in  a war?   Senator Wellstone passed away a few days later in an airplane crash.  It was my last conversation with him, but I remember that moment, and I  remember the responsibility we had. What Senator Kaine and I are doing  now is to appeal to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Do not  walk away from our responsibility when it comes to the future decision  of whether we go to war with Iran. Stand up for those American families  who sent us here to do our constitutional duty and engage in the debate  as to whether it is the right thing at the right moment of history or  whether it is an impulsive decision by a President who broke away from  a political campaign meeting to authorize the assassination of General  Soleimani and then returned to the campaign meeting. Make the decision  as to whether this is the right moment in history. Don't point to the  President that it is his responsibility; it is our responsibility. That  is what this Constitution says.   (Mr. BOOZMAN assumed the Chair.)   Now, with that responsibility, we need to stand up and act. I am  honored to join Senator Kaine. We have filed our resolution. We are  seeking a ruling by the Parliamentarian, and we want to move forward on  a schedule for a debate on the floor of the Senate. It may be the  single most important debate we face this year for many years to come.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from  Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the  Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen), and the Senator from  Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.
