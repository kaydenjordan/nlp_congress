 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day.   National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is an opportunity for  citizens to recognize the difficult and sometimes impossible jobs  police officers have chosen to do.   There is no doubt that morale across law enforcement in our country  has decreased due to negative public sentiment over the last few years.   However, our selfless public servants have not let that deter them  from doing their jobs.   To have a strong police force, the officers must know that their  communities support the work that they are doing.   That is why I am proud to recognize our men and women in uniform.   I encourage everyone in the First Congressional District to go above  and beyond today and every day to show their appreciation to our law  enforcement. They are the best among us and deserve our unwavering  support.                            ____________________
