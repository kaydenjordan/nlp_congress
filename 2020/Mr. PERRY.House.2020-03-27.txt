 Mr. Speaker, the coronavirus emanating from China is here.  We can't stop that. We can't go back, but I am distressed by the  Hobson's choice that we have.   It is ravaging our communities. It is ravaging our healthcare system.  It is ravaging our economy. And we should be solely focused on healing  our communities and saving the small businesses, the big businesses,  and the economy that make America great.   So as we discuss this and also discuss a fourth--yet another-- package, no more Hobson's choice, no more billion-dollar bailouts for  things that are unrelated, no more policies that are long-standing for  a short-standing issue that needs our critical attention.   Mr. Speaker, whatever we do, let's do no harm.
