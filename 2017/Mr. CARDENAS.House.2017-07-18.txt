 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in opposition to  H.R. 806. I call it the ``Smog Is Back'' bill.   I was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley. As a boy, I was not  allowed to play outside due to smog alerts, and you couldn't see the  mountains just a few miles away. I have told my kids. They don't know  what a smog alert is. You get to see the mountains 365 days a year.   That is because we got smart about cutting pollution. We passed  commonsense regulations, and the impact was remarkable. Yet today, as I  stand here, this Congress is trying to strip those protections and take  us back to a dangerous time. It is not a joke, and this is shameful.   Just over a year ago, my first grandchild was born. It infuriates me  that he could grow up with the same restrictions that I had after we  have made so much progress. We should be making the world a better  place for our children and grandchildren.    Mr. Chairman, when it comes to smog, it is not good to go back to the  [[Page H5945]]  future. It is just wrong. I urge my colleagues to oppose this  legislation for the sake of all children.
