 Mr. Speaker, today the President put forward his budget  proposal. It will be damaging to the people in our communities and the  places that we call home.   It cuts Medicaid by over $600 billion and cuts the food stamp program  by over 25 percent, affecting the most needy within our communities. It  slashes infrastructure programs, eliminates TIGER grants, cuts student  loan and financial aid programs, and includes catastrophic cuts to the  Environmental Protection Agency.   For my home State of Hawaii, this budget zeroes out Federal funding  for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grants, the Native Hawaiian Loan  Guarantee program, and cuts Native Hawaiian education programs by  nearly $33 million, crippling the progress that has been made for over  30 years to strengthen Native Hawaiian early education, literacy,  gifted and talented education programs, higher education, vocational  programs, and more.   I strongly oppose this budget, and I look forward to working with my  colleagues in Congress to pass a budget that actually serves the people  and our planet.                            ____________________
