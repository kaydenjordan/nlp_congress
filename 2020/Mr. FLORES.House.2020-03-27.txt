 Mr. Speaker, a few days ago, White House and  congressional Republicans presented a bold, bipartisan plan of action  to help hardworking Americans deal with our current challenges. This  plan puts much-needed resources where they are most  [[Page H1831]]  needed: our families, our healthcare system, our small businesses, our  other businesses affected by this crisis, and our State and local  governments.   One of the things that we found out during this crisis is that our  healthcare system supply chain relies far too much on foreign sources  like Communist China. We can never allow this to happen again.   In order to fix that problem, I am pleased the Senate and House  negotiators included my request to help fund $3.5 billion to utilize  three existing centers in innovation for advanced development  manufacturing.   One of these CIADMs is part of the Texas A&M University System, which  I represent. These public-private CIADM partnerships are uniquely  positioned to accelerate research, development, and manufacture of  vaccines and therapeutics to mitigate pandemics, and they do it right  here in America.                                time  1100
