 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3456) to redesignate Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge as  the Nathaniel P. Reed Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3456         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REDESIGNATION OF THE HOBE SOUND NATIONAL WILDLIFE                     REFUGE.         (a) Redesignation.--The Hobe Sound National Wildlife       Refuge, located in the State of Florida, is redesignated as       the ``Nathaniel P. Reed Hobe Sound National Wildlife       Refuge''.        (b) References.--Any reference in any statute, rule,       regulation, Executive order, publication, map, paper, or       other document of the United States to the Hobe Sound       National Wildlife Refuge is deemed to refer to the Nathaniel       P. Reed Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3456 would rename the Hobe Sound National Wildlife  Refuge, located in southeast Florida, after Nathaniel P. Reed, who  passed away on July 11, 2018, at the age of 84.   Nathaniel P. Reed was a prominent conservationist who served as an  Assistant Secretary of the Interior from 1971 to 1977 and later  returned to Florida to form an advocacy group to help preserve and  restore the Everglades. He also joined forces with former Senator Bob  Graham to launch the Florida Conservation Coalition.   Renaming the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge, which is located  near his home in Florida, in honor of Nathaniel P. Reed is a tribute to  his legacy of conservation and public land stewardship.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur  in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 6287) to provide competitive  grants for the operation, security, and maintenance of certain  memorials to victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         On page 2, lines 9 and 10, strike ``, the Pentagon, and       United Airlines Flight 93'' and insert ``and the Pentagon''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6287, sponsored by Congressman Tom MacArthur,  authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to award grants through a  competitive process to nonprofit organizations to operate, provide  security, maintain, and increase visitation at U.S. memorials to the  victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. This bill  passed the House by voice vote on September 12.   Throughout our Nation's history, Congress has supported public- private partnerships with nongovernmental organizations for the  operation and maintenance of memorials and museums of national  significance. Such partnerships exist at the Oklahoma City National  Memorial and Museum and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,  for example.   The Senate has amended the bill to remove the Flight 93 site in  Pennsylvania from the program at the supporting foundation's request.   This bill will ensure that our Nation's other 9/11 memorials are  maintained and preserved for future generations to visit, learn, and  reflect. May we never forget the nearly 3,000 Americans we lost that  fateful day.  [[Page H10570]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge concurrence in the Senate  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
