 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember  the life of Corporal Francis James Jury of Clearfield, Pennsylvania.   Corporal Francis Jury was reported missing on December 2, 1950, at 23  years old. Corporal Jury was deemed missing during the battle with  enemy forces near the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea.   On July 27, 2018, following the summit between President Donald Trump  and North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea returned the remains  of 55 American servicemembers killed during the Korean war. Following  DNA testing, Corporal Jury was identified as one of those 55 members.   Madam Speaker, we still feel the pain of those missing from conflicts  fought generations ago, and we are forever indebted to their service.   My prayers are with Corporal Jury's family during this solemn time.   It is my hope with his return his family is able to find peace and  solace in knowing their loved one died a hero in service to the Nation.                            ____________________
