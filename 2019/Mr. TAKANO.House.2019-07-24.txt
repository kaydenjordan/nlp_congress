 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Ms. Chu, for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in affirming the  dignity and respect for married LGBTQ couples.   H.R. 3299, the PRIDE Act, would bring parity to LGBTQ couples and the  benefits afforded to heterosexual married couples in our Tax Code.   The PRIDE Act allows married same-sex couples to file claims for tax  credits and refunds back to the year of their marriage. Allowing these  claims to be dated back to the original marriage dates respects the  spirit of the Supreme Court's Windsor decision and underscores that the  IRS must recognize same-sex marriages and afford them equal protection  under the law.    Equality takes many forms. It means civil, social, and financial  equality. This legislation directly tackles financial inequality  created by parts of our Tax Code head-on.   The PRIDE Act also modifies the Tax Code to change language used to  distinguish married couples to be gender-neutral. By changing dated and  limited terms such as ``husband and wife,'' our laws will become more  inclusive.   Language is powerful. We must ensure that the language in our laws  reflects our values and does not exclude members of the LGBTQ community  from enjoying the same benefits as their heterosexual counterparts.   Congress must do everything it can to guarantee equal treatment under  the law for every person, regardless of their gender identity or sexual  orientation.   This bill upholds our commitment to family values by ensuring that  every family, including LGBTQ families, can enjoy the same benefits in  our Tax Code, and it helps us get one step closer to full equality.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
