 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment significantly alters critical  environmental review requirements and limits opportunity for the public  to challenge forest management projects.   Restricting NEPA analysis to two alternatives may seem like it will  save time and money, but this cuts right at the heart of critical  environmental protections. NEPA doesn't hurt forest management  projects; bad planning, ignoring science, and disingenuous intentions  hurt forest management projects.   NEPA supports collaboration through public participation. It allows  many voices and different voices to participate in the planning  process,  [[Page H4168]]  which leads to better results and reduced costs.   NEPA ensures Federal agencies consider all alternatives, without  requiring that agencies select the most environmentally friendly option  or value the environment over other concerns.   Much like the forestry provisions in the base text of this bill, we  have been down this road before. House Republicans tried to include  harmful provisions to scale bedrock environmental laws and restrict  access to the courts during the omnibus negotiations.   All of these toxic proposals were rejected by the Senate. Let's not  make the Senate say ``no'' for a second time.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, if my colleagues across the aisle are serious about the  long-term health of our forests, they should stop and pause and listen  to scientists, who tell us climate change threatens in a very factual  and scientific way and direct way the health of our forests, wildlife,  and the ever-increasing forest fires that we must confront every year.  We can use NEPA as a tool to consider these impacts, and if we are  smart, we will strengthen the law instead of weakening it piece by  piece.   The issue of forest health is a serious issue. This amendment does  not deal with the complexity of the seriousness of this issue. If,  indeed, we are to deal with this issue, then it has to be comprehensive  and it has to be looked at, not by eliminating protections and public  access, but by truly doing something for the long-term health of these  forests, and that is to consider all available information and not deny  scientific information in the process of blaming NEPA or any other law  that exists for the public and for the protection of our forests as the  reason why we are having forest fires.   Forest fires are a direct result of climate change, and as such, not  to consider that as part and parcel of a solution is a grave mistake  that will not solve the problem.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. It should not be tucked into  this farm bill. It merits its own proper discussion and debate in this  House, and that is the direction we should go.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Alaska.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment exempts all national forests in Alaska  from the Forest Service's Roadless Rule, one of the country's most  important conservation safeguards.   Inventoried roadless areas account for only 2 percent of our Nation's  land mass, but they provide invaluable benefits: clean drinking water  for over 60 million Americans, wildlife habitats for numerous  threatened and endangered species, and they act as critical carbon  sinks that mitigate the impacts of climate change. All of these  benefits are threatened by this amendment.   Nationwide, the Roadless Rule is incredibly popular. Our constituents  understand the importance of keeping intact roadless areas and managing  our last truly wild places in a manner that protects old-growth forest  and other precious resources from the pressures of development and  extraction.   It is not just people in the lower 48. Alaskans understand the  importance of protecting the roadless landscape. That is why hundreds  of businesses in southeast Alaska have joined together to oppose  overturning the recently adopted Tongass Forest Plan and efforts like  this amendment to overturn protection for roadless areas.   These businesses rely on clean water and healthy forests to support  thriving salmon populations and a robust tourist economy. By rolling  back safeguards that protect old-growth forests from harmful  development, this amendment threatens fundamental linchpins of the  regional economy.   The Roadless Rule is not a job killer, as some make it out to be,  because the Tongass Forest Plan balances protections of the old-growth  forest by allowing public roads, hydropower projects, utility  connectors, and access to inholdings, including mines. So its  application in Alaska does not adversely affect community access or  economic development projects in the legitimate public interest.   An exception for Alaska is a major policy change that hasn't had a  hearing or any other form of consideration in the House. This  controversial provision shouldn't be stuck in this farm bill without  any accountability to the American public.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, Alaska recently lost in Federal court on  this very issue. The Supreme Court refused to hear the State's appeal  of a ruling that struck down the Tongass exemption. This ended the  case.   This amendment attempts to run around that ruling and would exempt  Alaska from protections that are widely supported and intended to  protect our pristine public lands.   With regard to the Roadless Rule, if the very important and  significant issues we confront, whether it is immigration, whether it  is employment, whether it is education, the issues of poverty and  hunger in this country, I would suggest that the cause for not finding  solutions rests in this Chamber, it doesn't rest with the Roadless  Rule.   Mr. Chairman, I recommend a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  [[Page H4170]]
