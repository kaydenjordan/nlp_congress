 Madam President, let me start by saying to our  colleague, the Senator from New Jersey who just spoke on the  floor, that we are all thankful for his passion to make sure that this  country lives up to its promise and for sharing with this body his  personal testimony about racism and the need for all of us to move  urgently to address the fundamental inequities at the heart of our  society and institutions. I don't think it is an overstatement to say  that we are at a pivotal point in our country. It is a moment of  reckoning. Historians will carefully examine this moment to see how our  country responded to see which path we took, how the Senate responded,  how each Senator responded.    The immediate spark for this moment was the brutal murder of George  Floyd by agents of government. In Minneapolis, a police officer aided  and abetted by three other officers--we all witnessed the horror of  George Floyd gasping ``I can't breathe'' as a White officer kept his  knee on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds; three other officers  participated in the crime. All four need to be brought to justice, but  the murder of George Floyd was not an isolated event in the United  States of America. It is not the first time a Black man has called out  ``I can't breathe'' as he was choked or lynched. We can draw a straight  line that runs from slavery to Jim Crow to legal segregation to de  facto segregation to institutional racism to the killings of Michael  Brown, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Breonna Taylor, and  George Floyd, as well as the vigilante killings of Trayvon Martin and  Ahmaud Arbery and others.   The White police officer who looked at the video as he kept his knee  on the neck of George Floyd thought he would get away with his actions  because he and so many others had not been held accountable before. He  thought he could get away with it, based on his experience. We must  change that. As Senator Booker said, we can have our moments of  silence, we can have vigils, but that is not enough. It is not nearly  enough. This is a moment that demands real action, real change, and  real results, starting with changes in police practices and the  systemic racism and institutions that have shielded those who engage in  misconduct from accountability.   Those changes must include establishing truly independent oversight  mechanisms to ensure that those police officers who betrayed the public  trust are held accountable. We must ban outright the use of chokeholds  unless the officer's life is in imminent danger, and we must use  Federal leverage to incentivize deescalatory practices over escalatory  ones. We need national standards backed up by real consequences for  those who do not comply, and we must establish a Federal databank that  tracks reports of police misconduct--not simply unjustified killings by  police, but all forms of misconduct. These and others changes are  required to ensure the protection of citizens, communities, and an  overwhelming number of police officers who are meeting their sworn  oaths to protect our communities. Bad cops are bad for good cops, and  we need to make sure we have a system in place to punish misconduct and  reward those who are upholding their sworn duty.   Now, while the murder of George Floyd and others has, again, exposed  the need for systemic change in police accountability, it also cries  out for systemic change to address racism embedded in our institutions.  The need for additional change does not mean we have not made progress  in our country on key issues of civil rights and political rights, but  it does mean we have a very long unfinished road ahead to achieve the  promise of equal justice, equal rights, and equal opportunity in  America. The murder of George Floyd comes in the middle of a pandemic  that has inflicted disproportionate harm on communities of color,  especially the Black community, because of deep underlying disparities  in our society that have been well documented. It comes amid a pandemic  that has shone a harsh light on deep inequality in our education  systems, including the digital divide and the homework gap, but so much  more.   The reality is we must put all of our systems under the microscope  and very intentionally root out racial bias and discriminatory impact.  In the city of Baltimore, in my State of Maryland, we have a terrible  legacy of housing segregation. Baltimore City had an explicit committee  on segregation, which was followed by harsh and restrictive covenants  and redlining that blocked our Black community from economic mobility.  That may seem like a long time ago, but the harmful impact of those  laws is lasting, and you can still trace those red lines separating our  neighborhoods today.   So let us be very clear here that these disparities can be directly  traced to policies that were designed to discriminate. For decades,  Federal, State, and local policies covering issues from housing to  banking amounted to nothing less than state--sponsored efforts to deny  African-Americans the basic equal rights they are owed under our  Constitution. While many of these policies are off the books today,  their legacy endures and practices endure, and it is our obligation at  every level of government to uproot and destroy those embedded policies  with the same kind of deliberation that they were put in place in the  first place.    Now, the protests taking place in Minneapolis and all across the  country are an expression of the deep pain caused by the continued  death toll and other harms caused by our failure as a nation to address  the underlying inequities in our society and in our institutions. That  is why people have taken to the streets to protest. It was Dr. King who  said: There can be no justice without peace, and there can be no peace  without justice. Real justice and real peace is long overdue.   Last night, in response to those protests, we witnessed something I  never thought we would see in the United States of America. We had the  President of the United States call up and order military police to  fire tear gas and rubber bullets at peaceful protesters to clear a path  for him to conduct a photo op in front of Saint John's Episcopal  church, a historic church close by to the White House.   Here is what Mariann Budde, the bishop of the Episcopal archdiocese  of Washington, had to say about what the President did. She made a  statement that outlined the President's abuse of their church for his  political purposes, and then the church itself issued the following  statement--I should point out that the pastor of the church and many of  the parishioners were at the protest and providing water and nutrition  to some of the protesters.   Here is what the leaders of the church said:         We at St. John's Church were shocked at the surprise visit       from the President this evening and even more appalled at the       violent clearing of Lafayette Square to make the visit       possible. St. John's is a community that welcomes all--from       powerful presidents to the homeless--to worship God. We fully       espouse the words of our Baptismal Covenant, which says, in       part, that we ``will strive for justice and peace among all       people and respect the dignity of every human being.''  [[Page S2656]]         Living that covenant, we stand with those peacefully       protesting the tragic and unnecessary death of George Floyd,       and the far too many who came before him.        We pray that our nation finally confronts its history of       racism and, as a result, can fully embrace the peace of God       that passes all understanding.    Those are really words that we should have heard from our President.  Instead, they came from religious leaders responding to the President's  use of their church for political purposes--and, in the process,  violating the First Amendment rights of peaceful protesters, the rights  of those protesters to peacefully assemble, as the President ordered up  military police to clear a peaceful crowd.   We also listened in disbelief as Mark Esper, the Secretary of  Defense, talked about turning public places into ``battle spaces'' to  be dominated. This is the Secretary of Defense, who is charged with  defending our country, talking about turning rubber bullets and tear  gas against peaceful protesters here in the United States.   We witnessed General Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  in full military uniform, presiding over the breakup of this peaceful  demonstration.   I remind Secretary Esper and Chairman Milley that their oath is to  support and defend the Constitution of the United States, and they are  not permitted by that oath to follow illegal orders, even from the  President of the United States.   The President of the United States can give them what orders he  chooses, but the Constitution and their oath requires that their first  loyalty be to the United States of America and not to any one  individual.   So I think it is important that we investigate this incident and the  role that the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs of Staff played in  following the President's illegal orders, illegal because they  represented a gross violation of the First Amendment rights of citizens  of the United States to peacefully assemble.   Let me close with this. I said at the outset that this is a moment  when our country has different paths to choose and this Senate is very  much a part of deciding which path we will take. Will we take the path  that Senator Booker said of not only having moments of silence, but  working together to pass true reform to address police accountability,  to address other forms of systemic racism? Will we be willing to stand  up to the President of the United States when he violates the civil  rights and First Amendment rights of American citizens?   That is really a test for this institution, whether we are willing to  do our job and uphold our oath to the Constitution of the United  States.   Thank you, Madam President.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
