 Mr. Speaker, in recognition of National School  Counseling Week and in honor of the many dedicated school counselors in  Rhode Island and across the Nation, every day, school counselors are  out on the front lines helping our students navigate their educational  and career pathways. They provided advice and support during the most  formative years of students' lives, helping them develop the skills to  succeed in school, in the workforce, and in life.   Unfortunately, in too many schools across the country, students do  not have access to school counselors and counselors do not have the  resources they need to do their jobs.   Mr. Speaker, it is Congress' responsibility to provide schools and  counselors with the funding that they need to properly educate and  guide our Nation's youth.   In recognition of National School Counseling Week, I ask my  colleagues to join me in renewing our promise to fulfill that  responsibility. Our students, Mr. Speaker, are depending on us.                            ____________________
