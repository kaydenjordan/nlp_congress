 Madam President, today, I am introducing important  environmental literacy legislation, the No Child Left Inside Act, along  with Senator Collins and Senator Merkley and Congressman Sarbanes. Our  bipartisan, bicameral bill focuses on the fundamental goal of public  education, which is to equip the next generation with the knowledge,  skills, and experiences to understand the world around them and their  ability to shape it. In the face of a global climate crisis, it is  essential that all students graduate with environmental literacy skills  to secure and sustain their future.   Environmental education provides broad benefits. It has been shown to  enhance student achievement in science and other core subjects and to  increase student engagement and critical thinking skills. Moreover, it  promotes healthy lifestyles by encouraging kids to get outside.   Yet, environmental education often gets crowded out of the school  day. In a Rhode Island Environmental Education Association survey,  teachers identified challenges to integrating environmental education  into an already crowded curriculum and ranked professional development  as most helpful to remedying the situation. Some of the practices put  in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have shown real promise.  As the pandemic took hold, Rhode Island's environmental educators  sprang into action, creating outdoor learning support opportunities and  virtual programs for students as they did school from home. We need to  build on these successes and build stronger connections between  environmental education organizations and our public schools. That is  what the No Child Left Inside Act aims to do.   The No Child Left Inside Act establishes a new grant program to  support States in the development and implementation of environmental  literacy plans to integrate environmental education and field  experiences into the core academic program in public schools, with an  emphasis on professional development in environmental education for  teachers. With this funding, States will provide grants for  partnerships between school districts and  [[Page S1296]]  parks, natural resource management agencies, educator preparation  programs, museums, or other organizations with expertise in engaging  young people with real world examples of environmental and scientific  concepts. The legislation also establishes a pilot program for outdoor  school education programs that offer intensive, hands-on learning  experiences, such as residential programs and summer camps.   The No Child Left Inside Act will also help coordinate Federal  efforts on environmental education. It requires the Secretary of  Education to establish an environmental literacy advisory panel to  coordinate and report on environmental literacy activities across  Federal Agencies. It also will provide easy access to environmental  education resources through the Department of Education's website.   The No Child Left Inside Act has the support of nearly 100  organizations, representing educators, parks, museums, environmental  organizations, and community-based organizations at the national,  State, and local levels. They stand ready and willing to partner with  schools across the Nation. The Federal Government should be a partner  too. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring and  passing the No Child Left Inside Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Daines, Ms. Lummis,          Mr. Ricketts, and Mr. Rounds):   S. 1244. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prevent  double dipping between tax credits and grants or loans for clean  vehicle manufacturers; to the Committee on Finance.
