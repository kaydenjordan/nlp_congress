 Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. Con. Res. 46, which was submitted earlier today.    I further ask that the concurrent resolution be  agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.
