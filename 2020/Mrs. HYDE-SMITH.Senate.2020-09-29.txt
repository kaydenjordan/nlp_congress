 Mr. President, I would like to recognize  Misty Britt, an ICU nurse at Kings Daughters Medical Center in my  hometown of Brookhaven, MS. During the pandemic, Misty has truly  stepped up to be a leader in the hospital. She manages the nurses on  her rotation, picks up extra shifts; reads, studies, and learns about  the virus; and has helped streamline the workflow to make the  environment in the hospital more manageable for health care workers and  patients.   Misty cares for her patients with compassion and empathy. She holds  their hand when they are afraid, assists with family FaceTime calls  when family isn't allowed to visit, and forms close relationships with  each patient by offering love and encouragement. No matter the  circumstance, Misty is by her patient's side helping them fight every  day for their lives. It is nurses like Misty who do the mundane and the  heroic work with tender loving care and are able to provide patients  more comfort during difficult times.   For nurses all over our Nation, it is overwhelming to witness what  COVID is doing to their patients. The physical, emotional, and mental  stress of their work continues to mount. Every day, they go to work  knowing they may lose another patient and endure more emotional strain.  I am grateful for the hard work and personal sacrifice Misty and other  ICU nurses undertake. They have my admiration.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to recognize,  Larue Lambert, who has worked for Kings Daughters Medical Center in  Brookhaven, MS, for over 20 years. Mr. Lambert worked as an ICU nurse  before moving into the house coordinator position, where he monitors  admissions and discharges, staffing needs, patient census, responds to  emergencies, and compiles detailed reports for the chief nurse.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Lambert has picked up additional  responsibilities to ensure the hospital is functioning smoothly on a  daily basis. Personal protective equipment was a huge concern for all  hospitals at the beginning of the pandemic. Mr. Lambert closely  monitors the hospital's PPE inventory and would distribute it to units  that were in need. Additionally, he picked up extra shifts when  staffing levels were low. As a frontline healthcare worker, Mr. Lambert  selflessly puts his life in danger each day to care for his fellow  Mississippians.   Larue risks not only his personal health, but the health of his close  friends and family each day while he assists in the fight against this  pandemic. I commend Larue Lambert for  [[Page S5945]]  bravely stepping up to the fight against COVID-19 for the past several  months, and I pray that he may be granted safety and good health as he  continues to serve others. He is a hero in our Brookhaven community,  and I am grateful for what he has meant to so many during the  pandemic.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to commend a  friend and frontline healthcare worker, Tammy Livingston, who is a  nurse at Kings Daughters Medical Center in my hometown of Brookhaven,  MS. Rural hospitals like this one, along with their brave staff, are  the backbone of healthcare in Mississippi.   Tammy has worked at Kings Daughters Medical Center for over 20 years.  While she has served in many positions within the hospital, she is  currently the patient care coordinator. In her role, she cares for some  of the sickest patients in the hospital by assisting her colleagues  with patients in the ICU. Within the dedicated medical unit for COVID  patients at Kings Daughters, Tammy monitors patients daily, making sure  they are comfortable and cared for at such a difficult time.   Tammy is invaluable to the Kings Daughters Medical Center. Tammy is  put in situations every day where she endures heavy stress, heart- wrenching situations, and puts herself in harm's way to care for  patients and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic. She is a  lifesaver and best friend to all of her patients. Tammy is a healthcare  hero. I am thankful for our fighters like Tammy and pray that she may  be kept safe while she serves her friends, family, and community  through this pandemic.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I commend Christina Miller, a  healthcare hero and someone who puts her life in danger every day to  help save lives. Christina is an emergency room nurse at Kings  Daughters Medical Center in Brookhaven, MS.   Christina demonstrates a remarkable selflessness and level of  compassion for her patients and coworkers. As more Americans became  infected with COVID-19, hospitals began to fill up and staffing became  a challenge. Christina immediately stepped up and volunteered to orient  on the ICU floor to help with staffing needs to help care and treat the  sickest patients.   Not only does Christina give the utmost care to her patients, she  also realizes the physical and emotional strain all healthcare workers  are feeling during these unprecedented times. Christina wanted to help  encourage her colleagues, so she began an employee appreciation program  among the emergency room nurses. This gave the nurses something to look  forward to when they arrived at work.   Throughout our Nation's history, everyday Americans bravely emerge in  times of turmoil to aid their neighbors. In the case of Christina, she  has fought on the frontlines as a nurse by stepping into harm's way to  provide care for patients affected by the virus.   Mississippi first responders and healthcare providers have  experienced a drastic change not only in their professional life but  also in their home life. The COVID-19 pandemic has been demanding of  their time, taken them away from their loved ones, and caused their  worlds to totally change. These heroes, such as Christina, are walking  examples of what selfless service looks like.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr.  Jeffrey Ross of Kings Daughters Medical Center in Brookhaven. Dr. Ross  has both served and cared for his community since he first started  practicing medicine in Brookhaven in 1990 and has risen to the  challenge of COVID-19 with great distinction. Doctors like Dr. Jeff  Ross are working through both physical and mental exhaustion during  this pandemic. They have the burden of having the ``final say'' and a  team of healthcare providers relying on their instruction daily. The  stress presented in these situations is not something healthcare  providers can simply turn off when they go off the clock. Despite all  of this pressure, these doctors continue to do their job, selflessly  managing the care of their fellow Mississippians.   Originally from Whitfield, MS, Dr. Ross earned his medical degree in  Jackson before pursuing his residency in Kentucky. He returned to  Mississippi, where he has dedicated nearly all of his adult life to  serving his neighbors. Dr. Ross and his wife, Susan, have raised three  children in the Brookhaven community.   I commend Dr. Jeffrey Ross for his personal sacrifice, dedication to  his community, and his leadership. My State is fortunate to have  doctors such as him who are focused on the health and wellness of all  Mississippians.                            ____________________
