 Mr. President. I would like to offer my  congratulations to Valley View Charolais Ranch on their 50th Annual  Bull Sale and cowherd. Valley View Charolais have some of the most  proven and popular bloodlines available. They have been bred for ease  of calving, fertility, milk, and mothering ability, as well as  performance. Valley View Charolais Ranch's efforts to produce animals  that will make money for all that are involved, including the producer,  the cowman, and the packer, have been proven. Their commitment to  producing quality 2-year-old bulls despite trends, drought, blizzards,  fighting grasshoppers, irrigation water, and cattle price cycles, is  remarkable and demonstrates their true dedication.   I commend the Westphal Family for all the dedication and passion they  have poured into the industry to be one of the Nation's leading  breeders of purebred Charolais cattle and for selling 2-year-old  Charolais bulls for 50 years.                            ____________________
