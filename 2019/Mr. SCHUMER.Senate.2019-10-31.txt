 Madam President, today we come to an inflection point in  the appropriations process this year. Leader McConnell has scheduled a  vote on the Defense appropriations bill, which comes with a certain  irony. A bill that is supposed to provide resources for our troops and  their families actually steals money from them and puts it toward a  border wall that President Trump promised Mexico would pay for.   Democrats will not vote to proceed to a bill that steals money from  our troops and their families. Republicans know it is a nonstarter. Yet  Leader McConnell has scheduled a show vote this afternoon to  demonstrate something that everyone already knows: There is nowhere  close to the necessary votes in the Senate for President Trump's border  wall and, of course, there is not in the House. So this is just a show  vote.   Leader McConnell, a few weeks ago, got on the floor and railed  against show votes. He said: I only want to put things on the floor  that are going to pass. But we all know this ain't passing. I  understand memories in politics can be short, but the exercise we will  go through today is absurd, even by those low standards.   Senate Republicans, by pursuing a partisan process, by doing  President Trump's bidding on the wall--they know he is wrong, most of  them. They are just so afraid of him they just say ``Yes, sir''  whenever he proposes an absurd idea. They repeat the same failed  strategy that led to the longest shutdown in our Nation's history. I  warned Leader McConnell and our Republican friends that if they  continue down this path, they will lead us straight to another  government shutdown, and their party and President Trump will shoulder  the responsibility. The last time, they had to retreat from that  position after the longest shutdown in history with their tails between  their legs. Isn't history teaching them anything? We know it will not  teach President Trump much, but we would hope the Republicans in the  Senate would have more sense.   Instead of standing up and defending their own position that they  want the money for the wall--however indefensible in my judgment-- Senate Republicans have resorted to bogus attacks against Democrats.  Senate Republicans accuse Democrats of delaying a pay raise for our  troops, even though, first, the pay raise is strongly bipartisan, and,  more important, the standing law of the land dictates it will go into  effect regardless of whether we pass the Defense appropriations.   Our Republican friends are so desperate to divert attention from  their  [[Page S6317]]  holding up these bills for President Trump's wall that they come up  with completely false arguments, such as the statement that if we don't  pass this, the troops will not get a pay raise.   Yesterday, Leader McConnell and President Trump repeated a slightly  less specific but even more outrageous charge, claiming that Democrats  are not supporting the fight against ISIS due to the disagreement on  appropriations. Hello. Who was it who abandoned our Kurdish friends who  led the fight against ISIS? Not the Democrats in the Senate, not even  the Republicans in the Senate--it was President Trump.   President Trump's reckless decision to greenlight President Erdogan's  invasion of northern Syria left hundreds of hardened ISIS fighters out  of jail and, according to most experts, set a course for a likely  resurgence of ISIS. But instead of blaming President Trump--although  some of them did early on--they are trying to switch the blame. It is a  typical tactic that Leader McConnell is using with more and more  regularity, but like his previous attempts, it fails.   We were briefed yesterday by senior administration officials, and  they acknowledged the fallout in the wake of the President's decision  and the need to pick up the pieces of what was their strategy to defeat  ISIS.   The majority leader and I have been working together on legislation  requiring specific plans and reports from the administration on the  ISIS threat. I hope it will receive some action on the floor soon.  Let's cut the nonsense that Democrats don't support the troops or the  fight against ISIS. It is not true. It is laughable, and it ain't going  to stick. So instead of this bunk, Leader McConnell and my Republican  friends, roll up your sleeves and work with us to get something done.   Democrats and Republicans have been working through a package of  appropriations bills, as is clear in the bills we are voting on. Where  there is agreement, we can move forward. This week has shown the Senate  can efficiently work through these bills, and we have a bipartisan buy- in. That is how Democrats want to proceed on the remainder of the  bills.   Republican friends, work with us as you did on these four bills to  come up with bipartisan bills, and we can get them done.                                 Impeachment    Mr. President, on impeachment, at least a dozen witnesses have  testified in Congress as part of the House's impeachment inquiry. The  facts that are already in the public record are troubling and require  further investigation.   The Founders greatly feared foreign interference in our elections.  Here, we have a President who allegedly used the powers of his office  to pressure or coerce a foreign leader to investigate a domestic  political rival. The matter at hand is serious; both parties must treat  it as such. But already some of our Republican colleagues have tried to  kick up as much dust as possible to distract or detract from the facts  of the case because they know the reality will be damaging to the  President if these facts prove to be true.   Last week, roughly 40 Republicans stormed the secure facility in the  Capitol in a fit of staged protest, even though one-third of them were  already allowed to participate in the hearings that were taking place.   In the Senate, my colleague Senator Graham, a veteran of the House  impeachment process, put together a resolution of trumped-up charges  that the House process was unfair, all of which have been thoroughly  debunked as misleading or baseless. Again, it is an attempt by our  Republican friends to do Donald Trump's bidding no matter how false,  reckless, or harmful that bidding is.   Meanwhile, the White House and its allies in the Congress and the  media have leveled shameful attacks against the witnesses in the House  inquiry, questioning the loyalties of a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel  and Purple Heart recipient and calling the whistleblower a treasonous  spy. That is despicable.   Worse still, reports suggest that Republicans on the House committee  and members of their staffs are conducting a vicious campaign to  deliberately disclose or cause to be disclosed the identity of  the whistleblower, placing that courageous individual's safety and that  of his or her family in jeopardy.    We are supposed to be engaging with the facts of the case on the  merits. We have a solemn constitutional duty to do so. Even the  President himself has said he would ``rather go into the details of the  case rather than the process.''   My Republican friends in Congress should stick to the facts, quit the  partisan theatrics, quit the politics of blame, and quit trying to harm  the very serious patriots whose lives and safety might be in danger.  This is a time to put country over party and examine the facts--only  the facts.                                   Pensions    Madam President, finally, on pensions, this week, Murray Energy,  which employed over 5,000 people, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy,  putting thousands of hard-working Americans at risk of losing their  pensions. Forty percent of Murray's employees are represented by either  the United Mine Workers or the Seafarers International Union. Murray  faces over $8 billion in pension obligations, of which over $2 billion  are unfunded and under threat. This is only the latest example of the  danger facing millions of Americans with pensions from construction,  mining, truck driving, bakeries, and other industries.   These workers did nothing wrong. They saved up little by little, week  by week, expecting to retire with security and dignity, but their  pension plans are sadly now at risk of becoming insolvent because of  circumstances totally outside of their control.   The time has come for Congress to bring relief to these working  families. Members on both sides of the aisle have been working on  legislation that would provide relief to these underfunded pensions.  Just 2 months ago, the House passed the Butch Lewis Act, which I  proudly support and which would provide immediate relief to critical  and declining pension plans, but Leader McConnell has inexplicably  refused to take action on this bipartisan legislation--another  tombstone in his legislative graveyard.   Leader McConnell and the Republican majority are turning their backs  on hard-working middle-class Americans who need their pensions. They  could be robbed of them through no fault of their own. I hope the news  this week magnifies the consequences of Republican inaction.   President Trump has claimed to be a champion for American workers,  but under his Presidency, working Americans have slipped further and  further behind. Now, for millions of hard-working Americans, a secure  retirement is also at risk. If the President were truly a champion for  working Americans, now is the time for him to show some leadership by  urging Leader McConnell and his Republicans in the Senate to work with  Democrats to protect these pension plans.   I yield the floor.
