 Mr. President, today we celebrate the 150th anniversary of  the Senate Appropriations Committee. Established on March 6, 1867, its  powers are rooted in article I, section 9 of our Constitution, which  states, ``No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence  of appropriations made by law.'' The founders of our country recognized  the power of the purse as one of the most important tools Congress has  to ensure our system of checks and balance and to conduct oversight of  the Executive and Judicial branch, but it is much more than that. The  Appropriations Committee is also where we translate the priorities of a  nation into the realities of the people.   Our country is not a business, where we allocate resources only  according to the bottom line. We do not invest in order to make a  profit, or a one-for-one dollar in return. We invest in those areas  where it is uniquely right for government to take the lead. We invest  in the areas that make a difference in the everyday lives of Americans  and that help build the foundations of our country and our economy-- infrastructure, national security, our environment, education, health  care. The Appropriations Committee is where we fund nutrition programs  to ensure that children do not have to sit through class hungry and  remain healthy so they can develop and grow. It is where we allocate  the resources to clean our lakes and our streams and make investments  in growing our communities and promoting jobs. It is where we invest in  research to cure cancer. It is where we can define who we are as  country.   I have been a member of this Committee for almost my entire tenure in  the Senate, and just a few short months ago, I became vice chair. I am  proud to serve on this committee, and I feel honored to join in the  ranks of its leaders. Today I am glad to join you all in celebrating  150 years of an institution that is at the foundation of the Senate. I  look forward to working with my friend Chairman Cochran in continuing  the long and bipartisan history of the Appropriations Committee in the  months and years ahead.                            ____________________
