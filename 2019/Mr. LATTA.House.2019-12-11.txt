 Mr. Chair, I rise today, agreeing with Americans that drug  prices are too high. Congress must act, and we have done so in the  Energy and Commerce Committee by passing bipartisan solutions.   H.R. 3 is bad policy, a partisan sham, and will result in more than  100 fewer cures. Plus, it is dead on arrival in the Senate.   What if that one new drug is the cure for Alzheimer's or cancer?   Under the leadership of Ranking Member Walden, we have solutions that  deliver lower costs and more cures to Americans. Our bill is entirely  bipartisan.   H.R. 19 lowers the costs of prescription drugs and caps seniors' out- of-pocket costs. It encourages innovation and will increase  competition, while enhancing transparency and getting more generic  medicines to market faster.   The American people deserve solutions that will be signed into law. I  encourage my colleagues across the aisle to deliver the American people  more cures, not fewer, and to support H.R. 19.
