 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Carter for his support.   I rise today in support of the Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19  Act. There is no putting the genie back in the bottle. COVID-19  highlighted the importance of telehealth, especially in providing  quality care for rural communities. This bill would extend telehealth  offered through Medicare through the end of 2024.   Like many of my colleagues, I would like to see that go longer. This  bill includes a provision I have supported in my bill, the Protecting  Mental Health Services Act, which extends mental health services  delivered through telehealth.   While Utah has, for the most part, returned to regular life, it is  important that we keep in place those flexibilities that give Utahns  control over their healthcare decisions.   I support this bill and am pleased the Protecting Mental Health  Services Act was included. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support its passage.
