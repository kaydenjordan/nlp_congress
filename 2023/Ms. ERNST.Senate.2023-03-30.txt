 Mr. President, earlier this week, myself, Senator Cassidy,  and Senator Cornyn, along with 35 of our Republican colleagues,  introduced an effort to block President Biden's plan to transfer  student loan debt onto the back of hard-working Americans. This  includes ending the pause on student loan payments, which has been  extended six times since the start of the pandemic.   What might seem like a ``free pass'' in making payments on student  loans is, actually, a scheme orchestrated by the Biden administration  that could cost taxpayers an estimated $900 billion.   Let's break it down: $400 billion to cancel student loan debt, $195  billion to pause loan payments and interest accrued during the  pandemic, and $200 billion to implement President Biden's loan  repayment rule.   Folks, $900 billion is more than the Federal Government has ever  spent on higher education in our Nation's history. To give you some  additional perspective, this radical proposal costs--get this, folks-- three times more than what the government will spend on Pell grants in  this decade--in this decade--a program designed to help our neediest  students.   This is not debt cancellation. It is socialism.   President Biden is rewarding those who chose the path of higher  education by strapping their debt onto the backs of those who did not.   This is a personal issue to me.   My brother chose to enter the workforce directly out of high school.  My brother is a hard-working union laborer.   My sister worked to put herself through community college. She  received an associate's degree in Southwest Iowa. She works for a  trucking company and farms.   Their stories are similar to many Iowans across my home State. Why  should countless Americans who made responsible, financial planning  decisions be forced to take on the debts of others?   Biden's plan is unfair and unaffordable. It is fanning the flames of  inflation and is a driving factor in our growing Federal debt. Most  importantly, this transfer of student loan debt does nothing to address  and may actually be contributing to the real issue of rising costs to  attend college.   What message does this send to veterans who pursue higher education  through the GI bill or medical professionals who joined the National  Health Service Corps?   I was able to cover a portion of my college tuition at Iowa State  University through an ROTC scholarship. Joining the Army after  graduation was a privilege and an honor. I made a commitment to my  country, and, in return, they made a commitment to me to help me  receive my college degree.   President Biden's radical proposal invalidates many other successful  loan forgiveness and repayment programs designed to incentivize  participation in critical fields, including the military, public  service, and medicine.   Instead of putting a bandaid on the problem and passing the buck, we  should be giving students and their families a clear picture up front  about the true costs associated with their education. That is why I am  working in a bipartisan way to ensure that students know, before they  take out a loan, the estimated total interest amount based on their  repayment plan.   Folks, we have warned for years that the left is on the march toward  socialism. Look no further than Biden's student debt transfer plan.   I am proud to join my Republican colleagues in working to stop this  scheme.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the  Primrose Restaurant of Corning, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week for the week of April 3, 2023.   As a proud Iowan, I believe that we are home to one of the best and  most innovative culinary scenes in the world. A small business that  truly exemplifies this is Primrose in Adams County. Located in the  charming Great American Main Street district of Corning, IA, Primrose  serves the nearly 1,500-person town and the surrounding area by  providing quality food and excellent service to the region. Husband and  wife duo, Joel Mahr and Jill Fulton, started Primrose in 2018 with the  vision of offering world-class dining, with quality, farm-to-table  ingredients, to the hard-working folks of southwest Iowa. Joel, who is  an Omaha, NE, native, brought 18-years' worth of cooking experience as  a chef, including 7 years as head chef, in his hometown. While in  Omaha, Chef Mahr received the ``Cooking Light'' Neighborhood Chef Award  in 2013 for his work in their restaurant scene. While Chef Mahr heads  the kitchen, his wife handles the front of the restaurant and is the  resident mixologist. The couple chose Corning as the home base for  their restaurant due to her family connections in the area. Jill's  family owns Fulton Family Farms, which is the supplier of fresh produce  to Primrose. Fulton Family Farms is only a 20-minute drive from the  restaurant and provides them with some of the best produce on the  planet. Primrose also works with the Iowa Beef Council to ensure that  they have the highest quality cuts of meat for their restaurant.   A unique aspect about the restaurant's menu is that it rotates on a  weekly basis, offering a variety of cocktails, wine, and beer that pair  well with their gourmet dishes. They operate an active Facebook account  that contains pictures of their mouthwatering dishes and updates folks  looking for a bite to eat on their ever-changing menu. Primrose also  offers in-store pickup services for a fine-dining experience at home,  in addition to their indoor and outdoor seating.   Since their 2018 opening, Primrose has accumulated quite the array of  awards and magazine features. They are the winner of the Adams County  Chamber of Commerce Business of the Year for 2018 and the Entrepreneur  of the Year award in 2020. Due to the vast popularity of Primrose, it  has become a hotspot for travelers throughout the region, and the  publication Midwest Living included it on their list of ``9 Restaurants  Worth the Drive'' due to their sustained success in Adams County. Their  contributions to the Iowa  [[Page S1087]]  dining scene and their revitalization of the rustic storefront they  occupy have been recognized at the State level as well, with the Iowa  Economic Authority awarding the restaurant as the 2019 ``Superior  Interior Rehabilitation'' winners as part of their ``Main Street Iowa  Awards.'' In addition to major publications, various food and dining  blogs list Primrose as a ``must-see'' restaurant due to their  commitment to their ever-changing menu and farm-to-table experience.   One of the many beautiful things about Iowa is our commitment to  helping each other when times get tough. In 2020, when the world was  shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Primrose went above and beyond  by providing their quality meals to local students who could no longer  rely on school to provide their lunches.   Owning a small business truly is the American dream, and the great  State of Iowa is fortunate to have Primrose Restaurant call the Hawkeye  State home. By taking the time to provide locally sourced ingredients,  amazing service, and world-class dining in a small town, Primrose is a  prime example of what makes small businesses great. I want to  congratulate the entire team at Primrose Restaurant for their continued  commitment to culinary excellence in their work. I look forward to  seeing their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
