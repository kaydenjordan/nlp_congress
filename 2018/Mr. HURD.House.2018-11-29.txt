 Mr. Speaker, it should come as no surprise to anyone in  this Chamber that technology is integrated into every facet of our  daily lives. We have come a long way since the bill that established  the role of the Federal Chief Information Officer, the E-Government  Act, when it was originally passed.   Less than 50 percent of the U.S. population had access to the  internet in 2001. Nearly every American now has access to the internet.   Just 62 percent of Americans had cell phones when the original bill  passed. Now 95 percent of Americans own cell phones and 77 percent own  smartphones.   Mobile apps were non-existent in 2002. Today, over 2.2 million apps  are available to consumers.   This bill recognizes how far technology has come. It codifies the  position of the Federal CIO and elevates the office to report directly  to the head of the Office of Management and Budget.   This bill establishes the role of the Federal CISO, the Chief  Information Security Officer, who reports to the CIO and leads OMB's  cybersecurity efforts.   Empowering CIOs at the Federal agencies is consistent with the  principles of the Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act and the Federal CIO  should not be treated differently.                                time  1800    $90 billion is spent on purchasing IT goods and services. Eighty  percent of that is on old, outdated technology. We need a strong  Federal CIO to make sure American taxpayer dollars are being spent  wisely.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends, my colleagues--Mark Meadows  from North Carolina; Gerry Connolly from Virginia; my partner in crime  on the Information Technology Subcommittee, my good friend, Robin Kelly  from Illinois; and also Brenda Lawrence from Michigan--for showing the  American people that bipartisanship actually happens up here in  Washington, D.C., in order to make sure we are keeping Americans safe.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.
