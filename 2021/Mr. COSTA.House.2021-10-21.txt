 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize National Domestic  Violence Awareness Month.   Sadly, domestic violence has plagued our families and communities in  the Nation for far too long.   Each year, one in three women and one in four men in the United  States experience domestic violence.   My hometown of Fresno has, sadly, one of the highest rates in  California of verified domestic violence calls to the police  department.   We cannot ignore these staggering statistics, and we must do more to  address this crisis. This year, Congress passed the Violence Against  Women Act and the Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA, fix, to prevent  violence and expand victim services to our communities.   These bills would help organizations working tirelessly to uplift  survivors, including the Marjaree Mason Center, the Centro La Familia,  and the Valley Crisis Center in my district.   This week, the House also will be voting on the Family Violence  Prevention and Services Improvement Act of 2021, of which I am a  cosponsor. This bill aims to improve services for victims of domestic,  dating, and family violence, and we need to invest more.   I urge my colleagues to join me in advancing these efforts to end  domestic violence. As chair and cofounder of the Congressional Crime  Survivors and Justice Caucus, it ought to be our priority to benefit  those survivors and provide them the resources they deserve.                            ____________________
