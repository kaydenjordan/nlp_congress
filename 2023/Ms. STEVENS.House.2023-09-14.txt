 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to make a few things  clear.   Our environmental groups are opposed to this legislation. The UAW,  for those who don't know, the United Auto Workers, are opposed to this  legislation.   This is not States' rights, and, frankly, it is absolutely mind- blowing that  [[Page H4326]]  after the hottest summer on record, this is what the majority party is  pushing forward amidst talks of a government shutdown and the need to  take on climate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Madam Speaker, organized labor is a beautiful thing, and  it is incredibly evident today in the final hours of the UAW contract  negotiations.   I want all of my UAW friends, neighbors, and hardworking men and  women of Michigan to know that I have their back from the Halls of  Congress to the well of this very floor.   While working in the Obama administration during the auto rescue,  while working on that auto rescue, we saw the union take concessions.   Madam Speaker, 14 years later, the companies have rebounded. They  have record profits, and now is the time to deal workers back in.   That is what is being negotiated. That is what our friends in  organized labor are pushing for--dignity and justice.   I stand with them today, tomorrow, and the tomorrow after that.   We will see you in Michigan, friends.                            ____________________
