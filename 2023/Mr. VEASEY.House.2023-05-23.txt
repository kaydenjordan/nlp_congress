 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the legacy of  Lee Williams, a legendary track and field coach at Oscar Dean Wyatt  High School in Fort Worth who died at the age of 71.   Mr. Williams began his track and field career as a Poly Parrot and  then went on to TCU, where he set the school record for the 400-meter  run and mile relay and was a member of the first two relay teams to  qualify for the NCAA championship. For these accomplishments, Williams  was inducted into the 54th class of the Athletics Hall of Fame for TCU  just last year.   Williams went on to begin a legendary career as a track and field  coach at Oscar Dean Wyatt. One of his greatest achievements as a coach  came in 1998 when his 4-by-100-meter relay team set the national high  school record of 39.76, a record that still stands to this day.   Throughout his coaching career, Williams coached 15 all-Americans and  won 15 district championships, four regional championships, and two  State championships. He was selected to the Texas Track and Field  Coaches Association back in 2019.   I will end by highlighting Williams' dedication to the success and  mentorship of his students on and off the track. He will always be  known as a legend.   I am praying for his wife, Carolyn, his two daughters, and his  grandchildren.                            ____________________
