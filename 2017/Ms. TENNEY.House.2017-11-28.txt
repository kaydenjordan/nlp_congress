 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Erin Hamlin, a  hardworking and outstanding constituent of the 22nd Congressional  District, who has just qualified for her fourth consecutive Winter  Olympic Games.   Erin hails from a beautiful hamlet in Oneida County, known as Remsen,  New York.   Erin started her career in luge in 2005. Her first major  international victory was achieved in 2009, in Lake Placid, at the  World Luge Championships, where Erin earned a remarkable gold medal.   At the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, Erin became the first American  ever--both male and female--to medal in a singles luge competition when  she brought home the bronze for Team USA.   Next year, Erin will represent Team USA in South Korea by again  competing in the singles luge competition.   Please join me in wishing the best of luck to our hometown rock star  Erin Hamlin and all of Team USA in next year's Winter Olympic Games in  Pyeongchang, South Korea.                            ____________________
