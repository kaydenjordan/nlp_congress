 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment that I  have submitted to restore ``Buy American'' standards that support our  workers and our national defense. My amendment presents an opportunity  to work across party lines to strengthen our national security and to  support the hard-working men and women in Wisconsin and across the  country.   In fact, President Trump supports exactly what my amendment seeks to  achieve. In addition, the Parliamentarians have confirmed that my  amendment is germane postcloture. Given that the President agrees with  me and the amendment is germane, I am calling on the Republican  leadership to schedule an up-or-down vote on my amendment so that  Senators have a chance to show their support for the workers who help  keep America secure.   Let me explain what my amendment would do. The National Defense  Authorization Act would eliminate a number of important ``Buy  American'' laws for certain critical defense components for Navy ships  and other defense programs.   My amendment, entitled the Supporting America's Defense Workers Act,  would prevent the elimination of these critical ``Buy American''  protections, which give preference to American companies for government  contracts funded with taxpayer dollars. It is a commonsense ``Buy  American, Hire American'' policy that supports our domestic industrial  base, our workers, and our national and economic security.   Current law requires that certain critical components like valves,  air circuit breakers, machine tools, anchor chains, propellers,  passenger buses, chemical weapons antidotes, and photovoltaic devices  be supplied by American companies or certain qualified companies  located in closely allied countries, such as Canada.   Section 863 of the Defense bill would enact a harmful sunset  provision on these current requirements, eliminating them entirely at  the end of fiscal year 2018 and consequently opening up taxpayer-funded  defense contracts to unfairly subsidized foreign competition and  placing American jobs at risk.   Opening these procurements up to foreign sources would have the  additional effect of undercutting American steel and iron producers  because foreign manufacturers of these components do not use U.S.- sourced raw materials. Section 863 would weaken these sectors of the  U.S. defense industrial base and jeopardize the stability of companies  located in States across this country and the manufacturers of those  components. This would, in turn, harm our military's ability to rely on  secure and stable sources of critical defense components in an  increasingly  [[Page S5272]]  dynamic global security environment. If domestic sources for critical  defense components exit the market, our military could be forced into  relying on countries that don't share our interests, including  strategic adversaries like China or Russia, for parts and supplies.   I want to emphasize that my amendment does not add any new  requirements or preferences to defense acquisitions. Rather, it  maintains the existing requirements that have worked for years to  create a secure supply of critical parts for our Nation's defense.   Again, to be clear, my amendment does not force the Department of  Defense or the individual services to do anything that they are not  already doing. Indeed, DOD and the services have complied with these  requirements for years without complaint and without injury, and it is  important to note that these domestic content requirements can be  waived. They can be waived for cost; they can be waived for schedule or  noncompetitive reasons. In other words, the government retains  flexibility under these laws.   Strengthening our defense industrial base should be a bipartisan  issue. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, President Trump has said that  he agrees with me. He registered his opposition to section 863 in his  Statement of Administration Policy, which states: ``The Administration  strongly objects to Section 863.''   The Trump administration goes on to say:         The existing procurement requirements act as a key       guarantor of strategic supply chain security. They protect       DOD's ability to reliably source goods such as chemical       weapons antidotes and components for naval vessels, among       others.    Eroding ``Buy American'' requirements also runs counter to two  Presidential initiatives--President Trump's Executive order directing  the Pentagon to strengthen domestic manufacturing capabilities and his  ``Buy American and Hire American'' Executive order to better enforce  current domestic content laws.   I believe we must take steps to ensure that American products are  prioritized when American tax dollars are being spent. Domestic  preferences help our manufacturing sector and ensure that critical  products meet our high standards. This is particularly important when  we are talking about defense products used to ensure that our  servicemembers are safe and effective.   In sum, voting for my amendment means voting not only for the  creation of well-paying American jobs but also for ensuring that the  items used by our men and women in the military are of the highest  quality and will continue to be available.   This amendment is supported by the American Shipbuilding Suppliers  Association and the Alliance for American Manufacturing.   A strong defense industrial base means a strong and secure America.  My amendment has the bipartisan support of President Trump, and I  believe it deserves a vote and the support of all of my colleagues in  the Senate.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
