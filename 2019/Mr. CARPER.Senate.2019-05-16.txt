 Mr. President, years before President Trump moved to the  White House, even before President Obama and his family lived there,  our Nation was at odds with an isolated country ruled by a repressive  leader. It wasn't long before it became clear to the United Nations and  to our country's own intelligence community that the country I am  speaking of was enriching uranium for the purpose of obtaining a  nuclear weapon, threatening to destabilize a region of great strategic  importance.   As the world was winding down from a cold war, tensions between the  United States and this country were heating up. An administration that  some would call naive recently attempted to deescalate tensions, taking  an unprecedented step to hold out an olive branch to an unpredictable  regime in hopes of reaching a momentous agreement to stop them from  continuing to enrich uranium. Surprisingly, that President trusted and  was willing to give unprecedented concessions, all without any reliable  mechanism to verify whether the nuclear enrichment had indeed ended.   My Republican colleagues would be surprised to hear me say this  today, especially today, a week after the anniversary of the U.S.  decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. They are right to be  surprised because I am not talking about Iran; I am talking about North  Korea. I am not talking about President Barack Obama; I am talking  about Donald Trump.   Donald Trump was willing to sit down with a criminal dictator and  give away unprecedented concessions in the hopes that North Korea would  abandon its nuclear program. On the other hand, he turned his back on  Iran, a large country with a growing moderate population--roughly 75  million people, the majority of which, the last I checked, are under  the age of 25--and a moderate President. Let me be really clear. There  are some bad actors in Iran, and some of them are in powerful  positions. But, unfortunately, the actions of this administration,  unlike the actions of the last administration, the Obama  administration--here is what they sought to do. They sought to diminish  the extremists, the hardliners, and their sway over what happens in  Iran and at the same time bolster a new generation of Iranians who are  growing up, who are more moderate in nature and, frankly, who would  like to have a better relationship with our country. Sadly, President  Trump turned his back on Iran and looked forward to taking a different  course--a different course for sure.   Unlike North Korea, Iran committed 2 years ago to unprecedented,  invasive inspections under a deal called JCPOA. On July 14, 2015, after  years of careful preparation, the Obama administration began  implementing the JCPOA with Iran and five negotiating partners--Great  Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China--in an effort to end Iran's  pursuit of nuclear weapons for years and, possibly, if we are lucky,  forever. The deal was not based on trust; it was based on mistrust-- mistrust.   There is a Ronald Reagan line that says: ``Trust, but verify.'' That  is not the underlying principle with the Iran deal, the JCPOA. It is  mistrust, but verify. That is the theme that underlies the JCPOA.   Under that agreement, Iran was required to end uranium enrichment for  nuclear purposes and would be subject to invasive inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA. To the surprise of many,  they had apparently held up their end of the bargain until now.   We pulled out of the JCPOA a year ago. Our other negotiating partners  stayed in, and the IAEA recently certified for the 14th time in a row-- I think in February of this year--that Iran has complied with the terms  of the agreement, the letter and spirit of the agreement that we pulled  out of a year ago. We are the only one who has pulled out of it to  date. The IAEA itself says that the inspection regime laid out by this  agreement, the JCPOA, is the world's toughest--the world's toughest.   Here is the bottom line. Because of the JCPOA, Iran is much further  away from developing a nuclear weapon today than it was before the deal  was signed several years ago. However, as I said earlier, we have not  held up our end of the bargain. One year ago, President Trump announced  that this country would unilaterally leave the JCPOA, even though the  IAEA certified for the 14th time in a row, this year, that Iran has  complied with the terms of the agreement. But we pulled out, leaving  our allies, who committed to the deal in good faith, in the lurch.   This decision we made, I think regrettably a year ago, had  consequences. Instead of celebrating continued stability provided by  the Iran nuclear deal last week, Iran's President, President Rouhani,  announced that Iran will begin to end its compliance with some portions  of the JCPOA, including by stockpiling enriched uranium and heavy  water.   As I said at that time, President Trump's decision increased the odds  of armed conflict with Iran while doing nothing to constrain their  other malicious activities in the region. Again, make no mistake. Not  everybody in Iran wants to be our friend. Mostly young people want to  be our friends, and a lot of folks who have been elected to office over  there would like to have a friendly, better relationship with this  country. But there are some who do not, and I fully acknowledge that.   Today, thanks to President Trump's appointment of John Bolton to be  our National Security Advisor--the President's National Security  Advisor--we are seeing that prediction come truer than I could have  imagined.   Last month, the Trump administration designated the Iranian  Revolutionary Guard as a foreign terrorist organization, further  antagonizing Iran. Members of the Trump administration are reportedly  mulling over a plan to refuse to issue sanctions waivers to our  European allies who intend to purchase oil from Iran, and the  administration has reportedly drawn up plans to send 120,000 of our  troops to the Middle East in response to alleged increased threats from  Iran. But our allies in the region and around the world, including the  French, the Brits, and the Germans, say that they have seen no such  threat. All of this is happening in the absence of a Senate-confirmed  Secretary of Defense.   Earlier this week, I was out for a run a couple of miles from here.  If you run from the Capitol down to the Lincoln Memorial and then turn  around and sort of head back this way, you run by the Vietnam Veterans  Memorial. Whenever I run alongside the memorial, I take my left hand,  and with my fingers, I touch the names of 55,000 men and women who died  in that war. I served with them. I am the last Vietnam veteran serving  in the Senate. They died, and many of us risked our lives over a war  that was based--really, premised--on an untruth; some would say a lie.  [[Page S2909]]    In August 1964, then-President Lyndon Johnson announced that the  North Vietnamese had engaged the U.S. Navy in the Gulf of Tonkin, and  he asked Congress to pass a resolution supporting retaliatory attacks.  The following day, he added these words to his request: ``The United  States intends no rashness and seeks no wider war.'' Those were his  words in August 1964.   His administration went on to justify a bloody, almost decades-long  war after that on the basis of that document--55,000 of my colleagues,  my shipmates, my fellow marines, our soldiers, our airmen--55,000-- dead.   We had a similar situation in Iraq. It did not involve the Gulf of  Tonkin. It did not involve ships. It really didn't involve the  Vietnamese. But there were allegations and assertions that the Iraqis  were developing weapons of mass destruction. The President, the Vice  President--in that case, Bush and Cheney--the Secretary of Defense, and  the Secretary of State all asserted that the Iraqis were developing  weapons of mass destruction and called on this Congress to give the  President the power to respond appropriately.   There are 55,000 names on the Vietnam memorial wall. There is no wall  for the 4,100 men and women who died in Iraq after Congress provided  President Bush the authority to respond to the alleged, perceived  threat of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. While there is no wall  on which to write those 4,100 names, those names are written in  graveyards in every State in this country--4,100 men, women, some young  and some old, who laid down their lives on what was really based on a  lie--weapons of mass destruction.   I want to say that lie was chiefly perpetrated, if I am not mistaken,  by a fellow named John Bolton and that administration.   Fast forward to today. We have seen this movie before. Thanks to John  Bolton's rash actions in the Mideast, I can see it happening again.   I don't want to see it happen again. I have been to too many funerals  of people, servicemembers from Delaware, who died in Iraq. I don't want  to go to any more. I don't want to have to visit any more spouses,  children, parents, brothers, and sisters, as we have done in recent  years with families who have been crushed by sorrow flowing from our  engagement in Iraq.   John Bolton has agitated for war with Iran for over a decade. He even  wrote an op-ed about it. The op-ed was entitled: ``To Stop Iran's Bomb,  Bomb Iran.''   Under Mr. Bolton's leadership, the Trump administration's Iran policy  is becoming ever more dangerous and ever more isolated from our  traditional allies. This strategy could very well plunge us into  another foreign war, if not corrected.   This needless escalation is no way to conduct our foreign policy or  to safeguard our national security. What is more, the administration's  actions with respect to Iran haven't just increased the odds of an  armed conflict. They have also damaged the credibility of our country  around the world. If the United States cannot be trusted to uphold our  commitments to those with whom we negotiate, there is little reason to  believe that other countries, let alone nuclear-armed ones like North  Korea, would be willing to negotiate with us in good faith.   Now, there is another option here. Yesterday former U.S. Ambassador  Wendy Sherman published an op-ed in the New York Times in which she  wrote the following:         But war is not inevitable. President Trump campaigned on       bringing troops home, not sending tens of thousands more to       the Middle East. Such a deployment, although inadequate for a       full-scale war, is more than foolish. War in the Middle East,       as we should have learned by now, is neither swift to end nor       sure to achieve its purpose.    Reformists in Iran have expressed an interest in diplomatic solutions  with the United States and our allies, including a possible prisoner  exchange. The foreign minister of Iran, whom I first met a dozen years  or so ago at the Iranian Ambassador's residence in New York City--not  the Ambassador to the United States but the Ambassador to the United  Nations, a fellow name Javad Zarif. It turned out that when I met him,  I was impressed with how well-spoken he was. It turns out he had gone  to undergraduate school at San Francisco State, I believe, in  California. He is a really smart guy. He is not only well spoken but  knew a lot about America and spoke English as well as any of us in the  room. He went to graduate school in Denver, CO, and he ended up here as  the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations.   Later, when Ahmadinejab left office--Ahmadinejab was a bad guy, a  really bad guy, and was President of Iran before Ruhani--Ahmadinejab  sent Zarif back home, got him out of the United States, got him back to  Iran, and he sort of disappeared until the new elections. Ruhani  emerged as the more moderate--kind of a Gorbachev-type guy, really-- leader in Iran and said: Zarif, I would like you to be my foreign  minister. That is like being their Secretary of State, a position that  he still holds.   Not long ago, about a couple of weeks ago, in that role, he suggested  that we do a prisoner swap. We hold a number of people of Iranian  descent who are in this country. They hold about a half dozen or so of  our folks, I think mostly with dual citizenship, in their country.  Foreign Minister Zarif said: Why don't we just do a straight-out  prisoner swap?   That would actually be a good start to maybe tamping down the  rhetoric and to see if we can't find common ground with Iran again.   During the 8 years of previous administrations, our foreign policy  was designed to strengthen the standing of the moderates in Iran and to  undermine the power of the hard-liners in that country. Actually, it  worked--not perfectly, but it worked. The elections that they conducted  a couple of years ago--6 years ago--reflect that.   Sadly, this administration--I can't believe they did it  intentionally, but their policy in the last just 2 years or a little  over 2 years--what they have done is to undermine the effectiveness and  the standing of the moderates in Iran, and they have rallied support of  Iran around the extremists and around the hard-liners. It is just the  opposite of what was done in the last administration.   We have to be smarter than that. We have to be smarter than this.  When I think about the contrast between the Trump administration's  actions in North Korea and Iran, I can't help but wonder why there is  such a stark contrast? I would not trust the leader of North Korea any  further than I could throw him, and for this President to embrace this  guy and to trust him in ways that befuddle me--and, I think, a lot of  other folks, including folks in his party--is beyond me.   But why has this administration been so determined to abrogate a  carefully crafted deal that keeps Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon?  Why will President Trump not work to ensure the freedom of Americans  held in Iran? Well, part of the answer is provided by Thomas Friedman,  a highly regarded famous journalist whose column appears from time to  time in national newspapers.   Tom Friedman wrote, a year or so ago, something called the ``Trump  Doctrine.'' I think it provides an answer to the question: Why has  President Trump been so determined to get us out of the JCPOA and to  embrace a leader like the one we have over in North Korea?   The ``Trump Doctrine'' from Tom Friedman goes something like this. He  said: ``Obama built it, I broke it''--``I,'' being Trump--``you''-- including us here in this body--``fix it.'' That is it. ``Obama built  it, I''--Donald Trump--``broke it--you''--the rest of us--``fix it.''   I think my colleagues would agree that it would be a travesty if the  President's determination to destroy President Obama's achievement--an  achievement shared by others in this country and by our allies and  friends in, among other places, Britain, France, and Germany--but our  President's determination to destroy Barack Obama's achievement, the  achievements of his administration--in this case, the Iran nuclear  deal--led us into another endless war in the Middle East.   I urge President Trump, as he has done in the case of North Korea, to  engage in diplomacy and ratchet down tensions with Iran, rather than  engaging in needless provocation.   Mr. President, you meet with the President more than I do, but some  of the times I have been with him in the last 2 years, whenever he  mentions  [[Page S2910]]  George W. Bush, in the same breath he talks about how he got us into a  war that cost us thousands of lives and has cost literally tens of  billions of dollars--the Iraq war. So that would suggest to me that the  idea of drawing more troops and a whole lot more money into a war with  Iran has to be something you do with care.   So on this 1-year anniversary of the Trump administration's pulling  out of the Iran deal--I think, foolishly doing so--I would urge the  President and his advisers to think carefully about what outcomes we  really seek as a country. We should be prioritizing diplomacy at this  time, not escalating tensions and risking war with American lives with  no coherent strategy. It is my hope that cooler heads will prevail. It  is also in America's best interest that they do.   John Kennedy said a lot of things that are memorable, and one of my  favorites is this: ``Never negotiate out of fear, but never be afraid  to negotiate.''   ``Never negotiate out of fear, but never be afraid to negotiate.'' I  think we would be wise to remember those words with respect to Iran.   The last thing I would say to the Presiding Officer, who is former  military, is this. When I finish speaking, you are going to be  succeeded by a Marine colonel who serves here from Alaska. We know  people we serve with people who have given their lives up in combat in  wars far away around the world.   We are very proud in Delaware. The Dover Air Force Base may be the  best airlift base in the world. There are 5,000 or 6,000 people who  work there, mostly uniformed, and big planes, C-5s and C-17s. Maybe it  is the best airlift base in the world.   Dover Air Force Base is also home to a mortuary. A month ago, the  bodies of three marines, one of whom is from Delaware, were brought  back to this country. In this case, their vehicle in Afghanistan was  blown up by a roadside bomb, and we lost three of them just like that.  They are not the first, and, sadly, they will not be the last members  of our Armed Services to come home.   For one of the marines, Christopher Slutman, his body came home to  his wife Shannon and to their three daughters, ages 4, 8, and 10. I  have seen this movie before. I have seen it at Dover Air Force Base  with countless bodies that have come back from overseas. I think about  those kids every day, and I am sure my colleagues think about the men  and the women from their States who have served, in some cases, with  great courage and valor. But the idea that 55,000 of those colleagues  of mine who served in Vietnam in a war that was premised on a lie and  4,100 are buried in graveyards all over this country--we have to be  smarter than that. We owe it to not just the families of those men and  women who have died but to the ones who serve today and their families.   ``Never negotiate out of fear, but never be afraid to negotiate.''   I yield the floor.
