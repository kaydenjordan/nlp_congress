 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                           Remembering Ed Greelegs     Mr. President, allow me to take a moment of the Senate's  time to say thank you and farewell to an exceptional person.   Ed Greelegs was my chief of staff for 17 years, and he was a wise and  trusted friend. I was not unique in that regard. Ed had thousands of  friends. I used to marvel while walking through the Capitol with Ed  Greelegs because he knew everybody, and everybody knew him--not just  the Members of Congress and their staff but cafeteria workers,  carpenters, Capitol Police officers, and certainly Senators,  Congressmen, and their staffs. He was a beloved member of the Senate  community, and what a smart fellow he was.   During my first 10 years in the Senate, when Ed was my chief of  staff, he was an unfailing source of wise and thoughtful advice. Some  people are drawn to Congress because of what they think are the perks  and power that come with this job. That is not what attracted Ed  Greelegs.   For Ed, being a good public servant was always a privilege. He  avoided the spotlight. He was there to help people and to help move  America closer to that more perfect Union our Founders dreamed of.   Fifteen years ago, Ed was diagnosed with early onset Parkinson's. He  and his wife Susan faced that formidable challenge the same way they  faced everything: together, with love, determination, courage, and a  good sense of humor.   Sadly, yesterday, Ed's battle with Parkinson's ended, and he passed  away at the age of 66.   Parkinson's disease is a bitter adversary. Over the years, it took  away Ed's sure-footedness. It nearly killed him twice. In the end, it  robbed him of many memories. I can recall speaking to him a few months  back, and Susan had warned me that he didn't have much of a memory, she  said, unless you want to talk about politics. So I called him, and we  talked about politics--even the politics of the day--and Ed was spot  on. He always was. But regardless of the loss of memory, it never took  away Ed's dignity, his kindness, or his respect for others.   Ed Greelegs worked for so many Members of Congress from Illinois that  I think he became an honorary son of  [[Page S2085]]  our State. He grew up in Washington, DC, in the suburb of Wheaton, MD,  and graduated from the University of Maryland.   He came to the Capitol as an intern in 1970. Before he joined my  staff, he worked for Congressman Marty Russo of Illinois, Congressman  Bob Eckhart of Texas on the House Commerce Committee, Congressman Sam  Gejdenson of Connecticut, and finally back to Congressman Marty Russo.   He also worked briefly for the Consumer Federation of America and for  Fannie Mae.   In 1990 I persuaded him to come to work for me as my chief of staff  in the House. Six years later, when I went to run for the Senate, he  was right by my side, and he was there for me 8 years later when I  became whip.   His quiet, wry sense of humor helped to lighten the mood when things  became tense, and his profound compassion and decency reminded all of  us of why we were really there.   There were a couple of things that Ed loved more than public service,  and one was books. Ed's desk and his bedside were always surrounded by  mountains of books. More than reading, Ed loved his family, especially  his dear wife Susan and his stepchildren, Andrew and Amanda.   I have a thousand Ed Greelegs stories, but I am going to close with  my favorite. The year was 2002. I was on a codel with then-Majority  Leader Tom Daschle to Afghanistan with a handful of Senators. We were  the first group of Senators to land in Afghanistan after the war broke  out in daylight. The security was incredible. This trip to Afghanistan  was the first since the fall of the Taliban. No one knew who was friend  or foe on the ground. So when we landed at Bagram Airfield in Kabul, it  was really tense. As the back end of the plane ramp went down on to the  runway and we were brought off, we were surrounded by armored personnel  carriers and men holding rifles. These armored personnel carriers were  as far as the eye could see, and the armed troops as well.   As I came down the ramp, a man in civilian clothes walked up to me  and said: Are you Senator Durbin?   I said: Yes, I am.   He said: Well, I am a personal friend of Ed Greelegs.   I couldn't believe it. In the middle of a war zone, here was another  friend of Ed Greelegs.   On behalf of friends of Ed everywhere, I want to say: Thank you, my  friend. You made this Congress and this country better with your caring  and dedication. We will all miss you.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
