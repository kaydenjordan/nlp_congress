 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for the week to come.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say I yield to my friend, but maybe I had  better say it at the end to see how pleasant we are. I yield to the  majority leader.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)                                time  1115     Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I want to join the  leader. It is important for the public to understand that much goes on  in which there is agreement. Much goes on in this House between staff  and between Members that is a positive and bipartisan result for the  American people and for our country.   Obviously, the public sees mostly, and the reporters cover,  television and print, mostly the confrontation because that is what is  newsworthy. A headline saying everybody cooperated and got something  done is apparently not a very saleable, marketable headline. But I  thank the majority leader.   And as the roles shift and I become the majority leader, I continue  to intend to work with the majority leader and with the incoming whip  on the Republican side to see if we can forge bipartisan agreements on  critical issues that clearly the American people want addressed.   I thank my friend, Mr. McCarthy, and tell him that I look forward to  working with him, as we have in the past, and, hopefully, we can do so  constructively on behalf of, not only the House of Representatives, but  on behalf of our country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that  information. I would reiterate what the majority leader has said  because I believe this is accurate. There will be no votes before  Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. next week--no votes prior to 6:30 p.m. next  Wednesday, so that Members are advised that they need to be available.  We need to be here Wednesday at 6:30, and we need to be available every  day thereafter until we get this government on a solid footing.   Is that accurate, Mr. Leader?    Mr. Speaker, as he points out, these discussions are not  just about the schedule for the short term. They are about, however, a  schedule as to what policies we are going to address, when we are going  to address them, and how we are going to address them.   In that context, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader was, I think,  rightfully proud of the fact that the committee had reported out all 12  appropriations bills by the August break, and we had passed seven of  those appropriations bills on the floor and sent them to the Senate.   Sadly, however, Mr. Speaker, we are now 12 days before Christmas.  There was a meeting at the White House about 48 hours ago, at which  time there was a debate or discussion on TV, which the American people  saw, and the President of the United States said: ``I will shut down  the government, absolutely.'' And then he said: ``I am proud to shut  down the government.''   Mr. Speaker, shutting down the government is stupid. Shutting down  the government is costly. Shutting down the government creates great  uncertainty, not only among those who work  [[Page H10185]]  for the Federal Government, but everybody who relies on the daily  activities of the Federal Government.   We should not shut down the government. My side Mr. Speaker, has  offered to the President of the United States, and to all of us, two  alternatives. One is that we pass a CR for the balance of the year for  all bills. We don't like that alternative, but at least it will provide  some certainty for the next 8\1/2\ months until September 30.    The second alternative, which I think is the much better alternative,  and it comports with the leader's justifiable pride with dealing with  the appropriation bills on this side--as I understand, there is only  one disagreement of major proportion, and that is whether we build a  wall. We think that is bad policy. The President thinks it is good  policy. We are having an argument about that, and we don't agree. The  Republicans control the House and they control the Senate. They could  pass it. They haven't passed it. But we don't control that. That is out  of our hands.   And our suggestion was we have agreed on five of the bills that have  been signed into law. About 76 percent of the government's  discretionary funding has already been passed. We have about 25 percent  left. That 25 percent is in seven bills. One is the Department of  Homeland Security. It is clear that we do not have agreement on the  Homeland Security appropriation bills, but on six, it is my  understanding, Mr. Leader and Mr. Speaker, that we do have agreement,  that the two appropriations committees have worked together, the  leaders have worked together, and that we have agreement on those six  bills.   So our second alternative, the much preferred alternative is to pass  those six bills as they have been agreed to, funding those agencies to  which those bills apply between now and September 30, the end of the  fiscal year, and do a CR for the balance of the year for Homeland  Security, or, alternatively, do a CR on Homeland Security at some date  next year. Neither of those alternatives apparently has been pursued by  the majority party, Mr. Speaker, and the President, as I just quoted,  says: ``I am proud to shut down the government.''   Mr. Speaker, the leader has said he doesn't want to shut down  government. The whip has said he doesn't want to shut down government.  The minority leader in the Senate has said he doesn't want to shut down  government. We don't want to shut down government.   But we are at an impasse just about one issue, and we suggest we  agree with 95 percent. Wouldn't that make sense for the American  people, for us to pass the 95 percent on which we have reached  agreement after hard work all year? And on that which we can't agree,  agree that we can't agree and fight that another day?   But here we are, 12 days before Christmas. And I would ask the  majority leader: Do we have a plan? Mr. Leader, do we have a plan to  fund the government on or before the 21st of this month so that we can  do what all of us say we want to do, and, that is, keep the government  operating on behalf of the American people?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Let  me observe with respect to the gentleman's comment about we did send  five bills, 75 percent of government spending, discretionary spending  to the President. The President signed it. But when he says it is the  best in 25 years, I will remind him that when I was majority leader in  2007, we passed all 12 bills through this House.    The gentleman is correct. We passed all 12 bills. We  passed them one by one so that we can consider each one, and they went  to the Senate.   Unfortunately, the Senate didn't act in a fashion that I would hope.  I will tell the gentleman, it is my intention, as majority leader, to  pass all 12 bills.    Not necessarily one by one. We like his process, perhaps.  I hope he likes it as much as he liked it the first time when he got  that process, because I may--I have learned from the majority leader's  skill and judgment so that we----    We may pursue that process, and I know he is going to  support it because it is his process that we are going to pursue, sort  of like his schedule.                                time  1130    Mr. Speaker, we passed all 12 bills. We sent them to the Senate.  Unfortunately, we didn't get them all done.   But the fact of the matter is, this is a process called the  legislative process, and I just talked at the outset about compromise  and working together. We have six of those bills. It so happens we now  package everything, and maybe we are going to do that in the future.  But the fact of the matter is, we have agreement on six of the seven  bills that remain to be signed by the President of the United States.   The way this process works is, you have agreement on six separate  bills. These are not the homeland security. That is where we have a  disagreement. I understand that. We cannot pass homeland security right  now. But we have agreement on six bills.   Why shouldn't the plan be: We have agreement, in a bipartisan  fashion; we can fund those six agencies. There will be no drama, and we  will send it. Then we can do a CR on the homeland security, and we can  argue about the wall.   We can have hearings on the wall. We can have experts come here and  say to them: How do we make sure America is secure? Because every  Democrat wants to make sure the borders are secure, every Democrat. We  want the border secure.   There is a substantive disagreement. By the way, there are  Republicans who disagree with the wall, as the gentleman surely knows,  that it is not the best way to secure the border.   By the way, I don't know why we need money for it. The Mexicans  surely are going to pay for the wall. That is what the President said.  The Mexicans were going to pay for the wall. Now he wants $5 billion to  pay for technology we don't think works. So, as a result, we are  holding hostage the six bills on which we have agreement.   How frustrated the American people must be when they say: You know,  they agree on six-sevenths of the bills, and they won't take yes for an  answer.   The response is: ``I am proud to shut down the government.''   Mr. Leader, I would hope that we could send those six bills on which  we have agreement. After hard work in  [[Page H10186]]  the Appropriations subcommittees, in the Appropriations Committee, both  in the House and the Senate, and in communications between the two  bodies, they have reached agreement. We ought to be happy about that.  We ought to celebrate that. And we ought to send them to the President.  There is no indication he would not sign those bills, as far as I know.   Then, yes, we have a disagreement, and the American people have come  here to have us debate that, have hearings on that, see what experts  say on that. Frankly, if the wall is what your side wants, then I say  to the leader, put a bill on the floor Wednesday night and pass the  wall. You haven't done that.    We haven't passed the homeland security bill through this  House. It got out of committee; you didn't bring it to the floor. We  haven't had a vote on it, so there is no consensus on that part of it.   So, Mr. Speaker, let's pass those six bills. Let's have a plan that  will work to preclude shutting down the people's government. I hope we  can do that. I hope we can do it, come back Wednesday night, and I  hope, Mr. Leader, you have a plan between now and Wednesday night to  get us to the place where we can do what we have agreed upon, and  agreed not to agree on something that we can't agree on, or pass it and  send it to the President.   Mr. Speaker, I hope we can do that. That is our responsibility. That  is our duty, the duty to have a plan of how to make sure that  government continues to operate, and a plan as to how we can have our  Members and their families celebrate one of the highest holy days in  Christendom.   I yield to my friend.    I thank the leader for his comments, but what is your plan  to do that?   We have been now here in this Congress, this year, for over 330 days,  340 days. You haven't passed any plan on homeland security. You haven't  brought it to the floor. It passed out of the committee. You have not  brought it to the floor in 340 days.   Here we are, with agreement on six bills, Mr. Leader. We have reached  agreement. We have worked hard to get to that agreement.   Now, yes, you have a faction of your caucus that has told you from  time to time, ``my way or no way,'' even when you had agreement on six- sevenths.   Mr. Boehner had the same problem, and he decided he was going to  leave here because he had the ``my way or no way,'' ``my way or the  highway,'' ``my way or here's your hat and get out.''   Mr. Leader, you have not told us a plan. We have been discussing this  for, literally, all year, and we have a very significant, substantive  disagreement. And you haven't brought it to the floor to press your  view and send it to the Senate.   I don't know why you haven't brought it to the floor. We haven't had  any debate on the floor on this issue. We are prepared to debate that  bill.   But what we are not prepared to do is hold hostage six-sevenths of  the appropriations bills that remain to be done, which we have agreed  upon, worked on, and are ready to go. All you tell me is: We are  prepared to do that, but we have got to pass all seven bills. If we  don't get everything we want, we are not going to do it.   I understand, because you have the President of the United States  saying: ``I am proud to shut down the government.''   What kind of irresponsibility is that?   He wants the wall. I know he wants the wall. We are a democracy,  however, not an autocracy, not a dictatorship. We are a democracy, and  the wall has not passed this House. There is no agreement on the wall,  and we think the wall is a bad strategy.   There are more resources deployed to the South, the southern border,  than at any time, I think--I haven't checked this exactly--in my  service in the Congress of the United States. So it is not like we have  not put a lot of Border Patrol, a lot of technology, a lot of fencing.  We have supported substantial security at the border.   Now the President wants more. I get that. But we are holding hostage  six-sevenths of the appropriations bills, six out of seven, because the  President is going to be proud to shut down the government.   Now, I don't want to be too painful, but we had an election just a  few weeks ago, and the President made it very clear he wanted to build  that wall. He sent troops down to the border, at tens of millions of  dollars' cost. Of course, under the law, they can't deal with law  enforcement. And, yes, there were some people that came at the fence,  and they were pushed back.   But the fact of the matter is that there is border security. Can we  make  [[Page H10187]]  it better? Yes. Do we want to make it better? Yes. Will we work with  you to do that? Yes. But you are not going to get us to believe  something is good that we don't think is good.   You can pass it. The President can sign it. I get that. And we lose.  But you haven't brought it to the floor. You don't have a plan to get  that done, 330, I guess, 340 days into the year.   So I am, Mr. Speaker, saying, why, when we have agreement--I say six- sevenths. Very frankly, we have agreement on the homeland security bill  except for the wall, one item, so, essentially, we have probably 99  percent agreement. But it is my way or the highway, with no plan, as I  understand it, to get us from where we are today, where we were 2 weeks  ago, and where I am fearful that we will be on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m.,  because we have no plan to get from where we are to where we need to  be.   We have offered two plans. You don't like either one of them. One was  a CR for the rest of the year, for everything, for the remaining. We  don't like that. That is not our plan, but it is one option, and we  would support that if you bring that to the floor.   The other option, of course, is to pass the six bills. We will vote  for them, all of them. You can put them in a package. Then do a CR on  the homeland security, and we will have further discussions about that,  and we will see what the democratic process results in.                                time  1145    It hasn't passed the House. We are not for it. We are prepared to  debate it. If it passes and the President signs it, it will be law and  my friend will do it, but don't hold the rest of government hostage for  something on which there is deep disagreement not only by us, but  within my friend's own party.   I implore my friend, on Wednesday at 6:30, bring those six bills to  the floor. We will vote for them. Hopefully, his folks who worked to  get them in place will vote for them. We will pass them, and we will  avoid another stupid, as I said, shutdown of the government of the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, is the gentlemen aware we did not shut down  government?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, not that year.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is talking about here?    Mr. Speaker, in this session?    Mr. Speaker, I am pointing out that when the gentleman  says we didn't pass the appropriations bills, when I said we passed all  12 through the House, we did not shut down government. We ultimately  got to a resolution of the differences between us.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the majority leader, what is his plan to do that?    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, everybody likes to talk  about the Senate. What the gentleman has ignored is that I said the  bill is in committee and in 340 days has not been brought to this  floor. If that is the gentleman's policy, he has not brought it to the  floor for consideration.   By the way, when he talks about a broader issue of immigration, we  agree with him. He has not brought a comprehensive immigration reform  bill to the floor, either.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, did they pass those bills?    Mr. Speaker, why not?    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, we didn't vote for it  because we didn't like the bills. But the gentleman is in charge, and  he has 240 Members. All he needed was 218.   We didn't like his bill, so we did what we do when we don't like  bills: we vote against them. But he has 240 people still on his side of  the aisle, and he couldn't pass his bill because so many of his Members  didn't like it. That is why his bill didn't pass.   Mr. Speaker, what is the gentleman's plan, however, between now and  6:30 p.m. on Wednesday to get us off this dime that we are stuck on and  have been stuck on now for almost the entire year, 12 days from  Christmas?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, me, too.    Mr. Speaker, what is the solution?    Mr. Speaker, is the compromise we take the wall or we shut  down the government? Is that the compromise?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, is your answer to the question, yes, the  wall, or we shut down government?    Mr. Speaker, the President to whom the gentleman is very  close, he says so. The gentleman says so. The President says, and the  gentleman heard the quote, he probably gets tired of hearing it, I am  sure: I am proud, he says--I am proud, he says, to shut down the  government. I will shut down the government. Absolutely, I will shut it  down.   That is what the President said just 2 days ago.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, what is he talking about?  I voted against bills whose policies I did not agree with and that he  said ``we will therefore shut down the government,'' because if we  don't agree, he couldn't get the majority votes on his side, and he  couldn't get 60 votes in the Senate--which the Republicans were very,  very pleased with that when the Senate was controlled by Democrats.  They loved having that 60-vote rule because what they said is it  requires compromise. It requires coming together, having to get 60  votes. It requires not saying, ``Do it our way or you don't do it.''    The gentleman has not brought a bill, he has not brought a plan to  this floor on how to get out of that. And, Mr. Speaker, the leader has  not answered when I said, essentially when he says come together and  have compromise, these are his bills. They are not our bills.   We had to compromise. These didn't come out of Democratic  subcommittees. They didn't come out of a Democratic committee, didn't  come out of a Democratic Senate. These are bills that are his bills  that we compromised on.   We are prepared to vote for 99 percent--99 percent--of those seven  bills, 99 percent. That is compromising, I think, a pretty far way.   We don't agree with everything in those bills, but he is right, this  is a collective body. We have all been elected. We all have one vote,  and we have compromised on 99 percent.   He is holding it up. He has no plan other than we take the wall or  the President of the United States shuts down government. That is not  the compromise that I heard him talking about we ought to have.   Mr. Speaker, if that is the kind of compromise we are going to have  between now and Wednesday at 6:30 p.m., we are not going to get there.  We have compromised on 99 percent. Let's pass it. Let's move on.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, then I am going to yield back.    Mr. Speaker, I am afraid we are going to almost finish the  rest of that hour.    Mr. Speaker, what I hear is that the majority leader's  plan is that we give up. Ninety-nine percent of the Homeland Security  bill, I presume and believe, is directed at securing our borders. We  have agreed with 99 percent of it, probably 99.9 percent of it. That is  probably not true in dollar value.   But the plan is for us to give up because 99 percent is not good  enough for us to agree with. It has got to be 100 percent. If that is  the plan, it is not going to work.   The bill has not been brought to this floor, ever, this year. It is  worthy of debate as to how we keep our borders most secure. As I have  said, many Republicans, including, very frankly, the second ranking  member of the Senate on the Republican side, have questions about the  wall. He is from Texas. A lot of Texans think the wall doesn't make  sense, Republicans and Democrats. Maybe not all, but some. But if the  plan is we just give up after agreeing to 99 percent, that is no plan  at all.   Unless the gentleman wants to say more, I am going to yield back.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader.   I must say, Mr. Speaker, I have a serious suspicion--I trust the  majority leader, but I believe that gift was probably purchased by  Judy, his wonderful, beautiful wife.   I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
