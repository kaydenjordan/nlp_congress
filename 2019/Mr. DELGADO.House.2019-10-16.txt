 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an urgent crisis in  our communities: access to rural broadband. Over the district work  period, I held a field hearing on rural broadband with FCC Commissioner  Geoffrey Starks, where New York's 19th Congressional District residents  shared their stories about the need to improve rural broadband internet  in upstate New York. The commissioner heard from educators, healthcare  providers, and small business owners all impacted by this issue.   Following that hearing, I have introduced the Broadband Speed Act and  the Community Broadband Mapping Act. This legislative package will  address flawed broadband mapping practices that result in the FCC  overcounting rural communities and require that projects funded with  FCC money are future-proof, or built to withstand changes in  technology.   This legislation would also allow local governments, co-ops,  community groups, and small providers to access funding that would  allow them to collect information on local broadband service in order  to challenge a finding that they are, in fact, served.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to take up this legislation and close  the digital divide.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true American hero,  a fallen soldier, Senior Chief Petty Officer Shannon Kent of Pine  Plains, New York, who was killed at the age of 35 on January 16 of this  year by a suicide bombing in Syria during her fifth combat tour in the  Middle East.   Senior Chief Kent, a Dutchess County native and Stissing Mountain  High School graduate, was a wife, the mother of two beautiful children,  and a cancer survivor. She spoke five languages, including six dialects  of Arabic, and deployed with the Navy SEALs to Iraq and Afghanistan on  four different occasions.   Senior Chief Kent gave the ultimate sacrifice in service to our  country and will be remembered for her courage and determination. She  was the recipient of the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, two Joint  Service Commendation Medals, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation  Medal, and the Joint Service Achievement Medal, to name a few.   In 2016, Senior Chief Kent survived thyroid cancer and, in 2018,  commissioned for a special officer program to earn a Ph.D. in clinical  psychology at the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences.   Because of a flawed DOD policy, she was found medically unfit to  pursue this degree and, yet, somehow fit enough to be deployed to  Syria. Following this decision, Senior Chief Kent sought a waiver from  the Navy to override DOD's finding and, again, was denied.   Prior to her death, Senior Chief Kent worked tirelessly to change the  Navy and DOD policies that resulted in her fifth deployment. Due to her  work, the Navy has made positive changes to its waiver policy, in  Senior Chief Kent's honor. I remain hopeful the DOD will follow in the  Navy's footsteps.   Today, I urge the House to pass H.R. 2151 to create a memorial for  Senior Chief Petty Officer Shannon Kent in Dutchess County and name the  post office at 7722 South Main Street in Pine Plains, New York, the  Senior Chief Petty Officer Shannon M. Kent Post Office.   Senior Chief Kent's memory will live on because she defined what true  service means. Honoring Senior Chief Kent in this permanent way will  serve as a daily reminder of her heroism and sacrifice.   Senior Chief Kent is survived by her husband, retired Chief Warrant  Officer Joseph Kent, and their two young sons. My thoughts remain with  her children, husband, and the rest of her family and friends.   I urge my colleagues to make this bill law to honor her life and  legacy.
