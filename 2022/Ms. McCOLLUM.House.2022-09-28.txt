 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger) as cosponsor of H.R. 8446.    Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of my bill, the  Global Food Security Reauthorization Act of 2022, a bipartisan bill,  which I worked on with Mr. Smith to reaffirm the United States'  commitment to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide. It truly has been  a bipartisan effort.   This bill builds upon the landmark Global Food Security Act of 2016.  It reauthorizes the incredibly successful Feed the Future initiative,  which has carried out lifesaving programs and helped millions of people  break the cycle of poverty and hunger.   This legislation reauthorizes GFSA to 2028 and makes commonsense  updates to reflect the changing landscape of global hunger.  Specifically, this bill emphasizes agriculture-led economic growth and  strengthening resilience against climate change and the global COVID-19  pandemic. This will help reduce malnutrition in women and children.   By supporting small farmers and women farmers, in particular, we can  increase food production and incomes so that families and communities  around the world may improve their way of life.    This legislation will also help to create a more stable world, as has  been mentioned, by helping millions of people in the world's poorest  countries become self-sufficient in feeding themselves.   As chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, I know all  too well the human, economic, and national security costs of global  food insecurity, and it is just too high for Congress to ignore. The  passage and enactment of this bill today truly cannot come soon enough  for our national security.   I am proud to have worked on this legislation. I have worked on this  legislation for over 14 years, starting with Senator Lugar, after being  in Africa and watching how lack of food and clean water affected our  ability to really make the HIV/AIDS program move forward. From that,  the more I learned about malnutrition, the more passionate I became.   I am proud to have worked on this with experts in the field of global  food and nutrition security, such as InterAction, Bread for the World,  1,000 Days, CARE, Save the Children, The Alliance to End Hunger, and so  many more. Madam Speaker, I thank them for their expertise, for helping  to lift up this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I also thank our co-leads, Chair Meeks and Ranking  Member McCaul, and a special thank-you to Representative Smith, for  their work on this legislation. Their enduring commitment to end global  hunger is important work that we do together.   Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill.                                time  2130
