 Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.   I want to first point out--I want to thank the previous Presiding  Officer for pointing out the fact that if this is not a violation of  rule XIX, it is coming pretty darn close.   What you just witnessed here is this: We have witnessed Democrats  doing what Democrats do so well, accusing the other side of doing  exactly what they do--only 10 times or 100 times worse.   Earlier today, I chaired a business meeting of the Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs Committee, precipitated, created, made  necessary by the fact that the ranking member of my committee presented  an absurd, ridiculous interpretation of our rules. Based on the  subpoena authority I received earlier on June 4, the ranking member  said, in order to actually schedule a subpoena or schedule a meeting--a  deposition--I could come back for another vote.    During my opening statement of that business meeting, having just  described that level of meddling--which, by the way, the ranking member  also provided that ridiculous interpretation to our witness, the  witness, Jonathan Winer, an individual, by the way, who decided not to  cooperate with the Department of Justice inspector general in his  report on the FISA abuse. He decided not to show up for his deposition  that had been previously scheduled. Having just explained that in my  opening statement, I would like to read the next part, which describes  the duplicity and the hypocrisy of the Democrats.   I said: The most recent example of this hypocrisy was a letter and  classified addendum created by senior Democratic leaders that accused  Senator Grassley and me--    I appreciate the warning. I don't think I did that.    Let me continue.   The most recent example is a letter and classified addendum created  by senior Democratic leaders that accused Senator Grassley and me of  relying on foreign disinformation. This ``intelligence product,'' which  was full of false allegations, was produced, classified, and then  leaked to the press more than a week before Senator Grassley or I were  given access to it. Many in the media dutifully reported this hot tip.  Democrats then used those media reports to repeat, distort, and  embellish the false charges. This coordinated smear--and that is what  you have to call it. It is a coordinated smear which continues today on  the floor of the Senate--culminated in an August 7 opinion piece in the  Washington Post submitted by Senator Richard Blumenthal.   But John Ratcliffe, the Director of National Intelligence, wrote:         I can confirm the IC did not create the classified addendum       to the 13 July letter, nor did we authorize its [release].    The foreign information we were falsely accused of receiving--we have  a misprint here.   The foreign information we were falsely accused of receiving  utilized--purportedly comes from a Ukrainian named Andriy Derkach, who  has since been sanctioned by the Treasury Department. Although neither  Senator Grassley nor I ever sought, received, or used any information  from Mr. Derkach, the media has continued to report otherwise for  weeks, despite our repeated and unequivocal denials.   But it is true that a chart produced by Mr. Derkach is now part of  our investigatory record, not because of me or Senator Grassley but  because Senator Peters' staff introduced it into the record.   So as was the case in the 2016 election, the only foreign  disinformation being used to interfere in this investigation has been  introduced by Democrats against Republicans and not by Republicans.   Given all the concerns expressed by Democrats over foreign  disinformation, it is notable that we have not heard the same concern  over disclosure of the Steele dossier containing Russian  disinformation. We are aware of this fact because, during the course of  this investigation, my chief counsel uncovered it buried in four  classified footnotes to the Department of Justice inspector general  FISA report. We also know the FBI was aware of this as early as 2016.  Think about that. The FBI knew that Russian disinformation was  contained in the Steele dossier as early as August of 2016. Yet they  continued the investigation, and that investigation spilled over into a  special counsel and disrupted America's Government and politics for  years.   We also note that the Steele dossier was bought and paid for by the  DNC and Clinton campaign. Apparently, Democrats are willing to look the  other way when they pay for or use disinformation against Republicans.   That is what I read in my opening statement at our business meeting  earlier today.   As I look at this resolution, the last ``whereas'' talks about a  congressional investigation that alleges the same discredited claims by  Derkach. I don't know who Derkach is. As I said earlier, Senator  Grassley and I have repeatedly, unequivocally, denied we did not  solicit; we did not accept; we did not receive any information from Mr.  Derkach whatsoever. Yet Democrats persist in pushing this false  allegation.   As a matter of fact, I am not sure our committee has alleged anything  yet. About the only thing that I have alleged is the glaring and  obvious conflict of interest.   I have to step back here. I just have to give a little history about  Ukraine. In February of 2014, Ukrainians, courageous Ukrainians-- basically two factions: one that wanted to integrate closer to the West  and the younger Ukrainians who wanted to rid themselves of the  corruption of the Soviet legacy--joined together in massive protest on  the Maidan. Approximately, February 20, 21, over 80 Ukrainians were  slaughtered by snipers protesting to rid Ukraine of corruption and  increase their ties to the West.   Less than 2 months later--and I have asked my colleagues: Is there  any disinformation here? Is this anything from Russian sources? Two  months later, here are the series of events that occurred.   On April 16, 2014, Vice President Biden met with his son's business  partner, Devon Archer, at the White House. That is kind of a big deal-- anybody meeting with the Vice President at the White House. Hunter  Biden's business partner got to do that.   Five days later, Vice President Biden visited Ukraine. The media  described him as the public face of the administration's handling of  Ukraine. The next day, April 22, Archer joined the board of Burisma.   Again, Burisma is this company that is owned by what George Kent from  the State Department called an ``odious oligarch,'' Mykola Zlochevsky.  It is hard to say Ukrainian names.  [[Page S5630]]    Six days later, after Archer joined the board, British officials  seized $23 million from the London bank accounts of Burisma's owner,  Mykola Zlochevsky. Fifteen days later, on May 13, Hunter Biden joined  the board of Burisma. And over the course of the next, approximately, 4  to 5 years, Hunter and his firms were paid more than $3 million for his  and Archer's board participation.   Again, Ukraine had just gone through a revolution. Their leadership  was desperate for U.S. support. We all have to believe that Mr.  Zlochevsky, an odious oligarch, would have made those Ukrainian  officials well aware of the fact that the son of the Vice President of  the United States, the public face of the administration's handling of  Ukraine, was sitting on his board.   So what kind of signal did that send to Ukrainians who were trying to  stand up and were being pressured by U.S. officials to rid their  country of corruption? It basically said: If you want U.S. support,  don't touch Burisma   The fact is, when all was said and done, Burisma and Mykola  Zlochevsky were never held to account. The investigation, the  prosecution of him was ceased. It never occurred.   In terms of Russian disinformation, these false charges, these wild  claims against me and Senator Grassley--I was way ahead of the curve  when it came to Russian disinformation. Back in 2015, as chairman of  the European Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I  held three hearings focusing on what Russia does to destabilize the  politics in countries--an attempted coup in Montenegro and other places  in Eastern Europe. So I am well aware of what Russia is doing--well  aware. I don't condone it. I condemn it. I am not having any part of  pushing it.   But I have to say, for all the crocodile tears the Democrats shed in  terms of Russian disinformation, the effects on our politics, I would  argue that the Russian disinformation that has been perpetrated on our  politics and the effect it has on the election pales in comparison to  the false allegations, for example, that Russia colluded with the Trump  campaign. It was promoted by Democrats for years, culminating in a  special counsel and finally an impeachment. But how Democrats have used  and how the media has promoted and carried the water for Democrats all  this time has had a far greater effect, by orders of magnitude, in  terms of destabilization and affecting the politics and affecting the  elections. That is basically the truth.   I would just ask my colleagues and I would ask the American public to  take a look at what has really been happening here. The false  allegations, the basic playbook the Democrats engage in, time and  again, create a false narrative, create a false intelligence product,  accuse the other side of things that you are doing tenfold. That is  what is happening here.   I, personally, am tired of it. As a result, I object.    Mr. President, a quick response because in my other  paper here, I did not have the full quote from John Ratcliffe. I would  like to read it now.   This is referring to the intelligence product that senior Democratic  leaders created, leaked to the press, accusing Senator Grassley and I,  falsely, of receiving information from Andriy Derkach.   John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence, wrote:         I can confirm the IC did not create the classified addendum       to the 13 July letter, nor did we authorize its creation. The       IC was not consulted prior to its creation and subsequent       release to the entire membership of the U.S. House of       Representatives.    Then, referring to that addendum, he said it ``by no means reflects  the full and complete analysis of the IC.''   I would ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record an article  that was published today by John Solomon talking about the extensive-- extensive--contacts by members of the Obama administration in terms of  the NSC and the State Department and the Ambassador with Andriy  Telizhenko. It is right here.   We have a nice picture of House Member Elliot Engel as well.    The same person they are saying is just this dangerous  Russian agent, they were using extensively throughout the Obama  administration to set up contacts. He actually had the ability to go to  meetings in the White House, and he attended those. This is the person  whom now they are saying, because we spoke to him and got a little bit  of information from him, we are dealing in Russian disinformation.   If they had that level of concern, why did Democratic lobbying firm  Blue Star Strategies employ him for over a year, and why did Democrats  deal with him so frequently during the Obama administration?   I yield the floor.
