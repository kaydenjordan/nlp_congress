 Mr. Speaker, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a  time in our country to reflect on the progress that we have made on  civil rights as well as how much further still as a nation we must go.   When contemplating the progress in western New York, Frank B. Mesiah  immediately comes to mind. Mr. Mesiah has been a prominent civil rights  leader in Buffalo since 1950, following his service in the United  States Army. Following a 20-year stay as president of the Buffalo  NAACP, he retired late last year and will continue to be a public  watchdog, this time through the lens of an active citizen.   During his years of service, Mr. Mesiah has always been the first to  stand up and fight on behalf of our community. He played a leading role  in desegregating Buffalo public schools, integrating the Buffalo Police  Department, and fighting against noninclusive neighborhoods.   Mr. Mesiah has been a key leader in promoting tolerance and equality  in western New York. While his time as NAACP president has concluded,  his wisdom and passion endures in our community, and his work will  inspire generations to come.                            ____________________
