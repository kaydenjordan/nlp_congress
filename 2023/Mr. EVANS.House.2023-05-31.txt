 Mr. Speaker, this bill is far from perfect; however, the  full faith and credit of the United States is at risk, and we cannot  let Republicans drive us to default.   Defaulting on the national debt would disrupt Social Security  benefits for 92,000 households in my congressional district. I will not  stand by and let harm come to our Nation, seniors, and disabled people.  I urge my colleagues not to draw out this debt crisis and instead  return to our focus of lowering the costs for working families.
