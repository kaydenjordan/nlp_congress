 Madam President, I move to instruct the Sergeant At Arms  to request the presence of absent Senators, and I ask for the yeas and  nays.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I lay  it on the table.    Mr. President, I ask that the Senate stand in recess  subject to the call of the Chair.   Thereupon, the Senate, at 3:55 p.m., recessed subject to the call of  the Chair and reassembled at 8:10 p.m. when called to order by the  President pro tempore.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  cloture motions with respect to substitute amendment No. 1292 and the  underlying bill, H.R. 3935, be withdrawn.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask that it be in order to make a  motion to proceed to H.R. 5860.    I move to proceed to H.R. 5860, which was received from  the House and is at the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by title.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         Motion to proceed to H.R. 5860, a bill making continuing       appropriations for fiscal year 2024, and for other purposes.     Madam President, I know of no further debate on the  motion.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate?   If not, the question is on agreeing to the motion.   The motion was agreed to.                            ____________________     Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent there be up  to 5 minutes for debate, equally divided, between the two leaders or  their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate  vote on passage of H.R. 5860 with 60 affirmative votes required for  passage and with no amendments or motions in order to the bill prior to  the vote on passage.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The majority leader is recognized.    Madam President, I have very good news for the country.  Democrats and Republicans have come  [[Page S4888]]  to an agreement, and the government will remain open. We will have  avoided a shutdown.   Bipartisanship, which has been the trademark of the Senate, has  prevailed, and the American people can breathe a sigh of relief. But  this is a bridge CR. Leader McConnell and I have agreed to continue  fighting for more economic and security aid for Ukraine. We support  Ukraine's efforts to defend its sovereignty against Putin's aggression.   So thank you, thank you to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  for their excellent work. The bipartisanship here in the Senate set the  tone for today's result, and I hope it sets the tone for the future.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is recognized.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.    Madam President, it has been a day full of twists and  turns, but the American people can breathe a sigh of relief. There will  be no government shutdown. Democrats have said from the start that the  only solution for avoiding a shutdown is bipartisanship, and we are  glad that Speaker McCarthy has finally heeded our message.   In the end, more Democrats supported this bill in the House than  Republicans, proving bipartisanship was the best answer all along.   I want to thank my colleagues here in the Senate, especially our  appropriators, the Presiding Officer and Susan Collins and Leader  McConnell.   Our bipartisan work in the Senate set the tone for the bill we are  about to pass. Our bipartisanship made this possible and showed the  House that they had to act.   We will keep the government open for 45 days with a clean CR at  current funding levels, and we avoided all of the extreme, nasty, and  harmful cuts MAGA Republicans wanted. No 30 percent cuts across the  board; no 30 percent cuts to things like healthcare, to the Social  Security Administration, to the nutrition programs for kids; full  reauthorization of the FAA until December 31; and the poison pill  amendments, of which there were scores--MAGA-inspired riders--were all  removed from the bill. After trying to take our government hostage,  MAGA Republicans won nothing.   So one more time, it is good Speaker McCarthy finally--finally-- heeded our message that bipartisanship was and is and remains the only  way. He could have made this decision weeks ago.   Now, I have said from day one, this is a bridge CR, a temporary  solution, not the final destination. We will not stop fighting for more  economic and security assistance for Ukraine. Majorities in both  parties support Ukraine aid, and doing more is vital for America's  security and for democracy around the world. But this CR is still very  good news for the American people.   Today, MAGA extremists have failed, bipartisanship has prevailed, and  both parties have come together to avert a shutdown.   Once again, thank you to Leader McConnell, Appropriations Chair Patty  Murray, Vice Chair Susan Collins, and Members on both sides of the  aisle who came together.   Today's CR would not have been possible without the Senate's good  work. The Senate showed that bipartisanship was the only way, and the  same will be true again in 45 days.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 319.
