 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  7027, the Child Care Is Essential Act.   Failing to solve this childcare crisis will set women back in the  workforce for generations.   We know that if we let our childcare industry collapse, the burden  will fall heavily on women.    I saw firsthand the challenges childcare providers face when I  visited the Building Blocks Learning Academy in Batavia, Illinois  earlier this month.   They are doing heroic work, but they need support.   If Congress doesn't act, thousands of childcare providers will close,  and millions of childcare slots will disappear.   I am proud that Illinois has been a model for how States can respond  to support childcare providers, but they still need the Federal help  that this bill delivers, and we must pass it today.
