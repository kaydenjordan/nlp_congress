 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 4 p.m. on Tuesday next.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the resolution (H. Res. 197) providing for the expenses  of certain committees of the House of Representatives in the One  Hundred Eighteenth Congress, and ask for its immediate consideration in  the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
