 Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss the rising costs that  are crushing hardworking families.   Last week, it was reported that inflation hit a 30-year high. This is  a hidden tax on every American that is making your paycheck worth less.  Americans are paying more for everything, from groceries, to utilities,  to filling up the gas tank.   The cost of a gallon of gas is up 61 percent; utilities up 28  percent; and everyday grocery items, like eggs, milk, and chicken, are  all significantly higher.   These numbers have real consequences for not only Orange County  families I represent, but nationwide. We need to get our spending under  control or these problems will only continue to get worse.   Madam Speaker, I will continue to fight against these policies that  are making life for Americans more expensive.                            ____________________
