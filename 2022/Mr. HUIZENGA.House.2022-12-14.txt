 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my hometown, the  city of Zeeland, on its 175th anniversary.   Throughout the first week of October, friends and residents of this  small but vibrant city in west Michigan gathered together to celebrate  and share memories of the community's storied history.   The village of Zeeland was established in 1847 when nearly 500 Dutch  citizens, led by James Van de Luyster, sailed from Zeeland in the  Netherlands to pursue religious freedom and self-rule. I will note that  my own family came in the second wave that same year of 1847 and has  proudly been ensconced in the city of Zeeland since then.   After settling on 16,000 acres of land, one of the first buildings  established was a church. Here, Reverend Cornelius van der Meulen  became the first spiritual leader and pastor to the Zeeland colonists,  offering hope and courage as the settlers cleared thick forests and  tackled this new land.   As the center of the community, the church served as a place of  worship on Sundays as well as a school on the weekdays, with  instruction provided in both English and in Dutch.   A burgeoning manufacturing and agriculture sector, as well as a post  office helped Zeeland to grow, leading to incorporation as a city in  1907. Now, the 1900s were a time of growth in Zeeland. In fact, my own  father served over 30 years on the city council from the late 1960s up  until the 1990s.   While the city has grown, one thing has remained a constant: The  innovative, entrepreneurial, close-knit, and welcoming community  continues to make Zeeland a special place to live, work, and raise a  family.   Mr. Speaker, let us join in recognizing all former and current  residents of the city of Zeeland as they celebrate their 175th  anniversary.                            ____________________
