 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the North Carolina Courage for their second straight  National Women's Soccer League Championship and their third title in  the past 4 years.   Their four-goal win was the largest margin of victory in NWSL  history.   The Triangle area that I represent in North Carolina has truly  embraced this team with a record-setting crowd attending Sunday's  match.   Now, this was really a team effort, but I do want to give a special  shout-out to Coach Paul Riley, MVP Debinha Miri, and the retiring  great--Heather O'Reilly. I must also mention the four members from the  Courage who also led us to victory in the 2019 Women's World Cup:  Crystal Dunn, Sam Mewis, Abby Dahlkemper, and Jessica McDonald.   Thank you for making North Carolina proud. And congratulations again  to the North Carolina Courage.                            ____________________
