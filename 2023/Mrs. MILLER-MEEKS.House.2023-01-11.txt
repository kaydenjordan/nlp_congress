 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the ongoing  crisis at our border.   When President Biden took office in January 2021, he inherited  commonsense immigration policies, such as remain in Mexico and title  42, that worked to keep our Nation safe, reducing the flow of illegal  drugs and gang members.   Unfortunately, President Biden immediately ceased construction of the  border wall and enacted policies favoring illegal immigrants over  Americans. Thankfully, the Supreme Court has challenged the legality of  President Biden's policies and overturned the removal of title 42.   Now it is Congress' time to act. Both Republicans and Democrats  acknowledge that our immigration system is broken, but only Speaker  McCarthy's Commitment to America has a plan to repair our broken  immigration system.   This Congress, Republicans will pass legislation that secures our  border, stops the influx of illegal drugs and criminals, and ends  catch-and-release loopholes and human trafficking.   Americans deserve a government that works in their best interest, and  these policies will create a safe and secure Nation.   I would also like to wish a very happy birthday to my L.D., Kyle  Jacobs.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 26.  I thank my colleague, the chair of the Judiciary Committee from Ohio,  for yielding me time.   Madam Speaker, as a mother, a doctor, a former nurse, and a former  director of Iowa's Department of Public Health, I know firsthand the  preciousness of life and the importance of prenatal care and the  tragedies that ensue when proper care isn't provided. In fact, the  first healthy baby I delivered as a doctor was to a young teenager who  put the baby up for adoption.   Our Nation promises three things: life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. There is no clause in the Constitution to exempt newborns  who survive an abortion procedure from these rights. It is not only  unreasonable, but it is inhuman to deny care to babies who were born  alive.   Regardless of maternal intent, what could be more extreme than  denying care to an infant born alive?   My colleague on the other side of the aisle from New York is correct.  It is infanticide.   H.R. 26 is legislation that should receive wide support from both  sides of the aisle. It is unconscionable to think that some Members  will choose to vote against this bill which will ensure infants receive  lifesaving care simply because of partisan politics. This legislation  isn't about abortions but saving the lives of living and breathing  innocent newborns.   Many States, including Iowa, have put safe haven laws in place to  allow parents to leave their infants at hospitals or care facilities  without fear of being prosecuted. We already have laws in place to  protect these infants.   Why should infants who survive an abortion be treated any  differently?   Like all other medical professionals, I took the Hippocratic oath  which promises that I will do no harm. This legislation reaffirms the  Hippocratic oath and ensures that doctors across the United States are  providing the same standard of medical care to all infants regardless  of the circumstance of their birth.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to stand in support of  life by voting for H.R. 26.
