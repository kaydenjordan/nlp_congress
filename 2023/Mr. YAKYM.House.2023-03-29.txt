 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate excellence in athletics  and a very special group of Hoosier young men. March in Indiana is all  about basketball, and this past weekend, the NorthWood boys basketball  team out of Nappanee and Wakarusa reached the heights of basketball  glory by winning the 3A State title for the very first time in school  history.   The Panthers took home the hardware by outlasting Guerin Catholic in  a 66-63 overtime thriller, with senior guard Cade Brenner leading the  scoring with 28 points.   When they cut down the nets on Saturday night, it was a fitting end  to a season in which the Panthers went a near undefeated 28 and 2.  Their State championship win was the result of countless hours of hard  work and practice that every player put in, what they call, The Pit.   Congratulations to Coach Aaron Wolf, who was just named coach of the  year, and every single Panther on being the last team standing. Thank  you for making your parents, peers, and the entire Wa-Nee community  proud.   God bless you and may God bless America.                            ____________________
