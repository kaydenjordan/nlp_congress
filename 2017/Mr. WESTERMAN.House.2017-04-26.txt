 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of  former Congressman Jay Dickey, who represented the Fourth District of  Arkansas for 8 years. In the days since Congressman Dickey's death last  week at the age of 77, tributes have poured in, with many noting his  sense of civic duty, his love of family, and, most of all, his faith in  God.   If you spent much time with Jay, you likely reached a point in the  conversation where he would pause and ask a pointed question: When you  die, where will you spend eternity?   I remember Jay asking me that question, and when I quickly responded  ``Heaven,'' he didn't let me off easy, as he followed up with: How do  you know? After which, we had a long discussion sharing our common  faith in Christ.   There are current Members of this House who served with Jay, the  first Republican to represent Arkansas' Fourth Congressional District.  Regardless of political party, he was a representative of all  Arkansans, and he genuinely cared about people.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the Members of the House to join me and the  Members of the Arkansas congressional delegation in observing a moment  of silence in remembrance of Congressman Jay Dickey.                            ____________________
