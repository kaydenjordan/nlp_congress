 Madam Speaker, before the lockdown left took a  wrecking ball to our economy, we were enjoying one of the greatest  expansions of economic opportunity in our lifetimes. Unemployment was  at its lowest rate in 50 years. The poverty rate was at its lowest rate  in 60 years. Most importantly, wage growth was the strongest in 40  years, and the wage gap between rich and poor was narrowing for the  first time in many years as blue-collar wages increased dramatically.  The unemployment rate for women was the lowest in 70 years. For African  Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, veterans, disabled  Americans, and those without a high school diploma, unemployment was  the lowest ever recorded.   Now, the tax and regulatory relief we won in 2017 and 2018 explained  much of that success. But something else was going on that caused the  extraordinary improvement of wages for unskilled or low-skilled  workers. It was because the Trump administration restored control of  our borders and stemmed the flood of low-wage labor that had been  suppressing wages for American workers for decades. Big business and  big agriculture hated this policy because it required them to pay  higher wages to Americans, but in the growing economy it produced,  working Americans who had been left behind for decades finally began to  prosper.   Now, did we learn nothing from this blue-collar boom?   The Democrats that these families trusted to look out for their  interests in the recent election are betraying them at every turn.  Nowhere is that clearer than the Democrats' zeal to open our borders to  a new wave of illegal immigration.   The President's executive orders have already produced a new migrant  crisis on the southern border. One abandoned the border wall in mid- construction. Another undermines the longstanding requirement that  immigrants be able to support themselves and not burden American  taxpayers.   Another ends the Remain in Mexico policy for those making asylum  claims, the vast majority of those claims being dubious. Yet another  effectively releases illegal immigrants accompanied by youths under 18  directly into the United States.   Another grants what amounts to sanctuary status for a wide variety of  criminal offenses, including drunk driving and sex offenses. Another  restores unrestricted travel from hotbeds of international terrorism.   The worst one orders ICE not to deport illegal immigrants for 100  days. That order now enjoined by a Federal judge begs the question:  What is the difference between abolishing ICE and forbidding ICE to do  its job?   Customs and Border Protection agents report in the last month the  flow on the southern border has nearly doubled from 2,000 a day to  3,500 a day. The number of illegal immigrants encountered on the  southern border during the first 4 months of the last fiscal year was  nearly 165,000. That number has nearly doubled this year to more than  295,000.   Every American needs to clearly understand what this means to their  lives, their families, their communities, and their futures.   How are American workers helped by flooding the labor market with  another wave of illegal immigration?   How are our children, who have been robbed of an entire year of their  educations, helped by filling their classrooms with non-English  speaking classmates?   How are our streets made safer by allowing aliens who drive drunk to  remain on our roads rather than be arrested and placed in removal  proceedings?   How is our Nation made safer by reopening virtually unrestricted  travel with nations that foster terrorism?   How are our communities made safer by making it harder to deport  criminal illegal aliens and gang members?   How are our hospitals made more accessible by overwhelming emergency  rooms by illegal immigrants demanding care?   Why would they pursue these policies that strike most acutely and  painfully at America's working families? Especially now when those  families are reeling from the effects of a year of repressive  lockdowns?   Those blue-collar workers who made the greatest gains during the  Trump economic expansion are the most harmed by reversing the  immigration enforcement that produced it.   Let us not forget that millions of legal immigrants who obeyed our  laws, respected our Nation's sovereignty, waited patiently, and have  done everything our country has asked of them have also been made  victims of the Democrats' pursuit of open borders.  [[Page H622]]    Without enforcement of our immigration laws, our borders are  meaningless. And if our borders are meaningless, then America ceases to  be a nation and instead becomes a vast international territory between  Canada and Mexico.   Mr. Speaker, I fear that is the ultimate objective of the left and  that the only force that can stop them now is the American people at  the ballot box.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this law could not be plainer. It says  gender is not a question of genetics, but of personal choice. And  leftist dogma now calls for this doctrine to be imposed under force of  law, and the effect is frightening.   States that have adopted similar laws have threatened safe spaces for  women and intimidated the free exercise of conscience. But let me focus  on just two aspects: How this destroys women's sports and renders  parents powerless to protect their own children.   Selina Soule, a teenager, worked her heart out and qualified for the  Connecticut State championship track meet a few years ago. This is her  experience:   She said, ``Eight of us lined up at the starting line . . . but when  six of us were only about three-quarters into the race, two girls were  already across the finish line. . . .   ``What just happened? Two boys identifying as girls happened.   ``Fair is no longer the norm. The chance to advance, the chance to  win has been all over for us. . . .   ``This policy will take away our medals, records, scholarships and  dreams.''   An anguished mother named Elaine, told her story: She said, ``Let me  explain to you how this works. . . . Questioning a child's professed  gender identity is now illegal.   ``So, if a little boy is 5 years old and believes he is the opposite  sex, affirmative care means going along with his beliefs. Parents are  encouraged to refer to him as their `daughter' and let him choose a  feminine name. . . .   ``Is it really harmless to tell a child who still believes in the  tooth fairy that he is of the opposite sex?   ``If a 10-year-old girl is uncomfortable with her developing body and  suddenly insists she is a boy, affirmative care means blocking this  girl's puberty with powerful drugs.''   America, wake up. This is the brave, new world that House Democrats  propose under the name ``equality.'' The parents of every daughter, who  has ever poured their hearts into a sport should be outraged that their  daughter's dreams and hopes no longer matter to their own  Representative.   Every parent who would give their life to protect their child should  be livid that this bill is about to replace them with bureaucrats who  can administer puberty-blocking drugs on their child's say-so.   And every American should be scared as hell to realize the  ideological extremism that is now running rampant behind the razor- wired militarized U.S. Capitol. It is hard to believe that we once  called it ``the people's House.''   Let this be a wake-up call to every voter. If you elect enough  radicals to the Congress, you will get a radical Congress.     Mr. Speaker, everything we touch in our daily lives,  [[Page H698]]  everything that makes our existence possible, everything that makes us  more comfortable and more prosperous, everything we see in this Chamber  comes to us in only two ways. It is either grown or it is mined. That  is a universal truth.   Everything we enjoy on this planet is either grown or mined.  Fortunately, nature has given us a super abundance of resources and  left it to us to responsibly reap and to manage this bounty.   But it is precisely these resources that the left has waged war  against for an entire generation. The very things that make us  prosperous and comfortable are the things the left attempts to place  off limits.   Is it any wonder that the more they extend their domain, the worse  the human conditions that they produce?   This bill declares another 1.5 million acres of public lands, mostly  forests, an area about the size of Delaware, a wilderness area, off  limits to forest management, timber harvesting, and even many forms of  public recreation. An untended forest is like an untended garden. It  will grow until it chokes itself to death and succumbs to disease,  pestilence, and, ultimately, catastrophic wildfire.   These restrictions have abandoned our forests to neglect and produced  the paradox of a severe national lumber shortage while the government  sits on vast timber reserves.   This bill places 1,200 more miles of rivers under similar  restrictions that create water shortages in some of the most water- abundant regions of our country.   It prevents mineral extraction and energy production from another 1.2  million acres, killing jobs, crushing the economy, and empowering our  international adversaries. At a time when the Federal Government's bad  management practices have created a $12 billion maintenance backlog,  this bill takes another half million acres of land into Federal  mismanagement.   Understand what that means to local communities. This is land that is  producing no taxes and little commerce. Much is being seized over local  objections in States where the Federal Government already controls more  than half of their entire land area.   Mr. Speaker, this is a direct attack on working Americans who depend  on the resources of our Nation to put food on their tables and a roof  over their heads. It is an attack on the prosperity and security of our  people, and it is what we have come to expect from the greens gone wild  on the other side of the aisle.    The result will be more dead forests, more water shortages,  increasing costs for energy and consumer goods, lower wages, and fewer  jobs.   These policies always produce want from plenty, and I am afraid they  will continue until the American people finally demand that we restore  the nation of abundance that we once took for granted.
