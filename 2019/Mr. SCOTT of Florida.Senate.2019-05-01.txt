 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of the  nomination of Rodolfo Ruiz to serve as a judge for the U.S. District  Court for the Southern District of Florida.   I first met Judge Rudy Ruiz in 2012 when I appointed him to the  Miami-Dade County Court, when he was only 33 years old. He served  Miami-Dade County very well, and 3 years later I had the opportunity to  appoint him to the circuit court bench.   Judge Ruiz has an impressive record. He graduated from Duke  University and earned his law degree from Georgetown University.   Following law school, Judge Ruiz clerked for Federal Judge Federico  Moreno in the Southern District of Florida and later served as  assistant county attorney for Miami-Dade County.   With 7 years of distinguished service as a judge in Florida, it is no  surprise that the administration has nominated him for this position,  and the American Bar Association agrees. They unanimously rated him as  ``well qualified'' for the robe.   Judge Rudy Ruiz has honorably served the State of Florida, and I am  proud to support his appointment to the Federal bench today.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
