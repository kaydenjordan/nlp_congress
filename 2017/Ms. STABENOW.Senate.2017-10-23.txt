 Madam President, unfortunately, I was unable to  attend the rollcall vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion  to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2266,  emergency supplemental appropriations. Had I been able to attend, I  would have voted in favor of cloture.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
