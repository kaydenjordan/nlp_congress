 Mr. Speaker, Seymour Johnson Air Force  Base is getting it done for the American people.   As a proud U.S. Air Force veteran and member of the House Committee  on Armed Services, I toured the base recently to better understand its  challenges, including the possibility of losing F-15E Strike Eagles  without any replacement. That is why I led a bipartisan letter  encouraging House Members not to strike the Strike Eagle provision from  the NDAA.   During my visit, I saw a deteriorating child development center, and  this is unacceptable. While at the facility, a 4-year-old came up to  the window and waved, smiling, which touched my heart.   Mr. Speaker, we must advance military construction projects like this  and join in the work of the bipartisan Quality of Life panel, because  this 4-year-old, her friends, and her family deserve nothing less. This  is the best way that we can wave back to the children of our military  families.                            ____________________
