 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the last year, women's  reproductive rights have come under a new level of assault. From  Alabama to Missouri, to Texas, to Georgia, and beyond, over 300 new  restrictions have been proposed in 39 States--bans on abortion as early  as 6 weeks, so-called heartbeat bills, arbitrary waiting periods, and  restrictions on clinics so severe that they force any center that  performs an abortion to close down, leaving a few of our States with no  more than a single clinic.   Ten such bills have now passed into law. These restrictions fly in  the face of public opinion. The vast majority of the American public  don't want to see Roe overturned or a woman's right to choose curtailed  so severely as to render it meaningless.   I understand why many of my colleagues here in the Senate don't want  to associate themselves with these extreme anti-abortion laws. Some of  them have even publicly opposed the law passed by Alabama's  Republicans, including the House Republican leader and the President.  But let's face it. There is a sleight of hand going on here, because  while many of my colleagues don't support these policies out loud, they  are, at the same time, confirming judges to the Federal bench with  horrendous records on women's rights, many of whom hold extreme views  on Roe. These judges, in many ways, have just as much power as State  legislatures to restrict a woman's right to choose and limit access to  contraceptives through the courts.   Just look at some of the judges the Republican Senate has approved in  the past 2 years with almost unanimous support on the Republican side.  Look at Leonard Steven Grasz, who wrote about the ``moral bankruptcy  that's the legacy of Roe v. Wade.''   What about Amy Coney Barrett? She said Roe v. Wade had been  ``erroneously decided'' and called the ACA's birth control provisions  ``an assault on religious liberty.'' A lot of these judges are not just  against abortion. They are against contraception. She is on the bench  for life. Amy Coney Barrett, who said that, is on the bench for life  and on President Trump's short list for the Supreme Court.   Let's not forget Justice Kavanaugh, who refused to affirm that Roe  was settled law and now sits on the one body with the power to overturn  it.   Just last week, Republicans confirmed Wendy Vitter, who said Planned  [[Page S2987]]  Parenthood kills 150,000 a year and once pushed the idea that  contraceptives cause cancer.   We have more coming down the pipeline. Soon the Senate may consider  the nomination of Stephen Clark, who belonged to an organization called  Lawyers for Life. He once compared Roe v. Wade to the Dred Scott case.   So Republicans are playing a cynical long game here. They refuse to  comment on the anti-abortion bills but are content to install anti- choice judges across the Federal bench who will uphold many of these  very same laws. It is hypocritical. It is sort of like that old  routine. They are saying: No, no, no, I am not for these laws. Judges,  approve them. I am supporting judges who approve them.   It is not fair, it is not right, it is cynical, and the American  people are going to get wise to it. We are watching the endgame of a  long and concerted campaign by the far right to erode a woman's right  to choose through the courts. From the moment that Roe v. Wade was  decided in 1973, the most extreme elements of the Republican Party have  plotted its demise.   The Federalist Society was founded with the intent of cultivating a  generation of judges loyal to conservative causes. Its founder, Leonard  Leo, was, above all, an anti-choice advocate--some would say, even  further, a fanatic. Now that they have a Republican President and a  Republican Senate, the Federalist Society can push judge after judge  after judge onto the bench with barely a delay and with barely a  discussion, where they will have the power to severely curtail a  woman's right to choose.   My Republican friends who profess opposition or indifference to these  extreme anti-abortion bills while voting for hard-right, anti-Roe  judges are engaging in subterfuge, if not hypocrisy.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, there is a topic I have  discussed before--the administration's moves to block access to  telecommunications equipment to China's state-controlled and state- backed firms, like Huawei. I firmly back these measures. Our defense,  law enforcement, and intelligence officials have publicly testified  that Huawei and other Chinese telecom companies pose a national threat  to the security of the United States. Their technology could allow  China to spy on Americans, steal their data, and otherwise conduct  espionage.   Also, there is another point. China has taken advantage of us. There  is a huge consensus now in America that that has happened. We didn't  have that consensus even 5 years ago, but whether it is business or  labor, average American citizens, Democrats, or Republicans, everyone  agrees that China takes advantage, and one of the main ways they take  advantage is they don't let our companies that have top-line products  sell them in China, except under restrictions that make it almost  impossible for them to do it. Our major tech companies are excluded  from China, but China, at the same time, can sell anything it wants  here.   ``Reciprocity'' should be our watch word. If Google or Facebook or  any of our other companies can't sell in China, their top companies  shouldn't sell here until they let us in. That is what has happened  with Huawei, in addition to the national security concerns, and it  makes sense.   So I say to the Commerce Department: Stay strong.   We are now talking about some 90-day delay. I hope this is not a  prelude to what we did with ZTE, when we stood tough at the beginning.  It had an effect, and then we backed off.   President Trump, don't back off on Huawei.   Commerce Secretary Ross, don't back off on Huawei.   Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin and Ambassador Lighthizer, stay strong.   This will get the Chinese to play fair; talking won't. Tariffs are  one tool; this is another. We need all the tools in our toolbox to get  China to play fair.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
