 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Here we are about 1 week before Christmas, and the GOP has proposed a  tax bill that Ebenezer Scrooge would love. It is a big ``bah humbug''  for America and the families and communities we represent back home.   Their bill will raise taxes on millions of American middle class  families while showering tax breaks and new loopholes on the superrich  and big corporations. It is fundamentally unfair. It does this with a  massive increase to our national debt of about $2.3 trillion, in  essence, mortgaging the future for our kids and grandkids and squeezing  out our ability to invest in medical research and modern  infrastructure.   They admit they are going to look to cut and raise costs on families  who depend on Medicaid and Medicare. It is not fair. In this bill, they  even go so far as to rip health coverage away from 13 million Americans  in another attack on the ACA. In Florida, 1.7 million of my neighbors  rely on the healthcare.gov insurance pool for affordable coverage. They  are, in essence, giving them a lump of coal for Christmas.   We have got to defeat this bill. Vote ``no'' on this Scrooge tax  bill.
