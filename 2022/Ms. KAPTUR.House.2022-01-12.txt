 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to pay  tribute to distinguished Ohio Senator Edna Brown, a trailblazer who  recently passed away.   Edna Brown was a remarkable public servant from Toledo, Ohio, who  dedicated her life and her three decades of service to improving the  well-being and future of our community.   As the first and only African American to represent Lucas County in  the Ohio Senate, she blazed a trail for many to follow at the highest  level of elected office in Ohio.   She was a warm, inviting, and immensely kind person whose focus was  always on public service and bettering the lives of the people she  served, the people she truly loved.   Northwest Ohio lost a great champion. Her family lost a great mother  and grandmother. America needs more people like Edna Brown in public  service.   Her memory will live with us, and I know her legacy will inspire the  next generation of Ohio's leaders, including women leaders.   I will include her life story and her obituary in the Congressional  Record as a tribute to her persevering accomplishments for our Nation's  betterment.   Godspeed, Edna Brown. May the angels carry you very high, and may you  rest in peace.

I thank Chairman Takano and  Representative Levin for their important work on this legislation that  finally acknowledges the undervalued service of our guard and  reservists. The sponsors' sentiments ring true: Every day in uniform  counts. At least it should count. It should count more.   In Ohio, there are over 11,400 National Guard members performing  strategic and operational duties to whom we owe enormous gratitude.   Our National Guard protects our homeland and supports the mission of  our troops abroad. It provides critical support to people in times of  urgent need, from natural disasters to the public health COVID  emergency we are in right now.   The National Guard and Reserves have been an invaluable readiness  resource throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and are continuing to fill  critical roles in response to the pandemic.   In my home State of Ohio, the Ohio National Guard has helped Ohio  food banks distribute over 56 million pounds of food at 14 food banks  and warehouses, including the Toledo Northwestern Ohio Food Bank. They  have provided food banks the support they needed to keep children,  seniors, veterans, and families fed during these very trying times.   They set up COVID-19 testing clinics and traveled the State to keep  our communities safe. They are currently stationed at 12 testing  locations across Ohio.   Thanks to President Biden's executive actions, 2,300 Guard members  have been activated across Ohio to help hospitals and public health  experts care for those most in need so all the omicron variant patients  that are flooding  [[Page H55]]  our hospitals have some hope of survival.   The service and dedication of our National Guard and Reserves require  that we appropriately recognize and appreciate their sacrifices. While  the debt we owe them cannot be fully repaid, the legislation before us  ensures that these honorable men and women will receive the proper  access to the educational benefits they so rightly deserve.   Providing these important GI Bill benefits will undoubtedly aid the  recruitment and retention of National Guard units at home and abroad  while further investing in our servicemembers' futures.   With six National Guard sites in my own congressional district and  several Reserve units nearby, I know that this legislation will have a  deep and lasting impact on our State's residents and those who answer  the call to serve.   It is certainly my privilege to represent these guard and reservists  in Congress, and I am proud to support enhancing the benefits that they  can have access to and deserve for their service. May God be with all  our men and women in uniform.
