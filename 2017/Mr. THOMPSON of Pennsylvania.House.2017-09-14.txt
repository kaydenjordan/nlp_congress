 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate AccuWeather as it celebrates 55 years of serving  communities, businesses, and institutions around the world.   In 1962, Dr. Joel Myers founded AccuWeather to help people plan their  lives, protect their businesses, and to make the most of their days.   Dr. Myers has led an impressive career as a fellow of the National  Meteorological Society and one of the top entrepreneurs in American  history. Today, AccuWeather is the world's largest weather and digital  media company, reaching nearly 2 billion people at least 29 million  times each day. Proudly, it is headquartered right in State College,  Pennsylvania.   Throughout the years, the company has expanded its offices to New  York, Montreal, and Tokyo, just to name a few, but it has always called  Pennsylvania home, and it has been a major employer for decades in the  Commonwealth.   Over 55 years, AccuWeather continues to build upon its main mission:  to improve people's lives.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate AccuWeather on 55 years of service,  accuracy, trust, and protection they have offered to people around the  world.                            ____________________
