 Madam Speaker, I thank GOP leader Latta for yielding me  time to support our bill.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of our resolution, H. Res. 575,  which I introduced with my colleague Darren Soto from Florida,  expressing strong support for the Prague Proposals, a set of 5G  security recommendations agreed to by officials from the U.S. and 31  other countries during a conference in May 2019.   5G communication networks have the potential to transform the way we  live. Collaboration with our international partners is paramount in the  development of secure network architecture for the interconnected world  of the future.   5G networks will have the capacity to support innovative technologies  such as telemedicine, remote surgery, interconnected devices on the  Internet of Things, and, importantly, bring high-speed broadband to the  far reaches of rural communities to close the digital divide.   But if the underlying network that these services operate on is not  properly secured, bad actors will be able to exploit vulnerabilities to  disrupt critical infrastructure, harming public safety and jeopardizing  national security. It is imperative that we secure our networks on the  front end of deployment to avoid potentially catastrophic consequences  down the road.   Recognizing these risks, the U.S. and those 31 other countries came  together with representatives from the EU and NATO to agree on a set of  commonsense principles necessary to maintain a secure, resilient  network for next-generation communication.   These proposals urge 5G stakeholders across the global supply  technology chain to institute practical, proven solutions to mitigate  risks and to protect against security threats. Among these proposals,  the conference of 32 countries recognized the need for information  sharing and encouraged regular risk assessment tests to mitigate  vulnerabilities, while taking into consideration technological changes  that will address the risks we may encounter in the future.   Our resolution expresses the House of Representatives' support for  these recommendations as an encouragement for stakeholders, government  entities, and our international partners to work together to secure our  5G networks.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Soto for his work, and I urge my  colleagues to support this important resolution.                                time  1600
