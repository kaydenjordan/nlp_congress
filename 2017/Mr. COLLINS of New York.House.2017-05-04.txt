 Mr. Speaker, for the past 7 years, the  American people have pleaded with their Representatives in Washington  to repeal ObamaCare. Today, every Member of this body has the  opportunity to do just that. We have the chance to eliminate  excruciating mandates and taxes that are suffocating our economy and  marketplaces.   Under ObamaCare, premiums have increased by over 37 percent since  2014, one-third of counties in this country have only one insurance  provider, and 4.7 million Americans were kicked off the insurance  coverage they wanted to maintain despite President Obama's promise  that, if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it.   But today we have the chance to lower premiums, increase competition  among insurance providers, and improve access to health insurance for  all Americans. We finally have the chance to formally reject an  unprecedented government overreach into health care and take the first  step towards giving patients control over their own health.   In western New York, this bill will have even more profound benefits.  The amendment that I authored with Representative John Faso will  relieve county governments in New York of a $2.3 billion unfunded  mandate forced onto county taxpayers by the Governor of New York and  will substantially reduce the tax burdens of property owners across New  York State. This one provision of the American Health Care Act will  save taxpayers in the eight counties that I represent over $470 million  a year.   This is a game-changer for local New York governments and restores a  fundamental tenet of representative democracies that the level of  government that makes the decision about spending should be responsible  for raising those funds. I am proud to stand up for western New Yorkers  whose voices have been silenced for too long, and I am proud to vote  for the freedom, fiscal responsibility, and local decisionmaking this  bill guarantees.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to do the same.
