 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  3397, the Building Blocks of STEM Act, which also includes my Code Like  a Girl Act.   I first want to thank my Republican colleague, Steve Knight, for  working with me and co-leading this important legislation and our  Science, Space, and Technology Committee chairman, Lamar Smith, for  helping move this bill through committee. I am proud to see both of my  STEM education proposals come to the floor with wide bipartisan  support.   STEM and computer science are central to our country's innovation,  economic growth, and employment. Across the country, we are continuing  to see a huge demand for workers in the tech industry, including  software developers, engineers, and computer programmers like myself.   I built my career in STEM--a field that has long been dominated by  men--so I know all too well that the demand for talent in STEM is real.   In my home State of Nevada, tech companies like Tesla, Switch, and  Google are leading the way to create the jobs of the future. Even  across all industries, about 15 percent of jobs in Nevada require a  high level of knowledge in at least one STEM field.   Despite these increasing opportunities in STEM careers, not enough  Americans possess the education and skills necessary to succeed. This  disparity between computing and scientific talent and employer demand  really starts as far back as elementary school.   Studies have found that children who engage in scientific activities  from an early age will develop positive attitudes toward science and  are more likely to pursue STEM careers later on. In fact, interviews  with current graduate students and scientists found that the majority  of them reported that their interest in science began before middle  school.                                time  1730    The bill before us today, the Building Blocks of STEM Act, will  ensure that we are investing in our children as early as possible by  directing the National Science Foundation to equitably distribute  funding across age groups. Specifically, this bill would direct funding  to include early childhood education in the Discovery Research PreK-12  program, which seeks to enhance the learning and teaching of STEM and  address the immediate challenges facing pre-K through 12 STEM  education.   Currently, the Discovery Research PreK-12 program focuses the  majority of its research on students in middle school or older. Since  having access to hands-on STEM experiences as early as possible is  important for continued interest, my bill will ensure that NSF focuses  on engaging our Nation's children in STEM education even younger,  specifically, those under the age of 11.   H.R. 3397 also includes the text of another STEM bill of mine, the  Code Like a Girl Act, which I introduced with the support of my  Republican colead, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. It is also cosponsored  by Subcommittee on Research and Technology Chairwoman Barbara Comstock  and Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Ranking Member Eddie  Bernice Johnson; and I would like to thank them both for their support.   This legislation is for our girls, girls like Isabel, an eighth  grader from my district who loves STEM. She is on her high school  robotics team. Last year, for a school project, she proposed a new  monitoring system to accurately assess the fire issues at Yellowstone  National Park.   This past summer, I received a letter from Isabel, and in her letter  to me, she offered an idea on how to increase and improve solar energy  in Nevada. I wrote back to Isabel and later had the opportunity to meet  her and her family in person. I thanked her for her advocacy and let  her know that we will only move forward in this country by inspiring  young minds to create, innovate, and imagine the future. Isabel is one  of the young girls we are fighting for today.   Young girls should know that they are more capable of succeeding in  STEM and that they can grow up to be the next Grace Hopper or Katherine  Johnson. This bill will help bridge that divide and close the gender  gap that, for too long, has deprived young women from achieving their  full potential. These young, talented minds could be working on our  Nation's most challenging problems by inventing the next breakthrough  technology, founding future startup companies, improving access to  healthcare with computing, and even keeping our Nation safe from cyber  attacks. The Code Like a Girl Act would create two NSF programs to  encourage young girls to pursue computer science.   As we all know, the gender gap in the STEM workforce is widening.  Women only hold about 26 percent of STEM jobs, even though they make up  more than half of the U.S. workforce. This gender disparity extends  down through all levels of education. In 2015, approximately 23 percent  of AP computer science exam takers were girls.   And gender stereotypes begin at a very early age. Studies have shown  that, at around 6 years old, girls develop the belief that brilliance  is a male characteristic, and this negative stereotype is shown to have  an immediate effect as girls start to lose their interest in activities  they perceive as requiring brilliance.   Another study found that young children, both boys and girls, already  believe that boys are better than girls at  [[Page H1100]]  robotics and programming. It is unclear where precisely this stereotype  originates from, but implicit biases can have a negative impact on a  girl's academic achievement in math and science and on their future  decisions to enroll in advanced courses in these subjects.   The Code Like a Girl Act addresses this issue by creating NSF grants  to increase understanding of the factors that contribute to the  participation of young girls 10 and younger in STEM and computer  science activities. This bill also creates a grant program to develop  and evaluate interventions in pre-K and elementary school classrooms  with the goal of increasing participation of young girls in computer  science.   Some of these activities may include teacher training and  professional development, classroom programs on gender-inclusive  teaching practices, and providing mentors for girls to support their  computer science aspirations. We know that young girls are interested  in science, math, and computing, but we need to make sure that, as they  grow older, they stay involved and engaged.   We also know that knowledge of computer science and use of technology  is becoming increasingly essential for all individuals, not just those  planning to work in the technology sector. STEM education cultivates  students' curiosity, their creativity. It teaches them to work as a  team and fosters critical thinking skills that are fundamental for  success in any field.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will help invest in our students. It  will help them rise to meet the challenges of a changing economy that  increasingly relies on highly skilled labor and technology. I am proud  to stand for our students before this Chamber because, together, we are  making smart investments that will help our children succeed, smart  investments so that we can help our communities build more effective  workforces and a stronger, competitive economy.   For these reasons, I am proud that my Building Blocks of STEM Act,  including the text of my Code Like a Girl Act, is being considered  today. With the passage of these bills, we are one step closer to  bridging the current gaps in STEM education and workforce training.   Building the blocks for careers in STEM will prepare Nevadans and all  Americans for better jobs and help us meet the demands of our 21st  century economy. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
