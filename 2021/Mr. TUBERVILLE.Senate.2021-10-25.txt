 Madam President, after being in Washington, DC, for  10 months, I have seen this town jump from one issue to another. Sadly,  many of the issues we face are self-inflicted--illegal immigrants on  the southern border, Americans who remain trapped in Afghanistan, and  rampant inflation, just to name three.   But we face a more serious threat in this Nation, an issue larger  than left or right, a threat that goes beyond conservative and  liberal--China.   China seeks to shackle the United States economically,  technologically, and militarily. The Communist leaders of China are  employing every instrument of national power to diminish our standing  and influence in the world. Last month, President Biden told world  leaders during his maiden U.N. General Assembly speech that the United  States ``is not seeking a cold war.'' Well, the United States may not  be seeking out a new Cold War, but China is, so we shouldn't give them  the shovel to bury us.    When asked this week if China's hypersonic missile testing over the  summer was a surprise to U.S. officials, White House Press Secretary  Jen Psaki joked that the Biden administration ``welcomes stiff  competition.'' Businesses that are struggling under unfair competition  from China didn't laugh at the Press Secretary's joke.   Intelligence analysts who watch week after week as China hacks its  way to technological superiority know the competition is cheating.   Military leaders who stand the watch for us worry that the United  States public may be asleep at the wheel to this enormous threat.   In 2001, then-Senator Biden said:         The United States welcomes the emergence of a prosperous       integrated China on the global stage because we expect this       is going to be a China that plays by the rules.    President Biden, China is not playing by the rules.   The Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, said the  following in her Annual Threat Assessment:         The Chinese Communist Party . . . will continue . . . to .       . . undercut . . . the United States, drive wedges between       Washington and its allies and partners, and foster . . .       international norms that favor the authoritarian Chinese       system.    The four-star admiral in charge of our nuclear overwatch, ADM Charles  Richard, warned the country that China's growth and strategic nuclear  capability was ``breathtaking.''   To those paying attention, we know that China seeks to play a very  dangerous game--a game they intend to win and a game they will win  unless we stand united as a nation and work together to face this  growing threat.   So let's take a look at the most recent breathtaking development.  China recently conducted their ninth hypersonic missile test since  2014--their ninth.   By the way, 2014 was when then-President Obama was forced to start  investing in missile defense after he ended or slowed funding for  several programs early in his first term.   What was important about China's most recent test, however, is that  it showed off China's advanced space capabilities. Hypersonic missiles  are weapons that fly at more than five times the speed of sound, 3,800  miles per hour. They don't follow a fixed trajectory; their path is  flexible and maneuverable. This is what makes them so hard to defend  against.   A recent congressional report on hypersonic weapons revealed that the  United States will not have a defensive capability against hypersonic  weapons until the mid-2020s at the earliest.   Unlike our government, which, by the way, is wasting money on  civilian climate corps and bailing out poorly run liberal blue States,  China spends its resources on deadliness--a new and larger navy, a  modernized nuclear arsenal, advanced space assets, and artificial  intelligence. Yes, China is moving ahead and investing in killing  machines.   Developing hypersonics is costly. The Pentagon noted as much  recently, which is ironic given how little this administration has  showed it cares about throwing trillions of dollars around on other  programs not related to national security. China continues to outspend  us on national security. In just the last 10 years, China's defense  spending has increased by $200 billion, while we, the United States of  America, have decreased by $400 billion.   That brings me to a very important point. Senator Schumer needs to  bring up the National Defense Authorization Act for a vote here on the  Senate floor. Every year since 1960, we have passed the National  Defense Authorization Act, better known as the NDAA. The NDAA is one of  few bills that the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans, work  together on. That is because our military deserves it, and our national  security depends on it.   One of the most important items we agreed on this year in the NDAA  was that our military needs more support.   Earlier this year, President Biden sent Congress a laughable military  budget. In a stunning referendum on the President's disappointing and  dangerous military budget, Democrats and Republicans on the Armed  Services Committee came together to increase our military budget by $25  billion.   You know, we cannot ask our military to do more with less. We cannot  expect our military to defend new threats from our adversaries like  China without the resources required to do the job. Republicans  understand this. We have continuously fought to prioritize national  security. Democrats on the Armed Services Committee also understand  this. So I would like to ask  [[Page S7331]]  a simple question: What are we waiting for?   The best way to thank our men and women in uniform for their service  is to pass this bill. The best way to ensure our armed services have  resources they need to defend our country against China is to pass this  bill, especially in light of the news we have seen recently about  China's hypersonic missile testing.   Earlier this year, as the Senate Armed Services Committee crafted the  NDAA, I fought to prioritize robust funding authorization for high- energy lasers and hypersonic missile development. This investment  accelerates the country's timeline to a fully capable hypersonic  missile while at the same time assisting our missile defense  capabilities with tracking hypersonic, ballistic, and cruise missiles.  This is an offensive and defensive approach.   China is actively trying to outpace us, and keeping pace is not  enough. To do that, we need to have sustained, strategic investment in  our military. That is what the NDAA provides and why we need a vote on  the Senate floor. So what does it say about Leader Schumer's priorities  that passing our military authorization is at the bottom of his list?    But investment in their military is not the only means by which China  is seeking to get ahead. We have seen increased efforts by China to  infiltrate our economy--we have seen this--to undermine our free market  values, and to steal our international property.   In a recent survey, a greater number of Americans said that China is  more powerful economically than the United States. This is a reversal  from 2 years ago when most Americans said the United States had the  economic upper hand.   When it comes to taking over the economic upper hand, China has no  rules, and Chinese companies definitely do not play by ours. Our  country has already seen Chinese companies, backed by the Chinese  Communist Party, attempt to invest in and even take over companies.  This grave national security threat will only grow if we allow China to  invest in our critical industries.   Our government has a process to investigate offers made by foreign  companies and governments that want to acquire or invest in America.  This process is designed to protect our national security. It is  handled by a government entity called the Committee on Foreign  Investment in the United States, better known as CFIUS. But if there is  a loophole, communist China will try to slip through it.   Our goal as Members of Congress should be to strengthen this vetting  process. One way to do that is to add a permanent agricultural  perspective to this committee, which is not on there as we speak. The  COVID pandemic showed us just how important it is to have strong supply  chains, especially when it comes to our food supply. Every American is  supported by a safe and secure food supply. It is critical to our  country's prosperity.   Not everyone thinks about food security in relation to national  security, but they are linked. Global corporations have already become  more involved with our domestic food supply and agricultural  businesses. Recent data shows that 192,000 acres of farmland or forest  in the United States of America are linked to Chinese ownership,  including land used for farming, ranching, and forestry--192,000 acres  here within our borders. That is why we need more transparency.   Our food supply must remain secure from foreign governments like  China that have no business being in the American economy and actively  trying to harm our country. That is why I introduced a bill called the  Foreign Adversary Risk Management, or FARM, Act, to put more  protections in place for America's agriculture industry. My bill will  ensure that our agriculture industry has a permanent seat at the table  of CFIUS, which reviews agriculture-related investments. As we speak,  we do not have representation from the agriculture community. By adding  agriculture supply chains as a covered transaction that CFIUS has to  review, we can make sure food supply chains remain strong and free of  damaging foreign government interference.   Like China's communist leaders, leftists in this country believe that  when it comes to the economy, bureaucrats know best. They think raising  the corporate rate to be higher than communist China's will strengthen  our economy. Nonsense. That is like standing in a bucket and trying to  lift yourself by the handle. The far-left cheers for mandates,  hyperregulation, and massive taxes. They sneer at your freedoms and are  triggered by the American flag and our constitutional rights. Their way  is not the way to combat China; it is the way to become China.   We all know China wants to overtake the United States as a  superpower. But what makes the United States a superpower is not just  our economic and military might; we are a superpower for what our  military is fighting to defend and to protect: our freedoms and our  values and the American spirit of innovation and ingenuity, of hard  work and grit. These values pose a direct threat to communist China.  They are why China wants to surpass our country as the world's No. 1  superpower.   We need leadership that protects our national security and our  economic security. It is the only way to combat the aggression that the  Biden administration's weakness has invited.   I yield the floor.
