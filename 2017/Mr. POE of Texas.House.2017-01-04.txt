 Mr. Speaker, the anti-Semitic United Nations has  struck a new low, demanding that Israel prohibit Jews from settling in  the West Bank. Guess who was supportive of this absurd resolution in  betrayal of our closest ally? The United States.   Once again, this administration is on the wrong side. It has  alienated what few international friends we have. Secretary of State  John Kerry arrogantly declared: ``Israel can either be Jewish or  democratic; it cannot be both.''   Mr. Speaker, let's think about that statement. The United Nations'  mandate separating Jews from Palestinians in the West Bank is  segregation. Segregation is not democratic.   The United States and the U.N. have no legal business telling a  sovereign nation where people should live or shouldn't live in that  country. Who in the world do we think we are? Would we approve of the  U.N. telling us that one race or ethnic group could not live in one  region of the United States? Absolutely not.   Thankfully, this State Department will soon be clearing their desks  at Foggy Bottom--and good riddance. It is time for a new State  Department that supports America's friends and not our enemies.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
