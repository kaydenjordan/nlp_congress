 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, the distinguished new  chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. I am so proud to  call him that.   Mr. Chairman, let me just say, I heard the arguments from my friend  from North Carolina, and I know he does care about the Federal  employees, but his arguments ring hollow when you support a 35-day  shutdown of the Federal Government.   If you believe in regular order, then you never shu down the Federal  Government, nor do you advise the President of the United States to  shut down the Federal Government, nor do you use shutdowns as a tool to  get some policy goal achieved.    That is never acceptable. It shouldn't be acceptable to Washington.  It is not acceptable to the American people. It certainly is not  acceptable to the 800,000 Federal employees and an equal number of  Federal contract employees and small business owners who were affected  negatively by this shutdown.   So it is hard to listen to a lecture about regular order in the midst  of that wreckage.   That is what we are trying to do here. It is not a messaging bill to  embarrass anybody. It is a bill to try to begin to restore the  integrity of respect and dignity to the men and women who serve this  country. They are called Federal employees. They were innocent victims  of political games, as if they were pawns, Mr. Chairman, for a wall. We  are just trying to begin the process of making them whole again.   I thank the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, for bringing this bill to the  floor. The bill would end the current freeze for Federal employees,  recommended by President Trump, and provide hardworking civil servants  with a 2.6 percent pay increase, matching that for military employees.   On the heels of this largest government shutdown in U.S. history, and  the longest, I believe it is appropriate for the House of  Representatives to take up this legislation to make a statement in the  people's body that we do respect the work of our civil servants and our  Federal employees and that we are prepared to provide concrete measures  to do that.   During the shutdown, some of these individuals reported to work  without knowing when, or if, they would receive their next paycheck,  while others were willing to work, but were told they couldn't.   Even though the Federal Government has reopened, most Federal  employees are still waiting to receive that first paycheck. Under  statute, Federal employees should have received a 2.1 percent pay  increase for 2019. Instead, the recommendation from the White House was  zero.   This bill represents a pay increase for Federal employees above that  statutory level equal to an additional 0.5 percent over and above the  statutory level that would have otherwise been provided.   While the House of Representatives passed appropriations bills that  included a 1.9 percent pay increase for Federal employees, the  continuing resolution agreed to by the House and Senate did not reverse  the President's pay freeze. This bill would.   Historically, Congress has tried to ensure parity in pay between  Federal civilian employees and military servicemembers. This bill would  continue the tradition of pay parity for which I have advocated since I  came to Congress 10 years ago.   A Federal employee pay increase of 2.6 percent is, in my view,  further justified, as the distinguished chairman of the committee  pointed out, by the hardships just suffered and those suffered over the  last 10 years: three pay freezes, hiring freezes, compensation cuts,  and benefit cuts. Federal employees are the only group on the planet  that actually has contributed nearly $200 billion to deficit reduction.   In 9 of the last 10 years, Congress has failed to enact an increase  in basic pay consistent with the statute. Not true on the military  side. That is why we are trying to have pay parity.   In 8 of the last 10 years, basic pay increases trailed increases in  the cost of living itself.   I will point out that the legislation in front of us has been  endorsed by the American Federation of Government Employees; the  National Treasury Employees Union; the American Federation of State,  County and Municipal Employees; the International Federation of  Professional and Technical Engineers; the Senior Executives  Association; the Federal Managers Association; and the Professional  Managers Association.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record letters of support from these  groups.                                              American Federation of                                   Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                                   January 29, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Federation       of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE), which represents       more than 700,000 federal and District of Columbia government       employees within 70 agencies, I write urging you to support       H.R. 790, the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness       Act of 2019, introduced by Representative Connolly (D-VA),       when it comes to the floor this week. This legislation       provides federal workers with a FY 2019 pay adjustment of 2.6       percent. This modest adjustment would allow federal employees       to make up some of the purchasing power they lost over the       last decade and restore the long tradition of parity in the       rate of adjustment for civilian and military employees of the       United States government.  [[Page H1297]]         January 25, 2019 marked the end of our nation's longest       government shutdown, and federal employees have been without       a paycheck since December 21st. As a result of the funding       lapse, many federal employees have fallen behind on their       monthly bills and are experiencing serious financial       hardship. Although some federal employees make more, among       AFGE's own membership, the average take home pay is just $500       per week after they pay their taxes, health insurance       premiums, and mandatory retirement contributions. Many       federal employees were struggling to make ends meet before       the shutdown, and H.R. 790 would not only help agencies       recruit new employees, and retain a workforce battered by the       shutdown, compensation cuts enacted in the wake of the 2008       financial crisis, it would also demonstrate that the Congress       values the federal workforce's dedication and commitment to       serving the American public.        For decades, Congress supported pay adjustment parity       between federal and military employees. The civilian       workforce not only works alongside the warfighters to keep       our nation safe, they are also public servants who have       dedicated their lives to providing the American public with       invaluable benefits services. Federal employees work across       the country securing our borders, keeping travelers safe,       providing benefits to the elderly and disabled, caring for       our veterans, and keeping our air and water safe and clean.       Unfortunately, in recent years pay adjustment parity has not       been upheld and federal civilian salaries have continued to       lag standards set by private employers. H.R. 790 would help       narrow this gap.        As you work to pass legislation to fund the remaining seven       appropriations bills, AFGE urges you to support H.R. 790 when       it comes to the floor this week, and we strongly urge you to       support inclusion of a 2.6 percent federal employee pay       adjustment in the final funding measure for FY 2019.            Sincerely,                                                 J. David Cox, Sr.,      National President.                                   ____                                               The National Treasury                                                 Employees Union,                                                   January 29, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Treasury       Employees Union, which represents over 150,000 federal       employees in 33 agencies, I urge you to support H.R. 790, the       Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019,       which would provide federal workers a 2.6 percent pay       increase for 2019 and ensure pay parity with the military,       with whom they frequently work in service to the nation.        At the end of August, the President sent a letter to       Congress reiterating the call in his Fiscal Year (FY) 2019       Budget Request for a pay freeze for federal workers. If not       for the President's decision to implement a pay freeze, the       Federal Employee Pay Comparability Act (5 USC 5303) indicates       that federal employees should receive a 2.1 percent pay raise       in January 2019, prior to any amount being provided for       locality pay rate increases. This formula is designed to       ensure that the gap between federal government and private       sector wages does not further deteriorate. According to the       most recent Federal Pay Agent Report, the current pay       disparity is over 30 percent.        Like all American workers and middle-class taxpayers,       federal employees face ever-increasing costs of living, with       rising utility, health care and food bills, along with school       loan and rent or mortgage obligations. Due to a three-year       pay freeze and five subsequent years of below-market pay       raises that were lower than the amounts called for under       current law, federal employees have seen their wages fall       further behind the private sector, which has adversely       impacted them and their families.        Moreover, if the federal government is to have the ability       to compete with the private sector in recruiting and       retaining a skilled workforce, it is essential that the       federal government provide its workers a pay increase. The       federal government relies on qualified and professional civil       servants that live and work in every state and congressional       district across the country to carry out our nation's laws       and programs, providing critical services for our nation and       the American people.        Now, after suffering through a 35-day shutdown that caused       unimaginable hardship for hundreds of thousands of federal       workers, their families, and their communities, it is       important to ensure that employees are able to afford the       increased fees and penalties that they suffered as a result.       All federal employees deserve an adequate pay raise and we       urge your support for H.R. 790 in appreciation for their       service.            Sincerely,                                                Anthony M. Reardon,      National President.                                   ____            American Federation of State, County and Municipal             Employees, AFL-CIO,                                  Washington, DC, January 29, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the members of the       American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees       (AFSCME), including thousands of federal government       employees, I write to strongly support the ``Federal Civilian       Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019,'' H.R. 790, which       would increase federal employee salaries for calendar year       2019 by 2.6 percent. AFSCME urges you to vote for this bill       to demonstrate your support for America's dedicated and       hardworking federal workers.        A salary increase is necessary because expert analysis       demonstrates that when contrasted position by position,       federal workers' wages lag below employees in the nonfederal       sector--both in the private sector and in state and local       governments. In fact, federal employees are significantly       underpaid in numerous occupations. Furthermore, since 2010,       as a direct result of congressional legislation that reduced       pay and benefits, federal employees have had their       compensation cut by more than $180 billion (over 10 years).       Congress should take action to reverse these cuts and close       this pay gap.        To recruit, hire, and retain a qualified capable federal       government workforce, America must pay competitive salaries.       This is vital to continue attracting the best and brightest       to our public service. Unfortunately, during the last two       years, the federal government's hiring freeze and shutdowns       have lowered morale, forced many federal employees to cover       others employees' job responsibilities, and reduced the       federal government's effectiveness. H.R. 790 would help       address these challenges and move us forward.        AFSCME endorses this important legislation and urges you to       vote for the ``Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness       Act of 2019,'' H.R. 790.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____           International Federation of Professional & Technical             Engineers,                                                  January 29, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 90,000 represented       members of the International Federation of Professional and       Technical Engineers (IFPTE), we are writing regarding the       Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019       ((HR 790), legislation sponsored by Virginia Congressman       Gerry Connolly that is scheduled for full House consideration       this week. After the longest government shutdown in the       history of the United States, which impacted some 800,000       federal workers and their families, IFPTE is urging you to       support pay parity between military and civilian workers by       voting in support of this bill.        After three consecutive years of pay freezes, followed by       meager across-the-board adjustments, federal workers have       seen their incomes decrease by nearly 15% with respect to       inflation over the last eight years. Therefore, IFPTE feels       it is both fiscally responsible and reflective of the income       sacrificed by federal employees to adopt the long-standing       practice of pay parity between civilian workers and the       military by supporting HR 790 calling for a 2.6% federal pay       increase.        As Congress works to negotiate an acceptable solution to       pass the remaining FY19 appropriations bills, IFPTE urges       that whatever action is taken--whether it be a Continuing       Resolution (CR) or a full FY19 Minibus that includes all or       some of the seven outstanding spending measures, we believe       that quickly approving a 2.6% civilian pay raise is more than       reasonable. This number is reflective of pay parity with the       military pay raise approved last year as a part of the       National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and is reflective       of the many years of sacrifices made by federal workers,       including enduring a senseless 35-day government shutdown.        IFPTE does recognize the acute difficulties facing Congress       in these contentious times, but we simply ask that the men       and women who work hard every day in the trenches to deliver       excellence for the taxpayer not be harmed any more than they       already have by the political turmoil in Washington.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,      Paul Shearon,        President.      Matthew Biggs,        Secretary-Treasurer/Legislative Director.                                   ____                                    Senior Executives Association,                                                   January 29, 2019.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Gerald Connolly,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Hoyer and Representative Connolly: On       behalf of the Senior Executives Association (SEA)--which       represents the interests of career federal executives in the       Senior Executive Service (SES), and those in Senior Level       (SL), Scientific and Professional (ST), equivalent executive       positions, and other senior career leaders--I write to convey       our support for H.R. 790, the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay       Raise Fairness Act of 2019.        For the past decade the federal workforce has been treated       as the nation's piggy bank, with nearly $200 billion in pay       and benefits being taken for debt reduction and other       purposes. Providing all civilian federal employees with a       2.6% raise in 2019, especially following the shutdown, is an       important step to ensure the government can attract and       retain the talent it needs to serve the American public in a       competitive labor market. Moreover, reestablishing pay parity       with the uniformed services is applauded and welcomed.        This legislation sends a signal that Congress is serious       about ensuring the federal  [[Page H1298]]       government is an employer of choice. For too long race-to-      the-bottom policies related to the federal workforce have       become the norm. It is our hope that the silver lining of the       shutdown is that the American people now better understand       what government does for them every day, how dedicated the       professionals who work for them in the government are, and       that Congress and the administration will find ways to work       together to ensure our federal government has the personnel,       tools, and resources necessary to fulfil the duties assigned       to it.        SEA is deeply concerned that neglect of federal workforce       capabilities in recent years have resulted in an increased       risk of government failure, as outlined in a paper we       released last week. Strengthening the Senior Executive       Service (SES) and civil service and advocating for       cultivation of the public service leadership profession are       among our top organizational priorities in the 116th       Congress. I hope that passage of this legislation is just the       beginning of concerted efforts to modernize and strengthen       our civil service, to bring data-driven approaches to       management and compensation, and much more.        Thank you for your steadfast support of our federal       workforce and your leadership on this issue.            Sincerely,                                                    Bill Valdez,                                                          President,      Senior Executives Association.                                   ____                                     Federal Managers Association,                                   Alexandria, VA, January 29, 2019.      Hon. Gerry Connolly,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Connolly: On behalf of the managers and       supervisors currently serving our nation in the federal       government and whose interests are represented by the Federal       Managers Association (FMA), we extend our strongest support       for your bill, the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise       Fairness Act of 2019 (H.R. 790). This legislation provides a       much-deserved 2.6 percent pay raise for 2019, and addresses       the inequity federal employees faced in recent years due to       pay freezes and minimal raises.        The federal workforce ensures the safety of our borders,       protects the nation's food supply, cares for our elderly and       veterans, and serves alongside our military forces. But the       minimal increases in pay received do not reflect the duties       of these dedicated workers. It is time for the federal       workforce to be recognized for their dedication to serving       our country at home and abroad, and your legislation does       that.        In addition to providing fair wages to federal employees,       FMA believes H.R. 790 will help to combat the problem of       morale, recruitment, and retention in the federal government,       particularly in the aftermath of the partial government       shutdown. As the federal government continues to struggle       with these issues, your bill is a step towards offering       competitive salaries, attracting and keeping the brightest       and best to the federal workforce. By calling for wages that       fairly compensate the abilities and responsibilities of the       federal workforce, you recognize the need to ensure a fully       engaged federal workforce that remains dedicated to serving       the nation.        Thank you for your continued support of our federal       workforce.            Sincerely,                                                     Renee Johnson,      National President.                                   ____                                Professional Managers Association,                                   Washington, DC, January 29, 2019.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Gerald Connolly,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Hoyer and Representative Connolly: On       behalf of the Professional Managers Association--the non-      profit professional association that has, since 1981,       represented professional managers, management officials, and       non-bargaining unit employees at the Internal Revenue Service       (IRS)--I write to endorse H.R. 790 the Federal Civilian       Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019.        Pay parity between federal civilian employees and members       of the military has long been the norm, until recent years in       which the federal workforce has been faced with constant       attacks that have taken billions in earned pay and benefits       out of the pockets of hardworking middle class Americans. The       result of abandoning pay parity has been an ever-growing       imbalance between the compensation of federal workers and the       broader labor market.        In a highly competitive economy in which the types of       skills and abilities the government needs are in high demand       across the board, this legislation providing a 2.6% pay       increase across the board to federal civilian employees can       help begin to close the gap. Especially on the heels of the       embarrassing 35-day government shutdown, it is important for       Congress to ensure the government is a competitive employer       with good pay and benefits offerings.        Thank you for your leadership on this issue, and for your       steadfast support of our federal workforce.            Sincerely,                                               Thomas R. Burger,                                                 Executive Director,                                 Professional Managers Association.     The bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is that our Federal  civil servants are like any other workforce. More than 900,000 of those  Federal employees earn less than $60,000 a year. They are not rich.  They are not living high on the hog. They deserve and need this  adjustment, especially after the longest, most reckless shutdown of the  government in American history.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend from Maryland for  his leadership on this amendment, which I support.   The Secret Service do put themselves on the line, and the studies my  friend from North Carolina cited had to do with bad management and bad  working conditions that really affect morale and productivity at the  Secret Service. The gentleman's amendment is designed to try to help  that situation.   The idea that an across-the-board cost of living increase doesn't  distinguish between productivity and nonproductivity, performance or  nonperformance, would also apply to the military.   My friend has no objection to an across-the-board increase for the  military, but apparently on the civilian side, that is different. We  are making the opposite argument. We are making the argument that pay  parity is the right thing to do, especially after this reckless  shutdown.   Mr. Chairman, I congratulate my friend from Maryland on his  amendment, and I support it.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Massachusetts, and  I congratulate her on this amendment.   I can't believe that the distinguished ranking member of our  committee would continue to engage in conspiracy theories that have  been, in fact, disproved and, worse, would actually paint the entire  41,000 or more workforce of the IRS with one brush. They are all,  apparently, out to get us.   You would never know these are hardworking public servants who serve  their country nobly and often under very difficult circumstances,  because they are hardly the most popular agency in town.   Of course they deserve a pay raise. They were affected by the  shutdown. Many of them were called back by the Trump administration to  come back without pay because certain industries needed paper being  processed. They did it because they are noble public servants and they  are patriots, as the distinguished chairman of our committee indicated.   So instead of slandering public servants, we want to honor them.   You are right. We are proud of this amendment, and it is anything but  the most ridiculous to come to the floor. It is a very important  amendment. I support it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Clay of  Missouri, and a distinguished member of our committee, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I hope the American people are listening to what is  being said here on the floor, because they are actually getting an  honest flavor of where some of my friends on the other side of the  aisle actually are.   Everybody, Mr. Jordan says, agrees we need a wall, a barrier on the  border. Actually, not everybody does. Actually, most polls show most  Americans don't support that, and that number is increasing: the  opposition.   Federal workers make more than their private sector counterparts,  despite the fact that the official study shows they are 31 percent  behind their private sector counterparts, and there are differences  because of the differences in the nature of the work.   What you are also hearing, besides Darwinian ``survival of the  fittest'' rhetoric and Marie Antoinette, ``let them eat cake'' kind of  rhetoric coming out of this administration and some Members of this  body, which I think reflects poorly on an understanding about where the  average American, including the average Federal employee, actually is  and what their needs really are--and they don't demand much--but  respect is something they do demand, and it is something we offer them.  That is why this resolution in front of us is so important.   Is it that hard to come together? Yeah, it is nonbinding, but it is  aspirational. And even that, apparently, some of my friends on the  other side of the aisle find difficult to swallow: a commitment not to  shut down government for any reason.   Mr. Speaker, let's not hold Federal employees, and the American  public they serve, hostage ever again. We will deal with our policy  disputes separately, but we won't engage in shutting down the Federal  Government. It is disastrous, it is reckless, it is dysfunctional, and  it is a disservice to the people who sent us here. It is that simple.  Never again shut down government.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the slander  we have just heard.    Mr. Speaker, I have rarely heard such cynicism on the  floor of the House of Representatives. Oh, no. My friends on the other  side are right to kind of cabal because there is so much cynicism; but  this one takes the cake.   We are here to honor the Federal workforce, not slander them with  insinuation.   To listen to the gentlewoman from Indiana, one might infer that the  Federal Government is riddled with people who are guilty of all kinds  of nasty, near crimes and offenses, and should not be rewarded for it.   I wonder if we would use the same standard ourselves here in the  House of Representatives. How many in the last Congress, especially on  a particular side of the aisle, have resigned over sexual harassment  charges? And that wasn't insinuation, that was real. So let's not have  a double standard.   And by the way, I say to my friends, especially on this side of the  aisle, let us not be distracted by what is really going on.   We are simply trying, after the worst shutdown in American history,  to say to our own employees, 2.1 million: ``You are valued. You are  respected.''   To actually vote for this is not only to say the opposite and deny  them a simple cost of living increase that we have already given the  military; it is, in fact, to say: By the way, we buy into this  cynicism. We think you are riddled with guilt by association and  insinuation.   So we have an opportunity, in defeating this MTR, one of the most  cynical I have ever heard, to actually make a positive statement to our  Federal employees.   Stand up and be heard. Say ``no'' to shutdowns. Say ``yes'' to our  Federal employees, and restore their sense of respect with our dignity.   Defeat this MTR.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
