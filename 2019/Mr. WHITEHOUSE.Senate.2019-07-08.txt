 Mr. President, we have just heard two colleagues make  convincing and compassionate arguments for putting a price on carbon,  the central protection from climate crisis.   A price on carbon like we propose would dramatically lower emissions  and put us on a net-zero-by-2050 path, the path necessary to avoid the  worst climate chaos. Because it is a price on pollution, we can dial it  up or dial it down as climate chaos worsens or abates. Because our  proposal is border-adjustable, it would let American industry compete  even in countries without a price on carbon. Because our plan is  revenue neutral, all the funds go back to the American people in the  form of payroll tax credits, Social Security or VA benefits, or grants  to States to navigate this transition.   If our plan is so good, you might think it would already be on its  way to becoming law. You might think there would be Senate hearings on  it or bipartisan negotiations. Well, none of the above. To understand  why that is taking place, you have to look at who is supporting carbon  pricing and who is opposed.   Let's start with the good news. Who is supporting it? Earlier this  year, 27 winners of the Nobel Prize in economics--27 Nobel prize- winning economists--15 former Chairs of the President's Council of  Economic Advisers, more than half of them marked here in red are  Republicans; 4 former Chairs of the Federal Reserve, half of them  Republicans; and 2 Treasury Secretaries, including a Republican, in the  Wall Street Journal, no less, endorsed a border-adjustable price on  carbon with revenues returned to the American people--in other words, a  carbon price very like our bill.    Even the patron saint of conservative economists, Milton Friedman,  himself a Nobel Prize winner, made the case that it is proper under  conservative economics for government to put a price on pollution.         [T]he best way to do it is to impose a tax on the cost of       the pollutants . . . and make an incentive for . . .       manufacturers and for consumers to keep down the amount of       pollution.    Four former Republican Administrators of the Environmental Protection  Agency--for President Nixon, President Reagan, and both President  Bushes--advocated for a price on carbon in the New York Times.   There is burgeoning support in the business community. In May, dozens  of companies, with a combined market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, came  to Congress to advocate for a price on carbon. CEOs of 13 major  corporations recently announced the formation of the CEO Climate  Dialogue to do the same. All these CEOs and corporations may be  responding to an explosion of warnings coming from economic regulators  here and abroad, national banks here and abroad, government agencies  here and abroad, and risk analysts, who do this kind of thing  professionally, that we are headed for economic perils if climate  change is not addressed with an effective, predictable remedy, like a  price on carbon emissions.   Last month, even Pope Francis convened a 2-day summit at the Vatican  on climate change, where he urged governments, businesses, and oil  companies to get serious about climate change and to follow carbon  pricing as the smart path forward, calling it ``essential.''   By the way, to do a little moral wander here, Pope Francis is not  alone among religious leaders in seeing a moral imperative to solving  this problem.   The head of the Church of England said that ``[r]educing the cost of  climate change is essential to the life of faith. It is a way to love  our neighbour and to steward the gift of creation.'' Two hundred  thirty-two evangelical pastors from 44 States declared that ``[l]ove of  God, love of neighbor, and the demands of stewardship are more than  enough reason for evangelical Christians to respond to the climate  change problem with moral passion and concrete action.''   Forty-three rabbis from around the world stated that ``Jewish  teachings mandate that we do everything possible to help avert a  climate catastrophe and other environmental disasters and to help shift  our imperiled planet onto a sustainable path.''   Likewise, leaders and scholars of the Islamic, Hindu, and Buddhist  faiths have urged climate action, including pricing carbon.   With all this support, particularly from so many Republicans, you  would think that carbon pricing would be a no-brainer and that we would  be already at work here in Congress doing something. Unfortunately, if  you thought that, you would be wrong.   The bad news is who is opposed to carbon pricing and what dirty tools  they bring to that job. Here is one example: Last month, hints of  interest in carbon pricing appeared from a few House Republicans, and  suddenly an ``open letter'' appeared opposing carbon pricing. The  letter was signed by all these entities with happy-sounding names like  Americans for Tax Reform, Americans for Prosperity, Citizens Against  Government Waste. Such nice names.   You might think this letter represents grassroots popular opposition  to carbon pricing. You would be wrong. These groups have a common  identifier: They keep their funding sources secret. But skilled  investigative journalists and researchers who spent countless hours  digging through corporate tax filings and other documents have  unearthed the funders. And guess what. The vast majority of these  groups are funded with fossil fuel money. They are front groups. They  are not real.   We actually added it up. The groups behind this letter received  collectively over half a billion dollars from groups linked to the  fossil fuel billionaire Koch brothers, ExxonMobil, the American  Petroleum Institute, and other fossil fuel interests. It is a complete  front. Half a billion dollars is a lot. Remember, that is just what the  researchers could find. Because these front groups hide their funding  so well, the true number is probably several times that, probably  billions of dollars.   It sounds disgusting, doesn't it--an industry hiding behind front  groups to spend billions of dollars to gum up a remedy to our climate  crisis? But why wouldn't the fossil fuel industry spend a few billion  dollars to block climate action here in Congress? The annual U.S.  subsidy for fossil fuel was most recently estimated by the  International Monetary Fund at $650 billion. Against that fat annual  subsidy, spending a few billion is just a rounding error.   Look at one example from this flotilla of phony front-group  signatories: Americans for Tax Reform, with its president Grover  Norquist, which claims to represent the regular taxpayer. Hogwash.  Americans for Tax Reform has received over $5 million from Koch-linked  groups--Koch Industries, the big fossil fuel company--and over $800,000  from the American Petroleum Institute. They are hired guns, and they  are wearing masks so you don't know who is paying them. That group is  just one tentacle of the fossil fuel climate denial apparatus. They  have even taken over the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National  Association of Manufacturers and turned those business groups into  fossil fuel zombies on climate change.   It is time to say enough.   I ask my colleagues to please take a sincere look at climate change  and carbon pricing and look at who is saying what. On one side, you  have the moral authority of the great religions. You have bipartisan  agreement of the world's best economists. You have lots of  Republicans--at least ones who don't have to face elections. You have  lots of tough, smart business leaders. My God, you even have your home  State universities that teach this stuff. On the other side, you have a  bunch of hired guns, hiding behind phony front-group masks, funded with  fossil fuel money that they try to hide. Who are you going to trust?  Pope Francis or the oily, secretive Koch brothers? Milton Friedman or  fossil-fuel hit man Grover Norquist? The International Monetary Fund or  ExxonMobil, the company that has been caught out lying for decades  about climate change over and over again? Front groups who hide their  donors--isn't that a clue? Can we as a body, as the Senate, really not  discern where the conflict of interest lies, where the record of lying  lies?   The climate crisis is real, and it is accelerating. Bad as it is  already, we are just in the opening credits. It is getting worse. The  pages sitting here  [[Page S4692]]  on the Senate floor know this. The rest of their lives will be spent  coping with the consequences of our failure, the failure of the  grownups--the sickening failure of the grownups.   We have to get going here. We are trying to do it your way. Pretty  much every Republican who has thought this climate problem through to a  solution comes to the same place: a revenue-neutral, border-adjustable  price on carbon. That is what we offered. We can't come much further  than that. We are reaching out. We are trying to do it your way. But  the answer back can't be dictated by a fossil fuel industry that has  spent billions to deny and obscure the facts, an industry that to this  day fights from behind a facade of lies.   I tell my Republican colleagues, they have lied to you and lied to  you, and you should cut them loose. We are all just back from the  Fourth of July. How about an independence day for the Republican Party  from the rotten rain of the fossil fuel industry? Just cut them loose.   Let's do the job we have been entrusted with as Senators. Let's look  at the facts. Let's look at the reality. Let's look at what our home  State universities teach and what real businesses in America are  telling us. Let's do our job.   On our part, we have reached over as far as we know how. We know  nothing more that we can offer than the terms that Republicans have  proposed when they work this problem through to a solution. We said  yes. Is there really not one of you who will reach back and start to  solve this problem?   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
