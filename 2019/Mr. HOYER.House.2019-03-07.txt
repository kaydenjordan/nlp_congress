 Mr. Speaker, let me suggest at the outset that no party be  too self-righteous on the issue of supporting prejudice and bigotry too  often. This is a very serious matter. It is important to call out anti- Semitism in a way that is unmistakable and unambiguous.   We must do so because whenever some people begin to question the  allegiance or patriotism of Americans, indeed, whether certain people  fully belong as part of our country, it is critical to set the record  straight.   Recent statements employing timeworn tropes of dual loyalty have  deeply and correctly unsettled American Jewish communities because  their allegation is, simply put, that American Jews who support Israel  are not loyal to this country.   I stand as a very strong supporter of Israel and a very loyal  American. Such allegations fall into--as has been said--a century-old  and dark history of Jews being marginalized and set apart. They recall  past evils that occurred in other countries and in our own when,  according to the Anti-Defamation League, people accuse Jews of ``being  disloyal neighbors or citizens'' because of their connection to Israel  or Jewish communities elsewhere in the world.   That was false, and it was bigoted.   To be clear, the First Amendment protects the right of every American  to criticize policies and leaders, whether our own country or others.   That is the glory of our democracy.                                time  1630    However, in these past few weeks, those who say they are only  criticizing Israel's leaders or policies have, instead, been making  claims about the allegiance and motivation of Israel's defenders.   I do not believe there is anyone in our Caucus, not one, who wishes  to silence debate over policy. Rather, what is being called for is an  end to the invocation of age-old, anti-Semitic tropes that demonize  people instead of criticize policies.   Accusations that Jews bear dual allegiance because of support for  Israel or concern for its safety are false and they are also hurtful  canards that must be opposed and exposed for what they are: bigotry.  They elicit legitimate fear and uncertainty in the individuals and  communities they target.   In much the same way, we have also seen vile examples of hatred aimed  at painting Muslim Americans as somehow disloyal to our Nation, or not  fully belonging, causing similar feelings of insecurity and distress.   No Muslims could come to our country. Those feelings cannot be  discounted either. One of our own colleagues was the target of an  Islamophobic attack, impugning a Member of this House. That ought to be  unacceptable to all of us.   We have seen this same form of exclusion, hatred in recent years  whenever acts of bigotry have been directed towards African Americans,  and when Latino and Latina citizens have been yelled at to ``go back''  to their country. This is their country.   This phenomenon is also a reminder of the horrific internment of  Japanese Americans during the Second World War. None of us ought to be  like Pontius Pilate and think that we have not fallen short of the  principles enunciated in our Declaration.   In our multicultural Republic, sometimes it is incumbent upon the  American people to speak as one Nation, indivisible, and make a clear  affirmation that all Americans have an equal share  [[Page H2551]]  in our Republic, that no one's race, or creed, or origin can call into  question one's love of country.   I will continue to urge unity in the face of anti-Semitism,  Islamophobia, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, racism against  African American, Latino, Asian Americans, and other forms of prejudice  and discrimination.   American Jews, including those who serve our Nation in Congress, need  to be reassured that they are equal partners in the diverse coalition  for justice, opportunity, tolerance, and equality, and that they have  true allies who stand with them as firmly as they have stood with  others.   I will continue to make that clear. America is rightfully respected  for its Declaration of Independence and its Constitution, as amended  and perfected, both of which proclaim the dignity and rights of  individuals endowed by our Creator.   But America has also seen, too often, the denial of that dignity and  equality to millions of its citizens based upon the color of their  skin, the land of their birth, or the faith of their forebearers.   My colleagues, if we are to be better than our past, we must reject  all forms of bigotry and prejudice directed at any of our fellow human  beings and fellow Americans. Let us all, in solidarity and in union  with the principles of our country, support this resolution.
