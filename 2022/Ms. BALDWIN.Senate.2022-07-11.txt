 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the Honor the Earth Homecoming Celebration and Powwow.  The story of Honor the Earth begins with a small group of Lac Courte  Oreilles who wanted a better future for their tribe and their people.  [[Page S3199]]    The Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe--Ojibwe: Odaawaa-zaaga'iganiing--is one  of six federally recognized bands of the large Ojibwe Nation that  originally occupied the upper eastern woodlands area of the North  American continent. The Treaty of 1854 established the LCO reservation.   In 1971, the LCO community, and other people from neighboring bands  and Tribes took over Winter Dam in protest of flooding lands, broken  treaties, and desecration of LCO land, people, and traditional  livelihood. Eddie Benton-Benaim, supported by the American Indian  Movement, helped lead the 5-day effort to take over the dam. This  effort led to the renegotiation of the dam license which helped the  tribe recover several hundred acres of land, compensation for damages,  and the development of Tribal hydro generating project.   The following year, 1972, there was a reunion of the people who had  occupied the dam; they called it Honor the Earth powwow. Every year  since, the Ojibwa people come together as they have always done; they  celebrate with prayers, feasting, songs, dances, and honoring. The 1972  and 1973 powwows were organized as contest powwows and were sponsored  by a handful of individuals and then by LCO AIM, LCO Tribal Governing  Board, and the St. Paul Red School House, of which Benton was director.  In 1974, grounds were broken for what would eventually become one of  the largest traditional gatherings of Tribal peoples in the region.   In 1982 the first annual Miss Honor the Earth's ladies competition  began at the powwow to showcase the strong and beautiful  Anishinaabekwewag--Ojibwe ladies--perform a woodland dance while  wearing historical deer dresses.   This year, 2022, we celebrate the 50th Honor the Earth Powwow and the  40th Miss Honor the Earth ladies competition. In so doing, the  Anishinabeg, the Lac Courte Oreilles or ``Ottawa Lake'' Tribe continues  to sustain heritage, preserve and utilize the strong Ojibwe language,  honor strengths of the past, and embrace a good future. Please join me  in celebrating this historically and spiritually important community.                            ____________________
