 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my  amendment to ask the FDA to move forward with rulemaking on  cannabidiol. Despite the 2018 farm bill being signed into law  legalizing cannabidiol, hemp farmers, including those in my home State  of Oregon, have faced economic burdens from the regulatory uncertainty  by lack of action.   We have legalized the sale of hemp derivatives like CBD, but the  marketplace adoption has not taken off like Congress and hemp farmers  alike expected. Lack of clarity in legal purchasing of CBD is a big  part of the problem.  [[Page H4073]]    The FDA has the authority to conduct the necessary rulemaking to  establish a regulatory pathway for CBD as a dietary supplement and food  ingredient.   This amendment, with my colleague Representative Griffith, calls on  the FDA to proceed in doing so, as the livelihoods of hemp farmers and  safety of consumers across the country reside in the hands of the  agency. There is no reason for the FDA not to be moving forward since  the 2018 farm bill.   To that end, I have also introduced with Representative Griffith H.R.  841 on a bipartisan basis. My bill will require the FDA to do what they  have the authority to do and should have done already to craft the  necessary rules and guidance to regulate CBD as a dietary supplement.   No regulatory system is perfect, but congressional intent has been  clear on hemp and CBD. The livelihoods of the farmers and agriculture  jobs hang in the balance. It is long past time the FDA and Congress  move forward with making CBD legal and safe for consumers.                                time  1830
