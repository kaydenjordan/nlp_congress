 Mr. Speaker, last week, Senate Democrats blocked a vote  in the Senate on two pro-life bills: the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide medical care to  a child who survives an abortion, and the Pain-Capable Unborn Child  Protection Act, which would ban abortions beginning at 20 weeks. Senate  Democrats prevented a vote on both of these commonsense bills as House  Democrats have already done 80 times.   I call on the Democrats on both sides of the Capitol, as Senate  Majority Leader McConnell said last week, to take a ``clear and moral  stand'' to protect innocent life.                        Severe Weather Awareness Week     Mr. Speaker, this week is Severe Weather Awareness  Week, and it is a good reminder to always be prepared for extreme  weather events, which we too often face in Kansas.   Ready.gov--that is, r-e-a-d-y.gov--which is run by FEMA, is a great  place to find resources related to flooding, thunderstorms, winter  weather, or advice on building an emergency kit.   Similarly, FEMA offers a free smartphone app which provides real-time  alerts, shelter locations, and other resources to help during and after  a severe weather event.   But it is not enough to just communicate severe weather events to the  public. We need to continue to invest in tools and encourage innovation  when it comes to weather modeling and forecasting so that we can ensure  as much lead time as possible before a severe weather event occurs.   From coastal regions to the heartland, severe weather impacts us all,  and the Federal Government not only needs to be working with public and  private partners to improve systems, but also to encourage and  incentivize innovation in the field.   Recently, the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee has  taken a look at the various forecasting and modeling efforts across the  country and discussed how we can better improve these systems to give  people increased warning in the event of severe weather events.   Furthermore, I met with those on the front line in forecasting, such  as our hardworking meteorologists back home at our National Weather  Service, along with research institutions across the country,  discussing the advances they are making thanks to new tools and  technologies.   It is important to stay safe, informed, and prepared as we head into  the severe weather season, and I hope all Americans will take advantage  of the tools available to achieve these goals.           Steps United States is Taking to Respond to Coronavirus     Mr. Speaker, the spread of the coronavirus and its  dominance in the news has been at the top of my mind as well as for  many Kansans.   While there is no reason to panic, it is prudent for all of us to be  mindful of the ongoing challenging situation. As a physician and  Congressman, I feel it is important that I convey the steps the Federal  Government is currently taking to best respond.   First, we must demand more transparency from the Chinese and Iranian  Governments. American experts must be allowed to get access to  information on the ground in both China and Iran, particularly in  Wuhan--ground zero of the outbreak. Unfortunately, these countries have  a long history of misinformation and coverups, and we need to know the  full truth to best protect Americans.   Some in the American medical industry are concerned about a shortage  of supplies which are largely manufactured in China. Currently, the FDA  is not aware of any national shortages of medical products. Federal  agencies have been proactively reaching out to hundreds of  manufacturers to assess potential shortages and to let manufacturers  know they can provide assistance. That being said, this is an excellent  time to review our supply chain for both American healthcare as well as  all other industries.    I personally believe President Trump and Vice President Pence are  doing everything in their power to protect Americans. Consulting with  the top medical experts, this administration is moving to swiftly  mitigate outbreaks of coronavirus here at home.   Attempts by the national media and Democrats in Congress to place  blame on the President for these outbreaks are inexcusable--they are  unprofessional; they are unnecessary; and they are actually very  harmful.   Anything President Trump can possibly do to expedite the development  of testing, antivirals, and vaccines is already being done--and, I  might add, is being accomplished in record time.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of  Health and Human Services have been preparing for outbreaks like this  for years. We are the most prepared and the best equipped nation in the  world to take on this coronavirus.   On the eve of a potentially global epidemic, this situation  underscores how imperative it is for our country to be able to prevent  unidentified individuals from entering this country. Border security is  national security, and families in Kansas deserve a home safe from  unvetted individuals who may knowingly or unknowingly be carrying  contagious diseases.   I visited with the CDC over 5 weeks ago, asking what preventative  measures they were taking when this virus was in the early stages of  outbreak. I have been staying in close, constant contact with the White  House, the CDC, and all agencies responsible for controlling the spread  of this disease. The safety of Kansans is my top priority, and I will  continue monitoring developments closely and communicate with officials  across our State.   In the meantime, as a physician, I recommend some commonsense  practices: regular handwashing, applying hand sanitizer, proper  nutrition, and minimal travel outside your community. This is a time to  prepare and plan, a time to make sure you have a plan for your  children, for your elderly parents, perhaps, that you have a plan for  your place of work and for your place of worship, wherever you might  gather in your own community.   The event also underscores what an absolute disaster a government  takeover of the medical system would be. America's healthcare  capabilities are second to none because of competition and free market  innovation. Radical socialist policies would effectively eliminate  private investment in new medicines and technologies. That would be  unacceptable.                            ____________________
