 Mr. President, I submit to the Senate a budget  scorekeeping report. The report, which covers fiscal year 2024, was  prepared by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 308(b)  of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. This information enables the  Senate Budget Committee to determine if budgetary points of order lie  against pending legislation.   CBO's report shows the effect on spending and revenues of  congressional action through December 10, 2023, as compared to the  levels that I filed on June 21 as authorized by section 121 of the  Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, or FRA. Since then, Congress has  passed six pieces of legislation with small effects on direct spending.  These include two continuing resolutions that were eligible for  adjustments to enforceable levels as permitted under the FRA.   Tables 1 and 2 show that current budgetary levels are above allowable  amounts for budget authority and within allowable amounts for outlays.  The government is currently operating under a bipartisan short-term  continuing resolution that extends the previous year's discretionary  funding levels through early 2024. The budget authority level shown in  the tables is artificially high because it reflects CBO's estimate of  the continuing resolution, which for technical reasons is higher than  the statutory limits. Enactment of full-year appropriations for fiscal  year 2024 consistent with budget agreement surrounding the FRA would  bring total budget authority in line with the allowable limits. These  tables also reflect that there has been no change to Social Security.   Table 3 shows the Senate's pay-as-you-go-scorecard, which reflects  $44 million of net deficit reduction over 10 years.   The Democratic staff of the Budget Committee prepared an addendum  table to supplement CBO's report, which compares the mandatory spending  of each authorizing committee against the enforceable allocations under  section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act. It shows that 15 of the 16  authorizing committees are complying with their allocations, either  because no legislation with significant budgetary costs was enacted,  the legislation was deficit-neutral and qualified for an allocation  adjustment that was subsequently filed, or the legislation reduced  spending.   I ask unanimous consent that CBO's letter, accompanying tables, and  the addendum be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                  Washington, DC, December 13, 2023.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2024 budget and is       current through December 10, 2023. This report is submitted       under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the       Congressional Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on       November 29, 2023, pursuant to section 121 of the Fiscal       Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA, Public Law 118-5).        Since the enactment of the FRA, the Congress has cleared       the following legislation that has significant effects on       budget authority, outlays, or revenues in fiscal year 2024:        Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024 and Other Extensions       Act (Public Law 118-15);        Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act,       2024 (Public Law 118-22); and        A joint resolution providing for Congressional disapproval       under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule       submitted by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection       relating to ``Small Business Lending Under the Equal Credit       Opportunity Act (Regulation B)'' (S.J. Res 32).        This is the first current level letter for fiscal year       2024.            Sincerely,                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                                                          Director.        Enclosure.

As a   result, amounts in this current-level report do not include those items. In keeping with the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255), certain funding for the Department of Health and   Human Services is excluded from estimates for the purposes of both the Budget Act and the Balanced Budget and   Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA P.L. 99-177), as amended.

As a   result, this report excludes $2,374 million in budget authority and $2,374 million in outlays. a Current-level amounts and allocations include budgetary effects designates as an emergency requirement in   keeping with section 251 of the Deficit Control Act. However, they exclude budgetary effects designated as an   emergency requirement pursuant to section 4001 of S. Con.
