 Madam Speaker, across my district, the Seventh  Congressional District of Pennsylvania, and across our country, this  shutdown is hurting small businesses.   One of my constituents is an entrepreneur from Stroudsburg,  Pennsylvania. He recently emailed me to let me know that he can't get  his mandatory employer ID number for the new business he is trying to  start because the IRS is shut down. Until he gets that number, he can't  set up payroll for his employees or open a company bank account.   Another constituent from Emmaus, Pennsylvania, processes Small  Business Administration-backed loans to entrepreneurs trying to start  or expand businesses. But, as he explains, since the SBA has been shut  down, no small business loans have been going out. For many, that means  no access to capital at reasonable interest rates and having to turn to  loan sharks to keep businesses afloat.   And let us never forget that our Coast Guard is still working without  pay.   We were sent here to make people's lives better, not make them harder  and more stressful than they already are. Members of both parties need  to come together to support our military and the small businesses that  power our economy, and that means ending this shutdown.                            ____________________
