 Madam President, today we are learning about new  attacks in Europe. I would like to start by offering the Senate's  condolences to the victims and their families in London. As our allies  in the United Kingdom develop a better understanding of the nature of  that attack, let me again reiterate that our commitment to our friends  in Europe remains very strong. We will continue to stand by you.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, what has happened  in the years since ObamaCare was imposed on our country? Year after  year, it drove up costs. Year after year, it drove down choice. Year  after year, it continues to literally unravel right before our eyes. It  is a trend that continues today, one that will only get worse unless we  act.   Just last week we got more evidence of ObamaCare's failures as the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released reports that  identified a trend of Americans who had enrolled in the ObamaCare  exchanges but then canceled their coverage. Often these Americans  didn't even pay their first premium. Within just a couple of months of  enrolling, nearly 2 million people literally dropped out of ObamaCare.   Why did so many Americans drop their coverage? The reasons shouldn't  surprise anyone. The most common explanation these Americans gave for  having canceled their coverage was ObamaCare's outrageous costs. These  numbers underline what Republicans have been saying all along.  ObamaCare is collapsing around us, and the American people are  desperately searching for relief. Costs continue to shoot upward, and  insurance providers are fleeing from the marketplaces across the  country, leaving precious few options.   It is clear that ObamaCare just isn't working. In fact, it is not  working for millions of Americans, like those living in nearly 1,400  counties--about 50 percent of all counties nationwide--who would have  zero or just one insurance option on the exchanges next year. Of  course, one option isn't really an option at all.   These shrinking choices and increased costs under ObamaCare are not  an indication of a new pattern; they are just the latest in what has  been a years-long assault on far too many families by this failed  healthcare law. While this isn't a new trend, it is one that has grown  increasingly more unsustainable and one that we must work to change  very soon. That is why we have repeatedly called for a different  approach to healthcare. That is why we are working hard to move in a  different direction on healthcare today.   For months now, the entire Senate Republican conference has been  active and engaged on legislation to move beyond the failures of  ObamaCare and bring relief to the American people. We  [[Page S3568]]  have had numerous productive discussions on the way forward. We believe  we can and must do better than ObamaCare's status quo.   Working together and listening to our constituents, we are focused on  the following: stabilizing insurance markets which are collapsing under  ObamaCare; freeing Americans from ObamaCare's mandates, which force  them to buy insurance they don't want; improving the affordability of  health insurance, which is spiking under ObamaCare; strengthening  Medicaid for those who need it most; and preserving access to care for  patients with preexisting conditions.   Senate Republicans will continue working because it is clear that we  cannot allow Americans' healthcare to continue on its current downward  trajectory, taking so many families right along with it.   The ObamaCare status quo is simply unsustainable. The American people  deserve relief, and we will keep working to provide it.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  on confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 108 occur at 11 a.m. tomorrow  morning, with the pending cloture motions ripening after disposition of  the Long nomination.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 115.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to resume  morning business as under the previous order.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, I  remember full well 7 years ago. Senator Reid was the majority leader,  and we were called into session the Monday after Thanksgiving, and we  stayed here 7 days a week until Christmas Eve. So why did we stay in  session 7 days a week, from the Monday after Thanksgiving until  Christmas Eve? Our Democratic friends didn't want anybody to go home.  They didn't want anybody to go home and have to explain what they were  in the process of writing in the majority leader's office.   I think it is pretty safe to say that this subject has been very  partisan from the beginning. Not a single Republican voted for the  bill, and our friends on the other side have made it perfectly clear  that no Democrats will be voting to replace it.   So through that process, when our colleagues on the other side had 60  votes at the time, ObamaCare was imposed on our country. Over the last  7 years, we have all witnessed and debated its many failures. Over the  last 7 years, Republicans have offered ideas on a better way forward.  Over the last 7 years, Democrats have worked to prevent Congress from  acting. Basically, it is the same dynamic that we see today: ObamaCare  continues to collapse, Republicans are working to implement better  ideas, and Democrats are trying to prevent Congress from acting. I  regret that Democrats announced their intention early on that they  didn't want to be a part of a serious bipartisan process to move past  the failures of this law. Congress still has a responsibility to act,  and the reconciliation process will allow us to do so.   Later, after that period in late 2009, our Democratic friends used  reconciliation to force ObamaCare on Americans. It is a process that  can be used in 2017, the same way they used it in 2010, to move beyond  its failures.   I would remind colleagues of what happens when legislation comes to  the floor under reconciliation. The minority leader is somehow arguing  that reconciliation is not an open process. It is an open process.  There is an unlimited number of amendments.   First, the bill text is received. Then a CBO score is issued. Members  will have time to review both. After that, there is an open amendment  process and a robust debate. It is the one type of amendment we have on  the floor of the Senate on which no one can prevent amendments.  Ultimately, at the end of the process, the Senate votes. That is how  reconciliation works.   We have been debating ObamaCare's failures and what to do about them  for so many years now. Members are very, very familiar with this issue.  We have heard so many anguished stories from constituents who have been  hurt by ObamaCare. Thankfully, at the end of the process, the Senate  will have a chance to turn the page on this failed law.   I object.    Madam President, I would just say to my friend, we can  [[Page S3576]]  have a meeting of all 100 Senators here on the Senate floor with an  unlimited amendment process. There will be no failure of opportunity  for anybody to offer an amendment, to get a vote on it, to try to  change the law. That is the way reconciliation works.    I think we will have ample opportunity to read and  amend the bill.    I think we will have ample opportunity to read and  amend the bill.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.
