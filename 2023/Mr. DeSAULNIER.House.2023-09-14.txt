 Mr. Chairman, I am strongly opposed to the so-called  Preserving Choice in Vehicles Purchases Act. Not only does this bill  hinder our efforts and investments in reducing greenhouse gas emissions  and addressing the climate crisis, but it also reverses successful work  already implemented across the country and in my home State of  California.   This bill would stop California from getting waivers that allow it to  implement stronger and more aggressive emission standards than the  Federal Government sets. This waiver was signed into law by Richard  Nixon.   Over the last 50 years, California has received over 100 Clean Air  Act waivers; over that same time span, many pollutant levels have  decreased between 75 and 99 percent, even while the State's population  doubled and vehicles have quadrupled.   Mr. Speaker, 17 States and the District of Columbia have adopted all  or part of California's stronger regulations. With California's  leadership, we have seen benefits to the environment, the economy, and  public health.   As someone who was appointed by two Republican Governors and one  Democrat, I strongly oppose this bill.
