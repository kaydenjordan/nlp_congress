 Madam President, let me thank my colleague from Maryland  for outlining one of the cases for why the override of the President's  veto is so important.   There is no question that Saudi Arabia has in no way moderated their  human rights behavior since the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi. In  fact, as Senator Van Hollen has rightly pointed out, the stick in  America's eye from Riyadh has just gotten sharper. The number of  executions has increased. More American citizens are being detained. I  didn't catch it as to whether Senator Van Hollen specifically  referenced the case of Dr. Fitaihi, a Harvard-trained physician who has  allegedly been tortured, including stripped to his underwear and  shocked with electricity. He has been in detention without charges or a  trial for 1\1/2\ years after his arrest.   The Saudis' behavior has gotten more outrageous, has crossed more  human rights lines, has compromised the safety of more American  citizens, and yet no response from the U.S. Congress and not a single  piece of legislation moving through the U.S. Senate that would hold the  Saudis accountable for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and now the  detention of multiple U.S. residents. We almost shut down our  relationship with Turkey over the detainment of an American pastor, but  there is no similar response from this body when it comes to the  continued detention of Americans in Saudi Arabia, with no trial, with  no charges, and with evidence of torture. How is that? How is that?   Today we specifically litigate the case of the disastrous war that  continues to rage inside Yemen today. I want to read a very short  excerpt written by a hardened U.S. diplomat. Jeffrey Feltman is not a  Democrat or Republican. He was a career Foreign Service officer. He did  some of the toughest duty in the Middle East, including a stint as our  Ambassador to Lebanon. Many people know him, and I know he commands  just as much respect from Republicans as he does from Democrats. Here  is what he wrote. He said:         The war in Yemen has been a disaster for U.S. interests,       for Saudi interests, and above all for the Yemeni people. It       has sparked the world's largest humanitarian catastrophe:       tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, and 14       million are at risk of starvation. It has been a strategic       blunder as well, producing the exact results the Saudi-led       military campaign was designed to prevent. The Houthis are       more militarily sophisticated and better able to strike       beyond Yemen's borders than they were at the start of the       war; Iranian influence has expanded; and the relationship       between the Houthis and Lebanon's Hezbollah has only       deepened. Although the United Arab Emirates has waged an       effective battle against al Qaeda in Yemen, terrorism remains       a grave threat.    Now, I could read you similar pronouncements from all sorts of other  Middle Eastern experts. There is a hegemony of opinion that this war  has been a disaster not just from a humanitarian standpoint.   I had to select a picture that, frankly, wouldn't induce sickness  from my colleagues. I chose a picture in which this young, starving  boy's back is turned to the camera, but there are plenty others in  which you would have a hard time holding down your lunch.   It is not just the humanitarian nightmare; it is the strategic  nightmare that is Yemen. Every single day that we stay involved in this  war, the battle lines do not change, and yet Iran and Hezbollah get  more and more involved inside the military fight.   There is a political deal to be had here. If the United States chose  to lead diplomatically instead of follow militarily, there is a  political deal that can be had, but for reasons I do not understand,  the United States does not lead the diplomatic negotiations. We  outsource that to the U.N. I am a big fan of the U.N., but there is not  going to be a peace settlement in Yemen without the United States as  the lead. Instead, we simply choose to follow the military campaign of  the Saudis by helping them engage in a bombing campaign that has  murdered thousands of civilians, either on purpose or by accident. It  has destroyed the civilian infrastructure of the country, and it does  not relent.   Every single time you meet with somebody from the administration,  they tell you: Well, it is getting better. It is getting better. There  is really no evidence of that. On March 26, airstrikes reportedly hit a  hospital supported by Save the Children in northwest Yemen, killing at  least seven, including four children. There is no excuse for that  because every single hospital is on the list of targets that the Saudis  can't hit, and yet they continue to do so.   Senator Romney and I just came back from the region, and here is what  we heard. All of the relief agencies that do the big heavy lifting in  Yemen flew into Amman, Jordan, to talk to our delegation. I thought it  was exceptional that they were making this trip, but then when they  delivered the news that they had, I understood why they were making the  trip into Jordan to meet with us. The report they gave us was  absolutely bone-chilling.   I want you to listen to this. Today, in Yemen, there are 250,000  Yemenis who are so malnourished and so sick that they are beyond  saving. They will die. One-quarter million Yemenis are so sick, are so  malnourished that they cannot be saved, and another 10 million are on  the cusp of entering that category. The only way to stop this  humanitarian disaster, of a scope and scale that we see nowhere else in  the world, is to end this civil war.   So long as the United States participates in the military campaign  with the Saudis, while not offering any meaningful pressure to get to a  political settlement, we are complicit in those deaths. One-quarter  million people are going to die in the next several months inside Yemen  from starvation and disease and malnutrition due to a military campaign  that we are a part of. Don't get me wrong. The Houthis bear a great  degree of responsibility for those who are starving inside territories  they control. There is still 15 to 20 percent of the relief supplies  that the Houthis steal and take for themselves, but hundreds of  thousands of those who are dying or who are subject to disease and  famine are in the parts of the country that are controlled by our  coalition. This isn't just a matter of the Houthis refusing to let  supplies get to people who need them. There are people dying in parts  of the country that the coalition, of which the United States is a part  of, controls, and we are standing by, largely idly, as this devastation  continues.   I hope my colleagues will consider voting to overturn the President's  veto. I hope you will do it because it is the only means by which we  force a political settlement. I hope you will do it because even if you  don't think that a political settlement is coming, the United States  should never willingly be a part of a bombing campaign that results in  this kind of starvation. I hope you will also do it because even if you  believe Iran is the No. 1 objective of U.S. interest in the region or  even if you believe that al-Qaida and ISIS are the No. 1 target of U.S.  interest in the region, they are getting stronger every single day that  the status quo continues.   The military campaign has been a massive failure. The battle lines  don't move, and al-Qaida and ISIS remain uniquely strong inside that  country because of the chaos, and Iran, every single day, becomes more  and more influential. Get out of the military campaign, take the lead  on the diplomatic effort rather than simply follow others, and we will  end that misery. It is within our power to send that message.  [[Page S2588]]    I agree with Senator Van Hollen. This is also about sending a message  to Saudi Arabia about the continued murder and detainment of American  citizens and residents. This is about standing up for human rights in  the face of 37 people convicted and beheaded inside Saudi Arabia,  several of them minors. But this is also about squaring U.S. policy  with national security interests and getting the blood off our hands as  250,000 Yemenis face certain death if we don't do something different  very soon.   I yield the floor.
