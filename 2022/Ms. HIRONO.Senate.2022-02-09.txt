 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Climate  Adaptation Science Center Act, or CASC Act. This bill authorizes the  national and nine regional CASCs that came about after Congress  appropriated funding for a National Climate Science Center in 2008 and  subsequently, in 2009, Department of the Interior Secretary Salazar  recognized the Department as the lead Agency for protecting the  country's cultural and natural resources via secretarial order.   The national and regional CASCs are housed within the U.S. Geological  Survey, USGS. The national CASC is located in Reston, VA, and the nine  regional CASCs are dispersed throughout the country from Hawaii, to  Alaska to Massachusetts. These regional CASCs service stakeholders in  the continental United States, Hawaii, Alaska, U.S.-affiliated Pacific  Islands, USAPI, and the U.S. Caribbean. The purpose of these CASCs is  to help protect cultural and natural resources by developing the  science and tools that on-the-ground managers need to respond to the  effects of climate change.   One regional CASC, the Pacific Island CASC, or PI-CASC, is a  partnership between the USGS and a university consortium hosted by the  University of Hawaii at Manoa, with the University of Hawaii at Hilo  and the University of Guam. PI-CASC was established in October 2011 and  over the course of more than a decade has conducted important climate  research informed by impacted stakeholders, developed products and  tools for resource managers to address climate change, and provided  programs to increase capacity and stakeholder networking.   Over 100 research projects have been completed to address stakeholder  needs across the Hawaiian Islands and USAPI, such as prioritization  planning for coastal wetland restoration on Molokai, developing a  climate and GIS data portal for American Samoa, and predicting and  mitigating avian disease at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge on  Hawaii Island. Over a dozen different products and tools have been  developed by PI-CASC, including sea level forecasting tools for  communities throughout the Pacific, a database on weed fire risk  throughout Hawaii, and an agroforestry tool for Marshallese  agricultural producers. Programs that have been made possible by the  PI-CASC include a Manager Climate Corps on Hawaii Island, a Summer  Undergraduate Research Fellowship, and a Pacific Regional Invasive  Species & Climate Change Management Program.   These are just examples of research, products, and programs made  possible by one regional CASC. The nine regional CASCs are providing  similar services all across the country. Currently, stakeholder demand  for CASC system services outpaces available resources. Additionally, in  the coming years and decades, the challenges that on-the-ground  resource managers face with climate change are only going to become  more numerous and complex. As such, this bill is necessary to formally  establish the CASCs in law so that the important work that the national  and nine regional CASCs conduct can continue assisting stakeholders all  across the country for decades to come.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Coons, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Brown, Mr.          Blumenthal, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 3622. A bill to establish an AmeriCorps Administration to carry  out the national and volunteer service programs, to expand  participation in such programs, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Finance.
