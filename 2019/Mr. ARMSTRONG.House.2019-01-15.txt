 Madam Speaker, the North Dakota State University  football team brought home their record seventh FCS championship trophy  in 8 years.   On January 5, the Bison defeated the Eastern Washington Eagles, 38- 24. The Eagles are a good team and attempted several comebacks, but the  Bison held strong for the win.   Quarterback Easton Stick led the Bison with a spectacular  performance. He had five touchdowns--two passing and three rushing--for  a combined 319 yards.   The Bison players were cheered on by 17,000 dedicated NDSU fans who  traveled over 1,000 miles south to Frisco, Texas, for what has become  an annual journey.   Victory also sealed Coach Klieman's place in college football  history. In his five seasons, he has coached the team to four national  championships and just four conference losses.   Madam Speaker, this incredible achievement is the result of months of  hard work and preparation. Congratulations to all Bison players,  coaches, and fans. They earned it.                            ____________________
