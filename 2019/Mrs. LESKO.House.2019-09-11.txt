 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would require the Department of  the Interior, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to report  on whether the policies of this bill would put our national security at  risk.   There are many reasons to support domestic energy production, many  reasons to oppose the bans this bill proposes, but I believe chief  among them is that harnessing the natural resources our country has  been blessed with makes our Nation and our allies safer.   American energy production makes us less reliant on foreign actors.  More American oil means we will less likely have to use Saudi Arabian  oil. More American natural gas means our allies are less likely to rely  on Russian natural gas.   Our homes, factories, and vehicles need energy. Our allies need  energy. As our world grows, so will our demand.   Oil and natural gas are estimated to comprise 60 percent of global  demand in 2050. The question is, where will the United States get it?  Will we take it from our own shores, or will we rely on OPEC, whose  Arab petroleum-exporting countries previously stopped oil shipments to  the United States and caused gas prices to soar and threatened our  national security.   I support an all-of-the-above approach, which includes solar, wind,  hydropower, nuclear, and coal. I also support domestic oil and natural  gas. I believe an all-of-the-above energy approach benefits American  pocketbooks and quality of life and, especially, our security.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of my amendment because I believe our  government should fully understand the security risks these bans in  these bills entail, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank Representative Lowenthal, my colleague  from California, and thank my other Democratic colleagues. I think this  is a commonsense amendment, and it sounds like the gentleman approves  of it.   Mr. Chair, I think it is common sense, and I am hopeful that it will  be voted on with ``yes.'' I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1400
