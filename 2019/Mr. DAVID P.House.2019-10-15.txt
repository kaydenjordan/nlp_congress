 ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2385, as amended. This  bill, which is sponsored by Congressman Conor Lamb from Pennsylvania, a  United States Marine Corps veteran, would authorize the Department of  Veterans Affairs to award grants instead of contracts to educational  organizations that research the lives of those who are interred in our  Nation's cemeteries.   I thank Chairman Takano for the amendment he offered during the  committee markup of this bill to include report language to ensure that  Congress has the information needed to determine whether this grant  program is financially sound.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2385, as amended,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1645     ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I once again encourage all Members to support H.R. 2385,  as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1199, the VA Website  Accessibility Act of 2019. This bill would require the Department of  Veterans Affairs to examine all websites, apps, attachments, and  electronic forms, determine which are inaccessible to veterans with  disabilities, and develop a plan to make each of them accessible.    Visually impaired veterans, in particular, often face barriers to  accessing information from VA because they are directed to forms or  pages that are incompatible with screen readers. This bill would  require VA to take systematic action to address these issues, ensuring  that all veterans are able to access needed VA information.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1199, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers and am prepared to close. I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would challenge that people who are sight impaired in  this country have a 75 percent unemployment rate, if you look at that.   The challenge that I do each year and what I do to myself when my  sight-impaired constituents come to my office is I go back to my small  apartment that I have and I put a blindfold on, and I try to get around  and just do simple tasks of the day. And you find out how very  difficult that is.   I could not be more supportive of this legislation, and I thank the  gentlewoman for bringing it up because, try on your computer when you  can't see to get information you need to get services. You have to have  someone there to help you.   We have the technology available today, if it is used at the VA, so  that these men and women who have served this country can also have the  access that every other veteran has.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill, H.R. 1199, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2334, a bill sponsored  by Congressman Michael Conaway of Texas. This bill would name the  Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in  Odessa, Texas, the ``Wilson and Young Medal of Honor VA Clinic,'' after  two Texas veterans who received the Medal of Honor for their heroic  actions in the Vietnam war.   Private First Class Alfred ``Mac'' Wilson was a marine killed in  action March 3, 1969, when he threw himself on a grenade to save his  platoon mate during an enemy ambush.   Staff Sergeant Marvin ``Rex'' Young was a soldier who was killed in  action on August 21, 1968, when he was fatally wounded while rescuing  several of his fellow soldiers who had been pinned down by enemy fire.   Both of these men received posthumously the Medal of Honor, our  country's highest tribute, for their actions.   Even these many years after their deaths, their memories live on as  examples of true courage, selflessness, and love of country. I commend  Congressman Conaway for introducing this bill in their honor.   This bill is supported by the entire Texas delegation, in both the  House and the Senate, as well as by several veterans' service  organizations throughout Texas.   Mr. Speaker, this is something very near and dear and personal to me.  I am a Vietnam-era veteran myself. I remember, all too often, seeing  these American heroes who never got to see their families, their  children, or their grandchildren because of the sacrifice that they  gave for this country: their life, the greatest sacrifice they could.   And we stand here in this great country, free, because of what these  men did. And I hope that people in Odessa, Texas, take as much pride as  I do. Tennessee and Texas have a great connection, as the Speaker  knows, and I take great pride, in Tennessee, in having the privilege  today to be on this floor debating this bill and bestowing this honor  on these two heroes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to  yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), my good  friend from Texas' 11th District, the former chairman of the  Agriculture Committee and now ranking member, who also serves on the  Intelligence Committee, to honor these two great heroes.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I will associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Conaway). I know he misses his friend.   It is a true privilege to be here today to be able to honor this  clinic in Odessa, Texas.   I encourage all Members to support H.R. 2334, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 95, the Homeless Veteran  Families Act. This bill would amend the Department of Veterans Affairs  Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program to provide payments to  GPD providers for the services they provide to the children of homeless  veterans.   Mr. Speaker, while VA and other partners have been very successful in  decreasing the number of homeless veterans in the country by almost 50  percent since 2010, we still have an unacceptable number of veterans on  the streets every night.   The GPD program is a tool in VA's arsenal to help community  organizations provide services to homeless veterans by reimbursing them  for providing temporary housing and supportive services that promote  health and self-sufficiency among homeless veterans.   However, under current rules, community partners are not authorized  funding for providing services and shelter to the dependents of the  homeless veterans who they serve. This forces these organizations to  make a difficult choice of turning away homeless veterans with children  or finding another source of funding to provide services for them.   H.R. 95 would address this issue by amending current law to authorize  grant and per diem payments for the children of homeless veterans at  half the amount paid for each homeless veteran.   While I have some concerns about using medical care dollars to  provide these services, as they may detract from the already limited  resources available for providing services for homeless veterans  themselves, I am not going to oppose this approach today. I want what  is best for our veterans, and if this change helps community partners  provide the services they need to homeless veteran families, then it is  worthy of our support.   I thank the gentlewoman from California, my friend, Congresswoman  Julia Brownley, for sponsoring this bill, which has my full support,  and I reserve the balance of my time.     ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon). She was a member of  the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a very passionate supporter of our  veterans.   After the hurricanes in Puerto Rico, she was kind enough to invite  me. I saw her passion. We went through the VA hospital together, the  outpatient clinics. I don't believe anyone in this Congress has more  care for our veterans than her.                                time  1730    Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear  friend for allowing me to speak and for his visit. And actually, that  was the first time ever the Veterans' Affairs Committee had a hearing  in Puerto Rico in more than 100 years. So we got two chairmen in Puerto  Rico in the last 2 years, and I am happy to say that Mr. Roe and Mr.  Takano were there this year.   And actually I have got good news. Finally, we got the money assigned  for the new clinic in Arecibo and the new clinic in Ponce after that  visit. So that is real good news. And we just received a VA deputy last  week, and they are talking about expanding the services of the  hospital, which is good.   Today I rise in full support of H.R. 95, the Homeless Veteran  Families Act introduced by my colleague Julia Brownley of California.   Homelessness is, unfortunately, one of the challenges many of our  veterans face upon separating from the Armed Forces. Consequently, the  Department of Veterans Affairs has made ending homelessness part of  their core mission.   Initiatives like the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program,  which funds community agencies that provide services to homeless  veterans, facilitates tackling these problems head-on.   H.R. 95 builds upon this program by authorizing the Department of  Veterans Affairs to pay partial per diem for children who are under the  care of a homeless veteran. We need to keep in mind that homelessness  can affect our veterans at any point, impacting not only their lives,  but the lives of their children.   Recent estimates indicate that there are close to 82 homeless  veterans in Puerto Rico, and we need to take this personally because  they just can't move to another state. With us living on an island, we  have got to have our community being served, and a program like  Homeless Providers Grant and the Per Diem Program will help us lower  this number to zero and will counter the inability of providers of  these services to turn down helping a veteran because he or she has  children under their care.   And I think that is the most important thing about this bill. It is  not only the veteran themselves that suffers, it is the family that  suffers with him or with her, and that is the reason I am a proud  cosponsor of this bill.   I commend Congresswoman Brownley for her leadership on this issue,  and, of course, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. I  think it is important to recognize that we all need to take care of  these kinds of issues.   I thank Congressman Roe and Chairman Takano for visiting the island  this year. I think this is the first time ever that Puerto Rico has  received visits from two chairmen, and that means something for the  more than 105,000 veterans registered on the island.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I think this is a great bill. Homelessness is a huge problem in this  country, and keeping our families together is a huge problem in this  country. This, I think, will be some of the best money that we ever  spend, if we can keep these families together. If a veteran is out  there with their spouse and they are trying the best they can, they  need these resources so they can keep that family unit together.   This bill should go through the House and the Senate unanimously. I  think it will, and with over 300 cosponsors, I feel like it will.   I want to thank Congresswoman Brownley, who is a tireless supporter  of veterans on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I thank her for  bringing this up, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  bill, H.R. 95.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
