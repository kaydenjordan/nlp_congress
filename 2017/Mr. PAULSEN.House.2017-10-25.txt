 Mr. Speaker, last week in Minnesota, I conducted a tax  reform listening tour, visiting small businesses in our community about  why tax reform is so important. Throughout the tour, it was evident  that these small businesses were enthusiastic that tax reform means  more jobs, higher wages, and a stronger economy.   Diversified Plastics in Brooklyn Park, an employee-owned company that  manufactures and assembles plastic injection products, said that being  able to immediately expense new equipment will allow them to invest  more in their company and hire more people.   Northstar Balloons in Plymouth, which manufactures and distributes  foil party balloons, said that a Tax Code that provides stability and  predictability will allow them to invest in their company with  confidence.   Mr. Speaker, the message was clear: fixing a broken Tax Code will  help small businesses hire more people, give their employees a raise,  and create a growing and a more competitive economy.                            ____________________
