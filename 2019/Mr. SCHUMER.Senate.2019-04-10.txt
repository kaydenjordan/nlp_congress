 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, later this week the Senate will vote on  the confirmation of David Bernhardt, a longtime lobbyist, to the  position of Interior Secretary. An oil and gas lobbyist will be  entrusted with our sacred--sacred--inheritance, the great lands of  America.   I urge Senators to oppose this nomination.   The Department of the Interior is the Agency entrusted with  protecting our Nation's public lands, our water supplies, our wildlife,  and our energy resources. It grapples directly with some of the biggest  questions our country faces: how to respond to climate change, how to  protect endangered species, and how to care for our precious natural  resources. Yet to lead our Interior Department, President Trump has  nominated Mr. Bernhardt, an oil and gas lobbyist who has made a career  harming the environment, subverting environmental protections, and  helping polluters sidestep Federal regulation.   As former Secretary Zinke's deputy, he has paved the way for even  more polluters to run rampant without accountability. Under his watch,  the Department of the Interior has already opened a colossal 17 million  acres of Federal land for oil and gas leases, generating millions in  revenue for energy companies, all while Bernhardt recklessly managed  our national parks during the government shutdown.   I am especially troubled this morning because POLITICO reported that  under Mr. Bernhardt's watch, the Department of the Interior might even  greenlight offshore drilling off the coasts of Florida--a prospect both  parties in the State say they oppose. This should be a wake-up call to  my colleagues all up and down the coast--Atlantic, Pacific, and the  gulf. If they can't find a reason to oppose this nominee based on the  other serious and troubling issues that have been raised, maybe this is  reason enough for them.   It is hard to imagine someone whose background is so at odds with the  Department's mission as Bernhardt's. For all his talk of draining the  swamp, President Trump wants to add yet another Washington swamp  creature lobbyist to his Cabinet.   By the way, our resources--our oil and gas resources--are large. The  motivation here to spoil public lands for oil and gas drilling--it is  the power of the oil companies. It has nothing to do with the plan for  natural resources. Bernhardt is an exemplary example of the power of  these oil companies.   Gravely troubling is the long list of conflicting interests that  Bernhardt brings to Trump's Cabinet. Up to 20 of his former clients  have lobbied the Department of the Interior since his arrival, and the  New York Times reported last week that he very likely has been less  than forthcoming about when he stopped lobbying. No other Cabinet-level  nominee in the Trump era has so many conflicts of interest, and that is  a low bar. It is a distinction no one should be proud to hold.   Worst of all, Bernhardt is a hardened enemy of climate science. If  you are a lobbyist for oil and gas companies, you would say that  climate change isn't real too. The Washington Post reported he attended  a session of administration officials that ``debated how best to  establish a group of researchers that could scrutinize recent federal  climate reports.'' Translation: Bernhardt is actively working to set up  the White House's fake panel to deny basic science.   I have already introduced legislation to prohibit any funding from  going to this fake climate panel, but knowing Mr. Bernhardt's role in  setting it up should send shivers down the spines of every American who  is worried about the impact of our changing climate on their families,  their farms, and future generations.   We cannot entrust our public lands to someone known to wage a  campaign of censorship against facts and reason. Now, later today, I am  going to be able to meet with Mr. Bernhardt to discuss his  qualifications. I am letting him know now that I will ask him the same  three questions I have asked my Republican colleagues in this Chamber.  One, does Mr. Bernhardt agree that climate change is real; two, does he  agree it is a product of human action; and three, should the Federal  Government have a role in combating its effects? His record suggests  his answer to all these questions is no, but let's see what he says  today.   Caring for our planet and being good stewards of our natural  resources are the most important responsibilities we owe to future  generations, so I am gravely concerned about Bernhardt's nomination to  the Department of the Interior, and I urge my colleagues to vote no on  his confirmation.   One final point. It still amazes me that Donald Trump campaigns on  cleaning up the swamp, and he does exactly the opposite when in office.  An oil and gas lobbyist is head of the Department of the Interior? My  God, that is an example of the swampiness of Washington, if there ever  was one. When are Donald Trump's supporters going to understand this;  that what he promised them, in so many different instances, he is not  delivering. It is befuddling. It is a sign of the weakness of our  democracy that someone can walk into the Presidency promising so many  things and then just immediately do the opposite and still a large  chunk of Americans say they support him. It is amazing to me.                                   H.R. 268    Mr. President, for months, American citizens have been reeling from  natural disasters and are in desperate need of Federal aid.  Parenthetically, I remind Mr. Bernhardt that a lot of these disasters,  scientists believe, are because the climate is warmer, and the weather  is changing, but rather than work with us to provide the much needed  aid to large chunks of America, our Republican colleagues have once  again decided to follow President Trump and refuse to compromise. They  are so afraid of him that even when he proposes something they know is  wrong and irrational, they do a 180-degree hairpin turn and support  what he is doing.   Now, that would be just politics, except millions are awaiting aid  and need help. Their homes, their farms, their offices, and their  factories are underwater, literally, in a lot of places still.   Just yesterday, House Democrats offered a solution. We said: Let's  provide disaster relief not to some Americans but to all Americans  struggling to recover and rebuild from natural disasters.   Their new proposal that the House offered includes an additional $3  billion--this is House Democrats, not Senate Democrats, by the way.  Their new proposal includes an additional $3 billion to address urgent  needs following the floods in the Midwest and the tornadoes in the  South. This plus-up includes $1.5 billion for the Army Corps of  Engineers to support flood risk reduction so crucial in the Missouri  River Valley, $1 billion in CDBG for long-term recovery needs, and $500  million in agriculture funding to help  [[Page S2353]]  the farmers and ranchers rehabilitate farmland damaged by natural  disasters and replace some of the farm animals that have been lost.   Yesterday's House bill comes in addition to the proposals Senator  Leahy and I offered last week--and it is similar to them--and in  addition to the work Senator Leahy did last month. So, again and again,  Democrats presented option after option for disaster funding that helps  the Midwest, helps the coasts, helps the South, and helps Puerto Rico  and other territories. None of our offers are either-or, help this but  not that.   Enough excuses from our Republican colleagues. We have had enough of  the slow playing, but, more important, the people who need this help  have had enough. The bottom line is very simple. The aid we seek is  what Americans have always done. When there is a disaster, we all come  together and aid those areas in a disaster because we know when a huge  natural disaster hits from God, an area can't deal with it on their  own. They don't have the resources or the ability, and they are, many  times, in trouble because of the disaster itself.   We say: Come to the aid, but all of a sudden Donald Trump goes into  the Republican lunch a week and a half ago and says: I don't want any  aid for Puerto Rico. He falsely claims they have gotten $91 billion-- not true--and then all our Republican friends go along.   Well, we are not. The House will not. Senate Democrats will not.  Plain and simple, we don't believe you should pick and choose. Why did  President Trump single out Puerto Rico, which are American citizens  like everybody else? A lot of theories, but regardless of what your  theory is, that is not the way to govern as President, and, frankly, it  is not the way we should govern as Senators. It is bewildering that our  Republican colleagues have caved to President Trump's--what can we call  it--temper tantrum, even though they are well aware of the problems and  were ready to help Puerto Rico before he threw that temper tantrum.   Some say: Well, Puerto Rico is getting a little money. They are  getting food stamp aid.   Well, great. Then let's just give food stamp aid to everybody else.  Let's give it to everyone else. Now, what about all the farms that are  underwater? What about all the homes that are flooded and needing help?  If you give food stamp aid, that doesn't help them.   So let's be fair. Let's treat each area the same. Let's do what we  have done in the American tradition: Come together, when there is a  disaster, to help Americans. Let's not be so afraid of Donald Trump  that when you know he is wrong, you just go along.   The idea that Puerto Rico should be treated differently from the rest  of America is insulting. It is against our American values and a  betrayal of the promise to look after all American citizens, not  because of their politics and not because of what their last names  might sound like; as American citizens, we come together during times  of need.   Democrats will not yield in our responsibility to all American  citizens, and I tell that to all my friends from the farm States, even  those who voted against aid to New York when we had our hurricane. I  never even considered not voting for aid to any other place in the  country. I always have.   I say to my friends: Let's treat everyone fairly, and we can get the  much needed disaster aid out there quickly.
