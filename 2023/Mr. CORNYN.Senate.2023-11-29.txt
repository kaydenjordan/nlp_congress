 Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my  colleague from Kansas.   Coming from Texas, this is a familiar topic because we have a 1,200- mile common border with Mexico, and illegal immigration, drug  smuggling, and everything that goes along with it has been something we  have had to live with pretty much alone for a long time.   But now, as we have heard some people say, every State has become a  border State, and every city is a border city, because what happens at  the border does not stay at the border. You get migrants who ultimately  make their ways to big cities like New York, Washington, DC, and  Chicago.   The mayor of New York says a few thousand migrants showing up in New  York will destroy New York City. Well, what about the 7 million people  who have come across the southern border and then released into the  interior of the United States, released at the Texas-Mexico border?   There is not a lot of empathy, not a lot of sympathy for what we have  had to endure in our border communities and by the people of Texas, not  to mention the billions of dollars that we have had to spend of  taxpayer money, by Texans, to do the Federal Government's job. It is  outrageous.   The part that is most tragic is, of course, all the lives lost to the  drugs that come across the southern border. What the Biden  administration does not seem to understand--or they seem to be in  willful suspense of their power of disbelief--is that the 71,000  Americans who died of fentanyl overdoses last year, those drugs come  from synthetic opioids made from precursors that come from China, go to  Mexico, and are made into something that looks like a pharmaceutical  product--relatively innocuous. But fentanyl poisoning is the leading  cause of death of Americans 18 to 45 years of age.   I keep asking myself: What is it going to take? What is it going to  take for the Biden administration to wake up and do something about it,  to do its job? Well, obviously, 7 million migrants--that is not enough;  108,000 dead Americans--apparently that doesn't get President Biden's  attention. How about the 300,000 children, the unaccompanied minors who  have been placed with sponsors in the interior of the United States?   The New York Times documented that in 85,000 cases, when a call was  made 30 days after the child was placed with a sponsor, there was no  answer. There have been some terrible stories about forced labor and  very dangerous jobs. But it doesn't take imagination to realize that  what the Biden administration has done is lose basically 300,000  children. We don't know whether they are going to school. We don't know  whether they are getting the healthcare they need. We don't know  whether they are being trafficked for sex, forced into involuntary  servitude. We don't know.   The only conclusion I can reach is that the Biden administration and  the President of the United States don't care. He doesn't care because  if he did care, he would do something about it.   Well, because we have been met with complete intransigence by the  Biden administration and by the majority here in the Senate when it  comes to solving some of these problems on a bipartisan basis--there  are many of us who would be willing to work on a bill. We have worked  on bills. I see the Senator from South Carolina, who bears the scars of  having worked on the immigration issue many years, as have I. This is a  tough, hard issue.   But enough is enough. We are not going to proceed to this emergency  supplemental that the President has asked for unless and until policy  changes are made to our asylum policy, the catch-and-release policies,  that will stem the flow of millions of migrants across the border only  to be released into the United States. It will not happen, I am  confident of that.   I won't go through the statistics. Let me just mention one example.  It makes no sense for migrants who come from places like Haiti to move  to South America--to avoid what are admittedly dire circumstances in  Haiti--only to live in South America and then, when the opportunity  presents itself, to show up in Del Rio, TX, and claim asylum. They have  escaped the circumstances which caused them to leave Haiti and are  living in a safe third country. So why is it that under the current  policies, we say: OK. If you make it to the U.S. border, we will let  you in if you claim asylum.   Well, you are claiming a credible fear of persecution based on what  happened to you in Haiti, not what happened to you in South America.  Yet this is a huge flashing green light and a ``welcome'' mat for  people anywhere around the world who want to make their way to our  southern border.   Eagle Pass Mayor Rolando Salinas has said the city of Eagle Pass has  lost at least $500,000 during the closure of a bridge due to the influx  of migrants.   One of the things we did during President Trump's tenure in office,  which I think was one of the most significant, was we passed the U.S.- Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement in recognition of the fact that our  economies in North America are intertwined and that millions of  American jobs depend on that flow of legitimate trade and commerce  across our international bridges.   But, again, one of the other consequences of President Biden's border  crisis is that even the benefits of that trade and legitimate commerce  are being denied because resources at our bridges and ports of entry  are being overwhelmed.   I mentioned New York City. Last year, more than 130,000 migrants  arrived in New York City. That city spent $2 billion to manage the  crisis. That is a drop in the bucket compared to what the State of  Texas has had to do over recent years. But it is no surprise that the  mayor and others in New York have taken notice. I think that is the  point.   Governor Abbott knew that if the Biden administration was going to  ignore the plight of border States like Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and  California, that maybe he would care if these migrants showed up in New  York City.   Now, polls have shown that New Yorkers are overwhelmingly concerned  about the influx of migrants in their State and in their city. Eighty- two percent said it was a serious problem.   So why doesn't President Biden--maybe he doesn't care about a red  State like Texas, but he should care about a blue State. The truth is,  he should care about the entire United States, but let's just maybe  question why he would ignore the pleas of Mayor Adams and the voters in  New York State--a State that probably was responsible for his margin of  victory in  [[Page S5659]]  the last Presidential election. Well, he continues to ignore it.   In fact, the Senate majority leader, from New York, where Mayor Adams  is mayor--a major capital city there--despite the fact that Senator  Schumer represents that same State, he has criticized the Republican  effort to actually address the Biden border crisis. He has called it  partisan and hard right.   Well, frankly, that is all the majority leader and our Democratic  colleagues have been willing to do. But we are not going to miss this  opportunity to get true policy changes which help stem the flow of  illegal migration across the border.   It is clear that the President and Secretary Mayorkas, who has been  an absolute, unmitigated disaster as Secretary of Homeland Security--I  told him at the last hearing we had: I have lost confidence, any  confidence, in your willingness to do your job. You should resign.   Well, he continues to show up and testify under oath and to lie when  he says the border is secure. Well, anybody with eyes in their head can  tell that that is not true. And he has told the Border Patrol: Don't  actually tell anybody what is happening at the border.   Well, enough is enough. We are not going anywhere on this  supplemental appropriations bill until and unless acceptable provisions  are made to change the policies that currently implement the Biden  border crisis and to staunch the flow of drugs and people across the  border.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, Texas is home to many unique  festivals that celebrate the food, music, and culture that have shaped  our State. This year marks the 50th anniversary of an event ``Texas  Monthly'' once dubbed ``one of the most beloved and bizarre holiday  traditions in Texas''--Dickens on the Strand.   Each December, the Galveston Historical Foundation hosts the Dickens  on the Strand Festival, which celebrates the life and work of renowned  novelist Charles Dickens. Throughout its history, this holiday festival  has played a critical role in revitalizing and restoring the Strand  National Historic Landmark District. This year's festival is expected  to welcome more than 50,000 guests to the island.   Though Charles Dickens never set foot in Galveston, his descendants  have attended the festival every year since 1986, and this year will be  no exception.  [[Page S5672]]  Eight descendants of Charles Dickens are expected to attend this year's  festival and provide readings of Dickens' work.   The festival also honors our proud and historic ties between Texas  and the United Kingdom. In 1846, the first British Consulate in the  Lone Star State was established in Galveston, and it remained open  until 1939. The Second British Consul-General to Texas, Arthur Lynn, is  buried in Galveston's City Cemetery.   I am pleased that the British Consulate-General in Houston will be  the presenting sponsor for this year's festival. Events will take place  in multiple locations across the city, including the Salute to Sunset  on the Official Tall Ship of Texas, the Elissa, which was built in the  United Kingdom.   Galveston's holiday tradition has won 24 International Festival and  Events Association Pinnacle Awards in its history. It has also brought  much happiness and pride to the community and the visitors who come to  take part in the celebration.   Congratulations to all involved in organizing the 50th Dickens on The  Strand Festival, and I wish all of its guests, staff, and honorees a  very successful weekend.                            ____________________
