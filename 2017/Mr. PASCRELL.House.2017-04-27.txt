 Mr. Speaker, on the campaign trail, the President  talked a good game on trade that appealed to working families. But now  that he is President, his promises ring hollow.   He promised to stop outsourcing and shipping jobs overseas, but he  issued 15 contracts since becoming President with companies that have  outsourced jobs. He promised to hold China accountable and label them a  currency manipulator. He reversed that pledge.   He promised to drain the swamp, but he has done just the opposite. He  stacked the Cabinet with wealthy insiders; and his White House is  filled with friends, family, and a stunning display of nepotism and  conflicts of interest.   He said he would release his tax returns. That is a laugher. Breaking  with 40 years of precedent, he has not released his taxes and claimed  the American people don't care.   Seventy-four percent of Americans want to see his tax returns. And we  will never know the full extent of his conflicts of interest and how he  stands to enrich himself in office until we see his tax returns.   Congressional tax-writing committees can request them because they  have the authority under IRC 6103, and I urge my colleagues to support  this effort.                            ____________________
