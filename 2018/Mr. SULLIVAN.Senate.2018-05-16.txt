 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I just had a very productive and  informative meeting with the nominee to be the next CIA Director, Ms.  Gina Haspel. I wanted to come down to the floor and say a few words. I  was very impressed. I am going to certainly support her when she is  voted on, I believe as early as tomorrow.   There has been a lot of discussion about her background. She is the  first woman to lead the CIA, first career member of the CIA. That is  all important, but I think what is most important is that the American  people and this body know that she is very well qualified. She is a  very impressive person.   First of all, she has been very highly decorated in her 30-plus year  career at the Central Intelligence Agency. Her honors include the  Intelligence Medal of Merit, a Presidential Rank Award, the Donovan  Award, which is one of the highest awards in the CIA, and the George  H.W. Bush Award for Excellence in Counterterrorism. She is thoughtful.  She is honest.   In many ways, she has overcome numerous obstacles. Let me talk a  little bit about her bio. She is one of five children. Her father  served in the Air Force, having joined at the age of 17. She grew up on  military bases, like tens of thousands of Americans. Her original goal  in life was to be a soldier. She told her dad she wanted to go to West  Point. At the time, her father had to break the news to her that West  Point was not admitting women. I think West Point lost out on that one.  She ended up as a contractor for the military 10th Special Forces  Group. Later, she realized that if she couldn't join the military, she  was going to join the CIA, and that is what she did.   She has done an outstanding job at the CIA. She began working at the  CIA in 1985 during the closing days of the Cold War. She was stationed  literally all over the world--in Africa, for example. She recruited and  handled agents and survived a coup d'etat. She worked with government  partners during the first gulf war. She ran different CIA stations  around the world.   She started with the Counterterrorism Center at the CIA on September  11, 2001, and essentially has spent her life since that time focusing  on keeping our country safe. She became the Chief of Staff to the  Deputy Director of Operations and the Deputy Director for the National  Clandestine Service. She is now the Deputy Director of the entire CIA-- the first woman to rise from the ranks as an initial member of the  Agency to that title. And if confirmed, as I mentioned, she will be the  first career CIA official and female to lead the Agency. That is really  historic, but again, more important than history and more important  than these labels is that she is very qualified.   One thing that has been remarkable throughout this entire debate  about her--and there has been a lot of debate in the Intelligence  Committee--is the members of the military, members of the national  security establishment, both Democrats and Republicans, and members of  the Intel Committee who have come out and said: We support Gina Haspel.  The list is extremely impressive. Let me give a couple examples: John  Brennan, former Obama administration CIA Director; James Clapper,  former Obama administration Director of National Intelligence; Senator  Saxby Chambliss, former Senate Intelligence Committee vice chair;  Representative Porter Goss, former CIA Director and House Intelligence  Committee chairman; Gen. Michael Hayden, former Bush administration CIA  Director; Senator Bob Kerrey,  [[Page S2718]]  Democratic Senator from Nebraska, who was on the Senate Intelligence  Committee and was the vice chairman; Henry Kissinger, former Secretary  of State; Mike McConnell, former Obama administration Director of  National Intelligence; ADM William McRaven, former commander of  USSOCOM; Michael Morell, former Obama administration Acting and Deputy  CIA Director; Michael Mukasey, former Bush administration Attorney  General; Leon Panetta, former Obama administration CIA Director and  Secretary of Defense;  Mike Rogers, Republican Congressman and former  House Intel Committee chairman; George Shultz, an incredible statesman  and former Secretary of State under President Reagan; and George Tenet,  former Clinton and Bush administrations CIA Director.   That is impressive. That is an impressive list. That is the who's  who--Democrat and Republican--of who has been in charge of our  intelligence services over the last two to three decades, and they are  all supporting Ms. Haspel. She is qualified. She has the support of  everybody.   I want to briefly talk about essentially where the nomination has  been focused. In Washington, a lot of times you can have an issue that  comes up, and everybody focuses on it, and you miss the broader  picture. The broader picture is that she is very well qualified and has  the confidence, literally, of every senior official in the intelligence  agencies she has served under, but the focus has been in many ways  consumed by her role, which was a very low-level role, in what became  known as the enhanced interrogation program that the CIA enacted after  9/11.   It is hard not to say that in the discussion of this, seeing what  some of my colleagues have said and what some former Members of the  Senate and House have said, there seems to be a lot of amnesia going on  here.   I think it is important to take us back to the day that Ms. Haspel  started at the CIA's Counterterrorism Center, as I mentioned, on  September 11, 2001. For those of us who remember, it was a very  frightening time in our country. Almost 3,000 Americans were murdered  and almost 8,000 were wounded.   I wasn't here then, but in Washington, DC, whether it was from the  President or Members of Congress, there was one demand for the CIA:  Find out who did this. Find out who was responsible, and make sure they  don't do it again. Find out who did this. Find out who was responsible,  and do everything in your power to make sure the United States of  America and our citizens don't get attacked again.   That was the No. 1 focus from all the elected leaders in Federal  Government to the CIA: Protect us. Find out where the next attack is  coming from, and don't let us get hit again.   If what ended up happening during this period of U.S. history--and a  lot of people forget about it. A lot of people forget how scared we  were. Very few people predicted that we weren't going to get hit again.  As a matter of fact, everybody thought we would get hit again, maybe  with a weapon of mass destruction.   During the course of this time, the CIA started a program--when they  started capturing terrorists who they thought had information--called  enhanced interrogation techniques.   There was a lot of worry about getting hit again. I won't go through  all the examples, but there are members of the Intel Committee in the  Senate and members of the Intel Committee in the House who were briefed  on exactly what the CIA was doing--exactly what they were doing with  these enhanced interrogation techniques. And that is where the amnesia  comes in, because we have seen some Members of this body say: That was  horrible. Yet they were briefed. As a matter of fact, there are reports  that many Members of Congress said: Do more; find out who did this.  That was the order that the CIA and the members of our clandestine  services were given.   There are numerous quotes from that time. Let me give one from former  Senator John D. Rockefeller, West Virginia, who was the ranking member  on the Senate Intel Committee. In 2003, on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' he  was talking about how we had captured Khalid Shaikh Mohammed--KSM, as  he was known--who was known to be the mastermind of 9/11. It was very  clear that at least Senator Rockefeller was saying: Make sure that we  get as much info as we can from this guy.   Here is what he said:         Happily, we don't know where [KSM] is.    Meaning he was offsite, not in the country.         He's in safekeeping under American protection. He'll be       grilled by us. I'm sure we'll be proper with him, but I'm       sure we'll be very, very tough with him.        There are presidential memorandums that prescribe and allow       certain measures to be taken, but we have to be careful. On       the other hand, he does have the information. Getting that       information will save American lives. We have no business not       getting that information.    This is a year and a half after 9/11, and this is the vice chairman  of the Intel Committee saying: Get it. Press it.   The CIA used these techniques, but here is the important thing. At  the time they were told to go do this, it was reviewed by the Justice  Department, which said: This is legal. You are allowed to use these  techniques to try to get additional information. This is legal. Go do  this. The Government of the United States is telling you that you have  the authority to do it. It is legal.   That is undisputed. As a matter of fact, the enhanced interrogation  techniques were actually developed at our military training facilities  that we have in different parts of the country, called SERE schools-- ``Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape'' schools. That is where  the techniques were developed.   There was another reason why people at the time thought that this  could be legal, because these interrogation techniques and training are  actually used on our own military. For years, members of the military  had been going to SERE school, and they underwent these interrogations.  They underwent waterboarding. It was our own citizens. As a recon  marine, I went to SERE school, and these techniques were applied to me,  including waterboarding.   The CIA was told: Make sure this doesn't happen. The Members of  Congress were briefed. Intel committee members, like Senator  Rockefeller, were saying: Do more. The Justice Department comes out and  says: This is all legal. Go do it. Make sure we are not attacked again.  Oh, by the way, you are using techniques that we use on our marines and  soldiers.   And that is what they did.   Gina Haspel was not high up. She had nothing to do with this. She was  a GS-15 when this was going on. Yet my colleagues who are looking for  reasons to vote against her are using this as an episode, saying: Well,  because she was involved at a low level, we are going to vote against  her.   Think about that. Members of the clandestine service were going out  and risking their lives, being told to do something by the government,  being told it was legal to do something by the government, being  encouraged by Members of this body and the House to go do it, and now  that one of them has risen through the ranks, with a stellar career, we  are going to have Members come to the floor and say: No, we are going  to consider her not qualified because she was a GS-15 and didn't design  the program during this very, very difficult and challenging time in  American history. If you don't think that breeds cynicism or if you  don't think that breeds distrust between the Congress and the  intelligence service, well, it does. It does.   I even had a friend of mine, and I got recalled to Active Duty for a  year and a half at the end of 2004. We were staff officers to the  CENTCOM commander. So we were in the Middle East most of that time. He  was an agency representative, and he actually predicted this was going  to happen to me a long time ago. I don't think it is appropriate for my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to somehow use this against  Ms. Haspel, a low-level employee, who was told to go do it. Congress is  aware. Some Members even said do more--legally justified, used it at  SERE school with our military. Now we are going to hold that against  this very well-qualified nominee.   Let me just add something because I know it is part of the  discussion. In retrospect, over time, many Members look back on that  period and say: Well, maybe we shouldn't have done that. Maybe these  enhanced interrogation  [[Page S2719]]  techniques aren't legal. Maybe that is a bad reflection on our country.   So there was a debate on this. That is fine. That is the way it  should be.   As a matter of fact, one of the Senators whom I have the most respect  for in this entire body, Senator McCain--who knows a lot about torture  and a lot about interrogation and has been a hero and is well  respected--led that debate on the Senate floor that said that these  enhanced interrogation techniques--waterboarding--aren't what we should  be doing in this country. So let's clarify this. Yes, a previous  administration said this is legal. We do it to our own soldiers and  marines and Navy SEALS, but we are going to look at a higher value on  what we believe is right and what Americans should be doing or should  not be doing.   So we actually had a debate in 2016 on this floor as part of the  National Defense Authorization Act, where Senator McCain led an effort  with an amendment that said: From here on out, the techniques that our  CIA operatives would be able to use and that should be approved are  only those in the Army Field Manual. Those are OK--not the rest of what  happened in terms of the enhanced interrogation techniques. Then this  body passed that. As a matter of fact, I voted for the McCain amendment  out of respect, appreciation, and the arguments that John McCain was  making. So we clarified the law.   In many ways, that is how the system is supposed to work. In  challenging times with a lot of turmoil, yes, these operatives were  pushing the envelope, but it was legal. We should take a step back and  say: Maybe that shouldn't be what we should be doing going forward. And  we changed the system through debate on the floor, led by Senator  McCain.   Let me just end by saying that here is how it is not supposed to  work. We have a very dangerous situation, like we had after 9/11. We  asked our best and brightest to risk their lives to defend this  country, to do really tough operations all around the world. We go tell  them to do things. This body is briefed on it. We tell them it is  legal, and then later, we said: Do you know what? Now we are going to  hold that against you.   Not only is that unfair, but if we continue doing that, how hard do  you think it is going to be to get the top people in our country to  want to join the CIA or the special forces or the military? We tell  them to go do this, to protect your Nation; it is legal. And then 10,  15 years later, we say: No, maybe it wasn't.   I want to thank Ms. Haspel for wanting to serve her country at the  highest level, for her example, and all the other members of the CIA's  clandestine services, who have been on the frontlines protecting this  Nation. I certainly hope my colleagues who are looking at that period  of history, looking to hold it against her, recognize the broader  context. Not only were she and the other members of the Agency asked to  do that kind of work, but they were told it was important to protect  the country and that it was legal.   When her nomination comes to the floor tomorrow, I certainly hope my  colleagues keep this all in mind, look at her broad qualifications, and  vote for her to be the next CIA Director.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about  Sharon Jackson, a former member of my staff who recently left to pursue  another opportunity in public service.   Sharon was part of the original team in my State offices that I hired  after being sworn into the Senate in January 2015.   She served as a constituent relations representative, where her  compassion and authenticity reassured constituents as she worked to  resolve their issues with various Federal agencies. Being an Army  veteran herself, Sharon had a unique gift of connecting with veterans  and servicemembers while she helped them navigate complex government  systems. The difference she made in the lives of so many people is  immeasurable.   Sharon provided insight into the issues small businesses face in  Alaska. Her past work with National Write Your Congressman and the  National Federation of Independent Businesses put her in tune with the  passions and concerns of Alaska's small businesses.   She was also a very involved community member in Anchorage and Eagle  River, contributing her time and energy to a variety of organizations  with the intention of building a better and brighter future for our  great State.   Sharon was a true pleasure to have on the team. She loves Alaska, and  that always showed in her passionate advocacy on behalf of  constituents. She loves her family and is a devoted wife and mother.   We will miss Sharon and the joy she had helping Alaskans. I wish her  the best in her future endeavors.                            ____________________
