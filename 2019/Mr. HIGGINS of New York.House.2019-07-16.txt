 Mr. Speaker, this week, for the first time  in a decade, the House will vote to increase the Federal minimum wage  to $15 an hour. This legislation is long overdue.   Most economists believe that our country is suffering from a crisis  of income inequality. It is virtually impossible for a working family  to get by, let alone get ahead, working a--or several minimum wage  jobs.   Instead of actually increasing wages, this President and our  Republican colleagues have showered the wealthiest with trillions in  tax cuts that will never have a meaningful impact on economic growth  and opportunity.   This Congress needs to promote the dignity of work, and that starts  with increasing the value of that work and paying Americans a fair  wage. And the economic security that a fair wage will provide gives  families the opportunity to participate in the economy and not struggle  in its shadows.   So as a matter of basic fairness and dignity, I urge my colleagues to  support the Raise the Wage Act.                            ____________________
