 Mr. Chair, I rise to offer amendment No. 49 as  the designee of Mr. Khanna.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to offer this  amendment with Representatives Khanna, DeFazio, Omar, and Pressley.   What this amendment would do is freeze fiscal year 2020 defense  spending in the NDAA to 2019 levels by reducing the overseas  contingency operations account by $16.8 billion.   Now, by restoring defense spending to the levels authorized in last  year's NDAA, this increase would be even more modest than the $700  billion top-line figure publicly embraced by the President just 9  months ago before he reversed course and requested an outrageous $750  billion.   Mr. Chair, just last year, the Department of Defense failed its first  ever agencywide audit, something that I have long called for, along  with my colleague Representative Burgess.   I want to thank Chairman Smith for including our bipartisan language  on audit readiness to ensure that the DOD is acting to address waste,  fraud, and abuse at the Pentagon and ensure that it has a plan in place  so it can pass an unqualified audit.   If the Department of Defense cannot even keep track of its current  funding, it is truly outrageous that Congress would reward the Pentagon  with a massive spending increase. This amendment is simply about  reining in the bloated Pentagon budget.   At the minute-by-minute level, American taxpayers are already  spending nearly $2 billion a day at the fiscal  [[Page H5644]]  2019 NDAA enacted levels this amendment seeks to cut funding to.   The $16.8 billion to the top-line funding level, what this amendment  would do would require the fund to fund 6.8 million Head Start slots  for 1 year, 1.63 million veterans receiving VA medical care for 1 year,  and providing 7 million low-income children healthcare for 1 year.   Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney called OCO a slush  fund and a sham when he served in Congress, and there is growing  bipartisan support urging Congress to significantly cut OCO. That is  why I urge ``yes'' on this critical amendment to rein in our out-of- control defense spending.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  DeFazio), my colleague.    Mr. Chairman, this is a modest approach that  would ensure that Congress doesn't reward the Pentagon with even more  money after it failed its first agency-wide audit last year.   Recent polling shows that a majority of the public does not want  defense spending increased. Nearly three-quarters of Americans would  not support more of their tax dollars going to the Pentagon.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this critical  amendment, and we must move forward and at least begin to control this  out-of-control defense spending and support this amendment. I ask for  an ``aye'' vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Amash for yielding me  time and for his leadership on this issue.   Let me also thank Chairman Smith for his tremendous leadership of the  committee and for working with us on this critical amendment, as well  as so many other amendments in this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Amash-Lee amendment to  the National Defense Authorization Act.   This amendment guarantees that persons arrested on U.S. soil under  the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force or provisions under  the 2012 NDAA will receive the due process that they deserve, as  required by the Constitution.   The 2012 NDAA codified worldwide detention authority that, as the  ACLU said at the time, ``violates the Constitution and international  law because it is not limited to people captured in an actual armed  conflict, as required by the laws of war.''   The Amash-Lee amendment would remedy that by repealing that provision  and ensuring that we remain consistent with our fundamental values.   Mr. Chairman, we should have no doubts that our Federal criminal  courts can handle international terrorism cases, and indeed they have.   The Department of Justice has charged, tried, and convicted more than  200 defendants for international terrorism crimes in these very Federal  courts.   That is why I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this critical  amendment. I, again, want to thank Representative Amash and Chairman  Smith for their leadership on this issue.    Madam Chair, it is up to Congress to prevent  another costly war in the Middle East. For too long, Congress has ceded  its responsibilities as a coequal branch of government when it comes to  matters of war and peace.   As The New York Times recently put it: ``It is long past time that  the legislative branch reclaimed its central role in overseeing war  waged in the name of the American people.''   Madam Chair, I thank Congressman Khanna for this amendment. He has  been persistent and very clear about our role in the areas of war and  peace, and it builds upon the amendment I got into the Defense  appropriations bill that indicated and said that nothing in the Defense  appropriations bill could be construed as authorization for the use of  force in Iran.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I thank our chairman of the Rules  Committee, Mr. McGovern, and I thank the chair of the Armed Services  Committee, Chairman Smith, for working with me and all of our members  on this amendment and for making this amendment in order.   Madam Chair, I am pleased to offer this amendment along with  Representatives Adam Schiff, Eliot Engel, Jason Crow,   John Lewis,  Seth Moulton, Max Rose, and many, many others.   Madam Chair, this amendment is straightforward; it is timely; and it  should be noncontroversial. It would immediately repeal the 2002  Authorization for the Use of Military Force against Iraq. Repeal of the  2002 AUMF would not impact any existing military operations because it  no longer serves an operational purpose.   Leaving the 2002 AUMF on the books runs the risk that it could be  utilized by the executive branch for military operations that Congress  never intended to authorize.   When Congress passed the 2002 AUMF prior to the invasion of Iraq, it  was intended to address the perceived threat posed by the regime of  Saddam Hussein as it related to the presence of weapons of mass  destruction. United States military deployments and operations carried  out pursuant to the 2002 AUMF, Operation Iraqi Freedom, officially  concluded in 2011.   Seventeen years after the resolution's passage, the United States  recognizes the sovereignty of Iraq and considers the Iraqi Government a  key ally.   Both the Obama and Trump administrations have maintained that the  2002 AUMF only serves to reinforce currently existing legal authority.  None of the counterterrorism operations being carried out in Iraq  independently depend on the 2002 AUMF for authorization.   For these reasons, the 2002 AUMF is outdated and should no longer be  on the books. Leaving it in effect risks abuse by this and any future  administration.   For example, the Trump administration has claimed that the 2002 AUMF  authorizes the use of force to address both ``threats to'' and  ``stemming from Iraq,'' and it authorizes force in ``Syria or  elsewhere.''   Expansive interpretations such as this demonstrate why we strongly  believe that the 2002 AUMF should be immediately repealed.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Armed  Services Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Crow), a veteran who served his country well and now  is serving this body well.    Madam Chair, how much time do I have  remaining?    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), an expert on national security.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, first, I thank our Rules  Committee chair, Mr. McGovern, as well as all the members of the  committee for making this amendment in order. And I also thank our  chairman, Mr. Smith, for working with us to bring this amendment  forward.   I am proud to offer this amendment with Representative Max Rose. It  is a very straightforward amendment. It simply expresses the sense of  Congress that the 2001 AUMF has been utilized well beyond the scope  than Congress intended, and that it is far past time for Congress to  reassert our constitutional mandated role in war making.   Our amendment also states that any new authorization should include  more specific provisions, including a sunset clause, clear and specific  expression of objectives, targets, and geographic scope.   Madam Chair, my amendment is not only necessary, but it is timely.  Right now, the Trump administration is threatening to use the 2001 AUMF  as a legal basis to go to war with Iran. This demonstrates the dangers  of leaving this authorization for the use of military force on the  books indefinitely.   The 2001 AUMF is only 60 words, and one of the only modern  authorizations  [[Page H5720]]  for the use of force that includes no limitations in time, geography,  operations, or a named enemy.   On September 14, 2001, 3 days after the horrific attacks, I was the  only ``no'' vote in Congress for the 2001 AUMF. It was an authorization  that I knew would provide a blank check for the President, any  President, to wage a war anywhere, any time, and for any length. In the  last 18 years, it has been used by three consecutive administrations to  wage war at any time, at any place, without congressional oversight or  authorization.   According to a 2018 Congressional Research Service report, which I  encourage all of my colleagues to read, the 2001 AUMF has, in fact,  become that blank check for war. In the almost 18 years since its  passage, it has been cited 41 times in 19 countries to wage war with  little or no congressional oversight. And this report only looks at  unclassified incidents. How many other times has it been used without  the knowledge of Congress or the American people?   The AUMF has reportedly been invoked to deploy troops in Syria,  Yemen, Somalia, Libya, and Niger. We know that this is far beyond what  Congress intended when it was passed in 2001 in the days after the  terrible attacks of 9/11.   That is why our amendment is so important. It is a sense of Congress  simply recognizing that this has been used well beyond what Congress  originally intended when it first passed in 2001; that Article I,  Section 8 of the Constitution provides Congress with the sole authority  to declare war; and that any new AUMF to replace the 2001 should  include a timeframe within which Congress should revisit the authority  provided in any AUMF, which many experts agree needs to be included in  any replacement AUMF.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Rose), my colleague, who serves on the  Homeland Security Committee and Veterans' Affairs Committee.                                time  2145
