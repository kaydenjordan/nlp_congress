 Madam Speaker, our neighbors and low-income households pay  three times more as a share of their income on energy bills than those  in higher income strata.   The fiscal year 2020 Energy and Water appropriations bill marks an  important step to reduce that energy burden for America's most  vulnerable people by increasing investments in the Department of Energy  Weatherization Assistance Program.   This program helps families make their home healthier and safer. It  promotes energy efficiency and reduces utility bills, which means more  money in the pockets of these families for healthcare, groceries, and  other basic expenses.   For each dollar the American people invest in the weatherization  program, we see an estimated $4.50 in energy and nonenergy benefits.  This additional funding will ensure that even more families are able to  experience the benefits of the program.   The Energy and Water bill also recognizes America's need for clean  energy innovation by significantly increasing funding for essential DOE  research programs, including the Office of Energy Efficiency and  Renewable Energy, the State Energy Program and ARPA-E.   The work done by DOE and State energy offices is absolutely critical  to accelerate our Nation's transition to a clean energy economy. This  bill recognizes the need for the United States to continue to be the  global leader in clean energy innovation, technology development, and  deployment.   I thank and express my gratitude to Chairwomen Lowey and Kaptur for  their leadership on these issues.                            ____________________
