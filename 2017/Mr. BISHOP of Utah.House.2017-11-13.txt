 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis) be permitted to take the oath of  office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.   The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from  Utah?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER. Will the Representative-elect and the members of the  Utah delegation present themselves in the well.   All Members will rise and the Representative-elect will please raise  his right hand.   Mr. CURTIS appeared at the bar of the House and took the oath of  office, as follows:         Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the       Constitution of the United States against all enemies,       foreign and domestic; that you will bear true faith and       allegiance to the same; that you take this obligation freely,       without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and       that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the       office on which you are about to enter, so help you God.    The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you are now a Member of the 115th  Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I hope you realize you just swore in  another vote for sage grouse.   Utah, for too long, has been at 75 percent. We are now united at a  full 100 percent, which means, Mr. Amodei, be  [[Page H9157]]  careful: we are going to reannex eastern Nevada.   Mr. Curtis comes here with a background of being mayor of Provo City,  so he understands local government. He is going to be a fine addition  to our body. I look forward to it.   As he has taken the place of Jason Chaffetz, he is going to be in Mr.  Chaffetz's office.   I just want you to know, as you are getting settled in and before you  find your proper bed, I think I can get you a good deal on a used cot.   I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis), our  new Representative.
