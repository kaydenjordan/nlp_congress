 Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate David  Branscum for being named Arkansas Rural Advocate of the Year by the  Arkansas Rural Development Commission.   Raised in Marshall, David is a third-generation cattle rancher,  farmer, and small business owner who has dedicated more than four  decades of his life to rural Arkansas. After graduating from the  University of Arkansas with a degree in agriculture and economics, he  returned home to run the family farm and lumber business. For 7 years,  David represented House District 83 as a member of the Arkansas House  of Representatives where he served on both the agriculture and health  committees and chaired the legislative council. In 2017, he resigned  from the House after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue appointed him  as Arkansas director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of  Rural Development.   In this role, David has implemented programs across the State  intended to improve the quality of life in Arkansas' rural communities.  These programs include rural business development grants, single and  multifamily housing loans, community facility grants, and water and  waste disposal monies.   One of David's top priorities and one of the largest challenges  facing Arkansas and much of rural America is access to reliable and  affordable broadband connectivity. With nearly $1 billion in grant  money available nationwide to expand broadband services to rural  communities, he has championed this program around our State.   I congratulate David for being named the Arkansas Rural Advocate of  the Year. He has spent his career working to advance the economy and  improve the standard of living for rural residents throughout Arkansas,  and our State is a better place because of him.                            ____________________
