 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my deep  concern and outrage that extreme Republicans are moving to cut  education through McCarthy's default on America act at the same time  that extreme Republicans are banning books in our libraries and  classrooms across our country.   Sadly, last semester alone, there were 1,477 instances of book  banning. Sadly, these efforts chill speech. They are part of a national  education scare, a campaign to foment anxiety and anger with the goal  of suppressing free expression in public education.   America is not Communist China or authoritarian Russia that ban books  or Nazi Germany that burns books. Indeed, Anne Frank's ``The Diary of a  Young Girl'' is now a banned book.   Over 70 percent of Americans oppose book bans. Americans know  education is about learning. It is not about censorship.   A country that does not know its history is bound to repeat it.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Burgess for yielding  me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today while we stand here debating this rule, the  Republicans' default on America's plan is holding Americans hostage.   Across my district and this country, Americans are wondering what  will happen to their food security. How about their Medicare? What  about veterans' healthcare? Republicans are holding us hostage so they  can protect the tax cuts that they gave to the wealthiest corporations  and millionaires.   We need to remember that the debt we are looking at today was  incurred by Republicans during the Trump administration, $7 trillion of  that.   Do you know what? If they crash the economy, it is not the  millionaires who would be hurt. It is working families.   The Republican default on America would impact the very bills we will  be talking about today. It would cut funding to fight the fentanyl  crisis, treat addiction, reduce pollution, and help Americans pay their  bills when a pandemic hits.   The rule we are considering today will make in order three bills.   The first bill is H.R. 467, the HALT Fentanyl Act. We all agree that  there is a scourge of fentanyl in our communities, and we all agree it  needs to be stopped. There is no district in our country, no family,  and no community that hasn't seen and experienced the horrors of  fentanyl.    The problem is that this bill isn't going to do what needs to be done  to address the fentanyl crisis. To fight the fentanyl crisis, we need  more law enforcement funding, and we need to treat addiction.   Right now, as noted, fentanyl-related substances are listed on  schedule I. That listing goes to the end of 2024. The main thrust of  this bill is to make that listing permanent, but our communities are  pleading with us to do more than the status quo.   For decades, we tried to incarcerate our way out of addiction, but  addiction is a disease, not a crime.   Madam Speaker, I am speaking from the heart. I know most of my  colleagues on this floor have heard that I lost two brothers to  addiction, two beautiful souls that were taken from this world far too  soon. It was partially because there was no treatment available.   This country has failed to treat addiction as the health crisis that  it is, so I know personally the pain that fentanyl brings to our  families and our communities because I felt that pain when my brothers  passed away.   Treatment for addiction can save precious lives, but we lack the  capacity to provide those services. Instead, the default on America  plan that their crisis is creating would cut funding for mental health  and addiction treatment services.   H.R. 467 would also expand mandatory minimums, which takes away  discretion from judges to look at each case on its own, which  disproportionately harms Black and Brown communities more than others.   Last night in the Rules Committee, Republicans rejected 37 Democratic  amendments that would have added more law enforcement funding to  interdict fentanyl at border crossings. They would have provided more  evidence-based approaches to fentanyl use. They would have made sure  that we had the tools we needed to treat addiction.   Instead of creating and finding solutions, Republicans are creating  more problems. The Republicans' default on America act will cut funding  for Customs and Border Protection, potentially leading to an increase  in the amount of fentanyl hitting our streets.   Is this their way of addressing the fentanyl crisis?   We need to do better. We need to make sure we give real solutions to  these very serious problems.   Madam Speaker, I am tired of hearing that Democrats are to blame for  the fentanyl crisis. We all recognize the need to do more.   Let me remind my colleagues that in the last 2 years, the Biden  administration has seized record amounts of illicit fentanyl at the  border.   DHS has seized more than 35,000 pounds of fentanyl in fiscal year  2022.   The Department of Justice disrupted or dismantled 130 fentanyl  networks.   The administration is expanding access to treatments for those  suffering from addictions.   Democrats in Congress filed a funding bill last year that beefed up  resources for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program, the  National Guard counter-drug program, and the Drug Communities Program.   Contrast that with the Trump administration. A GAO report blasted the  previous administration for failing to come up with a coherent national  opioid strategy, and the crisis spiked. In the first 2 years of the  Trump administration, we saw significant spikes in the fentanyl crisis,  and more people died.   According to the CDC, the annual number of overdose deaths from  synthetic opioids increased by 192 percent between 2016 and 2020.   In contrast, since day one of this administration, President Biden  has provided solutions to the overdose crisis.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the  December 2019 GAO report: ``The Office of National Drug Control Policy  Should Develop Key Planning Elements to Meet Statutory Requirements.''    Madam Speaker, this GAO report highlights the  failures of the last administration in addressing this crisis we are  talking about today.   The rule also makes in order two Congressional Review Act disapproval  resolutions.   H.J. Res. 45 would roll back the student loan payment pause to last  October. It would create chaos and instability for millions who are  living check to check.   Let's remember why student loans were paused in the first place.  Let's remember how dark and horrible it was when the pandemic first  hit.   Remember how scary it was when COVID-19 started and the economy was  in free fall? People lost their jobs. They were struggling to pay rent.  We didn't know what the future held.   A pause to student loan payments was the right response to a public  health emergency that was also a financial emergency. The payment pause  was a lifeline for 37 million borrowers and their families, giving them  much-needed breathing room to pay their bills, to pay their rent  without worrying about sabotaging their credit.   H.J. Res. 45 could send surprise bills for interest to tens of  millions of Americans. This could lead to unprecedented delinquencies  and defaults for the most vulnerable borrowers.   The third bill, S.J. Res. 11, would reverse an EPA rule that reduces  air pollution from the trucking industry.   Many parts of America were once cloaked in air pollution that would  sit  [[Page H2517]]  at street level, sting your eyes, fill your lungs. Choking air, they  called it.   In response, we enacted the Clean Air Act and tasked the EPA with  cleaning up our air.   Still, one in three Americans live in counties with unhealthy air  pollution. Heavy-duty vehicles make up about 6 percent of vehicles on  the road but generate 59 percent of these dangerous pollutants that we  are talking about. This contributes to respiratory illness,  cardiovascular problems, and even death.   The Clean Air Act gives the EPA both the authority and obligation to  protect Americans from air pollution that could endanger public health  or welfare. That is exactly what EPA's heavy-duty engine and vehicle  rule would do.   Republicans want to block the EPA rule from going into effect. Even  worse, if this passes, Republicans would block EPA from regulating this  pollution in the future.   Why would we want to keep this agency from doing its job of keeping  us healthy?                                time  1245    So instead of putting polluters first, Republicans should be spending  this week paying America's bills. It is the patriotic thing to do.  Clearly, that is not their priority. Remember, a default hurts working- class Americans. It hurts seniors on Medicare, food assistance  recipients, and teachers' and students' access to care. If you are  still waiting for your tax refund, it might not come.   Democrats have signed a petition to bring to the floor for a vote a  bill that would raise the debt ceiling without any harmful cuts to the  programs Americans rely on. All we need is five moderate Republicans to  join the petition and the default crisis would be over.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I agree that we need to address  the fentanyl crisis, but what we are saying is we need to do more. The  bill we are looking at today does not increase any funding for law  enforcement. It does not address the need that we have to increase our  funding to assist law enforcement in interdicting this horrible drug.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Madam Speaker, while my colleague speaks loudly  about stopping fentanyl at the border, I will remind him that this bill  doesn't do anything about fentanyl at the border. Indeed, the  Republicans in the Rules Committee last night rejected amendments which  would have placed more money on law enforcement and on the ability to  stop fentanyl at the border.   Madam Speaker, I remind them that the Cato report points out that  fentanyl is brought in at our ports of entry more than 90 percent of  the time.   Madam Speaker, I point out that if we defeat the previous question, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a  resolution, which states that it is the House's responsibility to  protect and preserve Social Security and Medicare for future  generations and reject any cuts to these essential programs.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Frost), who will discuss the need to  reassure the American people.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include  in the Record an October 2020 NPR article titled: ``Opioid Crisis:  Critics Say Trump Fumbled Response To Another Deadly Pandemic.''    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include  in the Record a Newsweek article titled: ``Fentanyl Surge Started and  Peaked Under Trump Despite GOP Blaming Biden.''    Mr. Speaker, I think that we need to bring back  to focus what we are doing here. This bill does something that we have  no objection to, which is to permanently classify fentanyl as schedule  I.   What we keep hearing on the other side, though, is about what more  needs to be done, but their bill doesn't do it. Democrats have bills  that would indeed increase law enforcement, that would indeed increase  treatment for addiction, that would indeed increase the ability for us  to research into these drugs and determine if there are possibilities  in this ground where we could  [[Page H2520]]  actually find antagonistic drugs that would help counter the overdose  that happens from them, but this bill doesn't do that.   Now, when they get up there and they start talking about the open  border, this is not what this bill is. This is not what this bill is.  This bill simply, as was pointed out last night, sort of codifies the  status quo.   Our communities want more. Democrats were willing to provide more. We  have introduced bills that do more, but they were rejected by the  Republicans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, yes, indeed, I agree that we need  to make sure that we address fentanyl for every community whether it be  New York or New Mexico, because the fentanyl crisis is a public health  crisis, and families are losing loved ones every day.   Indeed, in New Mexico in 2020, the New Mexico Department of Health  found that 65 percent of people with substance use disorders were not  getting the treatment they needed. The same problem we find nationwide.  Over 86 percent of people suffering from opioid abuse were not getting  the treatment they needed in 2020.   Even once treatment began, people are at their most vulnerable when  they suffer from a relapse. Their bodies cannot handle the sudden  return of high levels of opioids, and the result is often fatal.   I do hope that we can continue to agree that we must address this and  that we must provide an addition to this bill, the kind of funding that  is needed and that is urgent to treat addiction.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), my distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I think what we heard on the House  floor today was agreement, agreement on the need to address the scourge  of fentanyl and what it is doing to our communities. I think we heard  individuals talk about the individual pain they feel, whether it be in  Texas, in New York, in New Mexico.   I think we want to hold that sense of agreement on this topic  together because we don't always agree on things, but I think in this  instance, we agree that we need to put our families first. We need to  put the people who unwittingly end up dying from fentanyl with no idea  that they were even taking that drug, and we need to remember that pain  and that fear that those families must have.                                time  1315    As we talk about this issue, we must also remember that we have to do  more. Making sure that fentanyl is classified and is not available with  the fentanyl substances is important. We don't disagree on that. The  issue that we are raising is the need to do more, and especially given  the moment we are living in today.   This week, we are days away from a potential default because  Republicans have refused to raise the debt limit. We are in a crisis,  and it is a crisis that the Republicans have manufactured. We need to  remember what that crisis does. That crisis actually hinders our  ability to do the work that is so urgent to combat fentanyl.   Fentanyl comes in through our ports of entry. The Cato Institute,  which is not a liberal or progressive institute, notes that 90 percent  of fentanyl enters into the country through our ports of entry,  smuggled in by, what I would call, despicable Americans who profit off  addiction and death.   But let's go back and say what would happen if their default that  they have engineered would actually come to be. The Department of  Homeland Security has said that if the default in America act goes into  effect, it would lead to 2,400 fewer frontline CBP law enforcement  officers. That is 2,400 fewer Border Patrol officers. That means that  there are going to be fewer officers to help prevent illegal drugs from  entering into our country. That would lead to over 150,000 pounds of  cocaine and over 350,000 grams of fentanyl avoiding seizure.   The cuts that they have proposed would lead to more fentanyl coming  in because there would be fewer officers on the ground to combat it.  That is shameful that they would raise and talk about this bill in the  angry and loud ways that they have done without acknowledging that the  work that they did several weeks ago would actually make this crisis  worse.   In New Mexico, as I noted, we know the pain of addiction and overdose  all too well. We have lost too many beautiful lives to addiction and  fentanyl.   We need to think about what those solutions are that we would want to  do. We would want to increase the funding for substance abuse  prevention and treatment block grants. That was one of the amendments  that was suggested to this rule by Representative Balint.   We want to use Representative Blunt Rochester's amendment, which  would have increased education, so stakeholders would know about  research and treatment and how to make sure that we make the public  aware of these issues.   These are things that Republicans have refused to address in the  bills we are looking at today.   I urge my colleagues, I urge those on the other side of the aisle, to  really look at what we are doing today. We are doing something that we  all agree on, which is addressing a teeny-tiny piece of the fentanyl  problem, but we aren't doing what needs to be done in terms of  increasing law enforcement, in terms of increasing funding at our  borders and for those who are actually doing the work of seizing  fentanyl as it comes in, of the law enforcement that must be done. We  need to increase that funding, not cut it.   With regard to truck emissions, we cannot tie the EPA's hands. We  must keep our air clean. The number of deaths from asthma in children  who would survive and not be hurt if this rule goes into effect, would  be horrible. I need to tell you that each child who would not be able  to breathe because of polluted air is the child that I will think about  when I vote on this bill later today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
