 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Burke Wall, who passed away on March 1, 2021, at the age of 76.   Burke was a lifelong Georgian who graduated from the University of  Georgia with a degree in dairy production. Burke was an avid UGA  football fan and an active sportsman.   Burke was also an enthusiastic deep-sea fisherman aboard his boat  called Trashman, and his talents were recognized in numerous  tournaments along the East Coast.   In 2019, Burke won the Edisto Beach South Carolina Governor's Cup  Tournament and impressively put a 549-pound blue marlin on the dock at  the Mid-Atlantic 500 the same year, earning him second place.  [[Page H1589]]    Burke owned Superior Sanitation Services, sold that company to Waste  Management, and then founded Atlantic Waste Services in Pooler in 1999.   Although Burke grew up with humble beginnings on his family's dairy  farm, he lived a life of immense influence through his involvement with  the Chatham Club, the Rotary Club of Savannah, the Savannah Yacht Club,  and several other professional organizations.   My thoughts and prayers go out to all who knew him during this most  difficult time, especially his son, Ben.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, we are addressing a  problem that didn't even exist a week ago. It did not even exist last  week.   The Republicans stood on this floor and argued against the $1.9  trillion partisan package last week. There were many reasons to oppose  it, but one of the most significant reasons was the fact that the bill  would trigger cuts to Medicare and other essential programs.   We argued that it would harm all of our constituents. I argued that  it would harm my constituents in Georgia to my friend, my fellow  delegation member. This bill penalized the State of Georgia more than  any State in the United States. More than any State in the Nation,  Georgia was punished. We lost $1.3 billion because of the funding  formula. We didn't shut down our State, and we didn't destroy our  economy, and the funding was based on the unemployment rate and not  population.   Where did that $1.3 billion go? It went to blue States. It went to  California, and it went to New York. Georgian taxpayers' money went to  other States; it went to blue States.   What did it do to Medicare in the State of Georgia? We lost $11.5  billion that would have gone to the seniors on Medicare in the State of  Georgia.   Where did it go? Again, it went to California, and it went to New  York. It went to the blue States. It went to the States that shut down  their businesses and destroyed their economies. Yet, the bill was  pushed forward anyway.   This could have all been avoided altogether. We could have crafted a  bipartisan package that would not have triggered these Medicare cuts.  Instead, those across the aisle resorted to forcing a bill through  reconciliation. In the end, they passed a package filled with political  favors on the back of our seniors.   Again, this could have been avoided. But today, we need to fix this  for our constituents who are recognizing we have a spending problem.   Now that the largest stimulus bill in our history has been signed  into law, our deficit for the year will also break records. We are now  projected to have a Federal deficit of $3.4 trillion, and debt as a  share of our GDP will be at 100 percent for only the second time in our  country's history.   My colleagues have shown little regard for actually paying for this  reckless spending for political favor. That is why I urge my colleagues  to find a way to pay for restoring the cuts to Medicare. The first  place I suggest looking for it is in the over 90 percent of the last  package that will not go to addressing the pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, this is wrong, and my colleagues know it is wrong. Let's  get this fixed.
