 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition, but I agree with my  distinguished colleague from Florida that Congress has an obligation to  review it. Congress should not abdicate our responsibility. We should  ask the tough questions. Ultimately, we should provide the funding  necessary and the resources to win. That is our job, and I agree with  you 100 percent.   But as a commander, they are doing more than just guarding an  embassy. A force structure of 900 may seem like a large footprint, but  those of us who remember Black Hawk Down would suggest otherwise.   A force requires medevac. Those medevacs require people that service  those aircraft. In case we get in trouble, we need a quick reaction  force, a force large enough to defend our troops. I, like my  colleagues, know that if you were to put any American servicemen in  harm's way, you want to ensure we have the adequate force to make sure  they are recovered safely. They also have to be fed and have  communications. In order to have an effective force, you need a  footprint that can do its mission.   I also agree that we should have a plan. Before we unplug our  obligations, we should know what unplugging it does and when, and also  we should have a plan on what our obligations are.   So much of this discussion is a discussion among similar views. We do  have an obligation for freedom. We have a commitment to democracy that  when we provide a force to defend that democracy, and it is American  force and our allies, that we provide them with a force package that  can win.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this well-intended  resolution. I do ask that we work as a body to uphold our duty as  Congress to make sure that the authorizations we give the executive are  both appropriate, timely, and do so to win.
