 Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly condemn the recent forced  removal of Sudan's transitional government by Sudan's military forces.   Before the October coup by military leaders, Sudan's civilian-led  government was positively reengaging with the United States and the  rest of the world, including being removed from the State Sponsors of  Terrorism list and opening up the Sudanese economy for foreign  investment.   The Sudanese people have bravely stood up to demand the right to  democratically choose their own future after decades of oppression  under a previous regime. The Sudanese military must respect the rights  of the Sudanese people.   America must stand with those who want democracy, including the  people of Sudan. The U.S. and our allies must use every diplomatic tool  available to restore stability and civilian-led control of Sudan's  government.   Thousands of Sudanese civilians are risking their lives every day for  democracy, and the United States must align its policies to support  their democratic aspirations.                            ____________________
