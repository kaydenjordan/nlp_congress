 Mr. Speaker, as part of the Immigration Act of 1990,  the diversity visa lottery was established as a way to diversify the  United States. Over the past 28 years, the visa lottery has helped to  fortify the image of our country and enlarge the greatness of America  through the immigrant population. The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program  awards up to 50,000 visas each year that presents permanent residency  in the U.S. and serves as a pathway to citizenship.   The lottery has been imperative in creating new opportunities for  African and Caribbean individuals seeking citizenship in the U.S. The  proposed immigration bills today that will be coming to the floor aim  to limit refugee admissions, eliminate the diversity lottery, and  reduce the number of employment-based visas distributed each year.   As Americans begin many of the pastimes of summer that are  quintessentially American--baseball, backyard barbecues, and family  road trips--Caribbean Americans reflect on our contributions and the  melded culture in the United States through Caribbean American Heritage  Month. Ironically, the bills that are coming on the floor this same  month will end the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, which has allowed  many Caribbean people to come and be part of the American experience.   In a month of polarized politics and the Trump administration's  assault on increasing diversity in this Nation, Caribbean American  Heritage Month serves as a perfect counterpoint example to support the  doctrine of Americanism.   Congress and President George W. Bush adopted Caribbean American  Heritage Month in 2006. While the act establishing Caribbean American  Heritage Month emphasized the present influence of Caribbean Americans,  American history would not be complete without the integration and  support of the Caribbean people.   From America's founding to the present, Caribbean people have  supported and assisted in the creation of a collective American  identity: the articulation of this Nation's rightful place in the  world, its traditions, its language, and its cultural style.   From Alexander Hamilton, to American Revolution Haitian gens de  couleur libre--free men of color--fighting troops, to slave revolt  leader Denmark Vessey, to Colin Powell's shock and awe doctrine, the  Caribbean emphasis on revolutionary and righteous ideals enforced  through martial action have supported American ideals both at home and  abroad.   In today's culture, many are surprised by the placement of Americans  of Caribbean descent. They include former Attorney General Eric Holder  to iconic personalities like Lenny Kravitz and Beyonce; economic minds  such as Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic; to  actors Kerry Washington and Jada Pinkett Smith; to athletes Tim Duncan,  Mariano Rivera, and Carmelo Anthony; to journalist Joy Reid and U.S.  Senator Kamala Harris.   These scions of the Caribbean region are completely American, yet, in  many ways, their Caribbean heritage informs and accounts for the  attributes which have assisted them in their advancement and supported  American greatness.   That philosophy is borne out with recent immigrants and naturalized  Caribbean people. According to the Migration Policy Institute, Latin  American and Caribbean people account for the largest percent of  foreign-born military personnel, and that group constitutes 38 percent  of all foreign born that are in the Armed Forces.   Additionally, according to the 2014 U.S. Census Bureau Report, about  66 percent of Caribbean immigrants and immigrants overall were in the  civilian labor force, compared to 62 percent of the native born.   According to the Caribbean Policy Institute, Caribbean Blacks have  labor force participation rates that exceed the averages for U.S.  natives and all immigrants combined. The study from this institute has  shown that, collectively, Caribbean people have higher median income  earnings than all the immigrants in the U.S.   The proposed zero-tolerance immigration policy has resulted, as we  have seen, in thousands of children being torn apart from their  families. Children are being held in prolonged family detention  centers, and this bill eliminates protections that are in place to  ensure safe and basic living needs.   It is our duty to stop the separation of children. It is our duty to  see that America remains great through the diversity that it entails.  We cannot allow this bill to go forward, which would eliminate the  diversity lottery that has created the diverse American culture that we  have.   Through service, through ideals, and even through protests,  immigrants have made this a great nation.   President Trump issued a proclamation on May 31, 2018, which stated  that Caribbean American Heritage Month is a time in which America will  honor America's long-shared history with our  [[Page H5230]]  neighbors, but he would appear to be ignorant of the fact that it is  not a shared history. Our neighbor's history is our American history.                            ____________________
