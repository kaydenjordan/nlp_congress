 Madam Speaker, this past weekend, my  community of Buffalo, New York, was ravaged by an act of domestic  terror.   A white supremacist used a weapon of mass destruction to brutally  murder 10 Black people who were just going about their business at the  Tops Friendly Market on Jefferson Avenue. Three others were wounded.   The victims were ages 32 through 86. They were mothers and  grandmothers. They were fathers and grandfathers. They were young  adults. They were good people of faith, a retired teacher, and a  retired police officer.   This premeditated act was planned to be broadcast to the world on  social media showcasing this massacre as the playing out of a vile  racist fantasy.   I rise today with my colleagues to honor those who have been lost. To  honor them and to help heal our broken community, I urge all of my  colleagues to think about what we can do to fight hate.   We have the power, through our words and our votes, to promote  civility, tolerance, and kindness. And we have the choice to do better  and to work together to fight the evil that exists around us and  throughout the world.   Today, we bow our heads in silence, but tomorrow--tomorrow--we raise  our voices loudly against hate.
