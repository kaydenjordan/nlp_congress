 Madam Speaker, I am so pleased to be here today to  celebrate the 100th anniversary of women serving in Congress.   I thank the Speaker for allowing this legislation to come to the  floor. And I thank my good friend and former colleague, Secretary  Zinke, for authoring this legislation with me. His support has been  instrumental in ensuring the consideration of this bill, and I am  deeply grateful to him.   One hundred years ago, Jeannette Rankin was sworn in as a Member of  the United States House of Representatives. She was the first woman  elected to Congress, and was elected before passage of the 19th  amendment which granted women the right to vote.   Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer her entire life. In 1902, she  graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in biology.  Afterward, she became active in the women's suffrage movement, moving  to New York City and assisting in the founding of the New York Women's  Suffrage Party and working for the National American Woman Suffrage  Association.   Rankin would eventually return to her home State of Montana, and was  elected to office in the congressional election of 1916. Upon winning,  she declared: ``I may be the first woman Member of Congress, but I  won't be the last.''   I am happy to say that she was right.   In recognition of Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin's many  accomplishments, and in celebration of the centennial anniversary of  her service in Congress, Secretary Zinke and I introduced the 100 Years  of Women in Congress Act.   Because Jeannette Rankin was a woman of science more than 100 years  before our current push to have more women enter STEM fields, we felt  it appropriate to rename the Department of Agriculture's Women and  Minorities in STEM Fields Program after her.   This program currently supports collaborative research projects at  institutions of higher education, and seeks to increase the  participation of women and minorities from rural areas in STEM fields.  It will continue to do so in the future, but now it will also recognize  the many contributions Jeannette Rankin made to American life.   Madam Speaker, thank you again for allowing this legislation to the  floor today, and thank you again to Secretary Zinke for partnering with  me on it.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.   Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 382, the 100 Years of Women in Congress  Act.   This bipartisan legislation will recognize the work that Jeannette  Rankin, the first woman elected to Congress in 1916, accomplished  fighting for women's rights. It will rename the USDA's Women and  Minorities in STEM Fields Program to the Jeannette Rankin Women and  Minorities in STEM Fields Grant Program. In our time, it is critical  that we encourage more women to enter STEM fields across this country.  In receiving a bachelor's degree in biology before women even had the  right to vote, she set an example for those who followed her to follow  their passions for science and to achieve impactful leadership roles.   As I travel through Delaware, one of the consistent messages that I  hear from businesses and universities is the need for more engineers.  We have a wealth of knowledge in our young girls who are demanding  rigorous programs that put them in place for rewarding careers. These  types of programs match the boundless enthusiasm with concrete steps  towards achieving meaningful career goals that benefit our entire  country.   My sister, Thea, demonstrates the impact of successful STEM education  from organizations like the Forum to Advance Minority Engineers--FAME-- for schoolchildren in Delaware, to her attending an HBCU as an  engineering major, and in her career spent serving our country as an  engineer with the Army.   My late husband Charles received undergraduate and graduate degrees  in mechanical and aerospace engineering. Those degrees gave him the  opportunity to travel the world as an engineer and give back to the  energy sector.   However, my family and I know that the answer doesn't simply end with  STEM. It is also about incorporating the arts into one's education in  the form of STEAM, where we can see the balance that a quality  education provides.   In my experiences, as the first woman elected to Congress from  Delaware, I understand the challenges that come with trying to break  through barriers. That is why this legislation and the impact of  getting more young women to pursue STEM and STEAM careers is so deeply  personal to me.  [[Page H2210]]    As Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin said before taking her oath of  office in 1917--nearly 4 years before women had even gained the right  to vote through the 19th Amendment--as you heard before, she said: ``I  may be the first woman to be a Member of Congress, but I won't be the  last.''   I am honored to serve as one of the more than 300 women to follow her  lead. When we look to history to guide us in challenging moments, we  will look to people like Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin, and I am  confident she would be honored to have her name associated with this  legislation and its aims.   I thank the sponsors, and I thank my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle for this bipartisan work.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   I would be remiss if I didn't thank my colleague, who I was sworn in  with in January of 2013 when she raised her right hand, as I did, on  this floor to join this great institution, my colleague, Grace Meng,  for being the sponsor of this piece of legislation. I thank Grace for  her leadership, and also Ms. Blunt Rochester, the first woman elected  to serve in this institution from the State of Delaware. It is humbling  and an honor for me to be able to stand here and help manage this piece  of legislation. She should be very proud of what she is doing today.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in support of this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speaker, I urge all Members as well to  support passage of H.R. 382, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 382.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
