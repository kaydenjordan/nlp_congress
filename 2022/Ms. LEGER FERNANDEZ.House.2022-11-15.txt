 Madam Speaker, today, I rise for students.  Today, I rise for teachers and doctors. Today, I rise for nurses. I  rise for those who care for our youngest and those who care for our  elderly and disabled.   Today, I rise and ask for bipartisan support for the Dream and  Promise Act. I rise for those who have been in our country and have  contributed so much.   I rise for our economy because we know that the Dreamers, if we lose  them, we lose half a trillion dollars of economic benefit for our  country.   If we lose our Dreamers, our labor force will be decimated because we  rely and depend on them. They pay $5.6 billion in Federal taxes and  $3.1 billion in State and local taxes each year.   If the Senate does not take action and pass the Dream and Promise  Act, we will lose our Dreamers and all that they contribute to our  United States of America, which we love.   Madam Speaker, I ask for everyone to reach out to their Senators and  encourage them to support those who have given so much to our country.                            ____________________
