 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important and urgent activity that we are on  this morning. Now, my Republican friends talked about this, but they  did the identical, same thing in 2017 with President Trump's tax cuts.  What is good for my friends is also good for us. That is the way the  rules are.   Mr. Speaker, let me tell you how devastating the damage would be if  we do not act. First of all, it will cut $29 billion from badly needed  programs, and no entity will be impacted and devastated like  agriculture. They will cut $29 billion and cut our programs for energy  efficiency and rural development.   We are working on that together. This bill will save our rural  development, research, specialty crop development, and beginning and  veteran farmer development.   Out of the $29 billion, it will take $23 billion out of our Commodity  Credit Corporation, limiting our ability to make payments to our  farmers and food producers at this critical time when we are in a  hunger crisis.   Mr. Speaker, you must understand, we Democrats and Republicans need  to send a powerful message to the Nation on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, let us move hand in hand  together at this serious time.   Now, when my friends used this, it was for the tax cut, most of which  went to the wealthy. But this $23 billion cut to our CCC will devastate  the American people where it hurts the most: their food, their water,  their shelter, and their clothing. We must not do that.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join us.
