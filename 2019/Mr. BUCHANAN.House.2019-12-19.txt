 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. I want to say up front, I am so excited  about this bipartisan effort, that is going to make a big difference  for American workers.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank our leaders on our committee: Leader  Brady, Chairman Neal, Chairman Blumenauer. I want to thank all of them,  because this has been a team effort. It is exciting to see that once in  a while.   What the House passes today will bring us one step closer to finally  modernizing and balancing the 25-year-old North American Free Trade  Agreement, which supports nearly $1.3 trillion in economic activity and  more than 12 million American jobs.   Passing USMCA will update the United States' critical trading  relationships with our North American neighbors into the 21st century,  a high-standard deal that benefits American workers, businesses, and  the economy.                                time  1100    In fact, according to the independent International Trade Commission,  USMCA will boost our economy by $68 billion and create an additional  175,000 new jobs.   International trade is critical to my home State of Florida, where we  export more than $12 billion worth of goods and services to Canada and  Mexico, supporting more than 700,000 jobs.   Leveling the playing field for Florida and the country, as well as  increasing access to our foreign markets, is critical to growing the  U.S. economy and creating good-paying jobs.   Florida has 15 deepwater seaports, including Port Manatee in my  district. Florida exports tens of billions of dollars in goods and  services annually and adds more than $100 billion in economic value to  our State.   I also congratulate President Trump because this is something for the  last 3 or 4 years he has been very passionate about, and Ambassador  Lighthizer because, without him and his effort, I am not sure we would  be here today.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this landmark trade agreement.
