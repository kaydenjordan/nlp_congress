 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  155th anniversary of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the  United States of America. Passed by the House of Representatives on  January 31, 1865, the 13th Amendment was ratified and put into effect  on December 6, 1865.   Section 1 of the 13th Amendment states, ``Neither slavery nor  involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the  party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United  States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.''   This amendment is what allows Black people the legal status to be  free, unbound, and unchained here in our country. If this amendment  were not in place, we would still be slaves and subject to the forced  subjugation of others. Before the ratification of this amendment, Black  people in the U.S. were enslaved and owned by other people. Now, we are  owned by no one.   This legacy in the U.S., this original sin, is recognized as an  abomination to mankind. As I travel throughout the world, I am reminded  of the greatness of our nation, but I am also intensely aware of the  faults, shortcomings, and injustices that still plague us today. It is  a sad reflection on our society that we are still fighting for complete  and pure freedom in our country, to share in the fundamental rights  guaranteed by our constitution to every person.   It is without question that we love this country and for most people,  know no other place to call home. We have struggled, fought, and even  died along the path to freedom. Our very existence has been met with  severe hardships. No one today can imagine the horrors that slaves were  subjected to daily.   However, there are those who, even today, say that slavery for Black  people was a good thing and a blessing in disguise. This errant view is  void of reality and ridiculous on its face.   The evils of slavery are too many to comprehensively and adequately  express. There are thousands of helpless people who were bound,  shackled, whipped, quartered, hung, burned and endured unspeakable  horrors whose stories will never be told.   The lasting effects of slavery permeate many aspects of society  today. Institutionalized racism, discrimination and prejudices are each  lasting remnants of our history and are present with us even now. Our  challenge is to continue to fight to wipe out these insidious vestiges  of a time long passed and a gruesome period of every day American life.   Our nation will be forever stained with the blood of slavery. Our  nation will be forever blessed by the freedom and liberty that the  ratification of the 13th Amendment brings. Let us continue the never  ending fight for freedom as we move towards prosperity for everyone.   While the 13th Amendment legally ended slavery in the United States,  we know that for many it did not end in 1865. Thousands of Black people  were either uninformed of their liberty or just outright denied their  rights to be free. They were forced into continued servitude and  grueling work to support the needs of their owners and masters. In  Texas, word of freedom and liberation from the slave owners and masters  of plantations and farms did not reach Black people until a whole two  years later.   Slavery in the United States was not just a way of life, but an  oppressive institution that was designed to profit off of the free  labor of Black folk. It was extremely prosperous. It is without  question that our nation was built on the backs of Black people who  continuously suffered the indignities, degradation and humiliation of  being enslaved.   We cannot afford to rest, sleep or be caught off guard. Even though  the 13th Amendment is in place, it does not mean that it cannot be  changed. All we truly have to do is look at the last administration and  its constant attacks on the freedom of people in the U.S. and its  attacks on our democratic institutions. Our freedom must be protected.   Please allow me to briefly turn my attention to the relationship  between the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments. The 13th, 14th, and 15th  Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, proposed after the Civil War,  granted enslaved Black people freedom, citizenship, and the right to  vote. The 15th Amendment declared that the right of U.S. citizens to  vote could ``not be abridged or denied'' by any state'' on account of  race, color, or previous condition of servitude.'' These rights are  still being attacked by those who would deny all people of color  freedom, citizenship and the fundamental right to vote. The third and  final Amendment during the Reconstruction Era--was adopted to protect  the freedoms outlined in the 13th and 14th Amendments. Make no  mistake--Reconstruction for Black people was devastating and a gross  erosion of rights that were supposed to be guaranteed.   Mr. Speaker, our country is no longer divided between free states and  slave states. We are now one. While we take this time to recognize and  celebrate this critical benchmark in the history of our country, we  must continue to fight to be the land of the free.                            ____________________
