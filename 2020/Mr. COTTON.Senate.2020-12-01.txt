 Madam President, the Senate has just voted to conclude  debate on the nomination of Kyle Hauptman to be on the Board of the  National Credit Union Administration, and we will soon vote to confirm  Mr. Hauptman to the administration.   This is a very happy moment, of course, for Kyle and his family and  the country. For me, I have to confess it is something of a bittersweet  moment. That is because Kyle is not only a nominee to a Federal Board.  Mind you, he is my trusted economic adviser; he is the staff director  for me on the Economic Policy Subcommittee of the Senate Banking  Committee; and he is a good friend.   So while I voted to confirm Kyle with enthusiasm, my enthusiasm is  mixed with sadness to see a close and trusted aide go. But my loss will  be America's gain. The NCUA, American taxpayers, and millions of people  who rely on credit unions will be well served by Kyle, who brings to  the job a collegial spirit and rare knowledge of financial markets.   Kyle's expertise comes from years of work for the bipartisan SEC  Advisory Committee and on Wall Street itself, where he focused on the  very same money markets where credit unions obtain their financing.  Lest anyone think that Kyle doesn't understand what struggling American  families can face, as an analyst on the Asia desk at Lehman Brothers,  Kyle lost his job and his savings during the financial crisis, which  means he has a deep and gut-level understanding about how decisions  made by bankers and bureaucrats at the top can have serious  consequences for everyone else.   Kyle has put this knowledge of the banking system and its  implications to excellent use as my top aide. He has provided  invaluable counsel and shepherded legislation through Congress on  topics as wide-ranging as money laundering, consumer fraud, and  blockchain technology. In fact, I have high hopes that an anti-money  laundering bill on which Kyle and I worked for months, the ILLICIT CASH  Act, will pass this Congress before the year is through.   That is not all Kyle has accomplished. As a top committee aide, he  has worked diligently to plan hearings and broker compromises with  other Senators' staff. As anyone who knows Kyle can attest, he is a  friendly and fast-talking guy, always ready with a joke and a smile,  and his congeniality has helped smooth over many partisan spats so that  the business of the American people can move forward.   As important, Kyle has served as a valuable liaison between me and  credit unions in Arkansas and the surrounding States. Though most  credit unions in Arkansas are very small, with maybe millions of  dollars under management--not billions of dollars--what our credit  unions lack in size they make up for in their mission. They exist not  for profit but to serve their members by keeping their money safe and  providing credit at reasonable rates of return.   So while our credit unions may not always manage vast fortunes, they  do manage vast dreams. They safeguard the savings and extend  opportunity to a customer base in Arkansas that looks an awful lot like  the rest of America--senior citizens who have used the same banks for  decades, for instance, or young families building a foundation for a  better life.   Kyle is very well acquainted with these credit unions from his work  for me in the Banking Committee, but you don't have to take my word for  it. Just listen to the Arkansas Credit Union Association, which  submitted a letter in support of Kyle's nomination. I will quote from  it here at length. This is from the group's executive director:         On behalf of the Arkansas Credit Union Association, I'll       say that we probably feel the same way you do--that he'll be       difficult to replace yet the NCUA is lucky to have him.        I've gone to Washington for a couple decades now on behalf       of Arkansas credit unions, most of which are very small,       rural institutions. Our largest credit union has just over $1       billion in assets, which would be considered small even by       community-bank standards. The rest are much smaller, where       you can count on one hand the number of ATMs they have. While       advocating for these community-based lenders, I've       encountered a lot of Congressional staffers. Kyle is the best       I've dealt with.        Given his background at large, international finance firms,       you might think Kyle wouldn't understand the needs of our       members, who are mostly low- or moderate-income families. Yet       it's quite the opposite: he has gone above and beyond to       listen, respond quickly and empathize with our concerns. His       knowledge of financial markets is an asset, not a liability.        I'm aware that NCUA board members aren't like Senate       staffers; I'll no longer be a constituent but rather someone       working for the institutions Kyle will be regulating. But I       think you'll agree that he'll continue to be fair,       professional and serious about his work.    I can tell you I very much do agree with every word of that letter  and similar letters we have received about Kyle and his work on behalf  of Arkansans.   Washington can sometimes be a confusing place, so Kyle's assistance  keeping Arkansans in the loop has been a great blessing to many of the  people we serve. I remember the countless emails from small business  owners praising Kyle for his help in understanding and receiving  assistance through the CARES Act in March, April, and May, at the  height of the danger and the uncertainty about the coronavirus  pandemic.   That was all Kyle, and I am confident he will bring the same customer  service mentality to his work at the NCUA. That is because Kyle, like  the credit unions he will regulate, is driven by a sense of mission: to  help his fellow Americans achieve their financial goals and the  American dream. That dream is based on freedom.   Alongside his hero, the great apostle of opportunity, Jack Kemp, Kyle  knows ``there are no limits to what free men and women and free  enterprise in a free society can accomplish when [men and women] are  free to follow their dream.''   Credit unions allow millions of Americans to follow their dreams. So  while I am sad to say farewell to Kyle as a trusted aide, I will take  consolation in the fact that he is going to serve our fellow Americans  in the cause of freedom, and I know that he will serve them well. Thank  you, Kyle, and Godspeed.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and honor MAJ  Brian Leitzke for his dedicated service in the U.S. Air Force and his  completion of the Air Force Legislative Defense Fellowship with my  office. Major Leitzke joined my office in January of this year, where  he served as my Defense Fellow. Previously, he served as an Air Force  Fellow in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. As a Defense Fellow,  Major Leitzke demonstrated a superior work ethic and tireless  dedication to his legislative duties, making him a trusted voice and  integral member of my defense team. Major Leitzke drafted or coauthored  almost 40 pieces of legislation, including $45.2 billion in  authorizations for the National Defense Authorization Act and the CARES  Act. Additionally, he prepared for 28 hearings of the Senate Armed  Services Committee and orchestrated  [[Page S7137]]  more than 30 engagements between Department of Defense principals,  staff, and Members of Congress. Finally, he single-handedly championed  the bill which granted Sergeant First Class Alwyn C. Cashe the  President of the United States Medal of Honor Authority. As part of  this effort, he galvanized bicameral, bipartisan support across 12  Member offices.   Brian is a humble professional, relentlessly focused on accomplishing  tremendous work for our nation, as demonstrated both in my office and  during his time in the Air Force. Prior to his current status as a  Defense Fellow, Major Leitzke was an F-15E instructor at the USAF  Weapons School, embracing the task of teaching the Air Force's best  tacticians. There, he served as the wing weapons officer and was  selected Wing Instructor of the Year. He had a career of continuous  flying until this assignment, with combat experience in Operation  ENDURING FREEDOM, and well over 500 instructor hours. He recently  completed an Air University master's with ``Highest Academic  Distinction'' and achieved a 4.0 grade point average. Major Leitzke  demonstrated tactical acumen and extraordinary leadership ability in  each of these challenges, including his time in the Senate.   On behalf of the U.S. Senate and a grateful nation, I want to express  our thanks to Major Letizke for his dedicated service to the U.S. Air  Force, the U.S. Senate, Arkansans, and all Americans. My office has  benefited greatly from his tireless efforts and leadership. I have no  doubt the U.S. Air Force will continue to reap the benefits from this  truly dedicated American. As I thank Major Leitzke for his service, I  also thank his wonderful family, which has remained by his side for his  years of military service. Major Leitzke resides in Woodbridge, VA,  with his loving wife, Amanda Leitzke, and three children, Lincoln,  Faith, and Kamali. It has been a great privilege to work with Major  Leitzke, and I wish him the best of luck on his next assignment. Thank  you for everything Major Brian ``Bud'' Leitzke. Continue your work  doing ``Good things for America.'' ``Banzai!''                            ____________________
