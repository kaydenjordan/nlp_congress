 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1635.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak today in support of H.R. 1635, the  Empowering Students Through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act, which I  introduced earlier this Congress with my friend, Congresswoman Suzanne  Bonamici of Oregon.   As the school year begins, high school seniors across the country are  trying to figure out their next steps. Many of these students will  ultimately decide to attend a traditional 4-year university or  community college program.   Parents and students know too well that the cost of college tuition  has climbed dramatically over the last decade. I know that many  families are worried about how to afford a college education. As  college tuition has risen, student loan debt has surged to more than  $1.4 trillion, surpassing both national auto loan debt and credit card  debt.                                time  1430    This should be a concern to everyone, not only to those with loan  debt to their names. Many borrowers are entering the workforce with  overwhelming debt that will play a role not only in their own lives,  but in the health of the American economy as a whole.   Student loans can, of course, play a positive role in helping  students attend college when they borrow mindfully and responsibly.  Unfortunately, many students enter into binding loan contracts with  their respective universities without fully appreciating the gravity of  the financial decision they are making and the consequences it can have  on their futures.   A recent survey of current students and new graduates with a high  level of debt found that more than 40 percent had no recollection of  having received financial counseling, even though current law requires  that students receive entrance counseling before receiving their first  loan.   It is vitally important for students to be equipped with all the  facts of their loan agreement so they can finance their postsecondary  education responsibly and with eyes wide open. The Empowering Students  Through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act is designed to improve  financial aid counseling for students receiving a Pell grant or a  Federal loan. H.R. 1635 increases the timing, frequency, and content of  mandatory student loan counseling.   Under current law, borrowers are required to receive counseling only  when they arrive on campus and upon graduation, which makes it easy for  borrowers to lose sight of just how much debt they are acquiring each  year and the responsibility they bear to pay it back. H.R. 1635  requires financial counseling for students and parents who participate  in Federal loan programs before they sign the dotted line on their  loans. After that, students would participate in annual counseling so  they can continue to understand their financial obligations and how new  loans would affect their payments later on.   The importance of annually providing information was dramatically  reinforced in a recent year when Indiana University reported they were  able to reduce undergraduate Stafford loan disbursements by 11  percent--11 percent--or $31 million, by telling students annually what  their monthly payment would be after graduation before the students  took out loans for the next school year. This was more than a fivefold  decrease in outlays compared to public schools nationally.   In addition to making the counseling an annual event, this bill would  require the counseling to include recommendations to students to pursue  all available grant, work study, and scholarship assistance prior to  taking out loans, as well as provide them with information about the  differences between Federal and private loans in bankruptcy. Exit  counseling would include information about the borrower's remaining  loan balance as well as what to anticipate throughout repayment of the  loan.   The legislation would also require borrowers to affirmatively provide  consent each year before receiving additional Federal loans instead of  automatically receiving the full offered amount every year.   The bill also equips low-income students with enhanced information  about the terms and conditions of the Pell Grant Program by providing  annual financial counseling to all grant recipients. The counseling  will include information about the expenses the grant  [[Page H7851]]  covers, the level of assistance the students are able to receive, and  ways to seek additional assistance in the case of changing financial  circumstances. Under current law, Pell grant recipients are not  required to receive any counseling.   This bipartisan legislation will help America's students and families  borrow responsibly and understand their aid package better so that new  graduates have the very best chance of success upon graduation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the chairwoman of the full committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), my good friend from the eastern part of the great  State of Tennessee and the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Ferguson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg), my good friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen), my good friend.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this is important. It is a first step, but it is a big  step and an important step as we look at what is going on in the cost  of our higher education.   Mr. Chairman, I know that, in our beloved Commonwealth, our Governor  and our legislators are trying to deal with the demands on the budget,  and they are working hard on it. But in the meantime, the costs to go  to school in our Commonwealth and across the country have increased.  Students have to rely more on Federal subsidized loans and Pell grants.   We hear stories, like the one that Dr. Roe talked about, of people  leaving professional school with a six-figure debt. But we hear about  an awful lot of people who have $6,000, $7,000, and $10,000 worth of  debt. They have to drop out, and they have no degree, and they have a  hard time paying it back.    This bill lays out, through the course of their time in school, for  each year, what their payments will be, and it walks them through what  they really need. Do they need to take out the full loan?   Back when colleges weren't that expensive, I remember people saying:  Take out the full loan; that is the cheapest money you will ever have.  Well, it becomes the most expensive money you have ever had over time,  as interest rates build up and other things move forward.   This bill is to make sure students are aware. It is something we  agree on. We do it bipartisan. I expect a big bipartisan vote, and we  do work together. There are issues that we have differences of opinion  on, and there are issues that we have similar opinions on.   When I was home in my State in August, people would say: Can't you  find things to work together on? And we do, as a matter of fact, on  most of the things we do. It is just not what tends to get out into the  news.   So I appreciate the hard work of my friend from Oregon, and I  appreciate the hard work of our committee.   Mr. Chair, I urge the passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment, but I do not intend to oppose it.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment will provide borrowers with  critical information on aggregate loan limits, which is particularly  important for transfer students, as my friend just explained. This  disclosure will encourage borrowers to thoughtfully plan their college  expenses and will help students make informed decisions when  transferring schools.   I thank my colleague for offering this amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to support it and the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment, but I do not intend to oppose it.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment will help students see an  estimated monthly student loan payment broken down by all income-driven  repayment plans for which the student is eligible.   I support this amendment because students need to see the full range  of possibilities available to them so they can make informed choices  about what they borrow and how they will repay the funds.   I thank my colleague for offering the amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to support it and the underlying bill.  [[Page H7858]]    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise to claim the time in opposition to  this amendment, but I do not intend to oppose it.    Madam Chair, this proposal will make sure students are  warned about third-party debt relief companies that prey on borrowers.   They frequently provide inaccurate or misleading information and  often charge excessive fees for services that can be received without  cost through federally contracted student loan servicers. As my friend  said, Federal student loan servicers employ dedicated professionals  equipped to help borrowers navigate the loan repayment process and  provide the assistance they need free of charge.   This amendment will ensure borrowers are armed with the information  they need to better protect their finances and help make wise decisions  as they begin to repay their Federal student loans.   I thank my friend from Washington for offering this amendment, and I  urge my colleagues to support it and the underlying bill.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here. We  all support veterans.   Under this bill, every veteran receives the same enhanced counseling  provided to all borrowers. Looking at the study and before we determine  the right elements of a new study to ensure we are providing the best  service, we should pause and, I suggest, work with our Veterans'  Affairs Committee to make sure we address the totality of the issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the underlying bill's support. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit and support the  final bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
