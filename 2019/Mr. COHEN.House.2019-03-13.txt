 Mr. Speaker, today I learned that John Kilzer, a friend,  an important figure in Memphis and in the music community, passed away.   John Kilzer was 62 years old. He was born in Jackson, Tennessee, up  the road from Memphis, but he lived most of his life in Memphis.   He was the epitome of what Memphis is about. A lot of times people in  Memphis call us grit and grinders, and the city is the city of grit and  grind. It comes from the basketball team, the Grizzlies.   John's life was Memphis and John's life was grit and grind. He was a  high school All-American basketball player who went to the University  of Memphis, then Memphis State, and played basketball. Didn't play it  that well, but he played it. He was on the team; a good outside shooter  and a scrapper.   He got interested in other things and he had some demons with him  too. Those demons came along maybe from his father, who was an  alcoholic, and it caused John to have problems with abuse of drugs and  alcohol as well. It interfered with his basketball career, interfered  with his music life, but he never let it keep him down. He came back.  He came back every chance he could.   He came back as a musician who was signed by David Geffen, had two  albums by Geffen, one song that made the top ten, and songs recorded by  Maria Muldaur, Rosanne Cash, and others.   He became a minister and he had a series of ministries in St. John's  United Methodist Church in Memphis. It was called Recovery Ministry,  where he had other musicians come and join him, and they performed for  folks who were having trouble with addiction, gave them a concert every  Friday and helped them on the road to recovery.   He never forgot people, especially little people. He made a big  difference.   For a man from Jackson, Tennessee, who was a tall guy who played  basketball, to become a musician and become a minister and a writer:  quite a life.   He was influenced by Reverend James Lawson, a hero of the civil  rights movement, whose simple presence at a Calvary Church Lenten  service influenced John to get back into ministry.   He had a ministry degree and a Ph.D. in ministry as well that he got  in London, England.   He was influenced in music--which he dabbled with but wasn't very  good--by Teenie Hodges, a guitarist for Al Green. He came over to see  the basketball team and saw a guitar in John's room. He took up with  John and taught him the finer points of music, songwriting, and guitar  playing, and John did good at that, but what John did best was helping  his fellow human being.   He never gave up. He always saw hope and opportunity. And he thought  in universal terms.   So when I read about my friend, John, dying, the first thing I did  was go around to try to find his CD in my condo. Most of my CDs are in  Memphis, about 1,000 to 1, but I looked around and couldn't find John's  CD. It must be in Memphis.   So I thought, maybe I can talk to my friend Alexa, see if Alexa can  help me. I said, ``Alexa, play me some John Kilzer.'' And Amazon Music  had John Kilzer, about eight or nine songs in there, including a song  he wrote with Kirk Whalum, a great saxophonist and a legend in Memphis  and in the music scene, called ``Until We're All Free''. We are not all  free until we are all free. It is a great song.   So if you have a chance, if you have got Alexa as a friend, ask her  to play you some John Kilzer. It is good music.                            ____________________
