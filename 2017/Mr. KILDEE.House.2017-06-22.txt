 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, in my hometown of Flint,  Michigan, there was a violent attack on a police officer at Flint  Bishop International Airport. And like many in my community, I am  shocked and horrified by this cowardly attack.   My thoughts are with injured officer, Lieutenant Jeff Neville, and  his family; and I am relieved that he is in stable condition. He is  expected to recover. I have known Jeff for decades, dating back to our  service together in county government. He is a true public servant, and  he is deeply committed to the community that he serves.   His actions to subdue the attacker, even while he was under attack,  are truly heroic. He helped save others from potential harm.   I also want to thank those individuals who put themselves in harm's  way to help Lieutenant Neville, including the Bishop chief of police,  Chris Miller, and an airport maintenance worker who stepped in, Richard  Cruell. Their actions saved lives.   I am thankful that the FBI, the Michigan State Police, the Flint  Police, and other agencies are investigating this terrible attack as a  potential incident of terror.   I just hope all my colleagues will join me in extending their prayers  to Lieutenant Neville and his family in hopes for his speedy recovery.                            ____________________
