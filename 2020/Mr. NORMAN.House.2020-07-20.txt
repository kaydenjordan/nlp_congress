 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment on the  Department of Energy Veterans' Health Initiative.   This amendment authorizes the Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct  collaborative research with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to  solve complex, big data challenges in order to improve veterans' health  care and further basic research in advanced computing and data  analytics.   The VA hosts one of the world's largest and most valuable health data  sets. Through the Million Veterans program (MVP), the VA has collected  detailed health information and genomic data volunteered by over  600,000 veterans.   For this data to enable better health care for our veterans, the VA  needs more advanced computing capabilities, infrastructure, and  expertise than it has in-house.   As a world leader in high performance computing, the Department of  Energy is well suited to meet this need. Through its national  laboratory system, it possesses a unique set of cutting-edge research  capabilities and funds robust research in data analytics, which can be  used to solve complex questions in the physical sciences.   The interagency partnership authorized in my amendment combines the  VA's clinical and population science expertise with DOE's advanced  computing to solve critical health challenges for our veterans, while  creating another path forward for the advancement of data science tools  for American researchers in support of key mission goals for the  Department of Energy.   Our veterans should have access to better health care services, and  our scientists should remain leaders in advanced computing. My  amendment promises to deliver on both fronts.   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.
