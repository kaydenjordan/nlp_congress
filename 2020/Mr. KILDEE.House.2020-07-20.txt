 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for yielding and for  his leadership, along with Representative Lee, on this issue.   If only it were true that no servicemembers or no veterans were taken  advantage of, were never put into a junk program by one of these  organizations. If only that were true. But we know it is not, and this  legislation intends to address that.   The GI Bill loophole is real. It has incentivized for-profit colleges  to aggressively target veterans into these junk programs. Not all, but  any organization that can't stand up a program without relying 100  percent on the funding that we provide has to face some scrutiny.   This is a rule that has worked, and it is a rule that ought to be  extended to protect those people who have made the most significant  sacrifice that Americans can make by putting on the uniform of their  country and serving us. They deserve no less.   This amendment would come to their aid, and I support it. I commend  my colleagues for offering it.
