 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here with my colleagues  [[Page H279]]  who believe so fervently in doing the right thing because if you seek  your wisdom from above, you will always do the right thing. I  appreciate Mr. Smith's leadership.   As we stand here remembering the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I  want to remind my colleagues that standing for life--and I repeat,  standing for life--has historically been a bipartisan effort. Example,  the Hyde amendment, especially across Michigan's First District.   Since coming to Congress, I am proud to have stood shoulder to  shoulder with my constituents as we collectively raise our voice, and  our vote, for those who have neither.                                time  1300    The very first inalienable right described in the Declaration of  Independence is the right to life.   As a Member of Congress I have always and will always continue to  fight to correct that right for the born and the unborn.   Protecting life isn't an issue of division. In fact, it is one of  unity.   We must all work together to enact better policies and build stronger  communities that create a culture of life.   Together, we can create a Nation that honors life and upholds the  self-evident truth that every life is precious and must be protected.
