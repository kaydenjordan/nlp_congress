 Mr. Speaker, I really want to ask a question. So I  guess I should ask if the gentleman would yield for a question.   Because if he would put up that slide where they had the barrier that  would stop the vehicles, I wonder if he had time yet--because we just  got back to--in fact, I think that might be me in the picture.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. We were able to--maybe  not here, but that's fine.   But just on the other side of that, do we have a picture of the rope?    Mr. Speaker, shocking. I mean, you know, it was  shocking. And then the trail, if I remember correctly, and Mr. Gohmert  can correct me if I am wrong, but the trail then goes on up into the  hills.    Where it makes it much harder for the border patrol  agents, we heard, to track them down. So where there is a wall, even if  they get over it somehow, it slows them down.   The border patrol folks can then spot them, using some of that  electronic equipment we have talked about, maybe using their pony  patrols, you know, where they are out on horseback, but they can then  have a better chance of catching a substantial number of these folks.   But where you don't have that wall/fence barrier, and you just have a  rope or a little fence--in fact, I know a picture was taken of it,  too--we saw a rancher, who may not want his picture out there--but we  saw a rancher who has to be in his seventies, and probably is in his  eighties, who had climbed under the fence to show that even he, in his  advanced age, could get under the fence. It was just remarkable.   I mean, did you have the same reaction I did that this was just  outrageous, and that, clearly, we just have a line that demarks it, so  that if you are law-abiding, you know that is where to stop. But the  people we are dealing with are not law-abiders, are they, sir?    I would say to the gentleman that one of the things  that really struck me that I probably didn't know or hadn't heard  stories of--a lot of this was just confirming what I believed might be  going on and bringing it visually home.   But one of the things that I was astounded with was the residents in  the area who were talking about it--we had a number of residents we met  with--that the drug runners are bringing the drugs in, sometimes they  are just dropping them off at a GPS site, sometimes they are handing  them off and getting cash and bringing the cash back, but they also  were looters. So all those properties along the border have to worry  about home invasions and burglaries and thieving; because there is  nothing to stop them, whatever they can carry, they are carrying out  and carrying south as well.   You know, if it was folks, that would be one issue--and I understand  that issue is a big part of it--but if it was just folks coming north  to look for a better way of life, that would be one thing. But a huge  number of these people are coming north with methamphetamine that comes  into my district, and probably into Mr. Gohmert's as well, with  fentanyl, with heroin, and with marijuana, and they are coming in with  that. They are taking the cash and anything they can steal back with  them.   And so it is a two-way street, so to speak. We have got illegal  commerce going both ways through a rope as our defense for our country,  a mere rope, an inch of cotton thread.    Amazing.    Mr. Speaker, that was a horrible story. And what was so  interesting was that the people who we were talking to in that group,  some of them had helped these folks out when they were found and helped  them recover as best they could in that situation. It was just a  horrible situation, and it was just one of many stories.   My colleague referenced the rape trees. We heard one of the ranchers  tell us that he was out on his property and he saw all this women's  underwear, and he picked up three trash bags full of women's underwear.  That represents somebody, each one of those, somebody who had been  raped.   This is a crisis, as you know. It is a crisis, and it is a crisis of  so many dimensions that we are not going to be able to talk about all  the different aspects.   One of the ranchers said to me: Why isn't anybody talking about the  environment?   It was really interesting. He pointed up to the mountains, and he  said: Those mountains used to be filled with Douglas firs.   Whether intentionally or unintentionally, whether it was somebody  building a campfire and was negligent or whether it was a diversion by  the cartels to pull all the first responders to one end of the county  while they ran drugs into the other end of the county, he didn't know,  but they burned down that mountain, all the trees on the whole range of  mountains.    It was.   And he said, you know: That wasn't just old growth. That was virgin  forest. Where are the folks who normally care about the environment?  Why aren't they saying anything?   And what I found really interesting, he talked about some of the  other environmental problems with all the trash and so forth.   Well, the next day, we were talking to border security, and the  fellow who was in our car started talking about how once they put the  wall up and made it more secure, it was amazing. It just took a few  years for the wildlife to come back.                                time  2045    Apparently, where they cross on a regular basis and are having lay- bys--that is where they hang out until they move on to the next camp,  and they leave all their trash and stuff there--a lot of the wildlife  had just disappeared. But once they started having a fence like this or  the ability to have a road into certain areas and they cut that off,  all of a sudden, the wildlife started coming back.   He showed me a picture on his phone that he had taken of a bear. He  said: That wasn't here 5, 6, 10 years ago. Now they are back. We have  big cats. We have bear. It really is amazing.   He didn't know that, the day before, I had been talking to a rancher  about similar issues, that it is a real detriment to the environment.   Then the other thing that probably won't get a lot of attention is  that, even if we are not able to build the wall everywhere we want, it  channels the folks. Just like we saw on the end of each wall, we saw  several segments and you could see the paths. What happens is that you  are then channeling the illegal immigrants into a particular area,  which makes it easier for the electronic devices and the agents to get  in there.   If you have the electronic surveillance, you have the walls, or the  wall fence, and you have the border agents with the supplies and the  equipment, including dogs and horses, et cetera, that they need, then  they know where there are pinch points where they can cut off a lot of  this. But it will be an ongoing problem that we will have to deal with  as a Nation.   This year is just a part of it. As we close in and close off some  areas, we will see other areas where they start going in, in greater  numbers. But we will start concentrating on where we can catch more of  the drugs coming in.   As my colleague said, the lady had said you won't catch them all, but  without a wall, you will not catch any of them. I think that those are  two important points.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know how the gentleman felt about that, but I  would love to hear his opinion on that as well.    Mr. Speaker, I mean, we heard from so many people, and  the ones who had lost loved ones really just wanted to try to make a  difference. They just wanted to make a difference to make their  communities safer, to make it safer for everybody. They are not going  to bring back their family member, but they want to make the whole area  safer.   They believe that it is a crisis. Every one of them believed it was a  crisis.   One night, we were having dinner, and a lady who didn't know we were  from the United States Congress walked over because she recognized one  of the local officials and said we have to do something on the border-- spontaneously. We are just in town having dinner.    Mr. Speaker, she had no idea who we were until she  walked over and said that and then was invited to address us: Well, you  have some Members of the United States Congress here. Why don't you  tell them what you think we need to do?   There wasn't any question. These folks who live right down there on  the border, they believe that the wall, fence, whatever you want to  call that structure there in your picture, they believe that that  helps, that it is not the whole equation, but that it is a big help and  that we have to do it.   They were very encouraging to us, to a person, to continue to work  hard to try to secure that border, to stop this humanitarian crisis, to  stop our security crisis, to stop the environmental crisis.   That one person was adamant that this is devastating. He was an  environmentalist person who really was very, very concerned about what  had happened to the ecology in his area and to the environment. He  attributes that directly to the flood of not a handful of people, but  tens of thousands coming across.   One of the ranchers that we talked to, their ranch is looking at  10,000 or more people coming across there every year.   We are not talking about a trickle. We are talking about a flood. We  are talking about a crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Biggs and Congressman  Gosar for inviting us out there to see this, making the arrangements  for us to meet with people who live on the border, people who work on  the border, people who are trying to secure America's border and are  putting their lives on the line, and they know that. They have had  friends and family members who have died. I appreciate them inviting us  down. And I appreciate Congressman Gohmert for having this time this  evening and giving me an opportunity to talk about some of the things I  saw. This discussion will continue because there is a crisis on the  American border.   I yield back.
