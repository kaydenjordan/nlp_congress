 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  Andy Merfeld, an outstanding educator from my district, for being named  Principal of the Year by the Central Minnesota Association of Secondary  Principals. The Central Minnesota Association of Secondary Principals  consists of over 200 administrators from more than 18 counties. The  Principal of the Year is selected for excellence as a collaborative  leader, unique curriculum, and personalization. With this  [[Page H3841]]  distinction, Principal Merfeld will be considered for the Principal of  the Year award.   As principal of St. Michael-Albertville Middle School West, and after  16 years with the St. Michael-Albertville school district, Principal  Merfeld has built a legacy as an educator and as a leader. He goes  above and beyond, serving on the district's finance advisory committee  and co-chairing a working group that aims to expand math opportunities  for high-achieving middle school students.   To Principal Merfeld, thank you and congratulations. Minnesota's  Sixth District is grateful for dedicated educators like you.                                 Capital One     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Capital One, its  executive team, and its employees for their generosity and commitment  to our local communities.   Since 2012, Capital One has generously donated over $80,000 to the  Boys & Girls Clubs of Central Minnesota to support the mission of  enabling young people to reach their full potential.   In particular, a Capital One grant to fund Project Learn helps  advance the goal of equipping our kids with coding skills to meet the  needs of the future. Capital One recognizes the importance of STEM- and  tech-related skills to the future of our Nation, and I thank them for  investing in our Nation's future leaders.   Thank you, Capital One, for your commitment to the young people of  central Minnesota. We are grateful for your team in our community.                Recognizing Anoka Ramsey Athletic Association     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Anoka Ramsey  Athletic Association, a volunteer service organization, committed to  providing opportunity for students across all skill levels to play and  compete in recreational athletics. Comprised of coaches, parents,  directors, commissioners, and board members, the organization serves  nearly 40,000 Minnesotans each year.   For over 40 years, Anoka Ramsey Athletic Association has sought to  provide character development through competition. Selfless volunteers  have donated over 300,000 hours planning, coaching, training,  maintaining fields, working concessions, and overall operations to  ensure that our kids have the opportunity to participate in sports like  baseball, basketball, football, lacrosse, softball, volleyball,  wrestling, tennis, and soccer.   To the volunteers of the Anoka Ramsey Athletic Association for your  decades of service, thank you.             Congratulating St. Cloud State University Wrestling     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the St. Cloud State  University Wrestling team for winning this year's NCAA Division II  National Championship. The young men on this team strive every year for  excellence, and for the third time in the last 4 years, it paid off.  But this year was special.   For the first time in Husky history, the team also clinched four  titles in one season. The Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference  title, the National Duals, and Regional and National tournament titles  were all achieved. The perseverance and success of our Husky wrestlers  reminds us all that when you commit to excellence and you work hard,  the results will follow.   Congratulations to the outstanding student athlete wrestlers of the  St. Cloud State Wrestling team for your remarkable achievement and  another memorable season.             Recognizing Teachers, Coaches, and First Responders     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  teachers, coaches, and first responders who saved the life of my  constituent, Ryan Monahan of Big Lake, Minnesota. Ryan, who is only 15  years old and a student at Monticello High School, unexpectedly went  into sudden cardiac arrest after a basketball practice.   The quick thinking and preparedness of the people around him saved  his life. A call was immediately placed to 911 and five heroic coaches  and teachers worked together to use the automated external  defibrillator to revive Ryan. We are grateful to all who helped save  Ryan's life.   Ryan was lucky. Unfortunately, more than 7,000 Americans lose their  life to sudden cardiac arrest every year. It is my hope that Ryan's  story serves as a reminder to all of us of the value of being prepared  for an emergency like this.   Our local community back home in Minnesota is so grateful to those  who reacted so swiftly, as well as all of the first responders who  saved Ryan. Thank you all.                            ____________________
