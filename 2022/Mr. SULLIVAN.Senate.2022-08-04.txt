 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  complete my remarks before the 1:45 p.m. vote.    Mr. President, I want to compliment my friend from  Delaware. He and I do work together on a number of issues. We are going  to part ways on this really important issue for me today. I do want to  just make a comment to his comments.   I would say--I wouldn't say--I know there is no group that has  suffered more at the hands of the Biden administration's Executive  orders and far-left environmental groups than Alaska Natives. I know  that for a fact.   I would invite my colleague to come up to Alaska with me, and I will  take him to these communities. They can't do anything--no jobs, no  nothing--because every far-left group in America wants to shut down  their opportunities. It happens all the time.   So I would love to take him and others up to Alaska to let them see  that when people talk about Alaska Native groups and try to speak for  them. Unfortunately, some of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle do that. No  [[Page S4011]]  way. You are not going to get away with that on this one.   Mr. President, we have a resolution that we are going to be voting on  here in about 10 minutes. This is my Congressional Review Act  resolution, and I have spoken on the Senate floor a number of times  about this.   The CRA today, what we call a CRA, is quite simple. It would rescind  the new Biden administration's NEPA rule--that is the National  Environmental Policy Act rule--promulgated in April, which will clearly  have the impact of slowing down the construction of literally every  infrastructure project in America: the construction of roads, bridges,  wind, solar, hydro--heck--even chip fabrication facilities, critical  mineral projects. Pretty much everything is going to be slowed down by  this.   It is pretty straightforward. Our resolution just says: We want to  rescind the resolution, the regulation, from April.   But the vote on this is much more significant than just one Senate  resolution. It is a test for all Senators on two key issues.   First, are you really serious about permitting reform so that America  can build the infrastructure that everybody knows our country  desperately needs?   Second, who do you stand with--the working men and women of our great  Nation who build things or the far-left elite special interest groups  who want to shut this country down?   Let's take these two issues in order.   First, permitting reform. My colleagues know this is a passion of  mine. Actually, it is a passion of a number of Senators. It sounds  wonky; it sounds boring; it sounds technical--``permitting reform.''  But in reality, it is so important for our Nation--for every community  in America, for the dignity of work, for good jobs in this country.   Here is why: We used to build big things in America--engineering  marvels on time, on budget--the source of pride for literally all  Americans and the envy of the world. We did that all the time. Think  about it: the Empire State Building--410 days to build; the Pentagon,  the biggest building in the world--16 months; a little closer to home  for me is the 1,700-mile Alaska-Canadian Highway through some of the  world's most rugged terrain--11 months; the Trans-Alaska Pipeline  system that feeds a hungry nation with energy from Alaska to the lower  48--800 miles with 70,000 sections of 48-inch pipe joined and welded  together, 3 mountain ranges, 800 river beds from the Arctic Ocean to  the Pacific--3 years. Incredible.   Why did we do this? Why can we do this? Why can we still do this in  America? Because we have the best workers--the most productive  workforce--in the world.   Unfortunately, those days of building great things in America in an  efficient, timely fashion are gone. We all know it. Every mayor knows  it; every city council member knows it; every Governor knows it; and,  yes, every U.S. Senator knows it.   We see it every day. We don't see the great building of things, but  we see the other things: 8 to 9 years to permit a bridge--yes, in  America, to permit a bridge; 9 to 19 years to permit and build a  highway. The Gross water reservoir in Colorado, for clean water, took  20 years to permit. The Kensington mine, which is a gold mine in Alaska  that is now employing hundreds of people with an average wage of  $110,000--really good jobs--took 20 years to permit with litigation.   This is killing our country, our economy, and good jobs. We all know  it, and we all know the reason for it. Every single Senator knows the  reason: a broken Federal permitting system that has turned into a  labyrinth of redtape; a system that invites and incentivizes delay and  litigation by groups whose goal is to shut down the building of our  country. Everybody knows it. It is a fact.   Now, how can I be so sure? Because everybody in this body likes to  talk about the need for permitting reform so we can get back to  building this country and putting Americans who do these hard jobs to  work.   Last year, I worked hard with a number of my colleagues on the  bipartisan infrastructure bill, which I voted on. In the EPW  Committee--and my colleague from Delaware is still here--we got some  important permitting reforms in it. That was good. They were not  enough, in my view, but it was a good start.   Today, as we consider Senator Schumer's reconciliation bill, which I  will oppose, we are all now being assured that Senator Schumer, Speaker  Pelosi, and even the President are fully committed to additional robust  permitting legislation in the fall, sometime in the future, once their  massive tax-and-spending reconciliation bill passes. So everybody is  talking about permitting. We all know we need it.   But here is what happened. In the meantime, between the ``important  but not as ambitious as I would have liked'' permitting reforms in the  infrastructure bill last fall and all of the talk of permitting today,  something happened. What happened?   The Biden administration promulgated a new NEPA rule, supported by  far-left environmental groups, that will clearly have the effect of  slowing down the permitting of infrastructure, inviting endless  litigation and putting people out of work. No one who has seriously  looked at this broad, nebulous, and destructive Biden rule disputes  this. I have read it. It is a delay bomb for infrastructure.   So here is the first test. It was noted in a very good, recent Wall  Street Journal editorial this week. It is this: If my colleagues--all  of my colleagues but especially my Democratic colleagues--really  support permitting reform so we can get back to building America, let's  get rid of this destructive, overbroad, vague, litigation-inviting  rule. Vote yes on my resolution. Right now, 50 Republican Senators are  cosponsors of this resolution.   To my Democratic colleagues, join us. Do the right thing for America.  We all know that this is the right thing for America.   Here is the second test. I asked you to join us in doing the right  thing for America. Join us in doing the right thing for the working  Americans and building trades that heroically built this country and  continue to do so today.   Now, I love this photo. It is iconic. It says so much, and I have had  it on the floor a number of times. But these are the kind of men and  women who built this great Nation--hard-working Americans who are doing  incredible stuff. That is a lunch break, by the way, in the building of  the Empire State Building.   This shouldn't be hard to support the men and women who build this  country, and this shouldn't be hard for my Democratic colleagues who  often claim to support the working men and women of America. In the  past, I certainly will acknowledge that that has been true, but today-- and I have learned this lesson the hard way back home in Alaska. Today,  whenever national Democrats have to choose between the interests of the  far-left elite environmental groups and these men and women who produce  things and build things in America, they sell out the working class  every time--every time. I see this every day in my State.   I mentioned this in a Congress committee hearing a few months ago.  One of my Democratic colleagues, who is a friend--and almost everybody  on the other side of the aisle is a good friend of mine--got upset with  me.   He said: Hey, that is not true. You shouldn't have said that.   Well, here is what I say: All right. Prove it.   Today's vote is a chance to prove me wrong or to prove me right. Here  is why, and this is really important.   Let's look at the lineup of the groups that support my resolution  today and those that oppose it. These are just some of the 50 groups in  America that are supporting my resolution that we are going to vote on  here in a couple of minutes, and I am very proud of this incredible,  broad, and diverse groups of Americans who are saying to vote yes on  the Sullivan resolution. They all have one thing in common: They  produce things and they build things for this great Nation.   Take a look at this chart. It is kind of hard to decipher who is on  it. Let me give you a couple.   The American Farm Bureau: So this is all of our farmers and  cattlemen--all of our cattlemen, farmers and ranchers, and ag  retailers.   The National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association: These are the guys who  build infrastructure.  [[Page S4012]]    It is the same with the Associated General Contractors of America,  the same with the U.S. Chamber, the same with the National Association  of Manufacturers, the same with the American Mining Rights Association.   Of course, the entire energy sector is supporting this, groups from  Alaska, the resource development sector, groups from West Virginia, and  groups from Ohio. This is a huge, broad-based group of supporters.   I will tell you this. I am most proud of the strong, robust support  for my resolution from organizations that represent the men and women  who build stuff and keep our country's economy humming.   Take a look at some of them: The North America's Building Trades  Union--that is all the unions that build things. The Laborers'  International, LIUNA--that is the largest construction trade union in  the country. The Operating Engineers--these guys do everything. Another  trade union: the Alaska Teamsters, the Alaska AFL-CIO.   These are the great men and women who built this country and built  the middle class of America. I have the utmost respect for them, and,  indeed, my family is part of this labor union heritage. My great- grandfather was one of the cofounders of the International Brotherhood  of Electrical Workers. That is a source of pride in my family.   But here is the question: Why are they all strongly supporting my  resolution to rescind the Biden NEPA regulations? It is a simple  answer: because they know that these are job-killing regs. They know  that these are the types of regs in America that delay or indefinitely  stop the building of infrastructure in our country, and their members  are the ones who suffer the most. And the dignity of the work--the  dignity of work that we all say we care about--also suffers.   Don't take my word for it. Here is what some of the leaders of these  organizations have said--and they are great Americans. Let me begin  with Terry O'Sullivan, the head of the Laborers' International. This  was his letter to the Biden White House when they were contemplating  this rule in April. Just take a look. He said:         The rollback of updates to NEPA reinstates burdensome       requirements that will cause excessive permit delays and       allow project adversaries--    Far-left environmental groups--       to use frivolous lawsuits--    Which they always do--       to disrupt or upend long overdue construction. Once again,       communities in need of vital infrastructure and the hard-      working men and women who build America will be waiting as       project details are subjected to onerous reviews.    That was Terry O'Sullivan saying: Don't issue the rule.   They ignored him. They ignored him because they chose the interests  of the far-left environmentalists.   Here is James Callahan writing in support of today's resolution. He  is the head of the Operating Engineers. You want to talk about great  unions--LIUNA, Operating Engineers--these are men and women who build  things. This is an incredible statement, and he nails it. This guy  really knows what he is talking about.         Since its modest beginnings, NEPA has evolved into a       massive edifice, capable of destroying project after project,       job after job, in virtually every sector of the economy.       Dilatory strategies employed by the project opponents--    Far-left environmental groups--       frequently exploit provisions in NEPA, weighing down       projects, frustrating communities, and raising costs to the       point that many applicants, whether public or private, simply       walk away.    And when they walk away, it kills jobs. That is from James Callahan's  letter, 1 of the 50 groups that is supporting this resolution.   The men and women who build our Nation support my resolution, like so  many groups.   So who is opposed? Well, it is pretty simple. It is pretty obvious.  It is the usual groups of far-left, coastal-elite environmental groups  that I see every day in Alaska trying to crush jobs and stop  infrastructure and put people out of work.   I will just give you few. You know, they are the usual suspects:  Center for Biological Diversity, Earthjustice, CODEPINK--I am not sure  why they jumped in on this--Friends of the Earth.   By the way, if you are watching this speech, go take a look at some  of those websites and see what they stand for. So that is who is  opposed.   One more point that I think is important to raise. To be honest,  there is something else going on here. Not only is there always  opposition by those groups to building anything in America--including  my resolution--regardless of how many pink slips result from the  actions of these groups to shut down things, there is sometimes a  subtle and not so subtle condescension looking down on the Americans  who build things. Workers can feel it. Workers can sense it.   No one epitomizes this condescending elitist attitude toward American  workers more than this guy. You might remember that last year, around  this time, he was asked if the Biden administration's Green New Deal  policies would put American coal and natural gas workers out of work  and end their livelihoods. John Kerry responded:         What President Biden wants to do is make sure that those       folks--    Men and women who build stuff, coal miners, natural gas workers--       have better choices--    Better choices--         That they can be the people who go to work to make solar       panels.    Sure, ``better choices,'' from a guy who flies in a jet, owned a 76- foot yacht, several mansions, and has the carbon footprint of a small  nation. Yet he tells American energy workers to go make solar panels,  when the Biden administration's regulations are killing their jobs.   I will end with this, back to the workers: When you are voting today,  keep the heritage of these men and women in mind. The Biden NEPA rule  that we are trying to rescind today will kill jobs. I am sure it has  already killed jobs. That is why we need to rescind it.   This should be an easy vote for all of my Senate colleagues today. If  you really care about permitting reform, so we can get back to building  things in America, you should vote yes. If you really put the interests  of working men and women like these incredible Americans over those of  elite far-left environmental groups, you should vote yes. And if you  truly support the men and women who build this country, feed this  country, and grow this country, you should vote yes.   I yield the floor.   I ask for the yeas and nays on this resolution.    Madam President, I just want to thank my colleagues for  the vote that just occurred here on the floor of the Senate. It was a  bipartisan victory, 50 to 47, on the Congressional Review Act that I  had put forward with all of my Republican colleagues to rescind the  onerous, job-killing Biden administration rule that came out in April  that would make it harder to build things in America. It would make it  harder to employ people, especially our incredibly productive American  workers.   So that just passed. That was a repudiation of the Biden White House  in a bipartisan vote on the Senate floor.   Here is the thing. Even my Senate colleagues--because I was working  the vote pretty hard down there in the well--even my Senate colleagues  who voted against it, several of them came up to me and said: You know  what. You are right. We have really got to fix NEPA. It is killing the  country. It is killing our ability to do anything. So that was an  important vote, but a good conversation is starting here.   We have the best workers in the world. If we let them build, we can  do great things again in terms of building this country and not let  redtape, far-left environmental groups, regulations, and endless  litigation stop us.   So I also want to thank all the groups that supported this  resolution.   I had a bigger sign down on the Senate floor when I was giving an  earlier speech, but the groups that were supporting this legislation  are very diverse. There are over 50 groups of men and women who produce  things, grow things, and build the country. I want to thank them for  the great support of this Congressional Review Act that just passed.   I really want to give a shout-out to the building trades, the  laborers, the operating engineers, and the trade unions that are doing  such a great job building this country who want to work. They know  these regulations are killing workers' ability to get good jobs.   We have a long way to go to fix the broken system of permitting in  America and the endless litigation by environmental lawyers who want to  stop everything, but today was an important start and an important vote  on the floor of the Senate, showing America that a bipartisan group of  Senators will stand up to these far-left groups and say: Hey, you know  what? We gotta build. We need to build. And that was the message here.   We are going to try to move this in the House and get it on President  Biden's desk. He says he is blue-collar Joe. Well, let's see if he is  blue-collar Joe when this comes to his desk and he would veto or not  veto something that all the building trades in America support.   I yield the floor.
