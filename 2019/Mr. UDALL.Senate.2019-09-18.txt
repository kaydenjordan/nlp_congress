 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise to urge this body to protect the  Constitution, to defend the separation of powers, and to prevent an  unauthorized, unconstitutional war with Iran.   The Constitution is clear. Under our article I powers, the  Constitution spells out that Congress shall have the authority to  declare war.   The Founders debated which branch of government should be given the  solemn power to wage war. Entering into battle had been the personal  prerogative of Kings, and Kings had shown that they would bankrupt  their countries and risk lives because of self-serving, power-seeking  feuds.   Therefore, our Constitution's Founders placed the decision to go to  war with the people's representatives. They wanted any decision to wage  war to reflect the will of the people. They deliberately rejected  giving this most consequential decision only to the President.   Yet, despite the clarity of the Constitution, President Trump  insists--without any equivocation--that he does not need congressional  approval to engage in military hostilities against Iran, and now,  instead of working with the U.S. Congress, he is publicly deferring to  the royal family of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our President said we  are waiting for Saudi Arabia to say ``under what terms we would  proceed.''   When discussing retaliation for the attack on a Saudi oil-processing  facility, our President has praised the Saudis as good customers who  ``[pay] cash.''   President Trump explained further as follows:         [T]he fact is that the Saudis are going to have a lot of       involvement in this if we decide to do something. They'll be       very much involved, and that includes payment. And they       understand that fully.    Does this Congress think the patriotic men and women of our military  are mercenaries at the service of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? I reject  that idea completely. When a President is threatening a military attack  because of a foreign King's oil interests, it is well past time for  Congress to assert its institutional authority.   Congress needs to make it clear: The President cannot begin a war  with Iran without coming here first, coming here to the Congress.   In June, we voted on a bipartisan amendment to the National Defense  Authorization Act that prohibited any war with Iran unless authorized  by Congress.   Getting a vote on the Udall-Kaine-Paul amendment was historic, and a  bipartisan majority of Senators voted to support our amendment that  day.   The House of Representatives has sent us its NDAA, which includes a  bipartisan provision prohibiting war against Iran without congressional  approval. The NDAA is now going to a Senate-House conference committee.  The conference committee must adopt our amendment that prohibits  unauthorized war against Iran.   Since our vote in June, tensions with Iran have not subsided; they  have only increased. The threat of miscalculation and unauthorized war  has only gotten more serious. This week, the President, on Twitter, is  threatening that the U.S. military is ``locked and loaded'' on behalf  of the Saudi Kingdom.   Iran's behavior in the region is highly problematic, but Saudi  Arabia's oil interests do not determine whether the United States goes  to war. Congress determines that, Congress and Congress only, based on  our national interests.   Rather than threats of war, the right move is active diplomacy to  lower tensions in the region.   We are at this point in the Middle East because of the Trump  administration's failed policies. Its unilateral withdrawal from the  Iran nuclear agreement, its maximum pressure policy, its abandonment of  diplomacy--these policies are only causing more chaos in the region and  doing nothing to advance U.S. interests.   When the President unilaterally withdrew from the Iran agreement in  May 2018, against the advice of his military and intelligence Chiefs,  he promised he would get us a better deal.   The deal we had in place secured for the United States and the world  an Iran that would not develop nuclear weapons. It was a deal that had  strict verification requirements and a deal his advisers and outside  independent groups said Iran was complying with.  [[Page S5565]]    It has now been 16 months since the President tore up that deal and  said he could get us a better one. Well, the President's supposed deal- making prowess has only produced increased tensions, bringing us to the  brink of war.   In June, we were 10 minutes away from an attack that likely would  have cost Iranian lives. Even after that aborted strike, the President  threatened Iran with ``obliteration like you've never seen before.''  Now we are ``locked and loaded.''   While it is a positive development that John Bolton is no longer  whispering in the President's ear--urging regime change in Iran--this  mercurial President could get us into a war before we know it, but  these are my own views about the President's foreign policy. I  understand others in this body do not share them, including others who  voted to support this amendment previously.   I want to underscore that this is not about what you think of the  President. This is about defending the separation of powers as outlined  in the Constitution, and this is about standing up for the will of the  American people. The American people do not want another endless war in  the Middle East.   While our military is the most capable on Earth, no conflict with  Iran would be easy. Iran has twice the population of Iraq and is four  times the size. Even so-called targeted strikes could escalate into a  much wider war.   Make no mistake, our amendment retains the President's authority to  defend against any attack upon us. While the chief complaint from  opponents of the amendment was that it tied the President's hands from  attack, this is a false argument. The amendment expressly reserves the  President's powers to defend the Nation. The Department of Defense's  rules of engagement remain in place. The President's full authority as  Commander in Chief to repel an attack and defend the Nation remains  intact.   If there are still concerns, we can continue to consult experts and  refine language in conference. That is part of the regular order, but  the Defense bill must prohibit an unauthorized war with Iran.   For too long, Congress has abdicated its constitutional duty to  decide matters of war and peace. We have hidden from the hard votes. We  have allowed the Executive to fill the vacuum.   We in this body need to step up to the plate and assume our  constitutional responsibilities. This is not about partisan politics.  This is not about tying the hands of the President in defense of our  country. This vote is not even about whether you think we should or  should not go to war against Iran. Even if you think military action on  behalf of the downed drone or Saudi oil is justified, the place to  debate and make that decision is on this floor in this Congress. It is  not the decision of one man in the White House.   I am making this call to our conferees: Affirm the Constitution.  Affirm our sworn responsibility to uphold the Constitution. Affirm that  our men and women in uniform will not be sent off to risk their lives  in war unless the people's representatives make that somber decision.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to grant floor  privileges to two of my fellows, Benjamin Riley and Miranda Hernandez,  for the remainder of the Congress.
