(a) Consolidation.--Not later than the date specified in       subsection (e), as modified by any adjustments certified       pursuant to section 6(b), the Director of the Administrative       Office of the United States Courts, in coordination with the       Administrator of General Services, shall develop, deliver,       and sustain, consistent with the requirements of  [[Page H7016]]       this section and section 3, one system for all public court       records.        (b) Requirements of System.--The system described in       subsection (a) shall comply with the following requirements:        (1) The system shall provide search functions, developed in       coordination with the Administrator of General Services, for       use by the public and by parties before the court.        (2) The system shall make public court records       automatically accessible to the public upon receipt of such       records.

Any such additional fees shall be       assessed on a progressive fee schedule according to the level       of use so that higher volume users are assessed higher fees.        (2) Pricing for high-volume, for-profit use.--        (A) In general.--Pursuant to sections 1913, 1914, 1926,       1930, and 1932 of title 28, United States Code, the Director       of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, in       coordination with the Administrator of General Services and       the Office of Technology Transformation of the General       Services Administration, may prescribe a schedule of       reasonable fees for high-volume, for-profit public users of       the system described in this section and section 3, to       facilitate service-level agreements for maximum response       times, integrations, high availability, and service and       support.        (B) Fee requirements.--The schedule of fees described in       paragraph (1) shall be based on a determination of specific       and substantial need, and may not impair access to justice       and the public right of access to court records, restrain       innovation in the provision of legal services and access to       public court records, nor inhibit not for profit research of       the business of the Federal courts.        (3) Fees to fund operation and maintenance of modernized       court records system.--        (A) In general.--To cover the costs of carrying out this       Act, the Judicial Conference of the United States may, only       to the extent necessary, prescribe schedules of reasonable       user fees, pursuant to sections 1913, 1914, 1926, 1930, and       1932 of title 28, United States Code. Such fees shall be       based on the extent of use of the system described under this       section and section 3 as well as factors such as feasibility,       fairness to other users of the system, and efficacy, and may       not foreclose access to justice and the public right of       access to court records.        (B) Filing fees prohibited.--The Judicial Conference of the       United States may not prescribe filing fees to cover the cost       of the system described in this section and section 3 unless       the Judicial Conference determines that all other sources of       fees will not cover the costs of such system. Only after such       a determination and only to the extent necessary, the       Judicial Conference may prescribe schedules of progressive       filing fees under subparagraph (A). In addition to the       requirements of subparagraph (A), such filing fees--        (i) shall be based on factors to ensure that such schedules       are graduated and equitable, including the type of action and       claim for relief, the status of a filer, the amount of       damages demanded, the estimated complexity of the type of       action, and the interests of justice;        (ii) may be prescribed for the filing of a counterclaim;        (iii) shall not apply in the case of a pro se litigant or       litigant who certifies the litigant's financial hardship;        (iv) shall not be a basis for rejecting a filing or       otherwise denying a party seeking relief access to the courts       of the United States;        (v) shall be assessed according to schedules, not on a       case-by-case, ad hoc basis; and        (vi) shall not be greater than 15 percent of any other fees       associated with the filing.        (4) Use of funds.--        (A) Deposit fees.--All fees collected under this subsection       shall be deposited as offsetting collections to the Judiciary       Information Technology Fund pursuant to section 612(c)(1)(A)       of title 28, United States Code, to reimburse expenses       incurred in carrying out this section.        (B) Authorized uses of fees.--Amounts deposited to the       Judiciary Information Technology Fund pursuant to this       paragraph and not used to reimburse expenses incurred in       carrying out this section and section 3 may be used pursuant       to section 612(a) of title 28, United States Code.

(b) Certification Regarding Anticipated Funding in the       Current Fiscal Year.--        (1) In general.--The Director of the Administrative Office       of the United States Courts may treat any and all receipts,       funds, expenditures and costs associated with the system       established under sections 2 and 3 as constituting a separate       item in its budget distinct from the remainder of its budget.

(5) GAO review.--In any fiscal year during which such       certification is issued and implemented, the Comptroller       General of the United States shall conduct a comprehensive       review of the certification not later than 120 days after its       submission, including--        (A) the accuracy of the expectations of the Director of the       Administrative Office of the United States Courts with       respect to any deficit in funds;        (B) the efficacy of the Director's recommended response,       and        (C) the Comptroller General's recommendations for       alternative or additional responses submitted as a report to       the Director and Committees on the Judiciary of the House of       Representatives and the Senate.

The system described under sections 2 and 3 of this Act       shall comply with relevant digital accessibility standards       established pursuant to section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act       of 1973.       SEC. 9. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8235, as amended, the Open  Courts Act, which would require the Federal judiciary to allow free  public access to court records over the internet and modernize the  court records system so that it will cost less to maintain and be more  secure.   This act is the product of over 5 years of bipartisan effort, and I  am so proud that we have gotten the bill to this moment.   I first want to thank the majority leader, Steny Hoyer, for his  involvement and commitment to bringing this important legislation to  the floor, and I would like to thank Director Duff and his staff for  their recent attention to this bill.   I also want to thank Mr. Jordan for his support for this bill at the  committee's markup.   I would be remiss if I did not recognize our partners in the Senate,  Senators Portman and Wyden, for their leadership and commitment to this  effort.   Finally, I extend sincere appreciation to my colleague from Georgia,  Doug Collins, the colead on this bill. I want to thank him for his  partnership in working to make the Federal court records system freely  accessible to all Americans.   I would also like to thank Perry Apelbaum with the Judiciary  Committee, Jamie Simpson and Matt Robinson of my subcommittee, Jon  Ferro with Congressman Collins' office, and I would also like to give a  special thanks to Keith Abouchar with Leader Hoyer's office for all of  his efforts to help us be on the floor today with this bill. Without  everyone's persistence, dedication, and countless hours of hard work  behind the scenes, we would not be here today.   Mr. Speaker, wealth should not act as a barrier to access our courts.  Whether it is a journalist reporting on the courts' activities or a  citizen petitioning the court for redress, access to the courts should  be free to all, not just to those who can afford it.   Forcing the public to pay for access to court records imposes an  unnecessary and unconscionable burden on people who are simply engaging  in a constitutionally protected activity. Transparency and  accessibility should be our goal, not profits and limited access.   Court records should be as easy to access as legislation is on  Congress.gov. All you have to do is put in that website, go to it, and  look at all of the legislation that we produce, Mr. Speaker, and you  should be able to do the same thing at the Federal courthouse.   Our courts are a vital part of America's government, and we in  Congress have a responsibility to ensure that public records in public  courthouses are accessible for free to the public. This bill provides  such protection of our most sacred democratic ideals.   Technology has become essential to preserving our First Amendment  rights by helping to ensure meaningful access to justice and to court  records. It is past time that we bring our Federal court records system  into the 21st century.   Convenient access to public records in public courthouses shouldn't  be a privilege for the few who can afford it. It is our duty to change  the system, and that is what this bill does. It finally makes it fairer  for everyone else.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join us voting on  this bipartisan piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my friend.   This has been a 5-year, bipartisan effort that only recently yielded  the ability of the Judicial Conference, through the Administrative  Office, to actually come to the table and talk to Congress to try to  work out their concerns.   After about a week of lots of conversation, hours upon hours of  conversation, dialogue, and negotiations, we came up with an amended  bill. Then at the very last minute, today, the Judicial Conference  issues a letter citing a preposterous figure--$2 billion--for this  system, which is not attached to any realistic cost estimate  whatsoever.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO's, Congressional Budget  Office's, estimate of the cost of the Open Courts Act to put in a new  system that is more secure and more user friendly than the one that is  in place right now.   CBO Estimate of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Effects of H.R. 8235, the   Open Courts Act of 2020, as Posted on the Website of the Clerk of the                         House on December 8, 2020         Estimates relative to CBO's March 2020 baseline. Components       may not sum to totals because of rounding.        H.R. 8235 would require the Administrative Office of the       United States Courts (AOUSC), working in coordination with       the General Services Administration, to develop and implement       a modernized software system to manage the electronic records       of the court. The legislation would require that public court       records be accessible to the public, and would authorize the       AOUSC to impose new fees--particularly on high-volume, for-      profit users--to cover the costs of developing and       maintaining the new system.        If enacted, CBO expects those fees would generate $47       million in additional revenue over the 2021-2030 period,       mostly from high-volume users of the system. CBO believes       that the new fees should be recorded in the budget as       revenues, because they are new and an exercise of the       government's sovereign power over the federal judiciary.       Those revenues would be offset by a decline in other revenues       of approximately 22 percent to account for indirect tax       effects. As a result, CBO estimates that the legislation       would increase net revenues by $37 million over that period.        Under the bill, the additional revenue would be deposited       in the Judiciary Information Technology Fund, and the AOUSC       would be authorized to spend those fees without further       appropriation. As a result, CBO estimates H.R. 8235 would       increase direct spending by $46 million over the 2021-2030       period. CBO expects that most of those costs would be       incurred during the 2021-2025 period as major work on       software development is completed and the system is deployed       across the federal judiciary.        On net, CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 8235 would       increase the deficit by $9 million over the 2021-2030 period.        If enacted, H.R. 8235 also would affect spending subject to       appropriation by the AOUSC; CBO has not completed an estimate       of that effect.     It is a state-of-the-art, 21st century system  as opposed to a 1985 system, one that will cost, in the CBO's  assessment, about $46 million over 10 years.   That is a drastic difference than a $2 billion cost estimate  submitted at the last minute to confuse and try to derail passage of  this very commonsense, necessary legislation that brings judicial  records into the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8235 is a bill that will make a meaningful  difference in the accessibility and transparency of an entire branch of  the Federal Government. It vindicates our critical First Amendment  rights and it will establish a level playing field for access to  critical government documents. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues  to support the bill, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
