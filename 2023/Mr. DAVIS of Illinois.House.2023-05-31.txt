 Mr. Speaker, I commend President Biden, Leader  Jeffries, and all of our negotiators for the great work they have done  to keep us from defaulting on our debts.   This agreement protects critical funding for children and families. I  am especially pleased with the protections for homeless youth in  school, foster children who have aged out of care, and veterans in need  of health services. It protects Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  Security.   This bill protects historic investments in clean energy. It also  protects the 40 million student loan borrowers under President Biden's  student loan relief plan, and it provides relief for some of my  concerns about SNAP and work benefits and work requirements in TANF.   I still have some serious concerns about how it affects the  environment and responds to climate control issues. The bill is not  everything I wanted, but it does give us an opportunity to pay our debt  and protect the good work we have done during the first term of  President Biden.
