 Madam Speaker, for 43 years, the President of the  United States has had the statutory authority granted by Congress to  declare a national emergency and to reprogram unobligated military  construction funds to meet that emergency. Fifty-eight times previous  Presidents have invoked this authority to address such matters as civil  unrest in Sierra Leone and Burma.   Only when this President invoked his authority for the 59th time to  address the most serious national security risk our country has faced  in our lifetime--the collapse of our southern border--do we now hear  protests from the left and its fellow travelers.   Madam Speaker, under our Constitution, the Congress appropriates  money but cannot spend it, and the President spends money but cannot  appropriate it. He spends it according to laws given to him by  Congress. In this case, Congress appropriated funds and delegated to  the President precisely the authority to spend those funds that he is  now exercising.   Now, whether Congress should have delegated this authority is a  separate question that no one has raised in 43 years. But while that  authority exists, the President has both a right and a duty to use it  to defend our country.   We also hear protests that the President's act will divert money from  other military projects. Listen to what these people are saying. They  care more about defending the Iraqi border than defending our own. Such  people should not be entrusted with the defense of our country.   I stand with the President, who is acting within our Constitution to  defend our Nation, and against the radical left in this House who would  dissolve our borders entirely if given the chance.   History warns us that nations that cannot or will not defend their  borders aren't around very long. Let that not be the epitaph of the  American Republic or the Constitution that created it.
