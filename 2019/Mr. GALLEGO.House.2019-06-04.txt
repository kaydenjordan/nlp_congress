 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Virginia  (Mrs. Luria).                   Honoring Virginia Beach Shooting Victims     Mr. Speaker, while the Trump administration is setting  fire to our legal immigration system, separating families, and all but  closing down our border, I am proud that today, here in the House of  Representatives, Democrats are standing up and taking action to provide  legal status and an earned path to citizenship for young people and  families that already call this country home.   Dreamers and TPS holders are our neighbors, coworkers, and our  friends. They are productive and contributing members of our society,  raising families, serving in our military, and uplifting our  communities.   Even though they collectively represent some of the strongest parts  of this country, the Trump administration has forced them to live in  constant uncertainty and fear that they or their loved ones will be  deported.   But even so, they have had the courage to step out of the shadows and  tell their stories and fight for the lives they have built for  themselves and their families and for the futures they aspire to.   They have spoken up many times, putting themselves at risk to do so  in hopes that they would drive us to act to uphold our American values  and allow them to become, on paper, what they already are in their  hearts: Americans.    The hundreds of thousands of Dreamers who came forward to register  with the government as part of the DACA program trusted the government  to live up to its end of the bargain.   Although the Trump administration has tried to break that promise,  today we are taking action to make sure we keep our word.   We will not allow these aspiring Americans to become the next victim  of Trump's brutal deportation force. This wasn't an easy process, and  the fight isn't over. It takes immense courage to stand up to power at  any time, but even more so, when your life--as you know it--is at great  risk.   I have the utmost admiration and respect for Dreamers who have taken  a stand and fought for the right to continue to live and work in the  country they call home. I know they will continue to fight until this  bill that we pass becomes law.   In the meantime, I--and my fellow Democrats--will continue to be  right by their side.                            ____________________
