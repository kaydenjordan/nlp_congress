 Mr. President, last night was a great moment for the  Senate.   We have been able to pass a broad legislative package that will  address the opioid epidemic in many ways.   As we all know, the opioid crisis is not nearing its end.   We are seeing more and more Americans abuse opioid drugs every year.   In 2016, there were 64,000 overdose deaths, and this number rose to a  staggering 72,000 deaths in 2017.   Right now, more than 115 people in the United States die from opioid  overdoses every day.   In Iowa last year, more than 200 people died from opioid misuse.   If there is one thing we have learned, it is that no segment of  society has been left untouched.   The crisis has affected people all over this country. Communities  throughout the United States are desperate for answers.   While overcoming this crisis cannot be accomplished overnight, the  passage of the Opioid Crisis Response Act is a huge step in the right  direction.   This legislation is a collection of more than 70 proposals from four  different committees here in the Senate, including Judiciary, where I  led six different bills through committee.   It is important to highlight how well we worked together on both  sides of the aisle--and across the aisle--to get to this point. This  was a massive bipartisan effort.   On behalf of Judiciary, not a single bill passed through committee  without wide bipartisan support. The Judiciary Committee contributed  six separate bills--each with different sponsors, to this larger piece  of legislation.   I worked with my Judiciary colleagues to get near-unanimous backing  for each of the bills. That takes a lot of time and hard work. It takes  some compromise. But we were able to get it done.   Several of the bills relate to Drug Enforcement Administration  authorities. Those bills will help empower DEA to better identify and  stop suspicious orders, gather more information when setting annual  quotas for opioids, and facilitate the flow of information among drug  manufacturers and distributors to enable better reporting decisions to  warn DEA of potential problems.   I teamed up with my fellow Iowan, Senator Ernst, to promote higher  participation in drug take-back programs so that unused, forgotten  opioids don't find their way from the medicine cabinet into  unauthorized hands.   Another bill successfully reported out of the Judiciary Committee  reauthorizes the Office of National Drug Control Policy. ONDCP directs,  crafts, and coordinates the drug policy strategy for the entire Nation.   Its reauthorization sends a message to other Federal agencies and the  country that we will continue to have strong leadership guiding us  through this crisis.   Yet another bill closes a loophole addressing illegal actors peddling  synthetic drugs, allowing law enforcement to better investigate and  prosecute cases involving synthetics.   Outside of the Judiciary Committee legislation, this bill also  includes several priorities of mine, including requiring drug  manufacturers to publicly disclose payments made to nurse practitioners  and physician assistants, just like doctors; increasing access to  substance abuse treatment in rural areas via telehealth; and better  data collection to make sure taxpayer dollars are spent helping people  who need help and not lining the pockets of crooks who take advantage  of common people.   While I cosponsored a number of bills in the opioid package, it is  important to remember that this legislation is a team effort.   The combination of bills from the Judiciary Committee, Commerce  Committee, Finance Committee, and the HELP Committee broadly address  the multiple facets of the epidemic.   As we have learned through several Judiciary Committee hearings, we  can't focus on single issues as we combat this drug crisis.   Rather, this legislation looks at the epidemic as a whole.   From prevention, treatment, recovery, and enforcement efforts, the  bill runs the gamut. It contains provisions on transparency in opioid  prescribing, family-focused residential treatment  [[Page S6219]]  options, education on drug abuse for youth, and tools for prosecuting  peddlers of synthetic drugs.   The Opioid Crisis Response Act addresses the front end of the problem  through education and prevention and also tackles the back end through  treatment and law enforcement solutions.   I would like to recognize my colleagues and thank them for their  cooperative spirit and determined efforts to help develop and move this  legislation forward.   Without reaching across the aisle and working together, we wouldn't  be here.   In particular, I would like to thank Senator Alexander and his staff  for their leadership in making this happen.   I am proud of the work we have done so far and look forward to  continuing our bipartisan effort.   Hopefully, this bill crosses the finish line, and we get the  President's signature on a major piece of legislation.   We certainly haven't solved all of our drug problems, but I will  continue to work hard to look for more ways that Congress can help, but  for today, we can take a brief moment to recognize what we have done in  passing this bill.   It is truly an important step in the right direction. This bill will  serve Iowans and all Americans in our continued fight against the  opioid crisis.                            ____________________
