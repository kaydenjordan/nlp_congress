 Mr. President, I strongly opposed the Republicans'  efforts to gut the SEC rule regarding transparency for oil and mining  industry payments to foreign governments.   I hope the American people are paying attention. One of the first  substantive legislative matters that Republicans are trying to send to  the President is a measure that makes it easier for oil companies to  corrupt foreign governments and undermine U.S. foreign policy goals.   This bill seeks to unravel human rights and transparency protections  implemented by the Obama administration. The rule requires oil and  mining companies to tell the SEC how much money they pay to foreign  governments to extract natural resources. It is a simple, common-sense  requirement to improve transparency and combat corruption in some of  the most corrupt and dysfunctional countries in the world. In fact,  dozens of other countries require that their companies report payments  to foreign governments.   Time and again, we have seen oil and mining companies go into other  nations that are poor and lack basic democratic institutions and pay  huge sums of money to autocratic corrupt regimes. According to a recent  article in Foreign Affairs, when Rex Tillerson led Exxon as its  chairman and CEO, Exxon ``cut lucrative deals with dictators in oil- rich pockets of Africa, extending the lifespans of autocratic regimes  in places such as Angola, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,  and Equatorial Guinea.'' Thanks to their countries' oil reserves, the  leaders of these poor countries have been able to remain in power for  decades.   Yet the rule is dogged by many myths and falsehoods spurred by the  fossil fuels lobby. More than $200 million was spent by opponents of  the rule--the oil and gas industry and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--on  political lobbying and campaign contributions. According to a report in  POLITICO, when our newly confirmed Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson,  was the CEO of Exxon Mobil, he personally lobbied vigorously against  transparency and disclosure, saying that if other people knew how much  his company paid foreign governments, it would be bad for his business.  In fact, Rex Tillerson said that there was one country in particular  where this rule would be hard for Exxon--Russia.   Another Republican myth is that U.S. companies are at a competitive  [[Page S744]]  disadvantage because non-U.S. companies do not have to make the same  disclosures and the rule applies only to public companies--not true.  The U.S. law covers all oil, gas, and mining companies listed on U.S.  stock exchanges--not simply companies based in the United States. This  includes BP, Shell, and Total, as well as leading state-owned oil  companies from China and Brazil, such as PetroChina and Petrobras.   Republicans also claim that this rule increases prices at the pump-- again, not true. Corruption costs oil and mining companies millions of  dollars every year from instability and fragility in resource-rich  countries, which contributes to increased operating risks, waste,  inefficiency, and delays.   When leaders tap a country's oil revenues to keep themselves in  power, it is called petro-authoritarianism. When the United States  allows companies to secretly pay authoritarian governments for rights  to their petroleum and mineral resources, we become implicit in the  resulting human poverty and rights abuses. We cannot let that stand,  which is why we have this SEC reporting requirement.   I urged my colleagues to vote no on this effort to kill the important  protections provided by the SEC rule regarding transparency for  extractive industry payments to foreign governments. We should be  putting human rights interests ahead of the financial interests of a  few powerful oil companies. That is why I urged my colleagues to vote  against putting the profits of industry above the interests of our  Nation and lesser developed nations all over the world.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the  Sessions nomination for Attorney General, but I also want to express my  very strong opposition to Senator McConnell's effort to deny Senator  Elizabeth Warren the opportunity to express her point of view.   There are two separate issues. No. 1, this is the Senate. The  American people expect from us a vigorous debate on the important  issues facing this country. I think all of us are aware that issues of  civil rights, issues of voter suppression, issues of criminal justice  reform are enormous issues that people from one end of this country  feel very strongly about. Those are issues that the next Attorney  General of the United States will be dealing with.   So clearly we need a vigorous discussion regarding the qualifications  of President Trump's nominee, Jeff Sessions, to be Attorney General. We  need to hear all points of view. The idea that a letter and a statement  made by Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King, Jr., a  letter that she wrote, could not be presented and spoken about on the  floor of the Senate is, to me, incomprehensible.   It comes at a time when we have a President who has initiated, and I  hope it will not stand, a ban on Muslims entering the United States of  America. We have a President who refers to a judge who issues a ruling  in opposition to the President as a so-called judge, which tells every  judge in America that they will be insulted and marginalized by this  President if they dare to disagree with him.   I was under the impression we had three separate branches of  government: Congress, the President, and the Judiciary, equal branches,  not to be insulted because one branch disagrees with another branch.   Here we are now on the floor of the Senate and one of our outstanding  Senators, Ms. Warren of Massachusetts, brings forth a statement made by  one of the heroines, one of the great leaders of the civil rights of  the United States of America, a statement that she made before the  Senate Judiciary Committee on March 13, 1986.   Anyone who knows anything about Coretta Scott King understands, this  is not a vicious woman; this is not a woman who is engaged in personal  attacks. This is a woman who stood up and fought for civil rights, for  dignity, for justice for her whole life. Yet when Senator Warren read  her statement, she was told that she could no longer participate in  this debate over Senator Sessions' nomination, which I regard as an  outrage.   I want the American people to make a decision on whether we should be  able to look at Senator Sessions' record and hear from one of the  heroines of the civil rights movement.   This is the statement of Coretta Scott King on the nomination of  Jefferson Beauregard Sessions for the U.S. District Court, Southern  District of Alabama, made before the Senate Judiciary Committee on  Thursday, March 13, 1986, and this is what the statement is about. Let  the American people judge.   This is from Coretta Scott King:         Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:        Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to express my       strong opposition to the nomination of Jefferson Sessions for       a  [[Page S916]]       federal district judgeship for the Southern District of       Alabama. My longstanding commitment which I shared with my       husband, Martin, to protect and enhance the rights of Black       Americans, rights which include equal access to the       democratic process, compels me to testify today.        Civil rights leaders, including my husband and Albert       Turner, have fought long and hard to achieve free and       unfettered access to the ballot box. Mr. Sessions has used       the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of       the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to       serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to       happen. Mr. Sessions' conduct as U.S. Attorney, from his       politically-motivated voting fraud prosecutions to his       indifference toward criminal violations of civil rights laws,       indicates that he lacks the temperament, fairness, and       judgment to be a federal judge.        The Voting Rights Act was, and still is, vitally important       to the future of democracy in the United States. I was       privileged to join Martin and many others during the Selma to       Montgomery march for voting rights in 1965. Martin was       particularly impressed by the determination to get the       franchise of blacks in Selma and neighboring Perry County. As       he wrote, ``Certainly no community in the history of the       Negro struggle has responded with the enthusiasm of Selma and       her neighboring town of Marion. Where Birmingham depended       largely upon students and unemployed adults to participate in       nonviolent protest of the denial of the franchise, Selma has       involved fully 10 per cent of the Negro population in active       demonstrations, and at least half the Negro population of       Marion was arrested on one day.'' Martin was referring of       course to a group that included the defendants recently       prosecuted for assisting elderly and illiterate blacks to       exercise that franchise. In fact, Martin anticipated from the       depth of their commitment 20 years ago, that a united       political organization would remain in Perry County long       after other marchers had left. This organization, the Perry       County Civil League, started by Mr. Turner, Mr. Hogue, and       others, as Martin predicted, continued ``to direct the drive       for votes and other rights.'' In the years since the Voting       Rights Act was passed, Black Americans in Marion, Selma, and       elsewhere have made important strides in their struggle to       participate actively in the electoral process. The number of       Blacks registered to vote in key Southern states has doubled       since 1965. This would not have been possible without the       Voting Rights Act.        However, Blacks still fall far short of having equal       participation in the electoral process. Particularly in the       South, efforts continue to be made to deny Blacks access to       the polls, even where Blacks constitute the majority of the       voters. It has been a long up-hill struggle to keep alive the       vital legislation that protects the most fundamental right to       vote. A person who has exhibited so much hostility to the       enforcement of those laws, and thus, to the exercise of those       rights by Black people should not be elevated to the federal       bench.        The irony of Mr. Sessions' nomination is that, if       confirmed, he will be given life tenure for doing with a       federal prosecution what the local sheriffs accomplished       twenty years ago with clubs and cattle prods. Twenty years       ago, when we marched from Selma to Montgomery, the fear of       voting was real, as the broken bones and bloody heads in       Selma and Marion bore witness. As my husband wrote at the       time, ``it was not just a sick imagination that conjured up       the vision of a public official, sworn to uphold the law, who       forced an inhuman march upon hundreds of Negro children; who       ordered the Rev. James Bevel to be chained to his sickbed;       who clubbed a Negro woman registrant, and who callously       inflicted repeated brutalities and indignities upon       nonviolent Negroes, peacefully petitions for their       constitutional right to vote.''        Free exercise of voting rights is so fundamental to       American democracy that we cannot tolerate any form of       infringement of those rights. Of all the groups who have been       disenfranchised in our nation's history, none has struggled       longer or suffered more in the attempt to win the vote than       Black citizens. No group has had access to the ballot box       denied so persistently and intently. Over the past century, a       broad array of schemes have been used in attempts to block       the Black vote. The range of techniques developed with the       purpose of repressing black voting rights run the gamut from       the straightforward application of brutality against black       citizens who tried to vote to such legalized frauds as       ``grandfather clause'' exclusions and rigged literacy tests.        The actions taken by Mr. Sessions in regard to the 1984       voting fraud prosecutions represent just one more technique       used to intimidate Black voters and thus deny them this most       precious franchise. The investigations into the absentee       voting process were conducted only in the Black Belt       counties where blacks had finally achieved political power       in the local government. Whites had been using the       absentee process to their advantage for years without       incident. Then, when Blacks; realizing its strength, began       to use it with success, criminal investigations were       begun.        In these investigations, Mr. Sessions, as U.S. Attorney,       exhibited an eagerness to bring to trial and convict three       leaders of the Perry County Civil League including Albert       Turner despite evidence clearly demonstrating their innocence       of any wrongdoing. Furthermore, in initiating the case, Mr.       Sessions ignored allegations of similar behavior by whites,       choosing instead to chill the exercise of the franchise by       blacks by his misguided investigation. In fact, Mr. Sessions       sought to punish older black civil rights activists,       advisors, and colleagues of my husband, who had been key       figures in the civil rights movement in the 1960's. These       were persons who, realizing the potential of the absentee       vote among Blacks, had learned to use the process within the       bounds of the legality and had taught others to do the same.       The only sin they committed was being too successful in       gaining votes.        The scope and character of the investigations conducted by       Mr. Sessions also warrant grave concern. Witnesses were       selectively chosen in accordance with the favorability of       their testimony to the government's case. Also, the       prosecution illegally withheld from the defense critical       statements made by witnesses. Witnesses who did testify were       pressured and intimidated into submitting the ``correct''       testimony. Many elderly blacks were visited multiple times by       the FBI who then hauled them over 180 miles by bus to a grand       jury in Mobile when they could more easily have testified at       a grand jury twenty miles away in Selma. These voters, and       others, have announced they are now never going to vote       again.        I urge you to consider carefully Mr. Sessions' conduct in       these matters. Such a review, I believe, raises serious       questions about his commitment to the protection of the       voting rights of all American citizens and consequently his       fair and unbiased judgment regarding this fundamental right.       When the circumstances and facts surrounding the indictments       of Al Turner, his wife, Evelyn, and Spencer Hogue are       analyzed, it becomes clear that the motivation was political,       and the result frightening--the wide-scale chill of the       exercise of the ballot for blacks, who suffered so much to       receive that right in the first place. Therefore, it is my       strongly-held view that the appointment of Jefferson Sessions       to the Federal bench would irreparably damage the work of my       husband, Al Turner, and countless others who risked their       lives and freedom over the past twenty years to ensure equal       participation in our democratic system.        The exercise of the franchise is an essential means by       which our citizens ensure that those who are governing will       be responsible. My husband called it the number one civil       right. The denial of access to the ballot box ultimately       results in the denial of other fundamental rights. For, it is       only when the poor and disadvantaged are empowered that they       are able to participate actively in the solutions to their       own problems.        We still have a long way to go before we can say that       minorities no longer need to be concerned about       discrimination at the polls. Blacks, Hispanics, Native       Americans and Asian Americans are grossly underrepresented at       every level of government in America. If we are going to make       our timeless dream of justice through democracy a reality, we       must take every possible step to ensure that the spirit and       intent of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fifteenth       Amendment of the Constitution is honored.        The federal courts hold a unique position in our       constitutional system, ensuring that minorities and other       citizens without political power have a forum in which to       vindicate their rights. Because of this unique role, it is       essential that the people selected to be Federal judges       respect the basic tenets of our legal system: respect for       individual rights and a commitment to equal justice for all.       The integrity of the Courts, and thus the rights they       protect, can only be maintained if citizens feel confident       that those selected as federal judges will be able to judge       with fairness others holding differing views.        I do not believe Jefferson Sessions possesses the requisite       judgment, competence, and sensitivity to the rights       guaranteed by the Federal civil rights laws to qualify for       appointment to the federal district court. Based on his       record, I believe his confirmation would have a devastating       effect on not only the judicial system in Alabama, but also       on the progress we have made everywhere toward fulfilling my       husband's dream that he envisioned over twenty years ago. I       therefore urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to deny his       confirmation.        I thank you for allowing me to share my views.    That is the letter of Coretta Scott King, one of the great leaders of  our civil rights movement, who, along with her husband and many others,  finally managed to get passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   That is it. That is the letter Senator Elizabeth Warren wanted to  communicate to other Members of the Senate as part of the discussion as  to whether Jeff Sessions should become our next Attorney General.   Let me say that I will vote against Jeff Sessions for a number of  reasons, but the idea that in the United States Senate, the same exact  letter that I just read and the American people have heard it--was  there some kind of vicious personal attack?   This is a letter written by one of the leaders of the civil rights  movement, expressing strong concerns about Jeff Sessions before the  Judiciary Committee in 1986, opposing his nomination  [[Page S917]]  to be a Federal judge. Yet Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of our leading  Senators, was denied the right to read that letter to inform fellow  Senators and the American people.   I think Leader McConnell owes Senator Warren an apology, and I  believe it is unconscionable and outrageous that Senator Warren not be  allowed to participate in the discussion about whether Jeff Sessions  becomes our next Attorney General.   There is a great fear in this country right now, starting at the  White House, where we have a President who has issued a ban on Muslim  visitors coming into this country. There is a fear that we have a  President who denigrates a judge as a ``so-called judge'' because this  judge issued an opinion in disagreement with the President, that we are  moving in a direction which is un-American, which is moving us toward  an authoritarian society.    We pride ourselves as a nation because when we have differences of  opinion, we debate those differences and we tolerate differences of  opinion. That is what democracy is about in our country, that is what  freedom of speech is about, and that is what debate is about here in  the U.S. Senate.   So I am going to vote against Jeff Sessions to become our next  Attorney General, but I am even more alarmed about the decision of the  majority leader here in the Senate to deny one of our leading Senators  the right to voice her opinion, the right to put into the Congressional  Record what I have just said. And if Mr. McConnell or anybody else  wants to deny me the right to debate Jeff Sessions' qualifications, go  for it. But I am here. I will participate in the debate. I will oppose  Jeff Sessions. And I think Senator Warren is owed an apology.   With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in  the Record the statement of Coretta Scott King.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.    Thank you very much.    Thank you very much.    Thank you very much.    Thank you very much.    Thank you very much.    Thank you very much.    Mr. President, I think many millions of Americans  perceive, as I do, that these are not normal times.   We have had a new President of the United States who called a judge a  ``so-called judge'' because he dared to disagree with President Trump's  decision on the ban of Muslims coming into this country.   We have a President who attacks the media in this country as fake  news; everything they are saying is a lie. We have a President who goes  before the troops--men and women in the American military--and starts  talking about politics. It is very clear to me that we have a new  President who really does not understand the Constitution of the United  States of America, who does not understand the separation of powers in  the Constitution, and in that context, we need an Attorney General who  will have the courage to tell the President of the United States when  he is acting in a dangerous, authoritarian, or unconstitutional way.   I have known Jeff Sessions for a number of years, and personally, I  like Jeff Sessions. But I do not believe at this moment in history,  when we need people around this President to explain the Constitution  to him, that Jeff Sessions will be the Attorney General to do that.   I am deeply concerned about voter suppression in this country. I am  deeply concerned that, as a result of the Supreme Court's gutting of  the Voting Rights Act, we have, in State after State after State,  Governors and legislatures that are working overtime to make it harder  for poor people, people of color, older people, young people to  participate in the political process.   Today in the United States, we have, compared to the rest of the  world, a low voter turnout. Only about 60 percent of eligible voters in  America cast a ballot. Our job--whether you are conservative,  Republican, Progressive, Independent, Democrat--whatever you are, if  you believe in democracy, what you should believe in is bringing more  people into the political process, increasing our voter turnout, not  working as hard as you can to suppress the vote.   I want an Attorney General of the United States of America to tell  those Governors, to tell those attorneys general all over this country  that as Attorney General of the United States, he will fight them tooth  and nail in every way legally possible to stop the suppression of the  vote in State after State throughout this country.   We have the dubious distinction in this country of having more people  in jail than any other nation on Earth. We have about 2.2 million  Americans. We are spending about $80 billion a year locking them up,  and the people who are disproportionately in jail are African American,  Latino, Native American.   I want an Attorney General who understands that the current criminal  justice system is failing, that we have to figure out ways to keep  people from getting into jail by investing in education, in jobs, and  that incarceration and more jails are not the answers to the crisis we  face within criminal justice. I honestly do not believe that Jeff  Sessions is that person.   In recent years, we have made significant progress in allowing  people--regardless of their sexual orientation--to get married and to  have the full rights of American citizenship. I do not believe that  Jeff Sessions will be the Attorney General who will be supportive of  LGBT rights.   We have some 11 million undocumented people in this country. I  believe that most Americans see the solution as comprehensive  immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.   Today we have some 700,000 people who are DACA recipients, who have  come out of the shadows and trusted the Federal Government to protect  them. We need an Attorney General who is sensitive to the needs of DACA  recipients, who will pursue humane immigration policies, and advocate  for the need of comprehensive immigration reform. I do not believe that  Jeff Sessions will be that Attorney General.   So, Mr. President, for all of those reasons and more, I will be  voting against Jeff Sessions to become the next Attorney General of the  United States.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.
