 Mr. Chairman, I want to tell you that the last speaker said  this was rushed through Congress. It took 2 years to write this  legislation. Even by congressional standards, this was not rushed  through Congress.   We have waited 7 years to hear the alternative, and the gentlewoman  from Tennessee has all of these plans over there, and she says: we have  got plans right here. How about one plan that we might have a chance to  focus on?   They have had the luxury of saying: we are going to do a better job  without telling us what the better job entails.   The Governor of Massachusetts recently wrote to our delegation and to  the leadership in the House and said: During the ACA repeal-replace  deliberations, it is important that coverage gains, patient protections  and market stability be maintained.   Let me give you some numbers from Massachusetts. 97.2 percent of the  residents of Massachusetts have health care. 100 percent of the  children in Massachusetts now have health care.   This is an effort at rhetoric. We want to hear what the plan is. We  want to understand what the alternative is. We want to know precisely  what is going to be included and, just as importantly, what will be  excluded from the benefits that this Affordable Care Act has given to  the American people.   Twenty-two million Americans now have healthcare insurance who didn't  have it. Nine percent of the American people are without adequate  health care. We should be fixing that.    I have heard this, in the 29 years I have been in Congress,  time and again. Till an honorable effort is put forward, you know what  the Republicans should be saying to us right now? Let's get on,  together, with making it all work, instead of saying repeal and  replace. How empty is that rhetoric?
