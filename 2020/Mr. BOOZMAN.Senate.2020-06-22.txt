 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Carolyn  Ashcraft on her retirement as State librarian and director of the  Arkansas State Library after 15 years of transformative leadership.   Carolyn has a dedication to the State of Arkansas and a passion for  books, and her departure from a career that blended the two will leave  a significant void in Arkansas' library community. Her enthusiasm for  libraries has been evident since childhood, leading to an invitation to  serve as a student library aide in sixth grade. She went on to serve in  a similar position at the university level while earning her degree in  English at the University of Arkansas at Monticello. She continued her  education at the University of Alabama, where she earned a master's  degree in library science. In 1981, Carolyn launched her professional  career at the Grant County Library and next served as director at the  Saline County Library. She held this position until she started with  the Arkansas State Library in 1993, where she served in various  positions, including deputy director in the library development unit  before being selected as State librarian in 2005.   Carolyn's career and the accomplishments of the Arkansas library  system  [[Page S3126]]  during her tenure as State librarian testify to her dedication and  influential direction. Under her guidance, our libraries adapted  emerging technologies. She helped facilitate the transition to  digitization, expanding digital programs such as the Traveler Statewide  Digital Resource Program and establishing the Arkansas Digital Library  Consortium in 2018. She also oversaw the relocation of the agency and  its collection of books, State and Federal documents, Library for the  Blind materials, and other documents.   Carolyn is known for having an unrivaled and encompassing knowledge  of libraries, as evidenced by her involvement in both State and  national professional library associations. The list of such  organizations is lengthy and includes the Arkansas Library Association,  American Library Association, the Association for Rural and Small  Libraries, and Chief Officers of State Library Agencies.   I thank Carolyn for her contributions to Arkansas during her career  of dedicated service, guidance, and support of our public libraries and  library services. She will be missed, but I am confident she will enjoy  her time in retirement.                            ____________________
