 Madam Speaker, 9 years ago today, Aurora, Colorado, faced  an unbelievable tragedy when a shooter opened fire in a movie theater.   Madam Speaker, 12 people lost their lives, 70 were injured, and  countless others are still impacted by the trauma of that day.   Every year, Aurora and the greater Colorado community come together  to remember the lives lost and the trauma. We also come together to  recognize the everyday heroes that stepped up to help their neighbors  and loved ones. Their heroism saved lives.   I thank my friend and colleague, Representative Ed Perlmutter for,  again, offering a resolution to designate July 28 as National Heroes  Day. This year, in particular, we recognize the everyday heroes that  have helped us withstand this pandemic, our frontline workers,  scientists, and healthcare professionals, and the first responders who  stand on the front lines every day.   As we reflect today, let us also be galvanized into action. In the 9  years since the Aurora tragedy, little has been done at the Federal  level to reduce gun violence and mass shootings. Enough is enough. I am  here, in part, because I have been inspired by my constituents who  endured incredible tragedy 9 years ago and have directed that pain to  fight for change. Let us not grow numb to the pain of this day, but  let's continue to work toward meaningful and lasting change.                            ____________________
