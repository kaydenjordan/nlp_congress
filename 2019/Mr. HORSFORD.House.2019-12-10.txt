 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R.  3, the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   Across America, seniors and families are struggling to afford the  prescription drugs they need to stay healthy.   One of my constituents from the rural part of my district, Christie  Baldock from Yerington, Nevada, was receiving tele-healthcare through  her Senior Care Plus coverage before her health plan cut its rural  coverage. Until she enrolls in another coverage, she will have to pay  out of pocket for her prescriptions. Her insulin alone will be $500  each month.   Under H.R. 3, some commonly used insulins can cost as little as $400  per  [[Page H9956]]  year. For Christie and for the 30.3 million Americans who live with  diabetes, we must pass H.R. 3 and lower drug costs now.                            ____________________
