 Mr. Speaker, why should the United States of America  be the only rich country in the world that cannot protect our families  from gun violence?   It doesn't have to be this way. In fact, there are a number of States  that have enacted gun safety protections. And in those States that have  done so, there are fewer gun deaths and there are fewer gun injuries.   My State of Oregon is one of those that has enacted them, in part,  because of votes of the people, not politicians. This proposal would  strip away protections of Oregonians because there are 12 States that,  basically, if you are 21 and have a pulse, you can carry a firearm.  Others have much less-restrictive proposals.   This eliminates the ability of States to protect its own citizens. It  is shameful. It is wrong.   Someday, Congress will come to its senses and enact reasonable gun  safety legislation for the country. But until we do, for heaven's sake,  don't punish States that have accepted their responsibility to protect  their families.
