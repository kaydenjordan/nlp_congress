 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 2:15 tomorrow, all postcloture time on  the Collins nomination be considered expired; further, that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today, I am introducing Federal  legislation to make 21 the new minimum age for purchasing any tobacco  product anywhere in the United States. Let me say that again--a new age  nationwide for purchasing anything classified as a tobacco product-- cigarettes, e-cigarettes, vapor products, and everything else. It  shouldn't be 18 any longer; it should be 21, and this legislation will  make that happen.   I recognize I might seem like an unusual candidate to lead this  charge. I am the senior Senator from Kentucky. I have consistently  stood up for our Kentucky farmers, including our tobacco farmers. I  championed the tobacco buyout back in 2004. But actually my long  experience with this subject and my commitment to farm families are  part of what has convinced me that now is the right time to do this. I  would like to say a few words about why.   Tobacco has been deeply intertwined in our Nation's history from the  very beginning. Native Americans grew it and used it before European  explorers ever arrived. John Rolfe--the famous settler who later  married Pocahontas--kick-started Virginia's export economy using  foreign tobacco seeds in 1612.   By the eve of the Revolution, tobacco was a major export and a huge  part of  [[Page S2965]]  our colony's prosperity. Many tobacco farmers were energetic early  backers of independence. George Washington grew tobacco at Mount  Vernon, at first as his primary crop. In Benjamin Franklin's  newspapers, some of the earliest ads for American tobacco ran alongside  the essays urging Americans to stand up for freedom. Several million  pounds of tobacco were actually used as collateral to help secure the  loans they needed from France. Years later, Lewis and Clark used it as  a peace offering to the Native Tribes they met while they were headed  west. And, like too many other parts of early American history,  tobacco's development was closely linked with the sin of slavery.   So tobacco has been a part of this country right from the start--so  much so, in fact, that right here in the U.S. Capitol, artisans  replaced the traditional designs in many of the Roman-style columns and  chiseled American tobacco leaves in their place. Right here in this  Chamber, we still have some old spittoons. We used to have Senate snuff  boxes filled on the taxpayers' dime. The residue on the floors used to  be so considerable that Charles Dickens warned fellow visitors not to  pick up anything they dropped unless they had a pair of gloves on. One  of the Senators Dickens actually admired most from that visit was Henry  Clay. And, befitting the Commonwealth of Kentucky and our own rich  history with the crop, that legendary Kentuckian was also a legendary  tobacco enthusiast.   When the first settlers came over the Appalachians into what is now  Kentucky, tobacco offered the perfect opportunity to jump-start their  new lives. A pocketful of seeds was enough for a downpayment on a new,  economically secure future for your family. Kentucky had fertile soil.  We had favorable summers. We had inland waterways and access to the  Mississippi for shipping.   Before long, burley tobacco was a staple crop for literally tens of  thousands of Kentucky farms. For a time, we led even Virginia and North  Carolina as the No. 1 tobacco State. Generations of farmers, even if  they weren't primarily tobacco growers, would plant a little corner of  it to help float the rest of the operation. Farming tobacco put shoes  on kids' feet. It put dinner on the table. For many in Kentucky,  tobacco made the American dream possible. It is a central pillar of our  State's history.   In fact, back in the early 1900s, there was literally an armed  conflict called the Black Patch War that revolved around tobacco  prices. Farmers were against farmers. We are talking about beatings and  horse whippings. Barns were burned. Eventually, martial law was  declared in part of Kentucky. We are talking about neighbor-on-neighbor  violence that was reminiscent of the Civil War--all over tobacco  prices. The conflict was actually memorialized in the book ``Night  Rider,'' the first novel by Robert Penn Warren, the famous Kentucky- born writer who won multiple Pulitzers and served as U.S. Poet  Laureate.   A few decades later, in the late 1930s, Senator Alben Barkley--the  only other Kentuckian to serve as majority leader--set up a top-down  quota system that got Washington heavily involved in the tobacco market  to try to provide price special assurance for farmers.   So when I first arrived here in the Senate in 1985, more than two- thirds of Kentucky's farmers grew some tobacco, and it accounted for  almost half of the value of all the agricultural production in my  State. But, of course, demand for U.S. tobacco has gone down as, among  other factors, our knowledge of the health consequences has gone up.   Even as early as the late 1800s, when the transition began from all  the varied forms of tobacco toward the modern, mass-marketed, mass- produced cigarette industry, there was concern. Those concerns went  mainstream with the Surgeon General's report on smoking in the 1960s,  and of course our understanding has only grown with more research. By  2004, these concerns, plus foreign competition, were making that quota  system less of a helpful backstop and more of a stranglehold. So there  was interest on all sides in unwinding this archaic system without  pulling the rug out from under our growers.   I secured the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act, known as the  tobacco buyout, which President Bush 43 signed into law. It wound down  the special treatment for tobacco, while also providing the farmers who  had invested heavily in these quotas 10 years of buyout payments to  ease their transition.   What has happened since then has been a very exciting story. Just as  Kentucky farmers once led the Nation in cultivating tobacco and helped  write that important chapter in American history, they are now helping  to write the next chapter of innovation.   We aren't interested in banning tobacco. We aren't interested in  turning our backs on adults who choose to use these products or  pretending we aren't proud of the Kentuckians who still grow it. But as  the market has settled, many of our farmers have seized the opportunity  to try new things.   Just a few years before the buyout, almost 30,000 Kentucky farms were  still growing tobacco. It still made up about one-quarter of all of our  farmers' cash receipts statewide. But the 10-year buyout program ended  in 2014. These days, instead of 30,000 farms growing tobacco in the  Commonwealth, it is more like 2,600. It still brings in hundreds of  millions of dollars, but now it is only 6 percent of our total receipts  from agriculture. Freed from the sunk costs of a quota system, our  farmers have been able to participate in a more free market and reap  the benefits. In fact, overall cash receipts from agriculture actually  set a new record in 2014--the very same year the buyout ended. I am  proud the 2004 policy I achieved has been a success. Kentucky farmers  have taken the ball, however, and they have run with it.   I mentioned that George Washington initially planted a whole lot of  tobacco at Mount Vernon before a variety of factors led him to scale it  back and experiment with other things. One of those new crops was hemp.  That was all the way back in the 1770s. As usual, George Washington  knew what he was doing.   Industrial hemp is making a comeback today, and Kentucky farmers  asked for help to change the outdated Federal laws that confused the  plant with cannabis and prevented them from exploring the crop.   In 2014, I fought and won for farmers the right to explore hemp  through State pilot projects. In last year's farm bill, my provision  finished the job and made hemp a fully legal commodity nationwide. Now  we are seeing the future take shape right before our eyes. Farmers in  99 of 120 counties are growing hemp. Processors are reporting more than  $50 million in gross sales. And this is just one of the new crops our  farmers are using to chart new directions and connect Kentucky's past  with its future.   I realize this has been quite a history lesson, but Kentuckians are  used to hearing sweeping statements about our tobacco industry from  folks outside the State who know none of this history and yet have no  problem forming strong opinions. We are proud of our past. We are proud  of who we are. But Kentucky farmers don't want their children to get  hooked on tobacco products while they are in middle school or high  school any more than any parents anywhere want that to happen. Kentucky  is proud of what we make, but we also take pride in the health and  development of our children.   The sad reality is that Kentucky has been the home to the highest  rates of cancer in the country. We lead the entire Nation in the  percentage of cancer cases tied directly to smoking. Our State once  grew tobacco like none other, and now we are being hit by the health  consequences of tobacco use like none other.   Nationwide, we are in the middle of a completely new public health  epidemic that is really threatening our progress in youth tobacco use-- the use of e-cigarettes and vaping. This spike has been concentrated in  teenagers--and not just 18-year-olds. Moms and dads across the country  are seeing their middle and high schoolers take up this new habit and  start down a deadly path that our society has previously spent decades  working hard to close down.   From 2017 to 2018, high school students' use of what are classified  as tobacco products shot up by nearly 40 percent. That is a staggering  figure, especially in a single year. That increase is driven almost  entirely by vaping.  [[Page S2966]]  The brain is still developing at this young age. When teenagers use  tobacco, they are quite literally altering their brain's chemistry and  making it more susceptible to addiction. Many young vape users aren't  buying the products themselves but sharing them with a friend. And  remember, 90 percent of adult daily smokers say they used their first  tobacco product before age 19.   Youth vaping is a public health crisis. It is our responsibility, as  parents and public servants, to do everything we can to keep these  harmful products out of high schools and out of youth culture. We need  to put the national age of purchase at 21.   That is why I am introducing this legislation in recognition of  tobacco's storied past in Kentucky and aware of the threat that all  tobacco products pose now and for future generations. I am proud to  partner on this effort with Senator Tim Kaine, who represents another  Commonwealth with a long history of growing tobacco. I know there is  interest from Members on both sides of the aisle, including Senators  Young, Romney, Schatz, and others. This is not a zero-sum choice  between farmers and public health. We can support both. We need to  support both, but the health of our children is literally at stake.   That is why I will make enacting this legislation one of my highest  priorities, and I look forward to working with all of our colleagues to  make that happen.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.  [[Page S2967]]    There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1541         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 19, S. 163.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. Tuesday,  May 21; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to executive session  and resume consideration of the Collins nomination. Finally, I ask that  the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the  weekly conference meetings.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order following the remarks of Senator Whitehouse.
