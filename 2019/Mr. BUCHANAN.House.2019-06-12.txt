 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment.   My amendment instructs the National Institutes of Health to designate  $6.25 million to research the long-term effects of red tide and other  harmful algal blooms on human health.   As you may know, last year, Florida suffered from one of the longest  and most devastating bouts of red tide in our State's history. I  witnessed firsthand as thousands of tons of dead marine life washed  ashore our local beaches, causing significant hardship on both our  local residents and county governments.   While some of the short-term health impacts of red tide are well  documented, as swimmers and beach goers often suffer from severe  respiratory issues, skin irritation, and rashes, the long-term health  effects of exposure to red tide are largely unknown. That is why my  amendment will devote critical resources to help us better understand  the lasting health impacts on people exposed to red tide.   I urge the amendment's adoption, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
