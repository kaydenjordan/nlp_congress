 Mr. President, I lift my intent to object to Executive  Calendar No. 262, the promotion of Lt. Gen. Timothy Haugh to the grade  of general and, consequently, to be the Director of the National  Security Agency--NSA--and commander of U.S. Cyber Command. I have  received the information I sought from the Department of Defense and  NSA in connection with the nomination.                            ____________________
