 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, this amendment deals with a small community that is kind  of circled around by the Gila National Forest.   This amendment basically is going to allow the Forest Service to sell  parcels of Forest Service land to the village of Santa Clara. It is a  small village. About 2,000 people live in it. They, like many of our  mountain communities, like many of our communities in the Forest  Service, are slowly starving to death.   The land that the Forest Service would sell to them is adjacent to  the village. It is not a part of the larger national forest. It is just  an isolated parcel. The Forest Service does not want to manage this  land.   It is in the state that it is in because it was set apart back in  1869 as a part of the Fort Bayard Military Reservation. Because the  land is reserved as a military post, it cannot be disposed of in the  normal fashion by the Forest Service. They must be released by law.   Back in 1968, there was a bill that released other parcels of Fort  Bayard to be sold and to be distributed to the State. This parcel just  was not included in that for some reason, so the amendment steps around  and includes that now to where the Forest Service would be allowed to  dispose of the land.   It would have to be appraised. It would be sold through normal  processes. It is just that it requires a law to do it. It cannot go any  other way.   The village is desperately in need of expansion room. Like I said,  this Forest Service land butts up against the village and stops their  growth, stops their economic potential, and it is a very key piece of  property for the village, but it is not a key piece of property for the  Forest Service.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  noncontroversial amendment, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment would reauthorize the Collaborative Forest Landscape  Restoration Program, CFLRP, for another 5-year period. This program was  initiated in 2009, and, basically, it aims to restore vital sections of  our national forestlands.   There are two projects in New Mexico, the Zuni Mountains and the  Southwest Jemez, with over 420,000 acres total, that would be covered  under this collaborative project.   The Zuni Mountains project supports one of the last mills in New  Mexico. We used to have 123 mills that processed timber. Now we are  down to just one or two. That destruction in the capacity and the  infrastructure for our national forest has been devastating to our  ability to really accomplish projects of selective thinning and  balanced management of our forests.   The extension of the program is going to provide enough certainty so  that this last mill operator can make investments that will reduce the  cost of conducting forest management activities in western New Mexico.   If we lose the mill, if it does, in fact, close--which should not be  an option--it is going to increase the cost of the projects due to  transportation costs. So it makes sense for the government, it makes  sense for the U.S. Forest Service, the taxpayer, and the local economy  to keep this mill open and to find others that would reopen with these  collaborative projects that come under this program.   This program is a good starting point, and, when paired with other  reforms that open up more acreage for treatment, it is going to  increase the profitability of restoration projects. That will, in turn,  save taxpayers money.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  noncontroversial amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
