 Mr. Speaker, a lot of history was made last night. I,  too, want to join my New England colleagues to say congratulations to  the New England Patriots on an extraordinary victory at Super Bowl LI.   A lot of history was made. This was the greatest comeback in Super  Bowl history where our team was down by 25 points in the third quarter  to come on to victory. It is the only team to win in Super Bowl history  in overtime; and it is an incredible display of the extraordinary  talent of Tom Brady, the only quarterback in history to win five Super  Bowls. This establishes Tom Brady unequivocally as the greatest  quarterback ever.   Also, congratulations to Bill Belichick for his extraordinary  coaching, to Jonathan and Robert Kraft, and the whole Patriots  organization for all that they have done.   This was a great and wonderful night and an important example and  display of determination and persistence. It is really a lesson for all  of us to never stop fighting and, for young people, the importance in  believing in yourself.   Mr. Speaker, the victory last night by our great team, the New  England Patriots, raised the spirits of our entire Nation.   Congratulations to the Pats. Thank you for a great season and thank  you for a great victory last night.                            ____________________
