 Mr. Speaker, we know the activities of the Chinese  Communist Party under the leadership of Xi, the worst genocide since  World War II, not just according to the United States--multiple  administrations of the United States, but also according to the U.N.-- Hong Kong, South China Sea, threats to India, and threats to Taiwan. Xi  is telling his country to prepare for war.   Here at home, we have the cornering of critical supply chains and  dependencies on China that is being done deliberately as they steal  their way to the top through our intellectual property, spying on the  Federal Reserve, flooding our key institutions, including academia,  with money, buying up farmland.   Mr. Speaker, this is a whole-of-government, whole-of-society  challenge that we have never before faced in American history. That is  why we need a committee like this. That is why we need a committee that  spans all of these jurisdictions, and we certainly need the leadership  of my good friend and colleague, Representative   Mike Gallagher.
