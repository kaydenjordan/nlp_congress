 Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Wenstrup for the time  and thank both him and Dr. Davis for the work they have done to get  this bipartisan bill to the floor.   I rise in strong support of this 5-year reauthorization of the  Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, which  honors our late colleague and friend, Jackie Walorski.   Jackie spent every day working in this body to improve the lives of  families in Indiana and across the country, and enacting this bill,  which enhances the ability of States and communities to help at-risk  new parents care for and support their children, I think is a fitting  tribute.   I led the last MIECHV reauthorization 5 years ago when I chaired the  Human Resources Subcommittee, and this bill actually enhances  everything that MIECHV does right.   It is a preventative program which keeps kids out of the child  welfare system and saves money.   It uses fact-based methods to ensure our support dollars are well  spent.   It asks States to provide matching funds, so they have some skin in  the game when utilizing this funding, and it is paid for within our  committee's jurisdiction without raising taxes.   MIECHV is a model for how our safety net should work, and I strongly  support this bill.
