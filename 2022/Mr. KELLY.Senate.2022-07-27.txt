 Mr. President, just a few minutes ago, after a year and a  half of work, we have finally--finally--passed our plan to boost  microchip manufacturing in the United States.   Microchips go in nearly everything we use. They are in the TV or the  cell phone that folks are watching this on, and they are in lifesaving  medical devices, and they are in our most advanced weapons systems.   The United States invented microchips, and, once, we produced 40  percent of the world's supply. Today, we only produce about 12 percent,  and we don't produce any of the most advanced microchips.   Now, that leaves us vulnerable to disruptions in the supply chain,  like the current microchip shortage that has halted production lines  and driven up prices.   If you have recently tried to buy a car--a new car--and waited months  or paid more than you were expecting, the microchip shortage is a big  reason why.   So we have worked on a plan, Republicans and Democrats, with  incentives to make sure the world's leading microchip manufacturers  grow their operations here in the United States instead of in China or  Europe. It also boosts research so that the most advanced chips in the  world are invented and produced right here in the United States. That  will mean tens of thousands of new jobs in places like Arizona, which  is already a microchip hub, poised to grow as Intel and the Taiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Company expand and build new manufacturing  facilities.   That is all made possible by this legislation, and it creates jobs,  not just with those companies but also with the companies that supply  them the tools and packaging for their products. And these are great- paying jobs, and many  [[Page S3716]]  of them do not require a four-year degree.   I visited Estrella Mountain Community College just several weeks ago,  where they are training Arizonans to enter the semiconductor technician  career track with just a 10-day course followed by a guaranteed job  interview.   Now, this is an enormous opportunity to reinvent our economy for the  future, and this week, we are getting it done. This bill has now passed  the Senate, and I am confident that it will pass the House and be  signed into law.   While this process has been long, it has also shown what we can  accomplish when we work together, Republicans and Democrats.   Senators Young, Cornyn, Warner, and I first began working on this at  the beginning of last year, we found agreement, and we worked to build  support from our colleagues. Since then, we have had to overcome more  than a few roadblocks, but what matters most is that we got this done.  As a result, our country is going to once again be a leader in  microchip manufacturing, creating tens of thousands of great-paying  jobs, strengthening our national security, and lowering costs for  everyday products.    I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the  consideration of Calendar No. 433, S. Res. 623.    I ask unanimous consent the committee-reported substitute  amendment to the resolution be agreed to.    I know of no further debate on the resolution, as amended.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  amendment to the preamble be agreed to, the preamble as amended be  agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed  to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 725, which was submitted  earlier today.    I further ask that the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 726, which was  submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I further ask that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Thursday, July 28, and that following the prayer and the pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider  Executive Calendar No. 922, the nomination of Constance Milstein to be  Ambassador to the Republic of Malta, as under the previous order;  further, that at 1:45 p.m., the Senate vote on confirmation of the  Milstein nomination, with all other provisions of the previous order  remaining in effect.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:06 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, July 28, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
