 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute  in morning business.    Madam President, we are getting, perhaps, close to a  new Presidency. So there is a lot of talk about how the Senate might  handle new Cabinet people. Democrats are always lecturing Republican  Senators about approving future Biden Cabinet nominees, even if we  don't agree with them.   Now, that is pretty darn rich. In other words, they are saying  something like this: Don't follow our example from the past four years.   Or another way to put that is: Don't treat Biden nominees to the  Cabinet like we treated Trump nominees to the Cabinet.   So they seem to want two sets of rules for Republican and Democratic  Cabinet nominees, just like they want with judicial nominees.   President Obama had six Cabinet Secretaries approved by the Senate on  his Inauguration Day, without even needing a rollcall vote, so that  President Obama could hit the ground running.   President Trump had none by voice vote, and only two were approved by  rollcall votes before the President took over. Trump Cabinet and sub- Cabinet nominees, even ones who had been easily confirmed in previous  Republican administrations, faced obstruction and partisan ``nay''  votes. Many Democrat Senators who aspired to be President voted against  virtually every single Trump nominee, no matter how well qualified.   My position has always been that a President should have the ability  to choose his own Cabinet people whom he gets along with and whom he  gets along with on policy, provided, of course, that they are qualified  and will follow the law.   That is the way it should be. It is how I have approached nominees to  date. But can Senate Republicans be sure that if we employ that  standard, Democrats will play fair with the next Republican President?   I don't want retaliation for its own sake, but the threat of holding  Democratic Senators to their own standards has been our only means of  deterrence of obstruction. I want to hear from Democrats why we should  not now adopt their standards and vote down nominees based on politics.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I thank both for these clarifications of their intent.  I look forward to working with them toward these ends.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in late June, I came to the floor to  speak about the need to fix the multiemployer pension system and how  that system is failing its employees and retirees. I spoke about the  need to secure retirement benefits for the millions of Americans who  will start to see plans fail and benefits cut in the coming years if  Congress doesn't fix this problem.   For the past 2 weeks, Chairman Alexander and I were negotiating with  our Democratic colleagues to do just that--fix the system so future  retirees and retirees now would not lose out on what they were  promised. Those negotiations were very constructive, and I believe that  both sides worked in good faith. While both sides agreed to make  significant changes, in the end, we weren't able to find a compromise  that satisfied our respective principles and objectives for resolving  this situation.   Here is the hang up--time. Now at the end of the session, with the  end-of-the-year agenda and adjournment of the Congress, we just ran out  of time. So in the midst of yearend appropriations and COVID relief  negotiations, there simply wasn't enough time to reconcile our  differences on how to fix this failing system.   My hope had been to use the last 8 months to negotiate a solution in  a thoughtful and measured manner, instead of like now, in the heat of a  complex yearend bill. But sadly, those 8 months didn't produce results.   From the beginning, we have agreed that Federal funds will be needed  to solve the crisis in the short term--yes, money from the Treasury for  pension plans that are in trouble now. But we have been equally  resolute that reforms are essential to ensure the system can be self- sustaining in the long term. So we were trying to find a short-term  solution that would involve the injection of Federal dollars, but we  wanted a long-term solution that would make sure that private pension  plans were self-sustaining and not relying upon the Federal Treasury.  Otherwise, taxpayers will be perpetually subsidizing a private sector  system of employee benefit promises.   Last November, Chairman Alexander and I presented our comprehensive  approach to rescue and reform the multiemployer pension system, which  we have been working on and improving ever since. The product was  improved with an amazing amount of input from workers, retirees,  unions, employers, actuaries, academics, plan officials, and even  members of the general public. Something as big as this needed to  involve all of those people being at the table.   Today, Chairman Alexander and I will introduce a revised version of  that plan, the Chris Allen Multiemployer Pension Recapitalization and  Reform Act. This legislation served as the basis for our recent  negotiations and is the product of years of work with Chairman  Alexander to produce a serious, responsible plan that can provide  relief to failing plans and to protect retirees' benefits.   It is also designed to ensure the long-term solvency of the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation's multiemployer insurance fund, based on  the many comments and proposals we received to the original Grassley- Alexander plan released last November.   We believe this legislation would ensure that the PBGC's  multiemployer insurance fund remains solvent over the long term after  the initial rescue of the currently failing plans. But, most  importantly, this legislation would reform the system to prevent this  from happening again.   I would also like to note that the bill is named after Chris Allen,  who was a  [[Page S7593]]  dedicated member of my Finance Committee staff, who passed away nearly  1 year ago at too young of an age. Chris poured thousands of hours of  work into developing, drafting, and perfecting the Grassley-Alexander  plan. I am grateful for all the work that Chris did, and I am proud  this legislation bears his name.   I am also grateful to Andy Banducci, who helped us continue Chris's  work while on detail to the committee from the PBGC for several months  earlier this year. His expertise and commitment, especially during the  pandemic, were essential to bringing this legislation to completion.   Lastly, Mark Warren of the Finance Committee staff has led my team on  this very important issue with the help of Jamie Cummins.   This bill would not be possible without their efforts. So I thank  Mark, Jamie, Andy, and Chris for their dedicated service.   Let me close by stressing two points for my Democratic colleagues. I  appreciate the Democrats' professional and good-faith effort to try to  find an agreement to this important issue. Although we were not able to  reconcile our differences before the clock ran out, we need to carry  that work forward, and I remain ready to continue that discussion. I  want to make clear that, while the last 2 years I have been chairman of  the Finance Committee, I won't be chairman the next 2 years, and we  will be working under the leadership of the next chairman, Senator  Crapo, if Republicans continue to be in the majority.   These issues are not simple, and as I said in June, delaying the  solution is only going to make the whole effort more costly. We should  continue to work together to find a solution for the 10 million workers  and retirees in these multiemployer plans. America's retirees deserve  it.   Mr. President. I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the  Record.ZPERSONAL COMPUTER\J\019060-A17DE6-023-*****-*****-Payroll No.:  09409 -Name: debjd c6 -Folios: 15/wS-15/w430S [pickup] -Date: 12/18/20  -Subformat:                                  S. 5045         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

assumptions and methods.--Except as       provided in subparagraph (A), the determination of the       transition contribution rate for a plan year shall be based       on actuarial assumptions and methods consistent with the       minimum funding determinations made under section 431 (or, if       applicable, section 432) with respect to the legacy plan for       the plan year.        ``(F) Adjustments in rate.--The plan sponsor of a legacy       plan from time to time may adjust the transition contribution       rate or rates applicable to an employer under this paragraph       by increasing some rates and decreasing others if the actuary       certifies that such adjusted rates in combination will       produce projected contribution income for the plan year       beginning on or after the date of certification that is not       less than would be produced by the transition contribution       rates in effect at the time of the certification.        ``(G) Notice of

procedures.--Pursuant to standards       prescribed by the Secretary of Labor, the plan sponsor of a       composite plan shall adopt rules and procedures that give the       parties to the collective bargaining agreement notice of the       failure of such agreement to satisfy the transition       contribution requirements of this subsection, and a       reasonable opportunity to correct such failure, not to exceed       180 days from the date of notice given under subsection       (b)(2).        ``(4) Supplemental contributions.--A collective bargaining       agreement may provide for supplemental contributions to the       legacy plan for a plan year in excess of the transition       contribution rate determined under paragraph (2), regardless       of whether the legacy plan is

fully funded for at least three out of the       immediately preceding 5 plan years, and is projected to       remain fully funded for at least the following 4 plan years.        ``(2) Determination

present value of the plan's       liabilities, determined in accordance with the rules       prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under       sections 4219(c)(1)(D) and 4281 of Employee Retirement Income       and Security Act for multiemployer plans terminating by mass       withdrawal, as in effect for the date of the determination,       except the plan's reasonable assumption regarding the       starting date of benefits may be used.        ``(3) Other applicable rules.--Except as provided in       paragraph (2), actuarial determinations and projections under
