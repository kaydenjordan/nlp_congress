 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 7352) to amend the Small Business Act to extend the  statute of limitation for fraud by borrowers under the Paycheck  Protection Program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7352         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``PPP and Bank Fraud       Enforcement Harmonization Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. FRAUD ENFORCEMENT HARMONIZATION.         (a) Paycheck Protection Program.--Section 7(a)(36) of the       Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)(36)) is amended by       adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(W) Fraud enforcement harmonization.--Notwithstanding any       other provision of law, any criminal charge or civil       enforcement action alleging that a borrower engaged in fraud       with respect to a covered loan guaranteed under this       paragraph shall be filed not later than 10 years after the       offense was committed.''.        (b) Paycheck Protection Program Second Draw Loans.--Section       7(a)(37) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)(37)) is       amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(P) Fraud enforcement harmonization.--Notwithstanding any       other provision of law, any criminal charge or civil       enforcement action alleging that a borrower engaged in fraud       with respect to a covered loan guaranteed under this       paragraph shall be filed not later than 10 years after the       offense was committed.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank all the members on the Small Business  Committee for their work and support of the bills before us.   The legislation we are considering is, once again, a product of our  committee's bipartisanship and shows that we are committed to our  Nation's entrepreneurs.   The seven bipartisan bills we are considering will promote economic  growth on our Main Streets in numerous ways.   The first two reaffirm our commitment to being good stewards of  taxpayer dollars, and the importance of holding pandemic fraudsters  accountable for their crimes.   The second pair of bills under consideration will help small firms  attract and retain qualified employees by boosting apprenticeships and  career and technical education programs.   Finally, we will consider three bills to improve the Federal  procurement process and promote opportunities for small businesses to  secure contracts from the Federal Government.   The first bill under consideration today is H.R. 7352, the PPP and  Bank Fraud Enforcement Harmonization Act of 2022, introduced by myself  and our ranking member from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer).   H.R. 7352 sets the statute of limitations for all cases of PPP fraud  at 10 years, consistent with the statute of limitations for bank fraud.   Under current law, bank-originated PPP fraud is being prosecuted as  bank fraud, which has a 10-year statute of limitations.   At the same time, PPP loans originated by nonbank lenders, including  fintech companies, are often prosecuted as wire fraud, which carries a  5-year statute of limitations.   To address this difference, the bill extends the time for prosecutors  to bring charges to 10 years for all cases of PPP fraud, regardless of  whether the lender was a bank or fintech company.   SBA's Office of Inspector General identified over 70,000 PPP loans  totaling over $4.6 billion in potentially fraudulent PPP loans, many of  which originated with fintechs.   According to researchers at the University of Texas at Austin,  fintech companies handled 75 percent of PPP loans connected to fraud by  the DOJ, despite originating only 15 percent of the loans overall.   As of March 10, the DOJ's efforts have resulted in criminal charges  against over a thousand defendants with alleged losses exceeding $1.1  billion and over 240 civil investigations into more than 1,800  individuals and entities for alleged misconduct in connection with  pandemic relief loans totaling more than $6 billion.   Given the extent of potential fraud, especially among the subset of  PPP loans originated by nonbank lenders, we must ensure prosecutors  have enough time to fully investigate and bring fraud charges.   As of now, the statute of limitations for nonbank PPP loans secured  in April 2020 will expire in 2025 in most cases, less than 3 years  away. That is not enough time given the complexity of these fraud  schemes.   As the chair of the Small Business Committee, I take my role over the  SBA and its program very seriously. That is why I sponsored this bill  to give the DOJ, FBI, and State and local law enforcement the resources  and time they need to bring these bad actors to justice.   Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Luetkemeyer for joining me in  leading this effort, and to the members of the Small Business Committee  for their support.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, we must continue supporting the work of our Federal,  State, and local law enforcement agencies as they investigate and  prosecute pandemic loan fraud. It appears the bulk of PPP loan fraud  was originated by nonbank lenders and fintech companies, which may not  be prosecuted as bank fraud and is therefore subject to a much shorter  statute of limitations.   This presents the possibility that pandemic loan fraudsters may get  off the hook because the statute of limitations expired. We simply  cannot let this happen. This bill would give law enforcement agencies  the time needed to hold fraudsters accountable and bring them to  justice.   Once again, I thank our ranking member, Mr. Luetkemeyer, for working  with me to lead this important effort, and all the members of the Small  Business Committee for their bipartisan work on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 7334) to extend the statute of limitations for fraud by  borrowers under certain COVID-19 economic injury disaster loan programs  of the Small Business Administration, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7334         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``COVID-19 EIDL Fraud Statute       of Limitations Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR CERTAIN                     COVID-19 ECONOMIC INJURY DISASTER LOAN                     PROGRAMS.         (a) Certain Economic Injury Disaster Loans.--Section 7(b)       of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(b)) is amended by       inserting after paragraph (15) the following new paragraph:        ``(16) Statute of limitations.--Notwithstanding any other       provision of law, any criminal charge or civil enforcement       action alleging that a borrower engaged in fraud with respect       to a loan made under this subsection in response to COVID-19       during the covered period (as defined in section 1110(a) of       the CARES Act) shall be filed not later than 10 years after       the offense was committed.''.        (b) EIDL Advances.--Section 1110(e) of the CARES Act (15       U.S.C. 9009(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following       new paragraph:        ``(9) Statute of limitations.--Notwithstanding any other       provision of law, any criminal charge or civil enforcement       action alleging that a borrower engaged in fraud with respect       to the use of an advance received under this subsection shall       be filed not later than 10 years after the offense was       committed.''.        (c) Targeted EIDL Advances.--Section 331 of the Economic       Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act       (15 U.S.C. 9009b) is amended by adding at the end the       following new subsection:        ``(i) Statute of Limitations.--Notwithstanding any other       provision of law, any criminal charge or civil enforcement       action alleging that a borrower engaged in fraud with respect       to the use of any amount received pursuant to this section       shall be filed not later than 10 years after the offense was       committed.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H5251]]    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7334, the COVID-19 EIDL  Fraud Statute of Limitations Act of 2022, introduced by the ranking  member, Mr. Luetkemeyer, and cosponsored by myself.   As with the PPP and Bank Fraud Enforcement Harmonization Act, this  bill will extend the statute of limitations for COVID-19 EIDL fraud  cases to 10 years to allow prosecutors more time to do their jobs. The  bills are companion pieces of legislation and much-needed to help law  enforcement investigate and bring fraud charges.   Congress amended the SBA disaster loan program at the start of the  pandemic to allow small businesses facing economic injury due to COVID  to apply for SBA disaster loans which were originally designed for  natural disasters. At the same time, SBA lowered the guardrails and  disbursed funds quickly to provide stability to the small business  economy, which, as we all know, was facing unprecedented uncertainty in  2020.   In a very short time, the program went from one that responds to  natural disasters in a few, distinct geographic areas, depending on the  nature of the disaster, to one that was responding to a nationwide  crisis almost overnight. Overall, the COVID EIDL program approved  almost 4 million loans totaling over $378 billion.   The SBA administrator transitioned the program to the Office of  Capital Access to dedicate additional management capacity. Since that  transition, the office closed out a backlog of nearly 1 million  applicants and increased loan officer productivity while improving the  customer service experience and solidifying robust fraud controls.  Nevertheless, throughout the pandemic, our committee held numerous  oversight hearings with SBA's inspector general who testified that  there is a great deal of potential fraud in this program, and it would  be a decades-long effort to fully investigate.   The IG's office identified $78 billion in potentially fraudulent  activity in the EIDL program as well as over $6 billion in loans and  grants related to identity theft allegations. Given the degree of  potential fraud, we need to give prosecutors more time to bring  fraudsters to justice. This bill will give law enforcement the time  needed to conduct their investigations of COVID EIDL fraud.   That is why I cosponsored this bill which will go a long way towards  enhancing oversight and accountability.   Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Luetkemeyer, for  introducing this important measure, and to the members of the Small  Business Committee for unanimously approving this important piece of  legislation.   I urge all Members to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, our Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies  are diligently investigating and prosecuting pandemic loan fraud, and  we must continue to support those efforts, whether in the COVID EIDL  program or the Paycheck Protection Program.   We all agree that anyone who took advantage of this once-in-a- lifetime crisis to commit fraud and enrich themselves at the expense of  hardworking Main Street businesses must be held accountable.   It is unacceptable to allow anyone to get off the hook for defrauding  a government relief program simply because the statute of limitations  expired. We cannot let this happen, and we must pass this bill.   Once again, I thank our Ranking Member, Mr. Luetkemeyer, for  introducing this important measure, and I am pleased to support it.   I also thank all the members of the Small Business Committee for  their bipartisan work on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5879) to amend the Small Business Act to clarify the  application of the price evaluation preference for qualified HUBZone  small business concerns to certain contracts, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5879         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Hubzone Price Evaluation       Preference Clarification Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. APPLICATION OF PRICE EVALUATION PREFERENCE FOR                     QUALIFIED HUBZONE SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS TO                     CERTAIN CONTRACTS.         (a) In General.--Section 31(c)(3) of the Small Business Act       (15 U.S.C. 657a(c)(3)) is amended by adding at the end the       following new subparagraph:        ``(E) Application to certain contracts.--The requirements       of subparagraph (A) shall apply to an unrestricted order       issued under an unrestricted multiple award contract or the       unrestricted portion of a contract that is partially set       aside for competition restricted to small business       concerns.''.        (b) Rulemaking.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this section, the Administrator of the Small       Business Administration shall revise any rule or guidance to       implement the requirements of this section.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5879, the HUBZone  Price Evaluation Preference Clarification Act of 2021.   The HUBZone program is a contracting assistance program based on  locality. It helps small businesses in urban and rural communities gain  preferential access to Federal procurement opportunities. By ensuring  that small businesses in disadvantaged communities participate in the  Federal marketplace, it, in turn, boosts job creation and economic  growth.   One of the main incentives of the HUBZone program is the price  evaluation preference. This tool gives a slight competitive advantage  to HUBZone firms competing against large companies. In doing so, it  meets the objectives of the program because every contract awarded to a  qualified HUBZone firm is an opportunity for developing and uplifting  America's most distressed communities.   Unfortunately, this tool is not being used as often as it should be  due to agencies misinterpreting that it does not apply to orders. There  is nothing in the Small Business Act that excludes the price evaluation  preference from being used at the ordering level, and it is our  intention that it be used at that level.   Given the prevalence of government-wide and agency-wide vehicles, it  is now necessary to state in clear and unequivocal terms that the price  evaluation preference does apply to orders. This is precisely the goal  of H.R. 5879. With this clarification, this legislation incentivizes  the use of this important tool so that one day we can finally meet the  3 percent HUBZone contracting goal and, ultimately, bring economic  development to those communities that need it the most.   I thank Representatives Newman and Salazar for leading this effort,  which will bolster the HUBZone program.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Newman).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The statutory goal of awarding 3 percent of all prime Federal  contracts to HUBZone firms has never been met. H.R. 5879 will enable  agencies to better meet this goal by eliminating all ambiguity and  clarifying that the HUBZone price evaluation preference applies to  orders.   I commend the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Newman), the sponsor of  the bill, and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Salazar), the  cosponsor, for working together on this sensible piece of legislation.  H.R. 5879 will undoubtedly strengthen the HUBZone program which, in  turn, will create jobs and stimulate local economies across the Nation.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 7622) to amend the Small Business Act to include  requirements relating to apprenticeship program assistance for small  business development centers, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7622         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Workforce       Pipeline Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER APPRENTICESHIP                     PROGRAM ASSISTANCE.         Section 21(c)(3) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       648(c)(1)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (T), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in clause (v) of the first subparagraph (U) (relating       to succession planning), by striking the period at the end       and inserting a semicolon;        (3) in second subparagraph (U) (relating to training on       domestic and international intellectual property       protections)--        (A) in clause (ii)(II), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (B) by redesignating such subparagraph as subparagraph (V);       and        (4) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(W) providing information and assistance to small       business concerns, including by disseminating relevant       information from the Department of Labor and other Federal       agencies, on how to establish and improve--        ``(i) work-based learning opportunities (as defined in       section 3 of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical       Education Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2302));        ``(ii) apprenticeship programs registered under the Act of       August 16, 1937 (50 Stat. 664, chapter 663; commonly known as       the `National Apprenticeship Act'; 29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.);        ``(iii) pre-apprenticeship programs; and        ``(iv) job training programs.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7622, the Small  Business Workforce Pipeline Act of 2022, introduced by Mr. Crow and  cosponsored by Mr. Fitzgerald.   H.R. 7622 allows small business development centers to disseminate  information from the Department of Labor regarding job training  programs like apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships, as well as other  work-based learning opportunities.   Throughout the past year, small businesses have been hit hard by  tightening labor markets, often struggling to compete with their larger  counterparts. As the recovery continues, unemployment drops, and job  openings grow to record heights, the smaller firms in our economy have  found it harder than ever to recruit and retain qualified workers.   One of the most effective workforce training methods used in the U.S.  today is the registered apprenticeship program, an earn-while-you-learn  system that combines classroom instruction with on-the-job training.  According to the Department of Labor, the average starting salary for a  graduate of an apprenticeship program is $72,000, and businesses retain  these employees at a rate of 92 percent.   Not only do apprenticeships provide a reliable pathway into the  middle class for workers, but they also provide top-quality talent to  the business that trained them.   With assistance provided by the SBDC network, more small firms will  have access to resources to attract and retain high-quality talent,  helping them both establish and improve these programs for their  businesses while providing training opportunities and job security to  workers.   I thank Mr. Crow for leading on this issue with a variety of hearings  on the topic and for listening to witnesses as he worked to craft this  legislation with Mr. Fitzgerald, Ms. Houlahan, and Mr. Garbarino. These  bipartisan efforts will have a lasting impact on our Main Street firms.   I urge Members to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, there is no question that small firms  are facing the most dire consequences of a tight labor market. At a  time when the economy is recovering and businesses are seeking to  expand their operations, lack of access to a highly skilled workforce  can be frustrating to business owners and harmful to their recovery.   Maintaining economic competitiveness on the world stage means  investing in our workforce, and nobody is better equipped to do that  than the  [[Page H5255]]  small businesses fueling our economic recovery.   H.R. 7622 empowers SBDCs to expand workforce training resources to  small employers struggling to find workers, which will, in turn, grow  the skill sets of workers and the workforces of businesses.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 7664) to amend the Small Business Act to include  requirements relating to graduates of career and technical education  programs or programs of study for small business development centers  and women's business centers, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7664         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting Small Business       and Career and Technical Education Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. INCLUSION OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION.         (a) Definition.--Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 632) is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(gg) Career and Technical Education.--The term `career       and technical education' has the meaning given the term in       section 3 of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical       Education Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2302).''.        (b) Small Business Development Centers.--Section 21(c)(3)       of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648(c)(1)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (T), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in clause (v) of the first subparagraph (U) (relating       to succession planning), by striking the period at the end       and inserting a semicolon;        (3) in second subparagraph (U) (relating to training on       domestic and international intellectual property       protections)--        (A) in clause (ii)(II), by striking the period at the end       and inserting a semicolon; and        (B) by redesignating such subparagraph as subparagraph (V);       and        (4) by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs:        ``(W) assisting small businesses in hiring graduates from       career and technical education programs or programs of study;       and        ``(X) assisting graduates of career and technical education       programs or programs of study in starting up a small business       concern.''.        (c) Women's Business Centers.--Section 29(b) of the Small       Business Act (15 U.S.C. 656(b)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in paragraph (3), by striking the period at the end and       inserting a semicolon; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(4) assistance for small business concerns to hire       graduates from career and technical education programs or       programs of study; and        ``(5) assistance for graduates of career and technical       education programs or programs of study to start up a small       business concern.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7664, the Supporting  Small Business and Career and Technical Education Act of 2022,  introduced by my colleague from Texas (Mr. Williams) and my colleague  from Illinois (Ms. Newman).   After seeing massive layoffs in response to the pandemic, businesses  are starting to expand their operations and grow their workforce.  Unfortunately, this has created one of the tightest labor markets in  U.S. history, and small firms are feeling this acutely.   Oftentimes, small businesses are not only faced with a shortage of  applicants, but within that pool, they are seeing a shortage of  applicants with the skill sets they need.   One of the best strategies for equipping students with skills needed  to enter a market is career and technical education, or CTE. Aimed at  secondary and postsecondary students, these programs don't replace  academic training but, rather, expand upon it to give young people  practical skills they can use, whether they enter the workforce or  continue in their studies.   CTE programs can train students with a wide variety of skills in  nearly every industry, and this program often works with local  businesses to understand what skills are in demand to guide the  curriculum.   This legislation directs small business development centers and  women's business centers to assist small businesses in hiring graduates  of CTE programs while also helping program graduates start their own  businesses.   It takes a twofold approach of, one, creating a more adequate  pipeline of trained young people for small businesses and, two,  supporting those students who want to launch their own enterprise.   SBDCs and WBCs can help fill the gap between training programs and  small firms by building awareness and fostering relationships between  the private sector and our educational community.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Williams and Ms. Newman for their  meaningful work on this bill. I urge Members to support this bipartisan  piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   Madam Speaker, while our economy continues to recover and job  openings increase, it is important that we ensure there is an adequate  pipeline of skilled workers in our small firms.   Fueling our economic recovery relies on them having the resources  they need to thrive, including an adequate workforce. H.R. 7664 will go  a long way in connecting small employers in need of workers to these  programs and connect students to opportunities of launching their own  firms.   I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) and the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Newman) for their hard work on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 7670) to amend the Small Business Act to require a  report on small business concerns owned and controlled by women, and  for other purposes.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7670, the Women-Owned  Small Business Program Transparency Act.   The Women-Owned Small Business program levels the playing field for  female entrepreneurs who compete for Federal contracts. Additionally,  it assists agencies in meeting the goal of awarding 5 percent of all  contracts to women-owned small businesses.   While the program has steadily improved, it has faced its fair share  of delays and challenges. For example, the program started operating 10  years after its enactment, and since its implementation 12 years ago,  the 5 percent goal has only been met twice.   The Small Business Administration implemented a formal certification  process for the program in 2020, more than 5 years after being required  to do so by Congress. As a result, while the agency is making great  strides, it still has a substantial backlog of applications and the  implementation of corresponding regulations--especially when it comes  to program examinations--remains to be seen.   The importance of the program to elevating women-owned small  businesses in the Federal procurement arena makes it imperative to  conduct oversight to ensure the program is meeting its legislative  intent. H.R. 7670 will aid Congress in this endeavor by establishing  reporting requirements to better assess the effectiveness of the  program.   In particular, H.R. 7670 requires the SBA to report on multiple  facets of the Women-Owned Small Business program, including the amount  of contracting dollars awarded through the program, the number of  certifications issued, the amount of program examinations conducted,  and much more.   I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan) and the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney) for their bipartisan work on  this bill. H.R. 7670 is a commonsense piece of legislation that will  bring transparency and accountability to the Women-Owned Small Business  program.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, long after the enactment of the legislation to create  the Women-Owned Small Business Program, women still face inequities  when it comes to Federal contracting. The Women-Owned Small Business  Program tries to address these inequities.   Today, we have the opportunity to further this mission through H.R.  7670. This bill creates a reporting requirement through which to  measure whether the program is working as intended. I am certain that  this oversight mechanism will lead to increased transparency,  accountability, and efficiency to the benefit of our women-owned small  business community. That is why I thank our committee members for their  leadership in advancing this piece of legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the  [[Page H5259]]  bill (H.R. 7694) to amend the Small Business Act to modify the  requirements relating to the evaluation of the subcontracting plans of  certain offerors, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7694         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Subcontracting       for Small Businesses Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. EVALUATION OF SUBCONTRACTING PLANS.         Section 8(d)(4)(G) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       637(d)(4)(G)) is amended--        (1) in the matter preceding clause (i), by striking       ``bundled contract'' and all that follows through ``for       subcontracting'' and inserting ``contract that includes a       subcontracting plan required under this paragraph''; and        (2) in clause (i), by striking ``the rate provided under       the subcontracting plan for small business participation''       and inserting ``the description in the subcontracting plan of       the extent to which the offeror proposes to use small       business concerns as subcontractors (at any tier)''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7694, the  Strengthening Subcontracting for Small Businesses Act of 2022.  Subcontracting plans are an important mechanism for small business  utilization. In fact, for many small businesses, subcontracting plans  represent the only way to participate in Federal contracts. That is why  the Small Business Act requires contractors to have subcontracting  plans in certain situations.   For example, subcontracting plans are required for contracts that  exceed certain thresholds, have subcontracting possibilities, and are  awarded using negotiated procedures. While having these plans in place  is an important first step, it will not make a difference if the prime  does not implement them.   The Small Business Act has a provision that allows agencies to  subject prime contractors to liquidated damages if they do not employ  good faith efforts to meet the subcontracting plans. However, the  standard is ambiguous and not always enforced. As a result, primes  often face no consequences for failing to meet their subcontracting  plans. That is simply unacceptable.   We must do more to ensure prime contractors comply with their  subcontracting plans. This is precisely what H.R. 7694 does. It  requires agencies to evaluate past performance in meeting  subcontracting plans when considering offers for new contract awards.  In other words, by making sure that previous compliance with these  plans is taken into consideration when making new awards, it would  encourage more compliance with subcontracting plans.   I thank Representative Stauber and Representative Mfume for leading  this effort, which represents an innovative solution to a longstanding  problem.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Mfume).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, I would just say thank you to both  gentlemen, Mr. Stauber and Mr. Mfume, for their hard work, and I urge  my colleagues to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
