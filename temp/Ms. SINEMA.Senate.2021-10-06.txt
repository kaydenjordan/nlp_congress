 Mr. President, Senator Mark Kelly and I have the distinct  privilege of honoring the outstanding men and women of the U.S. Army  Intelligence Center of Excellence at Fort Huachuca, AZ. On October 6,  2021, MG Anthony G. Hale, Commanding General of the U.S. Army  Intelligence Center of Excellence and Fort Huachuca, will officially  recognize the 50-year anniversary of Fort Huachuca as the ``Home of  Military Intelligence.'' This is a momentous occasion, and we  congratulate all members of the Fort Huachuca community on their  invaluable achievements.   Military intelligence has been critical to successful combat  operations since the U.S. Army's inception in 1775. Tragic events in  our Nation's 246-year history have continually underscored the  importance of properly trained intelligence professionals, not only for  combat operations, but in times of peace as well. The U.S. Army's first  centralized peacetime intelligence school was established at Fort  Holabird, MD, in 1955, but moved to Fort Huachuca in 1971 to better  meet intelligence requirements. Fort Huachuca subsequently received the  moniker of ``Home of Military Intelligence.''   Over the next 50 years, the U.S. Army Intelligence Center and School  would absorb several other intelligence training centers until it had  responsibility for all military intelligence training. This includes  initial military training and professional military education for all  ranks and intelligence specialties, for both Active and Reserve  components, civilians, and foreign students from allied countries.   The Commanding General serves as the proponent for the Military  Intelligence Branch and Chief of the Military Intelligence Corps and is  responsible for recruitment, accession, and retention of the Army's  entire military intelligence force, while developing concepts,  doctrine, organizational designs, and materiel solutions. The  Intelligence Center and School have gradually morphed into today's U.S.  Army Intelligence Center of Excellence, notably becoming the place  where military intelligence professionals are symbolically bound  together as one unified organization. It continues to be, now more than  ever, the home of military intelligence.   As the Army prepares for future contingencies, the work of the U.S.  Army Intelligence Center of Excellence is paramount. The center's  military and civilian personnel work tirelessly to shape the future of  Army intelligence while ensuring intelligence professionals are trained  and equipped to protect our Nation. Fort Huachuca is postured to combat  our adversaries in the domains of spectrum and space and continues to  provide key contributions to the defense of the Nation.   Senator Kelly and I are immensely proud of the men and women at the  U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence at Fort Huachuca. They  deserve our deepest gratitude for the contributions they have made to  the U.S. Army and our Nation over the past 50 years. I know we both  look forward to seeing what they accomplish over the next half-century.   Again, congratulations on this proud occasion.                            ____________________
