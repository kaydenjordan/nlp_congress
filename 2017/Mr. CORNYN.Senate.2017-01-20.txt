 Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?    I ask the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services  Committee whether a period of transition from one administration to  another is a time of particular vulnerability to the United States, at  a time when we are transitioning not only to a new administration but  also to a new national security Cabinet.   Isn't this a time of particular vulnerability for the United States?    Mr. President, I am responding to the Senator from  Arizona.   I am not confident that he will get a unanimous vote here, but he  will certainly be confirmed resoundingly under the rules established by  the Democratic majority in the last Congress, which allow 51 votes for  confirmation.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Alabama (Mr. Sessions).    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Alabama (Mr. Sessions).    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson) and the Senator from Alabama (Mr.  Sessions).
