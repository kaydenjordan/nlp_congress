 Madam Speaker, Margaret Hahn--my mother-in- law--passed away on Friday and a Mass of Christian burial will be held  today at St. Mary Church in South Amboy, New Jersey. She was 96 and was  deeply loved and will be deeply missed.   Margaret--Peg--was a great woman--wife, mother, grandmother, and  great-grandmother. She selflessly devoted her life to public service  including her amazing work as Sayreville Borough Clerk for twenty  years. She had an incredible reputation for getting things done for the  people. No matter who served as mayor or on Council, everyone knew she  was the power.   My wife Marie and I will join family and friends today at her funeral  and internment making it impossible for me to speak today during the  debate on the reauthorization of a law I originally authored fifteen  years ago--the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005--and the  Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2015.   So, I submit these comments for the Record:   Madam Speaker, today the House of Representatives will vote to  reauthorize the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act.   This was an original idea of mine 20 years ago. Joined by 70  cosponsors, I introduced it in 2001 and again in 2003.   After five long years of hard work and numerous setbacks, my bill was  finally enacted into law in 2005.   Beginning in 2001, Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, who is President of the Cord  Blood Association, helped draft my original law. Dr. Kurtzberg has  said, ``Cord blood transplantation is now an established field with  enormous potential. In the future, it may emerge  [[Page H4998]]  as a source of cells for cellular therapies focused on tissue repair  and regeneration.''   The new law created a nationwide umbilical cord blood stem cell  program, designed to collect, derive, type, and freeze cord blood units  for transplantation into patients to mitigate and to even cure serious  disease. Pursuant to the law, it also provided stem cells for research.  The new cord blood program was combined in our 2005 law with an  expanded bone marrow initiative, which was crafted over several years  by our distinguished colleague, Congressman Bill Young.   I was the prime sponsor again when it was reauthorized in 2015.   Umbilical cord blood stem cells, obtained after the birth of a child,  have proved highly efficacious in treating 70 diseases, including  sickle-cell disease, lymphoma, and leukemia. And scientists are  continuing to study and better understand the regenerative effects of  cord blood cell therapies for other diseases and conditions. Bone  marrow donations provide lifesaving transplants to treat diseases like  blood cancer, sickle cell anemia, or inherited metabolic or immune  system disorders.   The National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI) provides funding to public  cord blood banks participating in the program to allow them to expand  the national inventory of cord blood units available for transplant.  These units are then listed on the registry by the ``Be the Match''  Program. The funds appropriated thus far have led to an important  increase in the overall number of high-quality cord blood units  available through the national registry, including 150,000 NCBI units.  Within the Be the Match registry, there are more than 783,000 NCBI  units worldwide.   The Program registry allows patients and physicians to locate  matching cord blood units, as well as adult donors for marrow and  peripheral blood stem cells, when a family donor is not available. The  Program is the world's largest, most diverse donor registry, with more  than 22 million volunteers and more than 300,000 public cord blood  units. To date, the National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match (NMDP),  through its operation of the Program, has facilitated more than 100,000  transplants. More than 45,000 patients have received cord blood  transplants, according to Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg.   The reauthorization before us authorizes $23 million to be  appropriated for fiscal year 2021 through fiscal year 2025. It also  authorizes $30 million to be appropriated for fiscal years 2021 through  2025 for the bone marrow transplant program. This continues funding at  the same levels authorized in the 2015 authorization bill.   Madam Speaker, each year nearly 4 million babies are born in America.  In the past, virtually every placenta and umbilical cord was tossed as  medical waste. Today, doctors have turned this medical waste into  medical miracles.   Not only has God in His wisdom and goodness created a placenta and  umbilical cord to nurture and protect the precious life of an unborn  child, but now we know that another gift awaits us immediately after  birth. Something very special is left behind--cord blood that is  teeming with lifesaving stem cells. Indeed, it remains one of the best  kept secrets in America that umbilical cord blood stem cells and adult  stem cells in general are curing people of a myriad of terrible  conditions and diseases--over 70 diseases in adults as well as in  children.   The legislation that is before us will enable even more patients to  receive the treatments that they so desperately need.                                time  1415
