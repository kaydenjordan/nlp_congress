 Mr. President, the end of a Congress is a bittersweet  time. We reflect with pride on our accomplishments but have a sense of  wistfulness with respect to the things we have been unable to do. We  look forward to the holidays, spending more time with our families, and  having a bit of a respite. But we have to say good-bye to several  colleagues. I would like to take a few moments to pay tribute to  Senators who will not be returning when the 117th Congress convenes.  They are my friends as well as my colleagues and I will miss them and  the unique attributes, skill, and devotion to public service they have  brought to the Senate.   Senator Cory Gardner is a fifth generation Coloradan firmly rooted in  the State's Eastern Plains whose family has been in the farm implement  business for over one century. He received his undergraduate degree  from Colorado State University, where he graduated summa cum laude, and  his Juris Doctor from the University of Colorado at Boulder.   While Senator Gardner has only been in the Senate since 2015, the  expression ``got it in one'' certainly applies to him. Perhaps that is  because he previously worked in the Senate for then-Senator Wayne  Allard, quickly rising to become Senator Allard's legislative director.  He served for 6 years in the Colorado House of Representatives and  another 4 years in the U.S. House of Representatives before being  elected to the Senate in 2014.   Here in the Senate, Senator Gardner has been a serious legislator but  with a cheerful and affable and civil manner. He has worked to bridge  partisan divides, particularly on energy policy, where he has been one  of the Republicans' leading advocates of renewable energy. This year,  the esteemed Lugar Center ranked Senator Gardner as the third most  bipartisan Senator.   I have had the opportunity to work with Senator Gardner on the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee as he led the effort to impose sanctions  against North Korea in his role as chairman of the Foreign Relations  Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity  Policy. Through the committee, we also worked together to introduce  legislation to enhance American maritime capacity and leadership and  increase support to our allies in the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia- Pacific Maritime Security Initiative Act of 2016. I was also pleased to  work with Senator Gardner in 2019 to introduce the Wildlife Refuge  System Protection Act, bipartisan legislation to provide legal  authority for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service--USFWS--to seek  damages for injury or harm on National Wildlife Refuges, National Fish  Hatcheries, and other USFWS lands and waters.   My wife Myrna and I have traveled with Senator Gardner and his wife  Jaime to promote human rights abroad. His commitment to global human  rights was crystal clear to Myrna and me. I will miss Senator Gardner  and his pleasant demeanor, but he is still a young man so I am  confident he will find new ways to continue serving all Americans, but  especially the Coloradans he has represented with distinction for the  past 16 years. I wish him, Jaime, and their children Alyson, Thatcher,  and Caitlyn all the best.   Senator Martha McSally has only been in the Senate for 2 years, but  it is impossible not to be in awe of her true  [[Page S7874]]  grit and determination, perhaps stemming from being the youngest of  five children. Her father died when she was just 12, leaving her mother  to raise and support her family. Perhaps it was the example her mother  set--Senator McSally was determined to let nothing stand in her way.  She was the valedictorian of her high school and earned an appointment  to the United States Air Force Academy, where she received a bachelor's  of science in biology. I am privileged to represent the U.S. Naval  Academy in Annapolis, MD. I have served on the board of visitors, and  my staff and I interview the hundreds of young applicants across  Maryland who aspire to enroll in one of our service academies each  year. I am not sure most Americans are aware of how intensely  competitive these positions are and what a tremendous honor earning an  appointment is. Meeting these applicants, reviewing their extraordinary  accomplishments at such a young age, and seeing their commitment to  service--willing to put their lives on the line, if necessary--restores  one's faith in the boundless future of our Nation.   Senator McSally certainly put her life on the line for us and  shattered gender barriers along the way. She became the first woman in  American history to fly a fighter jet in combat and the first woman to  command a fighter squadron in combat. She deployed six times to the  Middle East. She helped lead and execute the initial air campaign in  Afghanistan after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and she supervised combat  search and rescue operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. In total, she  flew 325 combat hours and earned a Bronze Star and six air medals. She  served in the U.S. Air Force for 26 years, retiring as a full colonel.   Senator McSally has never been one to rest on her laurels. She earned  masters' degrees from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of  Government and the U.S. Air War College, graduating first in her class  of 261 senior military officers. She ran for the House of  Representatives, first unsuccessfully by a narrow margin in 2012 but  then successfully--again by a narrow margin--in 2014, becoming the  first Republican woman to represent Arizona in Congress. She was  reelected in 2016. She lost a tough race to Senator Sinema in 2018, but  Arizona Governor Doug Ducey appointed her to finish the unexpired term  of another war hero, our late friend Senator John McCain.   Unfortunately, I had little opportunity to work with Senator McSally  during her 2 years here in the Senate, although I did travel with her  to Normandy for the 75th anniversary of D-Day, and I saw firsthand her  commitment to America's service men and women--especially military  sexual assault survivors--to veterans, and to military families.  Senator McSally is an inspiration to all of us, but especially to women  and girls, for her devotion to duty and the incredible odds she has  overcome and the barriers she has broken in her life. Senator McSally  has said, ``There's always more that unites us than divides us.'' I  agree wholeheartedly with that sentiment. She is a fighter who will  continue to fight for our county, and I am grateful for that.   Senator Doug Jones is a native Alabaman, a steelworker's son, who  grew up during the great struggle for civil rights and desegregation in  the South. He has been involved in that struggle all of his life,  active in campus affairs at the University of Alabama, where he earned  his bachelor's degree in 1976, and in trying to modernize Alabama's  court system.   Senator Jones has the distinction of working, being confirmed by, and  being elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. After he graduated from  Cumberland Law School at Samford University in 1979, he worked as a  staff counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee for then-Senator Howell  Heflin. Senator Jones served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney from 1980 to  1984. After he worked in private practice for several years, President  Clinton nominated him to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern  District of Alabama, and the Senate confirmed his nomination in 1997.   While Senator Jones was the U.S. Attorney, he successfully prosecuted  two of the four men who were responsible for the heinous bombing of the  16th Street Baptist Church in 1963, an attack that killed four young  Black girls between the ages of 11 and 14 and shocked the conscience of  our Nation. He prosecuted other domestic terrorists, including the Ku  Klux Klan and Eric Rudolph. He won a hard-fought special election to  the Senate in December 2017 and has served with honor, distinction, and  a commitment to finding bipartisan solutions to our Nation's most- pressing problems.   Senator Jones has fought to protect healthcare and to create equal  opportunities for all Americans. He led the passage of the bipartisan  FUTURE Act into law last year, legislation that I strongly supported to  provide permanent funding for historically Black colleges and  universities and minority-serving institutions. He has also championed  minority-serving financial institutions and minority-owned banks,  supporting the efforts to add additional funds for these institutions  through the Paycheck Protection Program. I was proud to work with  Senator Jones on the successful passage of our legislation to extend  the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act this year, which extends  until 2030 duty-free access for certain textile goods from 23 Caribbean  countries that are made with U.S. yarns, fabrics, and threads until  2030.   Senator Jones is equally committed to civility and civil rights. As  the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., so famously said, ``The arc  or the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.'' Thanks to  Senator Jones' abiding faith and ceaseless efforts, that arc is bending  faster. I wish him, his wife Louise, their children Carson,  Christopher, and Courtney, and their two grandchildren all the best  moving forward. I know he will continue to serve our country, and I am  hopeful it will be as a member of the incoming administration of  President-Elect Joe Biden.   Senator Tom Udall comes from an illustrious extended family with a  long history of distinguished public service, including his father  Stewart, who served as Secretary of the Interior under President John  F. Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson from 1961 to 1969. His uncle  Morris ``Mo'' K. Udall was one of the most accomplished and beloved  Congressmen in U.S. history, representing Arizona's Second District for  30 years. While Senator Udall was born in Tucson, he has deep roots in  New Mexico, starting with his grandmother Luna, who was born in New  Mexico Territory.   Senator Udall earned his undergraduate degree from Prescott College,  a bachelor of laws degree from Cambridge, and J.D. from the University  of New Mexico in 1977. And then joining the family tradition, he began  his public service by clerking for the Honorable Oliver Seth, chief  justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Later, he  became a Federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's criminal division  and chief counsel to the New Mexico Department of Health and  Environment.   Senator Udall was elected New Mexico Attorney General in 1990 and  reelected in 1994. He made his mark in several areas, but especially in  government transparency and ethics, a quest he would continue in the  U.S. House of Representatives, where he served five highly productive  terms, even though he was in the minority for four of them, passing  legislation to establish a national renewable energy standard.   Here in the Senate, Senator Udall has continued his distinguished  service for two terms in his low-key, quiet, understated, and effective  manner. Just this year, he led the passage of the Great American  Outdoors Act to fund our national parks and Federal land agencies. He  has championed environmental justice and has devoted himself to  rectifying the injustices our Nation has perpetrated against Indian  Nations and Tribes. Senator Udall has remained steadfast in his  commitment to good and transparent government as the lead Senate  sponsor of the For the People Act.   I have been privileged to work closely with Senator Udall on the  Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the  U.S. Helsinki Commission, and on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee. We have focused on strengthening our relationships with our  allies, which President Trump has put to the test, promoting American  values around the world, and  [[Page S7875]]  fostering human rights and international development and conservation  efforts.   I will greatly miss Senator Udall here in the Senate but feel  fortunate to have served with him these last 12 years in the Senate and  for 8 years together in the House of Representatives before that. New  Mexicans and all Americans have benefited greatly from his 30 years in  elected office and lifetime of public service. He has honorably and  effectively continued his family's noble tradition of stewardship in  all regards. My wife Myrna and Senator Udall's wife Jill, a tireless  advocate on behalf of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American  Indian, have become good friends, and Myrna and I will miss both of  them. I wish them and their daughter Amanda all the best.   Senator Mike Enzi was born in Bremerton, WA, where his father was  working in the naval shipyard during World War II. He grew up in  Thermopolis, WY. He came to Washington, DC, for college, earning his  bachelor's degree in accounting from George Washington University in  1966. He began his public service in the Wyoming Air National Guard  from 1967 to 1973. Later, he worked in the U.S. Department of the  Interior, earned a master's degree from the University of Denver, ran  his father's show business, and became mayor of Gillette, WY, when he  was just 30.   Senator Enzi served in the Wyoming House of Representatives for 4  years and in the Wyoming Senate for 6 years before being elected to the  U.S. Senate in 1996 with 54 percent of the vote. That was the closest  election he has had; he garnered over 70 percent of the vote each time  he sought reelection.   Senator Enzi is one of the most conservative members of the Senate  but that has not prevented him from reaching across the aisle. He is  quiet but his accomplishments speak volumes. While he chaired the  Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, it reported 37  bills, 23 of which the Senate passed. As he likes to say, ``People can  agree on 80 percent of the issues 80 percent of the time, and if they  leave the other 20 percent out they can get a lot done.'' He has  authored more than 100 bills that Presidents of both parties have  signed into law.   Senator Enzi and I have served on the Senate Finance Committee  together since the 112th Congress, and on the Subcommittee on Health  Care, where we have worked together to find bipartisan solutions to  expand access to affordable, quality healthcare. We have also worked  together to ensure the stability and health of pension funds, including  recent efforts related to the multiemployer union pension crisis, and  to bolster financial literacy. I have also been pleased to work with  Senator Enzi on legislation to ensure prompt payments to small  businesses working as Federal contractors across the Department of  Defense, and on our Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act, to help  student groups with collegiate housing costs.   Senator Enzi's grandfatherly mien and calm disposition have helped  steer the Senate through rocky times, and I will miss his steady hand  on our rudder. My wife Myrna will miss his wife of 51 years, Diana, an  active member of the Senate Spouses Club, who also works to provide  specially trained dogs and handlers to countries infested with  landmines. Senator Enzi is an avid hunter and fly fisherman, and I know  he will enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with Diana; their  children Amy, Emily, and Brad; and their four grandchildren.   Senator Pat Roberts is a native Kansan from Topeka and a  quintessential plainspoken Midwesterner and ex-marine. He is a fourth  generation Kansan, whose great-grandfather, J.W. Roberts, founded the  ``Oskaloosa Independent,'' the State's second oldest newspaper. Senator  Roberts has journalism and public service coursing though his blood. He  earned his bachelor's degree in journalism from Kansas State University  and then served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 4 years before working as  a reporter and then editor of several newspapers in Arizona. In 1967,  Senator Roberts worked for then-U.S. Senator Frank Carlson. In 1969, he  became administrative assistant to then-U.S. Representative Keith  Sibelius, who represented the First District.   Senator Roberts went on to represent the First District himself for  16 years before being elected to the Senate in 1996, where he has  continued to serve with distinction for four terms. Senator Roberts has  a well-earned reputation as a national leader on agriculture, defense,  and healthcare issues. He has the distinction of being the first person  in history to have chaired both the House and Senate Committees on  Agriculture and to author and pass bipartisan farm bills in both  Chambers. He led the passage of the overwhelmingly bipartisan 2018 farm  bill, which benefited farmers in my home State of Maryland and around  the Nation. As cochairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, Senator  Roberts has sought to address the challenges that rural communities  face in terms of access to high-quality healthcare.   While Senator Roberts chaired the Senate Select Committee on  Intelligence, he conducted one of the most thorough reviews of U.S.  intelligence gathering and analysis in the wake of the faulty  intelligence leading to the war in Iraq. The committee unanimously  issued the bipartisan report, which frankly and forthrightly revealed  systemic failures and provided numerous recommendations included in the  9/11 Intelligence Reform Act of 2004.   Senator Roberts has played a pivotal role in the creation of two  wonderful monuments, one here in Washington, DC, and the other in his  beloved Kansas. He served as Chairman of the Dwight David Eisenhower  Memorial Commission--and that fine memorial on Independence Avenue to  Kansas's favorite son was dedicated earlier this year--a fitting  capstone to Senator Roberts' 40 years as an elected official. Back in  Kansas, he helped to establish the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, one of  the most beautiful and majestic places in America. Tallgrass prairie  once stretched from Canada to Mexico, covering more than 170 million  acres. Today, less than 4 percent of it remains intact, mostly in the  Kansas Flint Hills, largely thanks to the efforts of Senator Roberts.   I have had the opportunity to work with Senator Roberts on  agricultural and healthcare issues, and legislation to encourage  retirement savings by fostering the growth of S corporations owned by  Employee Stock Ownership Plans--``S-ESOPS''. I will miss working with  him and his Semper Fi, ``can-do'' approach to problem-solving, but I  know he is looking forward to spending more time with his wife Franki;  their three children, David, Ashleigh, and Anne-Wesley; and their seven  grandchildren.   Senator Lamar Alexander has had a career in public service as long,  varied, and distinguished as just about any other American, working or  serving in all three branches of the Federal Government. He is a  seventh generation east Tennessean whose father was an elementary  school principal and mother was a pre-school teacher--thus began  Senator Alexander's lifelong interest in education. He graduated from  Vanderbilt University with a B.A. in 1962 and was elected to Phi Beta  Kappa. He earned his J.D. from New York University in 1965, was editor  of the law review, and a Root-Tilden Scholar.   Senator Alexander began his public service as a clerk for the  Honorable John Minor Wisdom on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth  Circuit. He worked on the staff of then-U.S. Senator Howard Baker and  as staff assistant to then-President Richard Nixon. In 1978, he walked  1,022 miles across Tennessee, spent the night with 73 different  families, and won election as Governor. As Governor, he helped to bring  the auto industry to the State. He was reelected in 1982 and served as  chair of the National Governors' Association from 1985 to 1986. He was  president of the University of Tennessee from 1988 to 1991, then- President George H.W. Bush's Secretary of Education from 1991 to 1993,  and a Professor of Practice in Public Service at Harvard the Kennedy  School of Government from 2001 to 2003. Somehow, he has also found the  time to cofound a law firm and two successful businesses, be a  classical and country pianist who has performed on the Grand Old Opry  and with symphony orchestras, and author seven books.   While Senator Alexander chaired the HELP Committee, it reported 45  [[Page S7876]]  bills that became law, most of which he authored. He sponsored the  America Competes Act of 2007; the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015,  greatly benefitting students in my home State of Maryland and  nationwide; the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016; and the Opioid Crisis  Response Act of 2018. He also authored legislation to modernize how  songwriters are compensated for their works. The list goes on and on.   Senator Alexander has been a champion of higher education reform,  seeking to simplify the process of applying for financial aid and to  increase access for all students. I have been proud to work with him to  support and strengthen historically Black colleges and universities and  minority serving institutions. On the environmental front, I had the  opportunity to work with Senator Alexander on legislation to end the  dumping of mining waste into streams, the Appalachia Restoration Act of  2009.   Senator Alexander is always courteous, an ``eloquent listener,'' and  always eager to forge bipartisan solutions to our Nation's problems.  Just a few days ago, I know Senators and staff were delighted to listen  to him play Christmas carols and hymns on the piano in the Hart atrium.  We will greatly miss his calm and dignified presence in the Senate, but  he has certainly earned the opportunity to spend more time with his  beloved wife of 51 years, Honey; their children Leslee, Kathryn,  Andrew, and William; and their nine grandchildren.   Senators Enzi, Roberts, and Alexander have served in this institution  for 66 years combined. Senator Udall has served 12 years, and Senator  Gardner has served 6 years. Senators Jones and McSally did not have an  opportunity to serve a full term, but all told, we are losing close to  90 years of dedicated service to the institution, our colleagues, their  constituents, and all Americans. There is a tradition for departing  Senators to give a farewell address, and most use the opportunity to  bemoan the fact that the Senate has become less collegial and more  partisan. I share that discontent and sadness. I think the best way we  can pay appropriate tribute to the fine Members who are leaving at the  end of this Congress is by rededicating ourselves to preserving and  expanding on their legacy of bipartisanship. I want to express my deep  admiration of and appreciation to Senators Alexander, Enzi, Gardner,  Jones, McSally, Roberts, and Udall. I am grateful for the opportunity  to serve with and learn from them, and I cherish our friendships                            ____________________
