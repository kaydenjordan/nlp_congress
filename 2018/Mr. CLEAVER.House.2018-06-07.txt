 Mr. Speaker, I am only able to raise my right arm to  maybe 50 percent, sometimes not that much, but that is due to shoulder  separations from playing football. John McCain cannot raise his arms  because he was tortured in Vietnam.   I believe that it is just about sinful for Mr. McCain, in his days of  very serious illness, to have anyone in this country, particularly  anyone in a position of significance, say things about him that cannot  in any way bless him or encourage him but, in fact, denounce him  through baseless attacks.   Mr. Speaker, when I was elected, I promised my four children that I  would never come to the well of this House and attack a human being or  call them names. Unfortunately, things have changed in this country to  the point now where that is a part of our daily way of doing the  business of the greatest Nation God has ever allowed to exist.   There is something wrong, Mr. Speaker, when the elected leaders of  our country refuse to apologize. There is not a single parent watching  the goings-on in this Chamber who would tell their children: No matter  what you do, no matter how awful you hurt another human being, you had  better not apologize.   We are setting examples for children and unborn children by what we  do in this Chamber. How in the world can a person sleep at night who  can hurt another individual and not apologize?   I guess there are some things I will never apologize for. I will  never apologize for never coming to the floor to attack a colleague. I  will never apologize for respecting a person with whom I may disagree.  I will never apologize for displaying disrespect for a member of the  other party though their policies are separate and distinct from mine.   I will never apologize for trying to get my point across without  stabbing someone with it. I will never apologize for being sensitive to  the pain and hurts of others. I will never apologize for being an  apologist when I wrong someone.   Silence is consent. And when I see this going on around this Chamber  and I see it going on in other places in our government, I know that  there are millions of people who believe that that is okay, that if it  is done by someone in my party, it is okay.   I have said to my family, I have said to our church, and I have said  to my colleagues here: If the leaders of the Democratic Party, Nancy  Pelosi or Steny Hoyer, stand up and attack someone, particularly  someone who is ill, I would come to the floor and condemn them.   Right and wrong is not based on party; it is based on right and  wrong.                                time  1100    We are becoming a mean-spirited nation. No one watching this will  tell their children: I want you to watch what is going on in Washington  and use what you see as an example of how to live.   Mr. Speaker, Washington is dark right now. The people around this  country who believe in light should let it shine.                            ____________________
