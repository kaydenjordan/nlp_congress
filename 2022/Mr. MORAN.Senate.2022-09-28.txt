 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this evening, I want to highlight a  community in my State of Kansas that is a model for rural towns across  our State and around the country. It is timely because, just yesterday,  the New York City mayor joked that my home State of Kansas has ``no  brand'' and then chuckled at his joke. I had planned to give this floor  speech before the mayor of New York City used Kansas as a punch line,  but now it seems a little more fitting and means even more.   Located in Allen County, KS, Humboldt is the home to about 2,000  residents. Like many small communities in rural America, Humboldt was  facing declining population numbers as businesses moved away and  buildings on Main Street were abandoned. Even the locally owned  newspaper, which began business in 1864 and was the State's longest  continuously running paper, the Humboldt Union, had to close its doors.   However, in the last couple of years, Humboldt has defied the odds.  The vacant buildings on Main Street now boast thriving businesses and  welcoming storefronts. Since 2020, Humboldt has gained a coffee shop, a  variety of bars and restaurants, a fitness center, a microbrewery, a  grocery store, a hotel, and the Humboldt Union has been reestablished.  Even as the pandemic created new challenges for many small businesses,  Humboldt's businesses were able to persevere.   In January, the travel desk of the New York Times selected Humboldt  as a top destination in the world, alongside places like Greece,  Australia, and Argentina--pretty ironic now.   The majority of growth and economic development in the community can  be attributed to a civic organization called A Bolder Humboldt. This  group was formed a few years ago by leaders like Paul Cloutier and is  still going strong today.   Paul recently took me on a tour of downtown with the mayor, Mayor  Nobby Davis, to see firsthand the renovations being done and to meet  the owners of small businesses that are reshaping the town square.   Paul said:         I've lived in a lot of big cities, and the thing I loved       about them was that they had complete neighborhoods, with a       grocery store and a dry cleaner's and a bar and little       restaurants, which is basically what a small town is or used       to be.    A Bolder Humboldt is working to rebuild that ideal--that ideal  American small town--for the 21st century.   I visited a cafe and a coffee shop owned by Josh Works, who is also  involved in A Bolder Humboldt. His father owns B&W Trailer Hitches, and  he set a standard during the recession in 2008 to prioritize and care  for his staff and his community.   In addition, the community has rebuilt 10 blocks of the downtown  streetscape with the help from a local business, Monarch Cement  Company. Owned and run by Walter Wulf, this is a 110-year-old business,  and it is a staple of this community.   The city has also developed Southwind Industrial Park, with the  latest addition of Murphy Tractor and Equipment Company, providing new  jobs for locals and new residents.   Humboldt has also gained fame as the hometown of Biblesta, which is  an annual festival taking place this weekend, that has been going for  six decades and features the world's largest Bible-themed parade.   Each year, City Manager Cole Herder addresses graduating high school  seniors and presents them with mailboxes in the school's colors--black  boxes with orange lettering. Each box has the student's name and  ``Humboldt, Kansas'' stenciled in orange letters. Inside, there is an  invitation. He appeals to students to pursue an education and new  experiences, but he also encourages them to consider their hometown of  Humboldt as the place to establish their careers and raise their own  families.   The community of Humboldt is a success story, and it is a role model.  It demonstrates how teamwork, creative thinking, hard work, treating  others with respect, and caring about the future of your community can  make a positive difference for your city, the State, and for our entire  Nation. That is our brand in Kansas.   I am proud to recognize the efforts of Humboldt with what we have  called the Building Better Communities Award.   Today, in the U.S. Senate, I offer my congratulations and my  gratitude for the kind of leadership and effort among all residents of  the community to see that Humboldt is a good place to live today and,  perhaps even more importantly, a great place to live tomorrow.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a  notable Kansan, Kevin Fern. Mr. Fern is currently executive director of  Visit Shawnee, a division of the Shawnee Chamber of Commerce and the  official Destination Marketing Organization for the city of Shawnee. He  has served the city of Shawnee since 2008 and was also nominated by  Governor Laura Kelly to the Kansas Council on Travel and Tourism.   Prior to his current position he spent a number of years in politics,  working a variety of campaigns, including for Presidential candidate  Dick Gephardt's campaign in 1988--always noting that he ``wanted to be  the guy behind the scenes, making everything happen.'' Following a  number of years in campaign politics, Mr. Fern entered the hospitality  industry, where he worked for more than 15 years in the hotel industry.   Mr. Fern is a long-time native of Shawnee, KS, and his passion for  the city mixed with his ethos to ``make our world just a little  better'' embodies the true Kansas spirit. I can confidently say Mr.  Fern's impactful career has truly made the world and the city of  Shawnee a better place.                            ____________________
