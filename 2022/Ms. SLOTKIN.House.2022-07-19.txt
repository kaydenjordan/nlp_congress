 Thank you, Representative Schneider, for your  leadership.   I rise today to honor the struggle that so many parents who must do  the unimaginable have gone through, to grieve the loss of a child. As  an Army wife and a former CIA officer who worked alongside the military  on three tours in Iraq, I have watched many parents send their kids off  to war, and, unfortunately, many did not return.   For the families left behind, not only does the hole in their hearts  never heal, but the ripple effect of that loss is also vast. The  Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, or TAPS, estimates that for  every Active Duty servicemember killed in Afghanistan and Iraq, six  family members are significantly impacted. This is the devastating  collateral impact of combat.   But our communities in the United States, our high schools and  colleges, are not supposed to be war zones. For many of us adults, we  look back fondly on those years as a time for liberation and new  opportunities for work, study, and play, for learning new things, and  for growing up.   So when a parent sends their child into the world full of hopes and  dreams for the future, they do so with visions of challenging classes  that expand their horizons, friendships that will define their lives,  Saturday tailgates, and spring break in sunshine.   Most importantly, they send them off with the full and complete  assumption that they will safely come back home.   But what we don't often think about is the incredible crisis of  mental illness and emotional turmoil that so many young people today  endure.   Our students are struggling. They are fighting internal battles that  even their closest friends and their parents do not see until it is  much too late.   Even before the pandemic up-ended our lives, we were already facing a  mental health crisis for young people. At this point, crisis is not the  right word. It is not strong enough.   Mental health experts and researchers use the term epidemic to  describe where we are with mental health challenges facing U.S. high  school and college students.   According to the National College Health Assessment, the most common  mental health issues facing adolescents are depression, anxiety,  suicidal ideation and intent, eating disorders, and substance abuse.   It is not easy getting help for any of those, navigating scarce  mental health resources as a newly independent and struggling young  adult.   Even if a student tries to take steps to get help, there is a  tremendous lack of services in our community, in our colleges, at our  universities. On college campuses, the ratio of certified counselors to  students is generally between 1 to 1,000 or 1 to 2,000 for small and  moderate-size schools and 1 to 2,000 or 3,000 to 5,000 for large  universities.    Far too often, the outcome is tragic as it has been for dear friends  and even some of my colleagues here in Congress who have lost their  children to mental health issues.   In the past year and a half, one of my superintendents, Dr. Bob  Shaner, a Marine veteran, he and his family lost their son in his  freshman year of college. More recently, my friend, Steve Sheffey and  the Sheffey family lost their beloved daughter, Orli, a young woman who  wanted to change the world.   It has become so common for me to get those terrible calls that it is  nearly commonplace. It is, therefore, up to us to make sure we do  something to change the system so that we honor their legacy. But we  need to start early because we know that the problem doesn't just  appear in college or after high school.   In my district in Michigan, one county alone has had a 300 percent  increase in demand for child psychiatric services in the past 2 years  and virtually no inpatient beds to offer them. It is not just the sheer  volume of demand that has increased but also the acuity of distress for  individual patients.   Right now, in our country when it comes to mental health and young  people, there is a tsunami of need and only sandbags to meet it.   You may know the now infamous name of a community in my district:  Oxford, Michigan. In November of 2021, Oxford joined the terrible club  that no one wants to be a part of, the list of districts where a school  shooting has taken place.   Like we have seen so many times in the past, the tragedy in Oxford is  rooted in the toxic combination of mental health issues and access to  weapons. Because of that, four students are dead and a community,  including the police, fire, first responders, and teachers who were in  the building that day are forever traumatized.   We must do better for the students of Oxford, for Orli, for every  student and every parent. We must train providers in trauma-based care,  increase access to mental healthcare services, treat mental illness  like physical health so that we understand that the issues and ailments  that affect us from the neck up are just as important as the ones that  affect us from the neck down.   We must improve insurance coverage for mental health services and  reframe the entire conversation around what it really means to be  healthy. The tasks are daunting, but the consequences of inaction, the  collateral damage of this battle, are even greater.   In closing, I offer a prayer often recited when mourning the loss of  a child:         May it bring comfort to the hearts of those who grieve, and       may it inspire all of us to keep their memories in the       forefront of our work.        A good person, though taken from us too soon, will rest in       peace.        For honor in old age, does not come from the length of       life.        Honor in old age does not come from the length of years.        Understanding is the gray hair of humanity.        A blameless life is ripeness of age.        Perfection in limited years is like living for many years.        So a good person, though taken from us too soon, will rest       in peace.        Let us, then, with peace of mind, let that good soul rest.
