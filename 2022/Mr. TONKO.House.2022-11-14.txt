 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pallone) for yielding.   The Manufacturing.gov Act is a vital piece of legislation that  supports American manufacturers, boosting our economy, our job growth,  and our global competitiveness.   The COVID crisis has strained our supply chains and limited factory  production abilities, overwhelmingly hurting the middle-class workers  who drive our Nation's economy and our industry.   Congress has a duty to support manufacturers and their workers in  every way possible, and that includes making it easier to navigate what  Federal resources are available to them.   The Manufacturing.gov Act offers a simple, bipartisan solution to do  just that. This legislation establishes a one-stop hub to centralize  the 58 different Federal manufacturing programs that span some 11  Federal agencies.   It also encourages public feedback by offering an online avenue for  people to  [[Page H8473]]  submit comments and concerns regarding such programs.   Now is the time to secure our supply chain and give local  manufacturers in my home State of New York and across our great Nation  the tools they need to identify the Federal support they will need to  help them flourish.   I thank Representatives Axne and Upton, as well as Senator Peters,  for being great collaborators on this bill. I urge my colleagues to  come together to bolster our United States manufacturing arena.
