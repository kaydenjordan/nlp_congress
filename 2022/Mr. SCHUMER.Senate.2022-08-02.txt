 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the last 5 days, we have seen what  President Biden and a Democratic-led Congress are focused on getting  done: bringing terrorists to justice, lowering costs, reducing  inflation and the deficit, helping out our veterans, and better  competing with countries like China.   I want to begin with a word on last night's strike. Last night,  President Biden reported that the United States conducted a strike that  targeted and killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the notorious mass murderer, the  leader of al-Qaida, and one of the sick planners of the September 11  attacks, which in New York and around the country and the world we are  still mourning.    The strike against al-Zawahiri is a major victory for the United  States. It will make our country and the entire world a safer place. It  will also help bring an element of justice for the 9/11 families, as  well as the many Americans who still carry the scars deep within.   I applaud President Biden for bringing final justice to this  loathsome murderer who orchestrated the killing of thousands of my  fellow New Yorkers, including some people I knew quite well. I also  want to thank the President's national security team for keeping  Congress fully and currently informed throughout the process. Finally,  I want to applaud the skill and bravery of our dedicated intelligence  community, servicemembers, and diplomats who work day and night--day  and night--to keep America safe.   This successful mission will send a chill down the spines of  terrorists all over the world and likewise will send a clear message to  those who wish to cross our Nation and harm our citizens: You will find  no comfort. You will find no quarter. You can run, but you can't hide.  We will hunt you down to the ends of the Earth until justice is carried  out.                               PACT Act of 2022    Mr. President, now on the PACT Act, every day that passes without  action on the PACT Act is another day that our Nation's veterans have  to do the  [[Page S3839]]  unthinkable: fight for basic healthcare benefits they rightfully  deserve.   Two months ago, the Senate overwhelmingly passed this bill that  secured the largest healthcare benefit expansion for our veterans in  decades. We are dealing by and large with that exact bill again, so  there is no justification to delay swift passage of the PACT Act any  longer.   I am very hopeful that Republicans can work with Democrats to break  through the impasse on the PACT Act immediately. We have offered  Senator Paul and Senator Toomey votes on the amendments they have been  calling for, set at a 60-vote threshold, just like the cloture vote has  a 60-vote threshold. We hope to reach an agreement where we can act on  this bill as soon as today, but for that to happen, our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle should work with us in good faith.   There is no better message we can send to the veterans who have  camped out for nights in front of the Capitol than that their long wait  and the wait of veterans everywhere is finally over. These brave  Americans risked life and limb to keep our country safe, and the very  least we can do is ensure they receive top care.   I urge my colleagues to come together so we can get the PACT Act done  ASAP, as soon as today.    Madam President, I have some good news. The minority  leader and I have come to an agreement to vote on the PACT Act this  evening. There will be 3 amendment votes, a 60-vote margin on the  Toomey amendment, on the Paul amendment, and on the Blackburn  amendment, and then 60 votes for the bill. I am very optimistic that  this bill will pass, so our veterans across America can breathe a sigh  of relief.   The treatments that they deserve and have needed but have been denied  by the VA because of all kinds of legal barriers and presumptions will  now be gone. Veterans who were exposed to the toxic fumes of burn pits  will be treated by the VA like they should have been from the very  beginning.   So this is good news. It took us a while to get here, but I am  grateful for the bipartisan cooperation and support that will allow us  to move forward today.   And a little bit more good news: The fact that we can finish PACT  today gives us a real opportunity to do the treaties that will allow  Finland and Sweden to join NATO. And that can happen tomorrow if we can  come to a time agreement. I am very hopeful that that can happen as  well.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m. today the  Senate proceed to legislative session and resume consideration of the  House message to accompany S. 3373, with the time until 5 p.m. equally  divided; further, that it be in order to consider and vote in relation  to a Paul motion to concur with amendment No. 5184, a Toomey motion to  concur with amendment No. 5186, and a Blackburn motion to concur with  amendment No. 5185; that at 5 p.m., the Senate vote in relation to the  motions in the order listed; that following disposition of the motions  to concur with amendments numbered 5184, 5186, and 5185, the motion to  refer and the amendments pending thereto and the motion to concur with  amendment No. 5148 and the amendment pending thereto be withdrawn and  the Senate vote on the motion to concur in the House amendment to S.  3373; that the Paul, Toomey, and Blackburn motions and the motion to  concur be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold, with 2 minutes  for debate, equally divided, prior to each vote; and that all votes  after the first vote be 10-minute votes; all without intervening action  or debate.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this long-awaited moment for our Nation's  veterans is occurring now. The Senate is finally--finally--going to  pass the most significant expansion of veteran healthcare benefits in  generations. This is a very good day, a long-awaited day, a day that  should have happened long ago.   For decades, many of our Nation's veterans have endured a shameful  reality. They went abroad to serve our country bravely, got sick from  toxic exposure in the line of duty, but came home and learned they  didn't qualify for the benefits they needed to treat their illnesses.  It is shameful. It is infuriating.   Today, we tell our veterans suffering from cancers, lung diseases,  and other ailments from burn pits: The wait is over for the benefits  you deserve. No more pointless delays on getting the healthcare you  need. No more jumping through hoops and even hiring lawyers just to get  an answer from the VA.   Today, if you are a veteran--from Vietnam to Iraq, to Afghanistan, to  everywhere in between--and you get sick from burn pit exposure or Agent  Orange, you will finally be able to get your earned benefits  guaranteed.   I want to thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for  working together to push the PACT Act over the line, especially  Senators Tester and Moran, who were the original leaders of the bill,  my colleague Senator Gillibrand from New York, and I thank in advance  all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who will vote for this  much needed legislation.   Importantly, I want to thank the many veterans, veterans service  organizations, and advocates, like Jon Stewart and John Feal, who led a  righteous, mighty movement to get this bill done. It wouldn't have  happened without you.   Especially, I want to thank the veterans who camped at the foot of  Capitol Hill for the past few days, enduring scorching heat and  drenching rain just to get to this point. They said they would never go  home until they got this bill done. They are here.   Well, I have good news. In a few minutes, after this bill passes, you  can go home knowing the good and great thing you have done and  accomplished for the United States of America.   Because of them, veterans everywhere will finally get the dignity and  care they deserve.   The PACT Act is now going to the President's desk.   I thank my colleagues for their work, and I ask for the yeas and  nays.                           Vote on Motion to Concur     Madam President, this is a wonderful moment, especially  for all the people who have made this happen who are observing it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.                            ____________________     Madam President, now I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate be in a period of morning business for debate only and with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, now, I am about to lock in an agreement  that will allow the Senate to pass the resolution of ratification for  the Finnish and Swedish applications to join NATO. Our NATO alliance is  the bedrock that has guaranteed democracy in the Western World since  World War II. This strengthens NATO even further and is particularly  needed in the light of recent Russian aggression.   When Leader McConnell and I met with the Finnish President and  Swedish Prime Minister in May, we committed to do this as fast as we  could and certainly before we go home for the August recess.   With the help of Chair Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, Senator  Shaheen, and Senator Tillis, we were able to get to this point.   I appreciate their hard work and bipartisan work. I know Leader  McConnell does too. For the awareness of my colleagues, I invited the  Ambassadors from Finland and Sweden to join us in the Gallery during  our debate and votes tomorrow.                            ____________________     And so now, I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday,  August 3, 2022, at 1:30 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 5, treaty document 117-3; that the treaties be  considered as having advanced through the various parliamentary stages  up to and including the presentation of the resolution of advice and  consent to ratification; that there be 3 hours for debate, equally  divided between the two leaders or their designees, on the treaties and  resolution of advice and consent to ratification; that the only  amendments in order to the resolution of advice and consent to  ratification be the following: Sullivan 5191, Paul 5192; that following  the debate, the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the order  listed; and that upon disposition of the amendments, any committee  conditions, declarations, or reservations be agreed to as applicable,  and the Senate vote on the resolution of advice and consent to  ratification as amended, if amended, with no intervening action or  debate; that if the resolution of advice and consent to ratification is  agreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.
