 Mr. Speaker, when Israel came back into existence in  1948, what was the first thing they were greeted by?   It was an attack. It was an attack by their Arab neighbors.   Less than 20 years later, war in 1967. Israel had to defend herself  again. Six years later, in 1973, yet again, Israel had to defend  herself.   What is the name of Israel's army?   It is the Israel Defense Force. Defense.   What is the Iron Dome system?   It is a defense system.   Arrow missiles are a defense system.   So what is this all about when we are seeing so much anti-Semitism  and we are seeing so many pro-Palestinian protests around the country  and on our college campuses coupled with anti-Semitism?   What is the core that they are defending when they are standing up  for this?   They are defending the pro-Hamas movement across the world which  includes their covenant. The Hamas Covenant of 1988 states in article  7: ``The  [[Page H5657]]  day of judgment will not come about until Muslims fight Jews and kill  them. Then the Jews will hide among the rocks and trees, and the rocks  and trees will cry out: `O Muslim, there is a Jew hiding behind me,  come and kill him.' ''   That is what they are defending.                            ____________________
