 Madam Speaker, the President abused his power.  He violated his oath of office. He sought to elevate himself as a  dictator or king. But we are not a monarchy. We are the United States  of America. We are a republic, a democracy, where the executive does  not have absolute power. America was founded on a system of checks and  balances.   When the President withheld military aid to vulnerable Ukraine and  pressed for a personal favor to manufacture dirt against a political  opponent, he went too far. He undermined America's national security.  He sought to sabotage our elections. He elevated his personal interests  over the interests of America. Then, he tried to cover up his  scandalous behavior, and he obstructed the investigation.   He violated his oath of office, but I intend to uphold mine to  protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America.  The President must be impeached today.
