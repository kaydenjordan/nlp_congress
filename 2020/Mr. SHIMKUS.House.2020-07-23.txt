 Mr. Speaker, in 1939, Hitler's Nazi Germany and Stalin's  Communist Soviet Union signed a secret agreement to invade and create  spheres of influence. The Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement allowed Hitler  to invade the free and sovereign country of Poland, while the Soviet  Union invaded the free and sovereign countries of Estonia, Latvia, and  Lithuania.   Eighty years ago today the United States responded with the Welles  Declaration. Let me read it.   ``Department of State, July 23, 1940, Statement by the Acting  Secretary of State, the Honorable Sumner Welles.   ``During these past few days the devious processes whereunder the  political independence and territorial integrity of the three small  Baltic republics, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, were to be  deliberately annihilated by one of their more powerful neighbors, have  been rapidly drawing to their conclusion.   ``From the day when the people of these republics first gained their  independent and democratic form of government the people of the United  States have watched their admirable progress and self-government with  deep and sympathetic interest.   ``The policy of this Government is universally known. The people of  the United States are opposed to predatory activities no matter whether  they are carried on by the use of force or by the threat of force. They  are likewise opposed to any form of intervention on the part of one  state, however powerful, in the domestic concerns of any other  sovereign state, however weak.   ``These principles constitute the very foundations upon which the  existing relationship between the 21 sovereign republics of the New  World rests.   ``The United States will continue to stand by these principles,  because of the conviction of the American people that unless the  doctrine in which these principles are inherent once again governs the  relations between nations, the rule of reason, of justice and of law-- in other words, the basis of modern civilization itself--cannot be  preserved.''   Mr. Speaker, this declaration here refused to recognize the Soviet  annexation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This nonrecognition  lasted 5 decades.   This declaration enabled the Baltic States to maintain free,  diplomatic missions. And with this declaration, Executive Order 8484  protected Baltic financial assets.   Today, the United States joins Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in  remembering this declaration and recommitting ourselves to peace,  democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.   Subsequently, their entrance into NATO and the European Union assures  them of being part of the family of western democracies.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Joyce), my colleague and friend.    Madam Speaker, who has the right to close?    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   Madam Speaker, this amendment would prohibit the use of any funds to  finalize or implement or enforce the EPA's recent proposal to maintain  the current Particulate Matter National Air Ambient Quality Standard.   In April of this year, the EPA proposed retaining the existing  particulate matter standard. The standard is 12 micrograms per cubic  meter of air. It was last reviewed and substantially tightened in 2013  during the previous administration.   The current EPA undertook the required 5-year review of the PM  standard. In a resounding 5-to-1 decision, the EPA's Clean Air  Scientific Advisory Committee voted to retain the standard.   The CASAC determined that there were substantial uncertainties with  studies alleging to demonstrate health effects below the current  standard.   Following the requirements of the regulatory process, the EPA  conducted a science-based review and analysis of the relevant data, and  it proposed retaining the current PM standards.   So if I have this right, the EPA conducted a scientific review and  analysis, it followed the requisite Administrative Procedures Act  process, and it made a regulatory proposal which it still will take  public comment on, review the feedback, and eventually make a final  determination.   So where is the misstep here that requires this kind of amendment?  Did the agency falter by listening to science? Did the agency falter by  following the rulemaking process?   What this amendment does is replace EPA's science-based analysis and  proposal with a politically motivated Congressional edict.                                time  1900    PM2.5 emissions have dropped 37 percent over the last two decades.  Combined pollutant emissions have declined 74 percent since 1970. The  U.S. has some of the lowest PM2.5 emissions in the world, including  five times below the global average and seven times below Chinese  levels, thanks to our rigorous Clean Air Act process.   Our air is cleaner, and under this administration, our economy has  simultaneously been stronger. Facts, science, and process, that is what  we should be dictating our environmental regulatory process.   Indeed, we should support a rigorous standard-setting process for the  Clean Air Act. Getting this right is vital. Setting standards  unnecessarily low is dangerous.   The economic, social, and physical collapse of communities that  follow when factories pull out or power plants close due to new  standards profoundly harms families, especially the most vulnerable.  Getting it right is exactly what is happening right now with the  administration's proposals for particulate matter standards.   The problem with my committee colleague's amendment is that it stops  this important process in its tracks. It will deprive the public of the  benefit of a sound science process to protect public health for all  populations. Stopping the scientific process does not protect public  health.   Support for this amendment undermines the Clean Air Act. I urge a  ``no'' vote on this amendment.   Madam Speaker, I will close with this. For my colleagues who promote  science, when you politically vote for science standards without the  scientific process, you kind of destroy the  [[Page H3826]]  whole EPA process. With that, I ask for a ``no'' vote on this  amendment.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
