 Mr. President, I am on the Senate floor now, where in  a moment I will be asking for unanimous consent for the Senate to take  up and vote on a House-passed bill that would provide full mandatory  funding for historically Black colleges and universities and other  minority-serving institutions.   The reason I am here is that the authority for this mandatory  spending expired 24 days ago, and we have it within our power right now  to remedy that situation. We can take up a vote on what is called the  FUTURE Act. We have a bipartisan Senate bill that is  [[Page S6143]]  championed by Senators Jones and Scott, and we have before us at the  desk a bill passed by the House of Representatives by voice vote, which  passed unanimously by the House of Representatives.   Without the passage of this bill, the FUTURE Act, our Nation's  historically Black colleges and universities will lose $85 million a  year in critical funding aimed at bolstering their resources, improving  their management, and enhancing their academic programs.   In my home State of Maryland, we have four terrific HBCUs--Bowie  State, Coppin, Morgan State, and University of Maryland Eastern Shore.  Collectively, they stand to lose over $4 million a year, which they  need for things like classroom upgrades, experiential learning  opportunities, and services for supporting students and helping them  stay in school.   I realize there are some who say that since we just enacted fiscal  year 2019 funding, there is no urgency to take up and pass this bill  now. But just this past Saturday, I met with board members of the  Thurgood Marshall College Fund. That is the organization that  represents our Nation's public HBCUs. When they asked me why, when  there is so much agreement and support for this program, we couldn't  pass the extension, I couldn't give them a good answer.   They gave me a letter they had sent to the U.S. Senate just last  week, trying to dispel the myth that there is no urgency to the current  situation. Their president, Dr. Harry Williams, wrote:         The expiration of this program is already having real       consequences. . . . We already have examples of campuses       notifying employees that their positions and programs will be       terminated as of September 30, 2020, if not sooner. These are       real jobs, held by people who interact with students       everyday, in programs that play a critical role in graduating       and retaining students in the STEM fields, among other       disciplines.    He goes on to write:         The longer we wait to give certainty to these universities,       the more institutions will be left with no choice but to       begin winding-down programs that materially benefit students       and employees alike, and strip away the institutional       knowledge bases that our schools have built over time.    That is from Dr. Harry Williams, the president of the Thurgood  Marshall College Fund.   I heard the same thing from our Maryland HBCUs, that they have to  plan now for what is going to happen next year. They can't budget and  they can't plan on hope; they have to budget and plan on reality.   So I understand--our colleague, the Senator from Tennessee and the  chairman of the HELP Committee, is on the floor, and, like him, I hope  we do a broader higher ed reauthorization. I think we need to do that.  I know the House wants to do that. I spoke earlier today with the House  Education and Labor Committee Chairman,  Bobby Scott. He wants to do  something too. He has introduced it. But he and the House also  understand that time is of essence when it comes to this piece dealing  with minority-serving institutions, which is why the House sent it over  to us in the first place. So there is really no time to waste. We need  to give these universities and colleges certainty.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 212, H.R. 2486; that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I would just say to the chairman of  the HELP Committee that I believe the best judge of what is good for  HBCUs is HBCUs themselves. They have asked the Senate to act  immediately on the legislation that passed the House unanimously on a  voice vote. So while we all would like to work toward comprehensive  reform and reauthorization of higher education, there is no need to  wait on this provision that is sitting in the Senate.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the letters we received from the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and  from the UNCF, both organizations that advocate on behalf of HBCUs.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Re Title III Part-F Funding to HBCUs and MSIs                                  Thurgood Marshall College Fund,                                   Washington, DC, October 14, 2019.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate.      Hon. Lamar Alexander,      Chair, U.S. Senate HELP Committee.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate.      Hon. Patty Murray,      Ranking Member,      U.S. Senate HELP Committee.        Dear Senators: We are sincerely disappointed that the       Senate did not pass the FUTURE Act prior to the September       30th deadline to prevent the Title Ill Part-F program from       expiring.        While it is true that Historically Black Colleges and       Universities (HBCUs) are funded through the academic school       year ending in April 2020, the expiration of this program as       set forth in the plain language of 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1067q,       means that no more grants will be made available to HBCUs       going forward and, as such, our institutions will be without       the ability to preserve the status quo as it relates to the       student programs and jobs supported by this funding.        In fact, the expiration of this program is already having       real consequences on the campuses of the publicly-supported       HBCUs that we represent. Despite having expired only two       weeks ago, we already have examples of campuses notifying       employees that their positions and programs will be       terminated as of September 30, 2020, if not sooner. These are       real jobs, held by people who interact with students       everyday, in programs that play a critical role in graduating       and retaining students in the STEM fields,  [[Page S6144]]       among other disciplines. The longer we wait to give certainty       to these universities, the more institutions will be left       with no choice but to begin winding-down programs that       materially benefit students and employees alike, and strip       away the institutional knowledge bases that our schools have       built over time with the support of Title III, Part F.        While we welcome a potential long-term or ``permanent''       solution to Title III, Part F, what we are hearing from our       campuses is clear--they simply do not have the time to wait       for Congress to work out a deal, particularly on bills that       have an uncertain future in both houses of Congress.       Therefore, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) strongly       encourages the Senate to finally take-up the House-passed,       bi-partisan and bi-cameral FUTURE Act immediately and pass       the bill before permanent damage is done to our campuses.       This course of action is the cleanest and most expedient way       to provide immediate certainty to our nation's HBCUs and       MSIs.        Following the Senate's passage of FUTURE Act, TMCF looks       forward to working with leaders on both sides of the aisle to       develop a longer-term solution for Title Ill, Part F, and for       other HEA-related issues in a broader bill like the Student       Aid Improvement Act or a comprehensive HEA reauthorization       that includes the permanent extension of Title III, Part F       funds.            Sincerely,                                             Dr. Harry L. Williams,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                   United Negro College Fund, Inc.                                 Washington, DC, September 19, 2019.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Lamar Alexander,      Chairman, Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions           (HELP) Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Patty Murray,      Ranking Member, Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions           (HELP) Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer,       Chairman Alexander, and Ranking Member Murray: UNCF (the       United Negro College Fund, Inc.) submits this letter urging       you to cosponsor, support, and pass the House-passed H.R.       2486, the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking       Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act. This bipartisan,       bicameral bill passed the House Floor on September 17th by       voice vote and has now been sent to the Senate for       consideration.        UNCF is a non-profit organization with a mission to build a       robust and nationally-recognized pipeline of underrepresented       students who, because of UNCF support, become highly-      qualified college graduates and to ensure that our network of       37-member, private Historically Black Colleges and       Universities (HBCUs) is a respected model of best practice in       moving students to and through college.        The 101 HBCUs that exist today are valuable institutions       with a large economic footprint. Despite only representing 3       percent of all two-and four-year non-profit colleges and       universities, HBCUs (1) enroll 10 percent of all African       American undergraduates; (2) produce 17 percent of all       African American college graduates with bachelor's degrees;       and (3) graduate 21 percent of all African Americans with       bachelor's degrees in STEM fields. Moreover, these       institutions have a strong economic impact, especially on the       regions in which they are located, by creating 134,090 jobs,       producing $10.1 billion in terms of gross regional product,       and having a total annual economic impact of $14.8 billion.        Despite the large economic impact of these institutions,       they continue to be under-resourced and have endowments that       lag behind those of non-HBCUs by at least 70 percent.       Unfortunately, this is common for HBCUs and Congress has       recognized this and sought out ways to find parity between       HBCUs and non-HBCUs. One strategic way in attempting to help       HBCUs receive adequate resources was initially through the       College Cost and Reduction Act of 2007. This bill allowed for       HBCUs, Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), Hispanic-      Serving Institutions (HSIs), and other Minority-Serving       Institutions (MSIs) to receive $255 million annually in       mandatory funds for Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 and FY 2009. These       mandatory funds were directed in the Higher Education Act of       1965 to be used solely for science, technology, education,       and mathematics (STEM) education, among other uses largely       centered around STEM. Instead of allowing this funding stream       to expire, Congress continued to recognize the need of these       institutions to offer quality STEM programs on their campuses       and continued this funding stream in the Student Aid Fiscal       Responsibility Act (SAFRA) of 2009. SAFRA extended funding       for these institutions from FY 2009 to FY 2019 at $255       million annually and was included in the Health Care       Reconciliation Act of 2010 that ultimately passed both the       House and Senate to became law. Every vote taken on the       mandatory funding stream for these institutions has been       bipartisan, and it is our desire to have the same outcome for       H.R. 2486.        It is imperative that the Senate pass the FUTURE Act       because funding for HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs, and other MSIs expires       September 30, 2019. While we support a permanent extension of       mandatory funding, H.R. 2486, due to its passage in the House       of Representatives, is the surest way for these institutions       to maintain funding for FY 2020 and FY 2021. We strongly       believe that passing this bill now will address the immediate       funding needs of our institutions and allow Congress to       continue to work towards a permanent extension of this       funding moving forward.        Should you have any additional questions regarding this       letter, please feel free to reach out to Emmanual Guillory,       Director of Public Policy and Government Affairs.            Sincerely,                                           Michael L. Lomax, Ph.D.,                                                 President and CEO.     I just underscore the fact, with respect to the  chairman, that the best judge of what is good for HBCUs, I think, is  HBCUs. They are worried because they are already having to provide  notice to their professors and their staff that funding might not be  available next year. I know, in the Senate, sometimes we think that no  one needs to plan ahead, but most of the world needs to plan ahead.   We will be back on this floor in the future again, asking that we  pass this urgent matter.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I  share the concerns expressed by my colleague, the Senator from Florida,  about the situation in Venezuela.   I have met with many of my constituents of Venezuelan heritage and  have discussed with them the crises that their relatives back in  Venezuela face every day--shortages of food, water, medicine, and  state-sponsored violence, which has caused 4.3 million people to flee  the country.   That is exactly why I joined many of my colleagues in supporting  legislation from many months ago of granting temporary protected status  to people who flee the horror in Venezuela. Of course, the House of  Representatives passed legislation to do exactly that. I have a copy of  H.R. 549 in my hand, and it is sitting here in the U.S. Senate.   I say to my colleague, the Senator from Florida, that I am happy to  sit down with him and discuss how we can revise and reform the entire  TPS system in our going forward. In fact, I introduced legislation back  in March of this year, S. 879, to extend temporary protected status to  all of the people who are, right now, in great fear of being deported  from the United States when their protected statuses expire. Yet I  recognize there may be reforms we can make to the overall system.   I suggest that a bill that is just focused on TPS to Venezuela is not  the place to try to reform the entire TPS system, about which I am more  than happy to have a discussion. As the Senator knows, we have people  with TPS status from many countries, including El Salvador, Guatemala,  Honduras, Haiti, and a number of African countries. To try to overhaul  the entire system in one piece of legislation by passing something  right now for Venezuela doesn't make a lot of sense, which is why I  support what the House did, for it immediately addresses the situation  in Venezuela with our current TPS system.   Let's not try to rewrite the whole TPS set of rules now. Let's  address the emergency situation right now. The Senate can do that by  passing the House bill, which, in a moment, I will ask to take up.   I object to the Senator's request to pass this version, which also  tries to overhaul the entire TPS system.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 549. I  ask unanimous consent that my amendment at the desk be agreed to, that  the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my  unanimous consent request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 549  [[Page S6146]]  and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; further,  that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
