 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina  for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for consideration of a bill to  designate perfluorooctanoic acid, also known as PFOA, and  perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, also known as PFOS, as hazardous  substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation, and Liability Act, outside the regular rulemaking  process. This rule also includes a bill to overturn a recent Supreme  Court decision on the Federal Trade Commission's authority to seek  monetary relief for consumers, and a bill to ease restrictions and  increase the cap on Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans.    H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act, has a laudable goal to address the  negative impacts of PFOA and PFAS. These are manmade chemicals and have  proven useful but potentially harmful. While they are often used in  products throughout our world, there is evidence that certain types of  PFAS lead to negative health consequences. Although there is bipartisan  agreement that Congress needs to address PFAS contamination, this bill  does not achieve that goal.   The PFAS Action Act would require the Environmental Protection Agency  to designate PFAS and PFOA as hazardous substances under the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act  of 1980, known as CERCLA, within 1 year of the bill's passage and then  to consider designating the remaining 9,000-plus PFAS chemicals as  hazardous substances within 5 years.   The reality is just over 800 compounds have been categorized as  hazardous substances since the passage of CERCLA in 1980. Now, we are  going to add over 9,000 chemicals in just 5 years, and I submit it will  be nearly impossible for the Environmental Protection Agency to  implement this.   The agency is actively engaged in investigating the prevalence of  PFAS chemicals and has undertaken rulemakings to address some of the  provisions in this bill, so undercutting this process by establishing  unrealistic requirements on a shortened timeline sets the Environmental  Protection Agency up for failure.   CERCLA is an incredibly complex body of law that triggers significant  liability if a cleanup is necessary. Creating a blanket designation of  all of the 9,252 PFAS chemicals would create a massive problem for  consumers who live with FDA-approved PFAS devices. For example, 40  million Americans are currently living with a PFAS-based heart stent.   Are they to be designated as Superfund sites or to have those stents  removed?                                time  1430    A blanket CERCLA designation would also hinder innovation in new  products. The coronavirus pandemic has revealed the vulnerabilities in  our supply chain. It doesn't seem like the correct time to limit the  materials available for innovation when the designation as hazardous,  for largely useful compounds, is based on rushed science.   This bill also requires the EPA to issue a rule on toxicity testing  for PFAS, a rule on PFAS contamination of drinking water, and a rule to  designate all PFAS chemicals as hazardous air pollutants under the  Clean Air Act.   Furthermore, this legislation requires the Environmental Protection  Agency to establish grants for communities to implement PFAS water  treatment technologies.   Republicans offered amendments in the Energy and Commerce Committee  and at the Rules Committee that were rejected for various procedural  reasons. The Rules Committee did not receive a score from the  Congressional Budget Office for this bill until an hour before our  Rules meeting yesterday, and the CBO score was indeterminate.   The administration of this bill would cost the Federal Government  $280 million over 10 years. It is impossible to know how this impacts  Federal spending over the next 10 years. No one knows how much PFAS  contamination exists, so no one knows how much liability this bill  creates for taxpayers.  [[Page H3710]]    Because the amendments offered by Republicans were based on the  underlying bill, the amendments were also problematic from a budget  perspective. There is no reason to limit consideration of these  amendments that affect consumer safety based on the inability to  achieve a budget score because the underlying bill is budgetarily  suspect.   Ultimately, this bill ignores the societal good that some fluorinated  compounds demand. PFAS are in medical devices that save lives. They are  used in firefighting foams to put out the worst of blazes, including  jet fuel fires. They are in advanced energy products like solar panels  and pipelines. They are even in piano keys and dental floss. These  compounds are risky if used improperly or irresponsibly, but they are  essential when used correctly.   Our second bill, the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act seeks to  overturn the Supreme Court's decision in the case of AMG Capital v.  Federal Trade Commission. In this decision, the Supreme Court ruled  unanimously that section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act does  not grant the Federal Trade Commission the authority to seek monetary  relief as an equitable remedy when engaging in enforcement actions.   Unfortunately, this bill was rushed through the Energy and Commerce  Committee without addressing any of the Republican concerns. First,  this bill reinstates the Federal Trade Commission's authority to seek  monetary relief under section 13(b) and expands the scope to apply  broadly to all FTC enforcement authority. This will likely make  monetary relief the go-to remedy for every alleged FTC violation.   The Federal Trade Commission already has authority to seek monetary  relief for fraudulent and dishonest conduct under section 19 of the  Federal Trade Commission Act.   Second, this bill includes a statute of limitations of 10 years, but  a 5-year statute of limitations is in line with the rest of the Federal  Trade Commission Act, and, in fact, would be more appropriate. It does  not make sense for courts to go back for a full decade to calculate  monetary relief.   During the Rules meeting yesterday, Ranking Member Bilirakis offered  an amendment that would have addressed these two issues. Unfortunately,  committee Democrats would not even allow a debate on these amendments  on the floor of this House.   Additionally, the expanded scope of the bill would give the Federal  Trade Commission new authority to seek monetary relief in antitrust  cases. This remedy is currently not needed, because antitrust cases can  be brought through private rights of action or, in fact, treble  damages, a tripling of the compensatory damages, can be awarded.   This bill is a missed opportunity to develop Federal privacy  legislation that is needed to overcome a patchwork of State laws. A key  part of protecting consumers is ensuring that the Federal Trade  Commission has the tools to enforce a Federal privacy standard. It is  disappointing that the Democrats refused to work with Republicans to  make this bill actually useful and effective for real consumers.   Republicans support ensuring that the Federal Trade Commission has  the necessary tools to protect consumers from bad actors. But it also  recognizes that guardrails are necessary to prevent the Federal Trade  Commission from exceeding its authority.   The final bill, the ALLIES Act, expands the number of special  immigrant visas by 8,000 and eases requirements for Afghan  requirements. To qualify, an individual must have been employed in  Afghanistan by or on behalf of the United States Government, the  International Security Assistance Force, or the Resolute Support  Mission.   This bill removes the current requirement that the International  Security Assistance Force or Resolute Support employees had been  engaged in sensitive and trusted positions. This will make it easier  for Afghans who served alongside our Armed Forces to qualify.   Americans first entered Afghanistan in October 2001. Most of us were  not in Congress in October of 2001. And this, of course, followed the  terrorist attacks on September 11 of that year. Once the Taliban was  defeated and Osama bin Laden was caught, the United States worked to  establish a legitimate and strong central government in Afghanistan.  Now, after 20 years, Americans are ready for their brave sons and  daughters to come home.   Despite our efforts and bloodshed, Afghanistan remains plagued by a  resurgent Taliban, by dangerous militias, and by a weak central  government. The Pentagon recently stated that, for all intents and  purposes, the United States withdrawal is, in fact, already complete.  Unfortunately, many Afghans who served alongside our Armed Forces and  security personnel remain in Afghanistan under serious threat due to  their employment by or on behalf of the United States' missions.    We must ensure that we are not putting Americans at risk by not  properly vetting applicants as they are brought to this country, but we  also must do right by those Afghans who risked their lives to aid  Americans throughout the last 20 years.   Mr. Speaker, it will come as no surprise to you that I am going to  urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to immediately consider S. 1867, the COVID-19  Origin Act, introduced by Senator Hawley. It has been 55 days since the  Senate passed this critical bill without a single dissenting vote.   Declassifying intelligence surrounding the origin of COVID-19 is  imperative and key to the House Republican plan to hold China  accountable for the pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, to further explain the amendment, I yield 5  minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), a valuable member of  the Doctors Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, again, I am going to urge defeat of the  previous question and consideration of the amendment as previously  discussed by Dr. Wenstrup.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  LaHood) to further explain the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), a former member of the Rules Committee and a  valuable member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how many additional  speakers the gentlewoman from North Carolina has.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans agree that PFAS contamination must be  addressed, and it must be addressed quickly. But requiring a blanket  CERCLA designation for a family of over 9,000 compounds is not only  untenable; it circumvents the science and the ongoing work at the  Environmental Protection Agency.   I do want to point out that yesterday I had posed a question in the  Rules Committee if there had been a hearing in the Energy and Commerce  Committee. I was assured that there had been. But, in fact, those  hearings occurred in the previous Congress.   There was a reference to PFAS in the budgetary hearing for the  Environmental Protection Agency, and there was likewise a tangential  reference in a reauthorization of a water bill, but for an issue that  is this involved, it seems that this required its own separate hearing  within the committee.   The Chair, who is on the Energy and Commerce Committee, knows that  sometimes these things run together. We have worked on this problem for  so many Congresses that I asked the question simply because I couldn't  remember if there had been an actual hearing on this bill in this  Congress. But, in fact, there has not, and I just want the Record to  accurately reflect that.   The reason that that is important is there are many Members in this  Congress who were not Members of the previous Congress, and we are  asking them to take a vote today on a terribly important piece of  legislation. We need to provide our colleagues with all the facts, and  the way we do that in regular order is through the regular hearing  process in an authorizing committee, like the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   Unfortunately, in spite of the assurances from the chair of the Rules  Committee, that has not happened with this bill.   Another thing really was concerning to me yesterday in the Rules  Committee. I had two amendments. I was told: Oh, we can't do those  because we don't really know the budgetary impacts of that.   My gosh, you don't know the budgetary impacts of the entire bill.   We got a CBO score right at the hearing time yesterday, and the CBO  score says $280 million of direct expenses over the next 10 years. But  it has no idea of the downstream effects of passing this legislation or  what the resulting expenditures would be for Federal and State  governments. We have no earthly idea what the actual cost of this is.   I would just simply submit, to reject amendments brought in good  faith by Republicans because you don't have all the budgetary  information at hand when the Congressional Budget Office really cannot  provide us the proper budgetary direction on the underlying bill, you  begin to see the discrepancy and why that yields so much frustration.   As a result, no Republican amendments to try to improve the bill were  considered because of the indeterminate budgetary effects. It seems to  me that a bill focused on consumer safety should not be limited by  procedural issues.   Those very same procedural issues, Mr. Speaker, can be waived by the  Committee on Rules. That is what we do. We waive things all the time.  But in this case, we couldn't find the additional energy to be able to  do that.   Additionally, the rushed bill to overturn the Supreme Court's  decision on the Federal Trade Commission's section 13(b) authority to  seek monetary relief will only make monetary relief the go-to remedy  for every FTC violation, with no guardrails.   Creating new agency authority that affects consumers should not be  undertaken so lightly and should not be rushed through committee  without full consideration of the issue. This bill does nothing to  advance Federal privacy standards that are needed to overcome the  patchwork of State laws and increase our ability to negotiate a new  data-sharing agreement with the European Union.   Again, I would just stress that an amendment offered by Mr. Bilirakis  in committee--and I offered it again yesterday in the Rules Committee-- to try to make this a more bipartisan and reasonable approach was  rejected on party lines. That is not the way that we should be  governing.   Finally, the ALLIES Act will increase the ability of certain Afghans  to obtain Special Immigrant Visas. These Afghans worked alongside our  troops for years to make their country a better place, often at  significant risk to their own lives and their families' lives. We must  ensure that they are properly and thoroughly vetted so that the Taliban  and jihadist militias cannot exploit our generosity. We must also not  leave behind those who risked their lives to aid our Armed Forces.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, and I  urge a ``no'' vote on the rule. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
