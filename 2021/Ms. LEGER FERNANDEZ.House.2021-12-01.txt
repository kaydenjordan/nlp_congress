(f) Repatriation Under Native American Graves Protection       and Repatriation Act.--The voluntary return provisions of       this section shall apply to a specific item of tangible       cultural heritage only to the extent that the repatriation       provisions under section 7 of the Native American Graves       Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3005) do not apply       to the item of tangible cultural heritage.       SEC. 7. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2930, the Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony  Act of 2021, or STOP Act, will increase the  [[Page H6731]]  penalties for trafficking Tribal cultural patrimony and will explicitly  prohibit the export of such objects.   The STOP Act will establish Federal frameworks to assist in the  repatriation of stolen Tribal objects between Federal agencies and  Tribal governments.   Due to colonization, it is no secret that the exploitation of Native  American cultural items, like human remains, sacred objects, and other  tools, have been looted and sold to collectors around the world.   In the 1970s, the Pueblo of Acoma in New Mexico had their sacred  Acoma shield stolen during a robbery on Tribal lands.   Imagine the Tribe's surprise when their sacred Acoma shield was  scheduled for sale to the highest bidder at the Eve Auction House in  Paris, France.   Thanks to an outpouring of support and diplomatic pleas against the  auction house, the sale was stopped. But incidents like this will  continue to occur without a codified method to hold traffickers of  cultural patrimony accountable.   While the Acoma shield is one example where the sale did not go  through, there are countless and numerous other undiscovered and  unreported cases where Tribal cultural artifacts and items are sold or  auctioned in pure disrespect for their proper ownership and place of  reverence.   Cultural items belonging to Native Americans and Native Hawaiians  should no longer be considered relics of the past and available to sell  to the highest bidder.   It is time for our country to celebrate the cultural items and  protect them from exploitation.   The STOP Act will: Direct the Department of the Interior to convene  an interagency working group;   Refer individuals and organizations to Indian Tribes and Native  Hawaiian organizations to facilitate the voluntary return of human  remains and cultural items; and   Convene a Native American working group with representatives from  Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to provide advice on  issues concerning the return of and illegal trade in human remains and  cultural items.   The United States is a signatory to an international treaty that  entrusts the Federal Government with supporting the repatriation of  other countries' tribal objects. We do it for other countries, but we  don't do it for our own.   Our Native American Tribes and Native Hawaiians do not have the same  statutory mechanism to prevent cultural sacred items in the United  States from going overseas to other countries.   The STOP Act requires the Department of the Interior and the  Department of State to each designate a liaison to facilitate and hold  trainings and workshops on the voluntary return of human remains and  cultural items.   The bill reflects significant compromises and adjustments to  accommodate concerns of antiquity dealers and has gone through 20  amendments. I was pleased to see these efforts recognized with passage  in committee by unanimous consent.   This version reflects negotiations with Tribal leaders, Federal  agency experts, and the Authentic Tribal Art Dealers Association. As  many know, New Mexico holds the largest Indian art market where artists  sell their beautiful creations. The Southwestern Association for Indian  Arts, SWAIA, has declared their support for the STOP Act.   Passage of the STOP Act will allow the United States to strengthen  its ability to prohibit the exportation of Native American and Native  Hawaiian cultural items. Let's not forget that Native American and  Native Hawaiian history is our country's history.   The protection of these cultural items must be a priority for our  country, because once they are stolen and taken out of our country,  they become lost to those who revere them.   Madam Speaker, I urge the swift adoption of H.R. 2930, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I, too, wish to thank the really incredible support and working  relationship that we have developed with the ranking member and other  members of the committee. This is a bipartisan bill, and it has taken  some work to get it where it is today, but I think that we are all  supportive of it.   The really wonderful thing is that when I am home in New Mexico, I am  asked about this bill repeatedly, because the Nations want to see their  works protected.   These are cultural items that belong with those who know how to  revere them, who know how to protect them, who know how to care for  them. It is something that you will hear Tribes across this country,  not only in New Mexico, ask Congress to take action on. I am very  pleased that we are taking action today on the STOP Act.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  the legislation. I see that in the Chamber, we have Representative  Young, who is a cosponsor. I would also like to thank Representatives  Cole and Radewagen for joining in this bill. It does have bipartisan  support.   I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4352) to amend the Act of June 18, 1934, to  reaffirm the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land  into trust for Indian Tribes, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4352         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REAFFIRMATION OF AUTHORITY.         (a) Modification.--        (1) In general.--The first sentence of section 19 of the       Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 5129), is amended--        (A) by striking ``The term'' and inserting ``Effective       beginning June 18, 1934, the term''; and        (B) by striking ``any recognized Indian tribe now under       Federal jurisdiction'' and inserting ``any federally       recognized Indian Tribe''.        (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1)       shall take effect as if included in the Act of June 18, 1934       (commonly known as the ``Indian Reorganization Act''; 25       U.S.C. 5101 et seq.), on the date of the enactment of that       Act.        (b) Ratification and Confirmation of Actions.--Any action       taken by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Act of       June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.), for any Indian Tribe       that was federally recognized on the date of the action is       ratified and confirmed, to the extent such action is       subjected to challenge based on whether the Indian Tribe was       federally recognized or under Federal jurisdiction on June       18, 1934, as if the action had, by prior Act of Congress,       been specifically authorized and directed.        (c) Effect on Other Laws.--        (1) In general.--Nothing in this section or the amendments       made by this section affects--        (A) the application or effect of any Federal law other than       the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.), as amended       by subsection (a); or        (B) any limitation on the authority of the Secretary of the       Interior under any Federal law or regulation other than the       Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.), as amended by       subsection (a).        (2) References in other laws.--An express reference to the       Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.), contained in       any other Federal law shall be considered to be a reference       to that Act as amended by subsection (a).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4352 amends section 19 of the Indian  Reorganization Act to allow the Secretary of the Interior to take land  into trust for federally recognized Indian Tribes regardless of their  date of recognition.   Over a decade ago, in the Carcieri v. Salazar case, the Supreme Court  held that the Secretary of the Interior's authority under the Indian  Reorganization Act to place land into trust for a Tribe applies only to  Tribes that were under Federal jurisdiction in 1934.   Before the Carcieri decision, the Department of the Interior, under  previous administrations, had consistently interpreted the Indian  Reorganization Act as authorizing the Department to take land into  trust for any Tribe as long as the Tribe was federally recognized at  the time of its land-into-trust application.   Placing land into trust is vital for Tribal sovereignty and self- determination. We must remember that most of the land sought to be  placed in trust is actually historic land, aboriginal land of the  Tribes themselves, and they are simply seeking to reacquire it and to  have the same trust protections placed on that land as their other  land.   Placing land into trust also confers important protections, benefits,  and flexibility for Tribes, including protections essential for  supporting Tribal cultural practices and well-being as well as their  ability to exercise jurisdiction over that land.   However, the Carcieri decision overturned 75 years of Department of  the Interior practice by holding that the Indian Reorganization Act  provided the Interior Department with authorization to take land into  trust only for Tribes that were federally recognized at the time of the  enactment of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.   As a result, the Court's decision created a two-tier system of the  haves and have nots among federally recognized Tribes applying for  trust land acquisition.   Now, Tribes that have been recognized after 1934 cannot apply with  the Interior Department to have land taken into trust. Instead, each of  these Tribes must seek new legislation from Congress every single time  they have a similar land request.   We have already seen the real-world consequences of the Carcieri  decision, as year after year Congress has to pass stand-alone bills for  individual Tribes on a piecemeal basis to protect their lands. In fact,  in a few moments we will consider exactly such a bill.   The Carcieri decision also opened up Tribes to costly lawsuits  regarding land that they have held in trust for years, sometimes  decades. It has taken almost a century for us to begin undoing the  damage we inflicted on our Nation's indigenous peoples upon colonial  contact.   The 1934 Indian Reorganization Act was an important step in that  healing process with the Tribes, but we now know that our work is not  yet done. We are still federally acknowledging Tribes to this day. We  passed a Tribal recognition bill here in the House on November 1.   To this day, Congress is still working to right many wrongs from the  Federal Government. We are still striving to return a portion, just a  small portion of the land back to the Tribes.   To say that Tribes federally recognized after 1934 are somehow  inferior to Tribes federally recognized before is dangerously ignorant  of the idea that we right now are on Indian land.   H.R. 4352, introduced by the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  McCollum), will right this wrong and amend the Indian Reorganization  Act to ensure that all federally recognized Tribes are treated equally,  regardless of their date of recognition.   For more than a decade, the Carcieri decision has caused anxiety and  confusion in Indian Country. It has created dangerous legal ambiguities  related to Indian trust lands.   Passing this bill will remove the ambiguity and uncertainty  surrounding land into trust and finally offer all 574 federally  recognized Tribal nations peace of mind that their lands can be  protected.   I urge the swift adoption of the bill, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I would like to offer my  gratitude to the next speaker for the hard work she has put into this  bill so that we can resolve this issue now and into the future.   I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I truly appreciate Representative Cole bringing into the discussion  about this bill the fact of how it has impacted his own Tribe and their  ability to take land into trust and not be subject to these  unnecessary, frivolous, and time-consuming, as well as expensive,  lawsuits that just create confusion out there.   I think the fact that Mr. Cole has worked on this every year since we  had the Carcieri decision tells you so much about how, on both sides of  the aisle, in the House and Senate, we are looking for a fix, and this  is indeed the Carcieri fix.   Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time and would inquire  whether my colleague has any remaining speakers on their side.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Once again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. We must  remember that all we are doing is making sure that all Tribes have the  same access to the existing statutory law that allows Tribes to take  land into trust. We are not changing any of the other laws that would  apply to that trust process.   I myself have engaged in numerous land into trust transactions when I  was an attorney, and I can tell you they are not easy. You must show  that you have a connection to the land; what you will be doing with the  land; how you communicated and discussed the issue of taking land into  trust with the nearby communities, with the local governments, with the  State government; is this aboriginal land; what will you be doing with  the land; let's go through the NEPA process.   It is not an easy process, but now every Tribe will be able to have  the same access to the same statutory process when we pass this law.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 897) to take certain lands in California into trust  for the benefit of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 897         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Agua Caliente Land Exchange       Fee to Trust Confirmation Act''.       SEC. 2. LANDS TO BE TAKEN INTO TRUST.         (a) In General.--The approximately 2,560 acres of land       owned by the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians generally       depicted as ``Lands to be Taken into Trust'' on the map       entitled ``Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians Land to be       Taken into Trust'' and dated November 17, 2021, is hereby       taken into trust by the United States for the benefit of the       Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians.        (b) Lands Part of Reservation.--Lands taken into trust by       this section shall be part of the Tribe's reservation and       shall be administered in accordance with the laws and       regulations generally applicable to property held in trust by       the United States for an Indian Tribe.        (c) Gaming Prohibited.--Lands taken into trust by this       section for the benefit of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla       Indians shall not be eligible for gaming under the Indian       Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 897 will take approximately 2,560 acres of  specified lands in California into trust for the Agua Caliente Band of  Cahuilla Indians and make these lands part of the Agua Caliente Indian  Reservation.   The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians is indigenous to the  desert and canyons of what we now call the Coachella Valley. I was just  there, Madam Speaker, and it is beautiful, and the manner in which the  Agua Caliente Band takes care of the land and works with their  community is superb. They should be recognized for their ability to  have that government-to-government relationship with their neighbors.   The Agua Caliente Indian Reservation was established in 1876, with  their ancestral lands located in the greater Palm Springs area. Over  the centuries, the lands traditionally held by the Agua Caliente were  divided by parcels owned by the Tribe, the Federal Government, and  private entities. The divided plots of land led to a checkerboard  formation of ownership.   The Tribe has been involved in land transfers with the Federal  Government to consolidate the traditional land and reclaim certain  culturally significant areas throughout the years. In 1999, the Tribe  assisted in preserving the cultural resources surrounding the Santa  Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument and supported  legislation for its recognition.   The national monument legislation included a land exchange of remote  wilderness located within the national monument. Although the  legislation establishing the national monument passed, it did not  expressly state the status of any land transferred to the Tribe through  the land exchange.   The lack of explicit language about the status of land led to the  Bureau of Land Management and the Tribe working for at least 17 years  to finalize a binding exchange agreement for the 2,560 acres addressed  in this bill.   This bill improves land management by the Tribe and the Bureau of  Land Management by consolidating the checkerboard land ownership around  the Tribe's reservation by placing these lands into trust.   Concerns regarding public access to trails have been addressed. The  Tribe has a long history of maintaining public trails within the  monument boundary. I urge anybody who is in the area to go take a hike  on the trails. They are beautiful.   The land is within a remote wilderness area and will be managed  similarly to how the Bureau of Land Management oversaw the land.   In a good faith effort to support the conservation efforts of the  binding exchange agreement, the Tribe included a gaming prohibition for  the lands in H.R. 897.   I thank Dr. Raul Ruiz for his sponsorship of this bill and his hard  work getting it to this point.   Madam Speaker, I urge swift adoption of H.R. 897, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2074) to assist Tribal governments in the  management of buffalo and buffalo habitat and for the reestablishment  of buffalo on Indian lands, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2074         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Buffalo Management       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--        (1) buffalo sustained a majority of Indian Tribes in North       America for many centuries before buffalo were nearly       exterminated by non-Indian hunters in the mid-1800s;        (2) the historical, cultural, and spiritual connection       between buffalo and Indian Tribes has not diminished over       time;        (3) Indian Tribes have long desired the reestablishment of       buffalo throughout Indian country for cultural, spiritual,       and subsistence purposes; and        (4) the successful restoration of buffalo would allow an       Indian Tribe to benefit from--        (A) the reintroduction of buffalo into the diets of the       members of the Indian Tribe;        (B) the rekindling of the spiritual and cultural       relationship between buffalo and the Indian Tribe; and        (C) the use of buffalo for economic development, in the       case of an Indian Tribe that chooses to use buffalo for       economic development.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2074, the Indian Buffalo Management Act is  sponsored by the dean of the House, Representative   Don Young from  Alaska, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill.   This bill will establish a permanent program within the Department of  the Interior to develop and promote Tribal ownership and management of  buffalo and buffalo habitat on Indian lands.  [[Page H6737]]    In the 1840s, the buffalo population in North America was estimated  at 30 million, with approximately 60 million at its peak. Before  colonization, about 7 million indigenous peoples populated the North  American continent. Throughout this time, many indigenous peoples  coexisted with buffalo, often through a sacred, spiritual relationship.  The buffalo provided food, shelter, tools, clothing, and became an  essential component of traditional beliefs and religion.   But in the 19th century, in an attempt to displace or eradicate  indigenous peoples, the United States military slaughtered tens of  millions of buffalo. At the turn of the century, fewer than 500 buffalo  remained in this country. Similarly, the American Indian population was  reduced to merely 250,000 in the early 1900s. What a loss. By the 20th  century many buffalo conservation efforts were headed by President  Teddy Roosevelt and frequently led to private ownership of buffalo  herds.   In 1991, 10 Tribes committed to buffalo restoration efforts with  1,500 buffalo and organized the InterTribal Buffalo Council, or ITBC.  The ITBC collaborates with several Federal agencies for buffalo  management, and now includes 69 federally recognized Tribes in 19  States with 55 buffalo herds. I am here to report that many of the  Tribes and pueblos within my district have thriving herds of their own.   The Indian Buffalo Management Act will allow Tribal nations to  develop and maintain buffalo herds on Tribal lands to restore treaty  obligations and the buffalo population itself. Additionally, this bill  will enable the transportation of surplus buffalo from Federal lands  into Tribal lands. The great Sioux Chief, Sitting Bull, summed up the  atrocities surrounding the buffalo when he said, ``a cold wind blew on  the prairie on the day the last buffalo fell. A death wind for my  people.''   Passage of the Indian Buffalo Management Act will begin the  remediation of buffalo for indigenous peoples and restore religious and  spiritual practices that were stripped after the founding of this  country.   Madam Speaker, I urge the swift adoption of this bipartisan bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am so very lucky to have on the Subcommittee for indigenous  peoples, the dean of the House, Representative   Don Young, as the  ranking member. The amount of work that we do in that committee, that  is bipartisan, that always looks at what is the issue that must be  solved and works together to solve that issue, is exactly sort of  epitomized by this bill.   We are recognizing that there was a tragedy in our history where we  actually tried to eliminate the food source for the indigenous peoples  of the Americas. And we did. We caused hunger. We caused the  deprivation, but we are recognizing that today and we are going to be  giving the assistance to all Tribes to be able to manage buffalo herds.   I have been very fortunate to eat bison. We love bison burgers at my  [[Page H6738]]  home; and I have been at Taos Pueblo when they have offered in their  ceremonial way the buffalo meat and the cooking around the fire. It is  indeed delicious. I completely agree with the dean of the House. But we  also need to recognize that managing a buffalo herd is not simple. We  need to make sure that there are no diseases that are passed between  cattle or elk and buffalo. They need to make sure that there is the  right genetics so that we don't interbreed so much.   So it does require a lot of work, and this bill provides the Tribes  with the assistance so that they can both protect and manage these  herds of these magnificent animals.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, for all of the reasons that has  been stated on the floor of this glorious House today, I urge my  colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3531) to authorize the Women Who Worked on the Home  Front Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of  Columbia and its environs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3531         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Women Who Worked on the Home       Front World War II Memorial Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         (a) In General.--The Women Who Worked on the Home Front       Foundation may establish a commemorative work on Federal land       in the District of Columbia and its environs to commemorate       the commitment and service represented by women who worked on       the home front during World War II.        (b) Compliance With Standards for Commemorative Works.--The       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       shall be in accordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United       States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works       Act'').        (c) Prohibition on the Use of Federal Funds.--        (1) In general.--Federal funds may not be used to pay any       expense of the establishment of the commemorative work under       this section.        (2) Responsibility of women who worked on the home front       foundation.--The Women Who Worked on the Home Front       Foundation shall be solely responsible for acceptance of       contributions for, and payment of the expenses of, the       establishment of the commemorative work under this section.        (d) Deposit of Excess Funds.--        (1) In general.--If upon payment of all expenses for the       establishment of the memorial (including the maintenance and       preservation amount required by section 8906(b)(1) of title       40, United States Code), there remains a balance of funds       received for the establishment of the commemorative work, the       Women Who Worked on the Home Front Foundation shall transmit       the amount of the balance to the Secretary of the Interior       for deposit in the account provided for in section 8906(b)(3)       of title 40, United States Code.        (2) On expiration of authority.--If upon expiration of the       authority for the commemorative work under section 8903(e) of       title 40, United States Code, there remains a balance of       funds received for the establishment of the commemorative       work, the Women Who Worked on the Home Front Foundation shall       transmit the amount of the balance to a separate account with       the National Park Foundation for memorials, to be available       to the Secretary of the Interior or Administrator (as       appropriate) following the process provided in section       8906(b)(4) of title 40, United States Code, for accounts       established under section 8906(b)(2) or (3) of title 40,       United States Code.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3531, the Women Who  Worked on the Home Front World War II Memorial Act, introduced by  Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. And I thank Representative  Eleanor Holmes Norton for the work that she has done to make sure that  all women are recognized and that we have a way of focusing that  recognition through this memorial.   This bill would authorize the establishment of a memorial to  commemorate the nearly 19 million women who worked on the home front  during World War II. With mass male enlistment leaving significant  vacancies in the industrial and defense agencies, women across the  country filled thousands of jobs that were historically held by men to  support the war effort and to keep America running.   As the men fought abroad, these women worked in defense plants, flew  military aircraft, delivered mail, and performed countless other duties  necessary to keep the home front running.                                time  1330    In addition to the women working on the home front, nearly 350,000  women served in uniform, both at home and abroad--directly supporting  the war effort as codebreakers, Airforce Service Pilots, and as  volunteers for organizations such as the Army Nurse Corps.   The work carried out by women on the home front during World War II  opened the door for women to hold more types of jobs than ever before,  and it is long past time that Congress recognizes the contributions to  our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for introducing  this important legislation. I would also like to extend my gratitude to  Ms. Raya Kenney, who developed the idea for this memorial when she was  in fifth grade, and for her tireless efforts to ensure that the  millions of women who worked on the home front during World War II are  recognized and celebrated.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3531, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton),  the sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am so grateful to  Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton because she knows how to listen to  brilliant women no matter the age. We really need to thank Ms. Raya  Kenney for coming up with the idea. Precisely, as we have heard on the  floor of the House today, it was not just Rosie the riveter, it was a  complex participation of women in the workforce.   In New Mexico, they were participating by running the ranches, they  were participating in our national labs on defense issues and some of  the most complex scientific discoveries that helped us win the war.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4706) to establish the Blackwell School National  Historic Site in Marfa, Texas, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4706         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Blackwell School National       Historic Site Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) National historic site.--The term ``national historic       site'' means the Blackwell School, in Marfa, Texas.        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds as follows:        (1) The Blackwell School, located at 501 South Abbott       Street, in Marfa, Presidio County, Texas, is associated with       the period of racial segregation in Marfa public schools and       is the sole extant property directly associated with Hispanic       education in the community, the remaining buildings having       been torn down after the school closed in 1965.        (2) The Blackwell School is a tangible reminder of a time       when the practice of ``separate but equal'' dominated       education and social systems. Despite being categorized as       ``white'' by Texas law, Mexican Americans were regularly       excluded from commingling with Anglos at barbershops,       restaurants, funeral homes, theaters, churches, and schools.        (3) The spectrum of experiences of students and teachers at       the Blackwell School constitute an important record of life       in a segregated school in the context of the history of Texas       and America.        (4) Mexican and Mexican American culture and history in       Marfa is tied to the Blackwell School, which for more than 50       years served as a leading feature of the Hispanic community,       illustrating the challenge of maintaining cultural identity       in a dominant Anglo society. Yet today, Hispanic influences       are seen in Marfa's social and religious organizations,       business and government institutions, and shared experiences       of language, food, and music.        (5) The historic Blackwell School building is a physical       record of the longevity and beauty of the distinctive design       and craftsmanship informed by both traditional techniques and       materials, and the transition from purely the vernacular to       the period of materials, design, and workmanship made       available after the arrival of the railroad. The original       historic school building and grounds on which it stands       provide an authentic setting to commemorate and interpret the       history of the Blackwell School.        (6) The Blackwell School is closely associated with the       broad patterns of local, State, and national history in the       area of school segregation. Mexicans and other members of the       Latin American diaspora have placed a high value upon       education as a means of economic, social, and political       advancement.        (7) Mexican Americans and other members of the Latin       American diaspora have placed a high value upon education as       a means of economic, social, and political advancement.       However, Hispanics and Latinos have not always had equitable       opportunities and access to quality educational facilities in       the United States.       SEC. 4.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4706, the Blackwell School  National Historic Site Act, introduced by my colleague, Representative  Tony Gonzales of Texas.   This bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish the  Blackwell School National Historic Site to preserve, protect, and  interpret the role of the Blackwell School as an academic and cultural  cornerstone in Marfa, Texas.   The Blackwell School was the sole public education institution for  Mexican-American children in Marfa from 1909 until 1965, when Marfa  schools were integrated.   The building is a tangible reminder of a time in American history  when separate but equal remained so prevalent in our culture. It is a  powerful reminder of the work that still remains before us today.   Approximately 4,000 students attended the Blackwell School over the  course of more than 50 years. Despite the inherent unfairness of  segregation, the Blackwell School became a meeting place and source of  pride for the local Hispanic community.   Today, all that remains of the once sprawling campus is a three-room  adobe schoolhouse--one of the last such schools remaining in Texas.  Designating the Blackwell School as a national historic site ensures  that the story of this school is maintained so that future Americans  can learn from and understand its rich and complex history.   Madam Speaker, I attended a school that was likewise, in its history,  segregated. Hispanos attended school on one side of the town and all  others on the other side.   I congratulate Representative Gonzales for championing this bill to  bring awareness that this is simply part of our history and we must  recognize it and understand it.   Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to support this bill today, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am ready to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I too want to recognize and  acknowledge the importance of this bill and Representative Gonzales's  bringing it to our attention because we must remember that all  stories--all stories--whether they be good or bad, whether they concern  segregation or celebration, are American stories, and this bill assists  us in looking at the complexity of the American story.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
