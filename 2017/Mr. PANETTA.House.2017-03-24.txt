 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of what has  become basically the complete repeal of the ACA. Don't get me wrong. I  have talked to small-business owners, and I have talked to patients who  have talked about the expenses of the ACA. But I have also heard from  people in my district on the central coast of California how much it  has benefited them, including 65,000 people who now have coverage under  Medicaid and 25,000 people who have gained it through the marketplace.   If the AHCA becomes law, we are not making it cheaper, and we are not  making it more accessible. Instead, all that is happening is that they  are fulfilling a campaign promise.   Mr. Speaker, we must make sure that the ACA is here. We cannot take  it away. We must make sure that we provide care, we provide coverage,  and we provide the covenant that we promised our constituents.
