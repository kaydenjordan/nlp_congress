 Mr. Speaker, as my distinguished colleague,  Representative Connolly from the State of Virginia, says: well, well,  well.   Several years ago, we warned during the Trump tax cuts, that this  dramatic decrease in revenue would explode the Nation's debt. We heard  from the Republican side: No, let us write off our yachts; let us write  off our private jets. We said that this decrease in revenue would  explode our national debt.   But instead of now realizing the error of our ways and reversing  these tax cuts for the wealthy, we are now seeing the Republican side  promote a bill that cuts student loan cancellation, veterans'  healthcare, cancer research, opioid treatment, Meals on Wheels, and  more.   The debt limit is about meeting our obligations already voted for,  that Republicans and Democrats have already voted for. If we want to  cut and make changes to programming in the future, we may do that, but  threatening to tank the economy is not how you do it.
