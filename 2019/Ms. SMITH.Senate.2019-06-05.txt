 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and  celebrate the life of Peter Melvin Thompson, Jr., a decorated Vietnam  war veteran and proud member of the White Earth Nation, who passed away  on Wednesday, January 30, 2019. Today, on June 5, 2019, Mr. Thompson  will be buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery  for his service to this country. He is the first member of the White  Earth Nation to receive this honor.   Mr. Thompson served in the Army for 12 years, during which time he  received six Purple Hearts, one Silver Star with valor device, and 3  Bronze Stars with valor device. In 1960, at the age of 17, Mr. Thompson  talked his dad into signing papers allowing him to enlist in the U.S.  Army. He attended basic training and was posted to Fort Leonard Wood,  MO, before volunteering to go to fight in the Vietnam war. Mr. Thompson  deployed twice to Vietnam, first with the First Cavalry Regiment in  central Vietnam from January 1968 to 1969. During this deployment, Mr.  Thompson was wounded twice and earned a Bronze Star.   Soon after returning to the States, Mr. Thompson volunteered for a  second tour in Vietnam. During his second tour, Mr. Thompson served as  platoon leader in charge of seven armored personnel carriers and three  tanks. He was wounded four more times. In 1970, while on a rescue  mission, Mr. Thompson was injured in combat for the last time. He was  airlifted to Hawk Hill, where he helped identify all the lost men in  his platoon before being sent to a field hospital to begin recovery.  Mr. Thompson was transferred to Colorado, where he finished his  recuperation and served as a probation officer at Fort Carson before  being discharged in 1972.   Mr. Thompson met and married Evelyn Auginaush on July 10, 1973 at St.  Phillips Church in Rice Lake, MN. Together they moved throughout  Minnesota before returning to Mr. Thompson's home in Rice Lake. Never  one to be idle, Mr. Thompson found work as a trapper for the State and  Tribe Predator Control and also worked at the Leech Lake Indian Health  Hospital Facilities as a manager, where he won two awards for his  service. Mr. Thompson's time in the military also left an indelible  mark on his life and led him to start the White Earth Honor Guard,  which he remained a part of throughout his life.   Today, Mr. Thompson is being laid to rest with full military honors  in Arlington National Cemetery by his wife Evelyn, daughters Cheryl and  Carol, 15 grandchildren, 6 great grandchildren, and many others. I am  proud today to recognize Peter Thompson for his service to this  country, to Minnesota, and to the White Earth Nation.                            ____________________
