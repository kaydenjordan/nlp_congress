 Mr. President, I was coming to floor today to talk about  legislation we just got passed in the last week in the Homeland  Security Committee with the hopes that I can convince some of my  colleagues to join us in this effort, and I will talk about that bill  in a moment. But first let me, if I could, address the photograph and  the comments from my colleague from New Jersey.   He showed a tragic photograph that so many of my constituents and all  Americans have seen--Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez and his daughter  Valeria, facedown in the Rio Grande.   This man came from El Salvador. We don't know all the details yet,  but clearly he was interested in coming to the United States and  applying for asylum, as so many others have come--hundreds a day,  thousands a week, hundreds of thousands a month now, overwhelming the  infrastructure at the border, pulling 40 to 60 percent of our Border  Patrol off the border to deal with the humanitarian crisis that has  occurred.   That tragic photograph--and it is a horrific photo of a daughter  clinging to her father's neck, having drowned in the Rio Grande coming  over from Mexico--should be a wake-up call. I agree with that, but it  should not be a wake-up call to have us continue to point fingers  around here at the other side and blame someone else for the problem.  It should instead be a wake-up call for solutions--for bipartisan  solutions--because that is all that works to be able to resolve these  issues.   I hope the first step will be taken today, because I just learned, as  I came to the floor, that the House of Representatives is now  considering taking up the legislation we passed here in the Senate just  yesterday. It provides immediate emergency funds for humanitarian  assistance at the border that is needed right now. We passed it with  over 80 votes here in the Senate--82 votes, with 9 of our Members  absent, I believe. Over 82 votes is very unusual for anything to pass  around here, particularly something so substantial.   It is bipartisan. It came out of the Appropriations Committee with a  30-to-1 vote to get these funds and these resources down to the border  now to help with this true humanitarian crisis that we are facing.  Everyone must acknowledge that.   The House was balking at that. They were sending us another bill that  had some partisan elements to it that no Republican could support in  the House--not a single one.   Finally, I think they have decided to pick up our bipartisan bill and  pass it, and thank God, because now the President can sign it and that  aid can go down to our border immediately where it is needed.   But I have to be frank with you. That humanitarian aid going down to  the border is not enough because I don't think it would have had an  impact on the tragic photograph that was talked about on the floor  earlier.   That incident did not occur because of the lack of humanitarian aid  that is badly needed. That incident occurred because there is this pull  factor to come to our country, particularly from these Northern  Triangle countries--Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. This particular  gentleman, Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez, came from El Salvador.   Then, there are push factors from those countries. And, again, this  is causing so many families to come here, so many unaccompanied  children to come here from these three countries in Central America.   The traffickers are telling them: If you come to America and you ask  for asylum, you will be let in.   Let's be frank. These countries are countries that have real  challenges and real problems.   My colleague from New Jersey is right. We have sent a lot of American  taxpayer dollars down to those countries, and he noted that the reports  back from the administration and others are positive, saying it is  beginning to make a difference. He noted that that funding is now being  reduced or even eliminated in some cases, but it was during the time  when that funding was there that the people started coming.   So, yes, we should have more funding that is effective for those  countries. I agree with that. The Millennium Challenge Corporation  funding is the new way we send that funding. It is more effective  because it says: What are you doing in Central America to improve your  infrastructure, your conditions, your judicial system, your rule of  law, and to fight corruption? We need to do all those things.  [[Page S4613]]    But let's be frank. Let's be honest. We have been doing that, and yet  the push factor is still there.   So I believe it is part of the answer, but I don't think logic  applied to this situation means that you could say that it is all of  the answer because we have been doing it.   My taxpayers and other taxpayers, I think, around this country are  willing to do more, but they also want to deal with the pull factor,  and the pull factor is very simple. If you come to America and you  apply for asylum right now, with the system being overwhelmed and with  certain laws in place, including a court decision, you are released  into the community, meaning you come into America. Most of the court  cases that deal with whether you are successful or not in your asylum  claim take over 2 years now. It takes over 2 years until you are before  a judge for a hearing.   When those court cases occur, we are told on the Homeland Security  Committee, that about 15 percent of those individuals are granted  asylum--15 percent.   Now, in America, our wages are 10 to 20 times higher than they are in  these Northern Triangle countries--El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras. Is  it any wonder that they come here seeking a better way of life? No, you  would too. But we have to have a system of laws here in this country  where, yes, we accept refugees and, yes, we accept people who have  claims of asylum that are granted, but we don't have open borders.   We have a system here, a system of laws, and it has clearly broken  down now. Again, thousands come in every week, hundreds of thousands  every month--mostly families, mostly children because of the way our  laws work. I don't think we should be separating families, by the way.  So, if you have a child with you or you are a child, then under a court  decision you could be held only for a short period of time, 20 days  maximum, in emergency situations. What happens is that people are  released into the community.   I will be frank with you. From what we have heard from Customs and  Border Protection and from the Department of Health and Human Services,  which are responsible for many of these detention facilities, they are  so overwhelmed, they don't even have room for 20 days, so people are  allowed to come into the community. Again, the court cases happen a  long time after that, and people are granted work permits. That is why  people are coming. It is a pull. They are saying: If you get to  America, we will get you in.   These traffickers are charging a lot of money. It is horrible. They  are taking mortgages on people's homes. They are saying ``We will take  half your pay for the next year,'' promising things that are frankly  beyond what can be accomplished.   A situation in Ohio occurred a couple years ago with kids from  Guatemala. Unaccompanied kids coming from Guatemala were told: You can  get in. It is good. We will take care of you. In this case, the  traffickers took mortgages on the parents' homes. They brought these  kids to the United States, to the Department of Health and Human  Services, HHS, detention facility. They were then sent out to sponsor  families, which is what they do. They take these minor children,  underaged, and send them to sponsor families. Sometimes they can find  families; sometimes they can't. In this case, our own government sent  these kids back to the traffickers because the traffickers applied for  the very kids they had brought up from Guatemala.   Despite claims and promises to their parents that they would get a  good education with a family taking care of these kids, do you know  what they did with these kids? They put them on an egg farm in Ohio-- underage kids--and exploited them. They took away their pay, had them  live in conditions none of us would find acceptable for any member of  our family. They had them living in trailers, some of them under  trailers, on mattresses without sheets, working 12 hours a day. Some of  these kids were working 6 days a week, some 7 days a week. This is not  America. Yet this was happening. Again, our system is broken. These  traffickers were exploiting these children.   Finally, in this case, law enforcement stepped in, and we have been  able to indict and convict the traffickers. Thank goodness. But this is  not a situation that can or should continue.   In the tragic photo of the story I just told, the answer is not  politically pointing fingers. Blaming Donald Trump isn't going to solve  this problem. We need as a body to change the laws. We need as a body  to provide more effective aid to those countries. That is true. The  push factors and the pull factors both need to be addressed. But if we  just play politics with this on both sides, we will have more  unnecessary deaths. We will have more tragic situations.   Again, I had planned to come and talk about something else, and I  will, briefly. But I must say, with regard to this immigration  challenge we face as a country, I hope the tragedy we have now all seen  online and on TV serves as a wake-up call to get to bipartisan  solutions that actually help solve this problem and stop the push  factors and the pull factors that will continue to bring hundreds of  thousands of people from these three countries to our border, which has  overwhelmed us.   Today there is a start. Today there is a start with the humanitarian  aid package. Thank goodness.   Tomorrow we need to get to work to talk about these bigger problems.  I will say, I have worked on this with some of my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle. I heard the words today from my colleague from New  Jersey about refugee processing centers. I think that is part of the  answer. In the Obama administration, you could apply for refugee status  from your country--El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras--and not come to  the border. The refugee criteria is almost identical to the criteria  for asylum. The United Nations does this all over the world. I agree,  that is a much better solution.   Let's have these processing centers in the Northern Triangle  countries. Let's have one in Mexico, maybe one in Mexico at the  southern border with Guatemala, maybe one at the northern border of the  United States. Let's deal with this processing problem. Let's determine  who is qualified, who has a legitimate fear of persecution. Again, 15  percent of them are now being granted. The other 85 percent are not.  For the others, we have to say: You can apply to come to the United  States as everybody else does, from Mexico, from the Philippines, from  India, from countries in Africa, and we need to continue to be a  generous country with regard to immigration. But we have to have a  system of laws, and we have to stop these tragedies where people are  being told by traffickers: You can make this journey to the north. It  will be fine.   It is not fine. It is arduous, it is dangerous, and you see the  results.   The trafficking that is going on of girls and women is all part of  this too. It is not going to stop unless we as a group here in  Congress, on a bipartisan basis, deal not just with the push factors  but also the pull factors and deal with them realistically.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the legislation I came to the floor to  talk about today passed in the Homeland Security Committee last week to  help make our synagogues, our churches, our mosques, and other  nonprofit institutions safer.   Sadly, we have seen a troubling pattern in recent years. Hate-fueled  attacks at houses of worship and religious institutions, not just in  our country but around the world, are becoming more and more common. A  couple of months ago, a shooting at a synagogue outside San Diego took  the life of Lori Gilbert Kaye, who heroically sacrificed herself to  save her rabbi. Exactly 6 months to the day prior to that, the shooting  at the Tree of Life synagogue outside of Pittsburgh, PA, claimed 11  lives, the worst act of anti-Semitic violence in U.S. history.   Sometimes this hate is manifested in other ways: bomb threats at the  Jewish Community Center in Columbus, OH, and anti-Semitic graffiti  sprayed on the Hebrew Union College walls in my hometown of Cincinnati,  OH.   Right after the attacks on the synagogue in Pittsburgh last year, I  went to the Jewish Community Center in Youngstown, OH, only 60 miles  away from Pittsburgh, to meet with Jewish community leaders. An attack  on one is an attack on all. We must all stand up.  [[Page S4614]]    In Youngstown that somber day, we talked about where we go from here  to stop anti-Semitism and hatred. I asked them for input about what the  Federal Government can do to help keep the Jewish community safe. Part  of the input I got was that we need more help on best practices on  security and more resources to protect our community centers, our  schools, our churches, our synagogues, our mosques.   The resurgence of this anti-Semitism must be confronted and defeated  with all the energy we can bring to bear. But sadly, it is not just  related to the Jewish community, which has known it for over the  centuries. Hate seldom stops at one religion or one country.    Hundreds of Christians in Sri Lanka were massacred in churches and  hotels on Easter Sunday. In New Zealand, the shooting at the mosques in  Christchurch killed at least 49 people. We will never forget the 2015  tragic killings of African-American parishioners at Emmanuel AME Church  in Charleston, SC, where I have visited and prayed, or the 2017 attacks  on the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, TX.   While I have highlighted unconscionable mass murders, there are so  many other examples of vandalism and harassment. We saw this in my home  State of Ohio this February, where a man holding a gun smashed the  windows of a mosque in Dayton while worshipers were praying inside. We  saw it in Louisiana this April when three historically Black churches  were deliberately burned down within the same parish. This violence is  senseless and contrary to our values as Americans.   Our first obligation as Americans and certainly as public officials  is to stand up and say this must stop. Stop the hate--not just partisan  finger-pointing but a single, unified message. Targeted communities  cannot stop it on their own. We must remind all of our fellow citizens  that we are all made in the image of God, and the anti-Semitism, the  hatred, and the violence are not acceptable in this country.   Sadly, if these trends are any indication, we also have to recognize  these attacks are likely to continue, and I think Congress can and  should do more to provide synagogues, mosques, churches, and other  faith-based organizations with best practices and more resources to  secure their facilities effectively.   Based in part on the input I received in Youngstown that sad day, I  have been the leading supporter of the Nonprofit Security Grant  Program. This grant program allows nonprofits, including synagogues and  other faith-based organizations, to apply for funds they can use to  access best practices to secure their facilities and to train  personnel.   Some good news came out recently. Under the new Department of  Homeland Security rules, nonprofits are now permitted to hire armed  security personnel with these funds. That is something I had promoted.  I think it is a good idea because it is needed. Last year, I led a  bipartisan letter with Senator Casey to push for a total of $60 million  for the program nationwide. I am happy to say that funding level was  incorporated in the final Homeland Security appropriations bill.   This year, I am working with my colleagues to actually authorize this  program to be sure it will be there in the future and to increase the  amount of funding in the program to $75 million so that nonprofits  outside of the largest urban areas--which are currently being served  through the initial program--also have access to this funding.  Unfortunately, in a lot of instances I talked about earlier, it was not  in major urban centers. So it is being spread well beyond our big  cities.   To support that effort, my colleague Senator Gary Peters and I have  introduced bipartisan legislation called the Protecting Faith-Based and  Nonprofit Organizations from Terrorism Act to provide best practices  and more funding for hardening vulnerable nonprofits and faith-based  institutions and for training resources for those congregations.   The bill authorizes $75 million annually for the next 5 years, $50  million to be used by nonprofits located within high-risk, large urban  areas, and the rest will be available for nonprofits in other areas.   I am pleased to report that the Homeland Security Committee  unanimously approved this bill last week. I look forward to its coming  to the floor, where I hope it can be passed on a bipartisan basis.  While our bill is pending, I hope my colleagues in the Appropriations  Committee will once again be receptive to the letter and spirit of our  bill to make those resources available to urban and nonurban areas  alike.   I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to ensure that the thousands of religious and other nonprofit  institutions in Ohio and across our country are safe and welcoming  places. I pray we will see the day when such security grants are not  necessary because we will abide by the admonition to love our neighbors  as ourselves. But in the meantime, let's do what we can to give our  communities the know-how, the resources, and the best practices so they  can be safer and more secure.   I yield the floor.
