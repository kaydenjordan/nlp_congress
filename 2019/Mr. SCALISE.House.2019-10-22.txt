 Madam Speaker, like so many of my colleagues here today  on the floor, I rise in strong opposition to the way that this  impeachment inquiry is being conducted--in secret, behind closed doors.   Madam Speaker, we had an election in 2016 and the people of this  country spoke loudly. Not only that, Madam Speaker, there is going to  be another election next year, and that is when the people of this  country should be able to decide who the next President is.   This shouldn't be conducted behind closed doors. Not only is it an  impeachment inquiry that has not had a vote of the full House, which  every other impeachment inquiry has had, but there are actual voting  Members of Congress who are being denied access to these hearings,  denied the ability to see what is happening behind closed doors.   What do they have to hide, Madam Speaker? Why aren't they willing to  have a vote on the House floor?   This is not the way it should be done. Maybe in Russia this is how  they conduct hearings. This is not how it should be done in the United  States of America, where Members of Congress are denied access, the  press is denied access, and, ultimately, the American people are denied  access to what is going on behind closed doors to overturn the results  of the 2016 election.
