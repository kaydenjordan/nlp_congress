 Madam President, today I would like to speak in  opposition to two dangerous pieces of legislation that were considered  in the Senate, both of which would severely undermine women's  constitutional right to safe and legal abortions. One bill, S. 3275,  the so-called Pain-Capable Unborn Protection Act, would create a  national 20-week abortion ban, while the other, S. 311, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act, would attempt to scare providers who  perform abortions out of business by subjecting them to penalties or  even prison.   Let me be clear. These bills are not about protecting babies. These  bills are about telling women what they can and cannot do with their  own bodies and making their own medical decisions for them. Today in  the United States, we have some of the highest maternal mortality rates  and infant mortality rates in the developed world. This crisis is only  worsened by the racial and economic disparities many women face in our  country, in addition to the reality that some 87 million Americans are  either uninsured or underinsured. Instead of helping our Nation make  progress toward eliminating these disparities, such as by guaranteeing  affordable healthcare, including abortion, as a right, this legislation  would bring us back to the dark ages when women in America did not have  the right to control their own bodies. It is a simple reality that, if  the Senate votes to deny women access to safe and legal abortion, many  of them will suffer and perhaps even die. I urge my colleagues to  oppose S. 3275 and S. 311. Thank you.                            ____________________
