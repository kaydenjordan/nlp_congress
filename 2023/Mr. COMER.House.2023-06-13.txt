 Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin), the  ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability,  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.  [[Page H2843]]     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Garbarino).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to support this bipartisan resolution as a  majority of my colleagues in the House did 2 months ago. Not much has  changed since we last passed this resolution of disapproval.   Since Congress sent this resolution to President Biden, we have  continued to see rampant crime in the District of Columbia. D.C.  residents and visitors are still unsafe in their Capital City.   The Metropolitan Police Department continues to face retention and  recruitment challenges.   Crime levels are still higher in 2023 compared to the same time in  2022. Total crime is up 27 percent. Violent crime is up 16 percent.  Homicide is up 19 percent. Motor vehicle theft is up a staggering 118  percent. This is unacceptable.   Most notably, as of June 7, D.C. hit a concerning marker. There have  been 100 murders in D.C. this year. According to the D.C. Police Union,  this is the earliest point in the calendar year that the city has  reached this marker since 2003.   However, in the Committee on Oversight and Accountability's March 29  hearing, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson claimed that there is no  crime crisis in D.C.   In another Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing on May 16,  U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves refused to take accountability for his  office's failure to prosecute 67 percent of cases last year.   The D.C. Council and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia  have failed the residents of D.C.   Congress has a duty to oversee the Nation's Capital and ensure its  safety for all residents and visitors. It is time for this body to  stand up to the criminals. I call on my colleagues to vote in favor of  this resolution.   The President's veto of H.J. Res. 42 serves no purpose other than to  continue to allow crime to spread and hinder our local police from  fulfilling their duties to protect the D.C. community and the Nation's  Capital City.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to uphold what we and the Senate  have done over the last 2 months by voting in favor of this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
