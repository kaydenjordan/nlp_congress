 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my coauthor on this bill,  Congresswoman Maloney, for her great leadership on this legislation, as  well as Chairman Huizenga, Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters,  and the entire Financial Services Committee team for their hard work on  this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, it is a rare occasion in Washington when Republicans and  Democrats can come together and get behind a change to the banking  regulations, but we stand here today behind H.R. 1624 because the  banking regulators, frankly, well, they messed it up. They created a  rule that gives foreign municipalities a competitive advantage over our  American cities and towns, and this advantage is hurting our  communities.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is really quite simple. It will help  cities and towns in my State and across the United States save money on  roads and bridges and schools. President Trump has made rebuilding our  infrastructure a priority for our Nation, and this bipartisan bill  paves the way for this type of investment by lowering the price tag for  roads and bridges.   H.R. 1624 reverses a backwards banking regulation that makes it more  expensive for U.S. municipalities to finance infrastructure projects.  Specifically, the bill will amend the regulation to enable more banks  to hold municipal bonds to cover their liquidity requirements. This  change should reduce the cost of borrowing for cities and towns across  the country. Ultimately, this bill helps taxpayers by making it cheaper  to finance infrastructure projects.   H.R. 1624 will help blue States and red States alike, and that is why  you have seen such overwhelming bipartisan support for this in the  Halls of Congress. The bill passed the Financial  [[Page H7706]]  Services Committee unanimously this summer, and very similar  legislation passed the Chamber by a voice vote last year.                                time  1515    Still we have got more work to do, and there is now momentum in the  Senate to get H.R. 1624 across the finish line.   The bill is also supported by numerous outside advocacy groups,  including the National Governors Association, the Government Finance  Officers Association, the National League of Cities, the National  Association of State Treasurers, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and  even the State treasurer from my home State of Indiana, my good friend,  Kelly Mitchell.   Mr. Speaker, today we take the first step in this process in the  House toward reversing this backwards regulation, and I urge all my  colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Pain-Capable Unborn  Child Protection Act.   Our Nation has long recognized that we are all endowed by our creator  with certain inalienable rights, chief among them is the right to life.  I am unapologetically pro-life because all human life has dignity and  should be protected, especially the lives of defenseless unborn  children.   Today the House is taking a critical but seemingly uncontroversial  step forward in protecting life by prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks  of pregnancy, or put another way, when unborn children can feel pain.   Currently, the United States is one of only seven countries  worldwide, including North Korea, that still allow late-term abortions.  This bill would end these horrific procedures.   I pray that one day our Nation will protect all unborn children, but  this important bill is a big step forward towards that goal.
