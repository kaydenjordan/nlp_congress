 Mr. President, I would say amen to the comments of the  Senator from Illinois, our Democratic whip. He spoke on two subjects  very eloquently--the subject of opioids and the subject of ripping  apart families in immigration, both of which require immediate action.                                  Healthcare    Now, Mr. President, I want to speak on something that requires  immediate action. There are 130 million Americans in this country who  have a preexisting condition. The Affordable Care Act that we passed 7  or 8 years ago guarantees insurance coverage if you have a preexisting  condition. Lo and behold, the Trump administration is trying to rip  that out of the Affordable Care Act, the law--130 million Americans and  almost 8 million just in my State of Florida.   They want to repeal and kill the Affordable Care Act. This is one way  to do it because the Trump administration and congressional Republicans  and their allies have repeatedly tried and failed to kill the  Affordable Care Act but now are trying to dismantle it piece by piece  by pulling out economic undersupports of the law. As a result, they  successfully did that and attached it to the tax bill that went  through, and we are seeing the results of that. The premiums are going  up. Now they want to basically kill the bill by saying that it is not a  requirement of the law that insurance companies cover a preexisting  condition.   Let me give you some examples of preexisting conditions: Alzheimer's,  cancer, acne. How about simply being a woman? Let me repeat that. Being  a woman was a preexisting condition before these protections were put  into law--that an insurance company would have to cover you and that  your rate had to be fair.   Having faced multiple times the Republicans trying to dismantle this  law, the Trump administration is now trying administratively and  through the courts to take health coverage away. In my State of  Florida, it is almost 8 million people.   Here is what they did. In February, in 20 States, the attorneys  general, including in my State of Florida, filed a lawsuit to attack  our Nation's health law and all of the key protections that go with it,  and that is without any plan to replace it. Just last week, the U.S.  Department of Justice sided with these States and went into court and  told the court to do away with the law that bans insurers from charging  people more or denying them coverage based on a preexisting condition.   This seems absolutely inexcusable to me. If the attorneys general and  the administration now supporting them prevail, health insurers across  the country will once again be able to charge unlimited premiums for  older adults by discriminating against all people with preexisting  conditions--discrimination by the insurance companies refusing to offer  them coverage or charging them exorbitant premiums simply because of  what they call a preexisting condition in their medical history.   As people age, they have more maladies, and almost everybody then has  a preexisting condition. The law says that you are guaranteed you can  get insurance coverage, even in an individual, single policy if you  have a preexisting condition. I gave you some examples. Let me repeat  them: cancer, Alzheimer's, maybe just an operation, maybe something  like acne. This Senator has even seen, as the former insurance  commissioner of Florida elected years ago, an insurance company saying  that a rash is a preexisting condition, and therefore they would not  insure a person. Then there is the fact that just being a woman is a  preexisting condition for which they would not guarantee coverage--just  because of being a woman.   Our constituents deserve better. They deserve access to healthcare.  They deserve to know they can go to the doctor without being placed at  risk of medical debt or bankruptcy, without putting even more pressure  on our communities, hospitals, and those of us with insurance. If you  don't have that guarantee, what is going to happen? Rates are going to  go up. More people will go to the hospital, and it is going to be  uncompensated care, and that is going to cause our rates to go up.  [[Page S3875]]    This lawsuit by these attorneys general is nothing more than another  political attack on our Nation's healthcare law. In my State of  Florida, Florida's Governor and the other 19 States that joined the  lawsuit are the ones who are behind this, and they need to be held  accountable. They are trying get rid of the protections for health  insurance if you have a preexisting condition.   It is not enough to say that the Trump administration is taking  deliberate steps to make healthcare more expensive. Now they are trying  to take away one of the most important and popular provisions--the ban  that prevents insurance companies from discriminating against people  with preexisting conditions.   Why don't we stop these games? Instead, why don't we work together?  Let's get together a bipartisan agreement and help our constituents be  able to have the healthcare they need, the insurance protection they  need at an affordable price.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
