 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate some exceptional young  people from my district, the cheerleaders from West Orange High School,  known as the Mountaineers.   They have one dream this year. They wanted to compete in the National  Cheerleading Championships. They knew it wouldn't be easy. It would  require hours of practice. They would have to work and make every  routine perfect, and they would have to defy expectations.   They went to the regional qualifier in Pennsylvania with one goal,  and when the routines were done and the points were counted, they  earned a trip to the national championships.   In February they are off to Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando to  battle with the best high school cheerleading squads in the country.   Mr. Speaker, I hope they bring home that trophy to West Orange. But  whether they do or not, they will always be champions to me and all of  us in the 10th District of New Jersey.                            ____________________
