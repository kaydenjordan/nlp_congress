 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of  this resolution requiring all Members and staff to complete  antiharassment and antidiscrimination training during each session of  Congress.   I would like to thank Chairman Harper. I would like to thank Speaker  Ryan for announcing this policy change in the House. I would like to  thank my friend and colleague on the House Administration Committee,  Barbara Comstock, for introducing this important bill.   No one should have to worry about sexual harassment when they come to  work. As a former staffer and someone with a female-led office, I  believe this resolution is an important first step in addressing this  problem as we work to increase professionalism in the House and  establish a workplace that is grounded in respect.   In Congress, we have got to lead by example.   As a member of the House Administration Committee, we worked hard to  pass reforms last Congress to make House office spending more  transparent and accountable than any other area of the Federal  Government, and I am confident in this committee's ability to address,  in a bipartisan way, this important issue as well.   I look forward to the continued hearings the committee will have on  this issue as we work to institute policies that protect staffers  against sexual harassment and ensure female staffers are provided  leadership opportunities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to support this resolution.
