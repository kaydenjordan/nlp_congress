 Mr. Speaker, I have the great privilege and honor of  representing Silicon Valley in the United States Congress. We are  living through revolutionary times. If 100 years ago we had the  industrial revolution, today we have the software revolution, and the  forces of automation and globalization are fundamentally changing our  economy.   We first must thank the hardworking Americans who helped build this  economy--the steelworkers and the coal miners and those who were  machinists who built the economy that made us an exceptional Nation-- that were the foundation of everything that Silicon Valley does today.  We need to thank them for the extraordinary hard work and grit that  they showed.   We also need to recognize that our economy is changing, and not  everyone has participated in the technology revolution. Some folks have  benefited, and they are creating jobs and wealth, and others have been  left behind. We have an obligation to make sure that every American and  their daughters and their sons get to participate in this technology  revolution and have technology jobs.   Enrico Moretti, an economist at Berkeley, has shown for every one  technology job, it creates four to five other jobs in communities, from  the barista to a lawyer, to a construction worker. Tech jobs have a  larger multiplier today than manufacturing jobs had in previous eras.   My commitment, my vision is to see how Silicon Valley can help create  technology jobs not just in my district, but across America. There is  no reason that Des Moines, Iowa, and Wichita, Kansas, and Dayton, Ohio,  cannot become centers for technology innovation and have extraordinary  technology jobs.   I look forward to working across the aisle with my Republican  colleagues and Democratic colleagues to figure out how we create tech  jobs across this Nation.                            ____________________
