 Mr. President, first, there is a little housekeeping,  and then I will give my remarks.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar, under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.    Mr. President, House Republicans are struggling-- struggling--to grasp a harsh reality about being in the majority. There  is no good substitute for having a plan. You can't solve the Nation's  biggest problems without a plan--a plan we can debate in Congress and  which the American people can judge for themselves. This is especially  true--especially true--when it comes to the debt ceiling.   Later this afternoon, President Biden will meet with Speaker McCarthy  for their first one-on-one meeting of the year, and everyone is asking  the same question of Speaker McCarthy: What is your plan? Where is your  plan, Republicans? Where is your plan, Speaker McCarthy?   For days, Speaker McCarthy has heralded this sit-down as some kind of  major win in his debt ceiling talks, but Speaker McCarthy is forgetting  something obvious to everyone else: If you don't have a plan, you can't  seriously pretend you are having any real negotiation.   Let me say that again because it is so crystal clear.   Speaker McCarthy, if you don't have a plan, you can't seriously  pretend you are having any real negotiation.   Speaker McCarthy showing up at the White House without a plan is like  sitting down at the table without cards in your hand.   And look, we know why the Speaker has struggled and is unable to  produce a plan or why he is delaying it or avoiding it. He doesn't have  the votes for one, in all likelihood. Some Senate Republicans want  Social Security and Medicare cuts. Others want to cut the healthcare  that Americans depend on  [[Page S180]]  through Medicaid. And at least one Republican said on raising the debt  ceiling: I am a ``no'' no matter what.   Speaker McCarthy knows that it is next to impossible to pass a plan  through his own House--that he can't do that. So Speaker McCarthy may  claim he wants to negotiate, but that is, ultimately, empty talk if the  hard right has the power to reject whatever the Speaker proposes. It is  a toxic dynamic that, sadly, isn't going away any time soon.    When President Trump was in office, I sat down with him to talk about  the importance of raising the debt ceiling, and we didn't engage in  threats or brinksmanship or hostage-taking. Instead, we Democrats  presented a plan and moved forward from there. It was not easy. It took  a lot of preparation and tough decision making, but, each time, we got  the job done.   So one more time, House Republicans, show us your plan. You have an  obligation to be transparent with the American people. If you don't  have the votes to pass a plan, let's just get the debt ceiling done. If  the plan involves drastic cuts to millions of Americans, then  Republicans have an obligation to show the American people what those  cuts are because Americans could be faced with the very painful,  painful results of those proposed cuts.   Republicans owe it--owe it--to the American people. Speaker McCarthy  owes it to the American people to stop dodging, to put pen to paper,  and to explain clearly how Congress is going to ensure the United  States does not default for the first time in history. We Democrats  have a plan: Raise the debt ceiling without brinksmanship or hostage- taking, as it has been done before. Speaker McCarthy doesn't have a  plan, so he is not really negotiating, and the clock is ticking.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the ERA, which is a different and  extremely important matter, I want to praise and echo the words of my  colleagues yesterday who reintroduced a resolution to affirm the  ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.   The resolution is simple. It removes the arbitrary deadline for ERA  ratification that was placed by Congress in the 1970s and recognizes  the amendment as a valid part of the Constitution. There is no good  reason why a constitutional amendment needs a deadline, especially not  an amendment that affirms gender equality.   The Equal Rights Amendment has never been as necessary and urgent as  it is today. The Supreme Court's repeal of Roe v. Wade reminded all of  us that, even today--in 2023, the 21st century--women don't have the  same fundamental rights as men. So this resolution is a terrific and  necessary idea.   The ERA has been ratified by three-quarters of the States but not in  the requisite time, and that is what this proposal would fix. It is  very popular in the minds of the American people, and I strongly  support the resolution. I want my daughters and granddaughter to live  in a country where they never have to worry about being discriminated  against simply because of their gender. Sadly, today, that is not the  case. The ERA would fix that.   So I want to thank Senators Cardin and Durbin, Representatives  Pressley, Dean, and Bush, and everyone who is championing this  important resolution.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on election undermining by the  Republican National Committee, one of the biggest lessons of last  November was that, for all of the attempts by MAGA Republicans to  undermine our elections, the roots of our democracy remain strong and  run deep.   For 2 years, we heard the same thing over and over again from the  MAGA brigade: that the 2020 elections were stolen, that President Biden  was illegitimate, and that we couldn't trust that our votes were  properly counted.   Well, Americans simply didn't buy it. They saw that the elections  were fair. Some have said these were the fairest elections we have ever  had. Yet, in every virtual race last fall, MAGA candidates who  campaigned explicitly on denying the results of the 2020 election and  overturning it were rejected by the voters. It was a good result for  the country, for our democracy. Frankly, it was a necessary wake-up  call for the GOP, telling them: Get rid of the Big Lie once and for  all. The American people aren't buying it. Maybe a small band of  extreme rightwingers is--MAGA people--but not everybody else.   It was so disturbing to read in the Washington Post that the RNC is  not abandoning the conspiracy of the Big Lie so much as it is doubling  down. According to reports, they are working on creating a ``permanent  infrastructure in every state to ramp up `election integrity'  activities'' as a way to cater to that portion of their base that still  believes in wacky election fraud conspiracies.   As a sign of how unserious this report is, the RNC also makes  unfounded claims of a ``continuing onslaught of Democrat election  manipulation.'' I would call it ridiculous--it is ridiculous--but it is  a troubling attempt to undermine our democracy. When people don't  believe the elections are on the level, that is the beginning of the  end of this grand experiment in democracy that has lasted for  centuries. Fortunately, the American people are rejecting it, but the  Republicans that lead the MAGA wing are keeping at it.   I will make this easy for the folks over at the RNC: Undermining our  elections is a losing strategy. It is a loser politically. It didn't  work last year, and it is not going to work next year. For the sake of  our country and the sake of the GOP, the RNC and the MAGA wing of the  Republican Party need to break the election fraud echo chamber that has  paralyzed their party and has, frankly, caused them to lose election  after election.                            ____________________     Finally, yesterday, Mr. President, was a very special  day for the people of New York. After a lot of hard work, we finally  welcomed President Biden to celebrate progress on Gateway, the most  important infrastructure project in America.   Anyone who knows me knows Gateway has been one of my greatest  passions for more than a decade. Call it a labor of love--and it is-- because I love New York. Without our tunnels, the region's economy  would come to a screeching halt, and not just New York's, not just New  Jersey's but the whole Northeast and eventually the whole country's.   So after many false starts and a lot of opposition, Gateway is  finally full speed ahead, thanks to both the bipartisan infrastructure  law and the great help and enthusiasm from President Biden.   We had a good time yesterday--the President, I, and the other  Senators--because we knew we were getting something so important done.  And that is why we are here. The implementation of the bills we passed  last year is really vital to this country and to keeping our prosperity  going and increasing.   There were a lot of smiles at yesterday's celebration. Many of us  waited for years for this moment, and after a lot of persistence, we  can finally say Gateway is going to be built.   Gateway is just one of the major infrastructure initiatives supported  by the bipartisan infrastructure law. Just like the CHIPS and Science  Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, it is beginning to pay real  dividends in the form of new jobs, new investments, and prosperity. We  are going to see much more of it this year and the years to come.   That is precisely what Democrats promised to do, and that is what we  are delivering on.   I thank the President for helping us and celebrating with us  yesterday in New York.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
