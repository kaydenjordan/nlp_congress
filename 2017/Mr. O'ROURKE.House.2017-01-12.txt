 Mr. Speaker, this Sunday at 1:30 p.m. in El Paso,  Texas, hundreds of my fellow citizens will come out to San Jacinto  Plaza to join us in celebrating, supporting, and defending those  DREAMers who, across this country, are 700,000 strong, who were brought  here at a young age are now contributing in, living in our communities,  going to school, serving in the military, and helping to create jobs  and grow our economy.   I am also introducing tomorrow the DREAMer Information Protection Act  to protect those DREAMers who voluntarily came forward out of the  shadows to give their personal information, their names, telephone  numbers, and addresses to the Federal Government. I want to protect  them and make sure that same government doesn't turn around and use  that information to deport them, as the incoming administration has  promised to end the executive DACA action and potentially deport those  DREAMers on who this country is depending, not just for our economic  success but our growth and success as a country that has always gained  from immigrants who contribute to the American way of life.                            ____________________
