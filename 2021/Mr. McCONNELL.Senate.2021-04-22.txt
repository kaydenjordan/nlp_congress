 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, I mentioned that the DNA  of the far-left Green New Deal is all over President Biden's spending  bills. That wasn't just my opinion; it was the verdict of our colleague  the junior Senator from Massachusetts.   Today, the President is scheduled to meet virtually with a group of  the world's leaders on climate policy. His agenda, reportedly, is to  encourage them to expand their countries' Paris climate agreement  commitments to meet even more ambitious emissions goals. The problem,  of course, as our colleagues, no doubt, remember, is that the hollow  commitments these countries made back in 2015 carry no serious means  for enforcement.   Under the last administration, even from outside this agreement, the  U.S. economy proved more than capable of meaningfully reducing  CO2 emissions. But many of the signatories within the  supposed deal have largely ignored their stated commitments and  continue to emit with reckless abandon.   As the Biden administration climate envoy, John Kerry, once lamented,  ``[M]ost countries are . . . not getting the job done in living up to  Paris.'' China, for example, has just kept emitting more and done it  shamelessly. Their share of greenhouse gas emissions is now nearly  double--double--that of the United States.   On a recent trip to Shanghai, Kerry tried to echo President Biden's  encouragement on emissions reduction, but the kid-gloves approach  didn't seem too successful. China's Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs  said: ``I'm afraid this is not very realistic.'' A direct quote from  the Chinese Government.   Democrats' zeal for imposing costly environmental agendas on our own  country is not something our biggest foreign competitors seem to share.  If that is true, our colleagues could inflict as many painful policies  on American workers and American industries as they want and still not  achieve a significant change in worldwide emissions or global  temperatures.   The cost of these misplaced priorities is already hitting Americans  hard. Remember, revoking permitting for the Keystone XL Pipeline and  killing thousands of jobs was a day-one priority for this new  administration. Now their so-called infrastructure plan would aim at  completely decarbonizing our electric grid, which means hurting our  coal and natural gas industries and putting good-paying American jobs  into the shredder.   Borrowing money in order to kill jobs, now, there is a concept.  Meanwhile, a mountain of redtape would keep public works projects  smothered, literally smothered in endless environmental reviews, and  their plan would thrust the west coast obsession with electric vehicles  onto the entire Nation, onto rural school districts, onto industries,  whether they like it or not.   Next week, President Biden is set to address a joint session of  Congress for the first time. I expect we will hear more claims like the  ones that have been debunked by fact checkers that all this Green New  Deal DNA would actually create a lot of American jobs. Fact checkers  are debunking that claim.   But even the most favorable analyses, even the administration's  favorite projections, suggest that the President's plan would be  terrible, just terrible at creating jobs. The rosiest numbers you could  come up with suggest it might cost American taxpayers more than  $800,000 for every job it might create--more than $800,000 per job.   And Ivy League economists have calculated that the plan's long-term  effects on GDP, capital stocks, and hourly wages would all be negative.  Let me say that again. These multiple trillions of dollars would buy us  less GDP, less investment, and lower wages. It almost takes talent to  craft something that completely disastrous.   So this is quite a one-two punch: toothless requests of our foreign  adversaries and maximum pain for American citizens.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on another matter, earlier this  week, the Democratic leadership of the Judiciary Committee convened a  hearing with the embarrassing title of ``Jim Crow 2021.'' It was the  latest effort to use shocking rhetoric to distract from the specific  details of actual voting laws in States like Georgia.   Amazingly, one of our Democratic colleagues testified before the  committee that people actually shouldn't bother combing through the  specifics of the law--don't bother reading the actual law. He suggested  that ``narrow analysis only obscures the larger, unmistakable  picture.'' Put another way, the facts deflate the narrative.   Misrepresentations of Georgia's election law have been debunked by  fact checkers. The real, unmistakable picture is that the bill would  expand early voting and make no changes to current election day hours-- none. Ironically, Democrats' own star witness at this week's hearing  once sponsored and supported an earlier effort that would have cut  early voting days in Georgia in half.   The facts puncture the left's big lie. Much of this overheated  rhetoric seems like simple projection because there is, indeed, a piece  of legislation that would create a stunning one-party takeover of  voting laws and elections in our country, and that would be Washington  Democrats' darling, H.R. 1. This is the bill that was first introduced  back in 2019, with many Democrats still in denial that a Republican had  won the White House in 2016.   It was marketed at that time as a wholesale transformation designed  to salvage a broken democracy. But now that Democrats got an election  outcome they liked better in 2020, what is essentially a xerox copy of  the same overhaul is now being marketed, oh, as a modest step, just a  modest step to maintain the status quo.   The first sales pitch was actually more honest. This 800-plus-page  takeover would give Washington Democrats unprecedented control over 50  States' election laws, over a newly--listen to this--a newly partisan  Federal Election Commission, over policing America's political speech.  That is what it would do.   Now, Democrats know that the same Senate rules they happily used for  the last 6 years will not make it easy to launch this awful proposal,  so there is another important piece in their plan. They are aiming the  same wild rhetoric at the Senate's own rules--at our rules here in the  Senate.   The legislative filibuster which senior Democrats have loudly and  proudly defended in the past, which Democrats used repeatedly in recent  years, all of a sudden has become an offensive and outdated relic  overnight. Isn't it amazing how this new awakening only happened when  Democrats felt they had a chance to retake the majority.   Now, the American people can see right through this. Nobody is  fooled. Nobody is fooled by their desperation to rewrite 50 States'  election laws or the campaign to pack the Supreme Court or the attempt  to pack the Senate with new blue States, rewriting the rules of  American politics to exclusively benefit one side: their side. That was  the Democrats' false charge in Georgia, but it is exactly what they are  trying to do in this Capitol on a national scale.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order be executed with respect to the reporting of the three amendments  under the consent agreement.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
