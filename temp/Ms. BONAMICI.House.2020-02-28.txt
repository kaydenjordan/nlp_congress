 Madam Speaker, Benjamin Franklin said: ``An investment  in knowledge pays the best interest.'' I agree.   I am proud to lead the Public Schools Week resolution with my  colleagues, Representatives Pocan, Graves, and Thompson. This  resolution recognizes the importance of and contributions of our public  schools to the country and to our Nation's young people.   I came to Congress to strengthen public education and to make sure  that all students, regardless of their race, color, national origin,  ZIP Code, or family wealth, have an equal opportunity to obtain a high- quality, well-rounded public education.   At the State of the Union, I was disappointed to hear the President  dismiss public schools as failing government schools. Public schools  are not disconnected from the communities around them. They are our  schools, our children, our students in our communities; and it is our  collective responsibility to do all we can to strengthen, not weaken,  our system of public education.   I will continue to fight for public schools every day, and I am proud  to honor them this week.                            ____________________
