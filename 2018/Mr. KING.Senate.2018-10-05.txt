 Mr. President, first I want to congratulate and thank the  Senator from Rhode Island for his moving and eloquent remarks--so  moving and eloquent, in fact, that I contemplated foregoing my own.   The Senator expressed the feelings of many of us, particularly in his  closing, which was very powerful, and, I think, very well encapsulated  the one possible positive result from this sorry process.   I stated my opposition to Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the U.S.  Supreme Court before Dr. Ford's allegations became public--before I had  ever heard about them, before anyone had ever heard about them, as far  as I know, except some members of the Judiciary Committee.   Therefore, I don't believe you have to believe Dr. Ford to conclude  that Judge Kavanaugh should not be elevated to the Supreme Court-- first, because of his judicial philosophy.   If you will pardon me, I want to digress for a moment into  constitutional history--preconstitutional history, if you will. There  is a basic paradox of government. We give power to something called the  government in order to protect our security, to protect us as  individuals, to protect our liberty. The paradox is that we then have  to worry about the government to which we have given the power abusing  us.   James Madison captured this in the 51st Federalist:         If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If       angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal       controls on government would be necessary. In framing a       government which is to be administered by men over men--    And, of course, today Madison would say men and women over men and  women--         the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable       the government to control the governed, and in the next place       oblige it to control itself.    The Romans put it this way: ``Quis custodiet ipsos custodes.'' Who  will guard the guardians?   The other philosopher who talked about this was the English  philosopher Lord Acton: ``All power corrupts and absolute power  corrupts absolutely.''   The American Constitution, in my view, is the most sublime answer to  this ancient question of any instrument of government ever formed by  people on this Earth. It is based upon a profound understanding of  human nature: If you give people power, there is the potential for it  to be abused--not the potential, the likelihood that it will be abused.   So the Constitution is an elaborate scheme for preventing that abuse.  The first line of defense is the structure of the government itself.  What Madison was talking about was obliging the government to control  itself--this herky-jerky, complicated, Rube Goldberg device involving  two Houses, checks and balances, the President, the veto, submitting  treaties, two-thirds votes, advise and consent, and then the whole  level of the State government and local government, the division of  responsibilities between the governments, and enumerated powers. The  Framers wanted it to be difficult for majorities to ride roughshod over  minorities. They wanted it to be difficult to legislate, and they  succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.   It is a very difficult piece of machinery to bring into action, but  even after the Framers had designed this elaborate structure  specifically in the name of protecting the rights of the people, they  weren't satisfied. They wanted to take another step, because going back  to our other fundamental document, the Declaration of Independence  talks about certain inalienable rights--life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness--and that word ``inalienable'' isn't defined much. Not  much attention is paid  [[Page S6615]]  to it. ``Inalienable'' means neither can you give it away nor can it be  taken from you. To alienate is to give away or have it taken from you.  That is what ``inalienable rights'' mean.   Going back to when they said we have this elaborate structure that  will be very complicated to operate, what if the majority makes this  structure work in such a way that is amicable to the fundamental rights  of people? The first thing Congress did was to adopt the Bill of  Rights. The Bill of Rights is the second shield for us as individuals.  I always thought of it as a force field around individuals that  protects the basic rights, even if the government follows all of the  procedures.   Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,  establishing religion, or controlling the free exercise thereof. Search  and seizure must be reasonable. You don't have to give testimony  against yourself. All of these rights in the Bill of Rights are  designed to protect us as individuals from the government.   The framers then had an interesting problem when they got to the Bill  of Rights, and they listed the rights. Somebody--and I can't remember  who it was right now--came up with the problem that if you list the  rights, then people will later say: Well those rights are listed.  Therefore, there aren't any other rights that can be protected. So they  added the Ninth Amendment, which is one of the most unappreciated and  undiscussed amendments to the Constitution. The Ninth Amendment says:  ``The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be  construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.'' In  other words, there are rights that exist--they recognize that--that  aren't the ones listed that we all think of in the First through the  Fifth Amendment--rights such as freedom of speech, the press, freedom  from unreasonable searches, the right to bear arms. They were afraid  they would appear too exclusive. So they passed as part of the Bill the  Rights the Ninth Amendment.    What does this have to do with Judge Kavanaugh? To understand Judge  Kavanaugh's jurisprudence, what kind of judge he will be--by the way,  that is what we are all doing here. This is an exercise in forecasting  the future. What will this person decide? What kind of judge will they  be? That involves things like demeanor and temperament, but it also  involves judicial philosophy.   To understand the judicial philosophy of Judge Kavanaugh, you have to  understand the judicial philosophy of Justice William Rehnquist. Judge  Kavanaugh has characterized Justice Rehnquist as his judicial hero. He  gave a speech about him in 2017. He says that the article in the Texas  Law Review in 1976 written by Justice Rehnquist is one of the most  important legal documents ever written.   What do Justice Rehnquist and Justice Kavanaugh have in common? They  have a very expansive view of what States can do to limit your rights  and a narrow view of what the Federal Government can do to protect your  health, welfare, the environment--you name it.   Justice Rehnquist voted against Roe v. Wade. Justice Rehnquist  criticized Griswold v. Connecticut. He voted against Roe v. Wade  because he said the right of a woman to control her own reproductive  health is not enumerated in the Constitution. Obviously, it is not  listed in the first two or three Amendments, but the Court found that  it was a basic human right of women, and that is the basis of Roe v.  Wade.   The problem with Justice Rehnquist's approach and Judge Kavanaugh's  approach to unenumerated rights is that they say unenumerated rights  could be recognized by the courts only if the asserted right was rooted  in the Nation's history and tradition. That is called originalism, or  it is a piece of originalism. In other words, you can't assert a right  unless you can show that the Framers thought about it when they passed  the amendments, or that it was somehow rooted in the tradition. If  abortion was legal across the country in 1897 or 1867 or 1787, then you  couldn't do it. The Court would be making law.   The problem is that this approach freezes rights in history, and it  allows no room for the evolution of ethics and morality. A good example  is Loving v. Virginia, which is the case that overturned misogynation  laws that made it illegal in many States in the country, including  Virginia, at the time--and this was in the 1960s--for people of  different races to marry one another.   It is hard to argue using the Kavanaugh philosophy that that is a  legitimate exercise of judicial authority because certainly, at the  time of the passage of the Bill of Rights and the passage of the 14th  Amendment, anti-misogynation laws were all over the place. So Rehnquist  and Kavanaugh would say you can't do that. This isn't judicial  lawmaking. This is judicial protection of individuals' rights from  State incursion.   In Griswold v. Connecticut, in many ways, Griswold was the case that  said the State of Connecticut could not constitutionally prohibit the  sale of contraception to married couples. It has been widely criticized  in many ways. The Griswold case, I believe, was the founding document  of the Federalist Society. It was in reaction to Griswold and the  following cases that the Federalist Society arose in the 1980s.   So this philosophy is that the States have wide latitude to restrict  these rights--enumerated or not. That is why I believe there is--I  don't know--a 50-50 chance, 60-40, or 70-30 that a Justice Kavanaugh  would repeal Roe v. Wade. I give it 99 percent that he will gut Roe v.  Wade. There are something like 15 cases headed for the Supreme Court  right now from various States around the country where the right of a  woman to control her reproductive future is under assault. The  decisions may not be an outright repeal, but by piecemeal, chipping  away at that right, making it harder and harder to exercise Roe v.  Wade, it will be a hollow shell.   Judge Kavanaugh said in his hearing: I am not going to make these  value judgments, ideological judgments. I am going to call balls and  strikes like an umpire.   I have a new principle for judging Supreme Court nominees: Anybody  who says all they are going to do is call balls and strikes is an  automatic no because they are conning us. Deciding whether a particular  rule in a State that restricts the ability of a woman to control her  reproductive future is unduly burdensome is not a mechanical ball and  strike. It is a value-laden judgment call. Don't tell me there is some  easy ball-and-strike thing here. You are making judgment calls based  upon values.   I don't have any doubt that a Justice Kavanaugh is going to vote to  restrict, to control, to limit, and ultimately, to gut Roe v. Wade.  Indeed, that is what the President said he was going to do--to appoint  a judge who was going to take that step. That is why he is so widely  supported in some parts of the country.   By the way, he said Roe v. Wade is a precedent. That is like saying  this is a chair. That is a statement of fact. That is not a value. That  is not a philosophy. That is just a statement of fact. Then he says:  Well, we have Planned Parenthood v. Casey. So we have a precedent on a  precedent. That is like saying this is a chair and this is a desk. That  is a statement of fact. That is not anything that gives you any  indication of what he says he is going to do.   By the way, Justice Gorsuch sat in my office and talked to me about  precedent and how committed he was to precedent. He had written a whole  book about precedent. I don't think he was on the Court even a year,  and he voted in the Janus case to absolutely trample 40 years of  precedent in a very important area of American law. So when somebody  tells me it is a precedent or it is settled law, that doesn't convince  me of very much. That is not a predictor of what they will do.   He has an expansive view of the State power to restrict individual  rights. He has a narrow view of the national legislature's ability to  protect individuals, whether it is healthcare, and I will give you 75  percent that he is going to start voting to undercut and destroy the  Affordable Care Act.   In 16 out of 18 cases on the environment that came before his court,  the DC Court of Appeals, he voted with the polluters. He narrowed the  authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. In one case  particularly relevant to my State, he decided against the right of the  EPA to tell upwind States they had to control their pollution in order  to benefit downwind States. Maine is in  [[Page S6616]]  the tailpipe of the Northeast. All the air moves from west to east and  ends up in Maine. We could shut off every automobile and every factory  in Maine and still have air pollution problems. Telling the EPA they  can't regulate air that moves across State lines is a direct shot at  the State of Maine.   As for campaign finance reform, I predict he will join with the 5-to- 4 majority to continue the deregulation of campaign finance, one of the  most serious issues facing this country.   He even said that net neutrality was unconstitutional because of the  right of large internet service providers to have free speech. That is  a case that would deny free speech and freedom of activity to millions  of internet users across the country. You don't have to believe Dr.  Ford to oppose and believe that Brett Kavanaugh should not be elevated  to the Supreme Court.   You also don't have to believe Dr. Ford to believe that Brett  Kavanaugh should not be elevated to the Supreme Court because of his  views on Presidential power, but first let's establish what he said. In  the Minnesota Law Review, he said we should not burden a sitting  President with civil suits, criminal investigations, or criminal  prosecutions. He has an elaborate argument about that involving  impeachment and that the Congress should pass a statute and a whole lot  of other things. We can argue about that. They are legitimate disputes  about the meaning of article III and how it relates to impeachment and  how it relates to the subject of the President being subject to  criminal prosecutions. I understand that. I understand we can have  those arguments, but once he stated that position, he should have  announced that he would recuse himself from any case involving the  President who appointed him--the first rule of the judicial canons.   Canon No. 2 is that a judge shall avoid not only impropriety but the  appearance of impropriety, and 2a, from the Code of Judicial  Responsibility says that a ``judge should act at all times in a manner  that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of  the Judiciary. Let me read that again: ``A judge should act at all  times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and  impartiality of the Judiciary.'' The reason for that is obvious. The  Judiciary doesn't have the power of the purse. It doesn't have an army.  It has to rest on public confidence.   He already violated that principle in his testimony to the Judiciary  Committee last week. He violated that principle. Imagine the reaction  of the public if a newly minted Justice Kavanaugh, within the next  couple of years, votes in favor and, indeed, can provide the deciding  vote, the swing vote, on a case involving the President who appointed  him. I am not saying he can't take this position ever in his judicial  career, but to have not recused himself when he had an opportunity to  do so, to announce he would do so, to me, is disqualifying. It is  obvious and mandatory that he should not take a position on a case  coming before the Court involving the President who appointed him.   No. 3, we don't have to believe Dr. Ford to conclude that Judge  Kavanaugh should not be confirmed to a lifetime job because we have  been denied the ability to learn about his record.   Imagine, Mr. President, you are doing a job interview for a very  important job in your company, and a guy comes in and says: I would  like this job, and I am going to show you 10 percent of my work  product. The 10 percent that I am going to give you is going to be  picked out by an old buddy of mine whom I used to work for. In fact, he  used to work for me. Oh, and by the way, once you hire me, you can  never fire me; I am there for life.   Nobody would take that deal. Any employer in America would laugh at  that job applicant. Yet that is exactly what we are doing here this  week. We have seen 10 percent of his record in the White House and have  been given no reason whatsoever why we can't see it all. People talk  about, oh, we have seen 100,000 pages or 200,000 pages. That is not the  point. He has a huge record, so the number of pages isn't the issue; it  is how much of it we have seen as a percentage, and we have seen 10  percent of it.   If I were on the side of this case preparing to vote for this  gentleman, I would be terrified about what is going to come out because  it is all going to come out. The records of the Bush administration are  going to be available in 2020 under the Presidential Records Act--12  years from the end of the administration. In 2020, all of these records  will come out. In fact, I think they are going to start coming out in  the next couple of weeks from the National Archives. I don't know what  is in those records. There may be nothing. The fact that they are being  withheld raises my main suspicions. Are they worried that something is  in there that will derail this nomination, or do they know it?   Asking us to vote on this lifetime appointment, with no do-overs, no  amendments, no chances, no repeals, when we haven't seen the entire  record, is beyond me. There is no justification for it.   Even if I were inclined to vote yes, I would say: Wait a minute. You  can't ask me to vote for this until I see all his records.   We haven't done it. It is ridiculous. There is no other word for it.   No. 4, we don't have to believe Dr. Ford to conclude Judge Kavanaugh  should not be elevated to the Supreme Court because he has demonstrated  he lacks the temperament and demeanor to be a Justice of the Supreme  Court.   First, I think it is only fair to state the standard. What should be  the standard for temperament and demeanor for a judge? Here is the  standard, as I have seen it:         To be a good judge and a good umpire, it's important to       have the proper demeanor. Really important, I think. To walk       in the others' shoes, whether it be the other litigants, the       litigants in the case, the other judges. To understand them.       To keep our emotions in check. To be calm amidst the storm.       On the bench, to put it in the vernacular, don't be a jerk.    This isn't me; this is the standard published to show and help  display that you are trying to make the decision impartially and  dispassionately, based on the law and not based on your emotions. Who  established that standard? Who wrote it? Brett Kavanaugh. Those are his  words from a speech several years ago at Catholic University. Proper  demeanor. Calm amidst the storm. On the bench, don't be a jerk. Help  display that you are trying to make the decision impartially and  dispassionately based on the law and not based on your emotions. I  don't see how anybody, with a straight face, can argue that Brett  Kavanaugh met that standard last Thursday afternoon.   I had an interesting experience that day. I was in a hearing in the  afternoon while he was speaking, and there was a television screen in  the hearing room, but the sound was off because we were doing other  committee work. Every now and then, I could look at the screen, and I  could see him. I turned to the person sitting behind me and said: He is  coming unhinged. What is going on? What is he saying? He is shouting.   You could see it. You could see his face contorted. Then, of course,  I saw what he was saying. No one could argue that he demonstrated  judicial demeanor in that hearing. In fact, something like 3,000 law  professors, including 40 from Yale, have come out and said that based  on that performance, he should not be confirmed to the Supreme Court.  Justice John Paul Stevens, a retired Justice, in an extraordinary  moment, said: This man should not be confirmed for the Supreme Court.   If you were from Mars, Mr. President, or from South Dakota and you  knew nothing about the history of this matter, you knew nothing about  the documents, the opinions, the philosophy, none of those things, and  all you saw was that hearing that afternoon, you would say: This guy  has no business anywhere near a courtroom.   His defense is, I was angry. I was being charged with something. My  family is being threatened, and I am being threatened.   I understand that. All of us have thought about how we would feel if  some unjust or untrue charge were made against us, whatever the nature,  and a particularly heinous charge was made against him. I understand  that he was passionate. But here is what really bothers me: What he  said--the conspiracy, the direct insults to the Democratic Senators,  the idea that he was a victim of a smear campaign--he had written down.  That wasn't a spontaneous outburst--that he was so mad  [[Page S6617]]  and caught up in the moment and said something he regretted--it was in  written testimony. He had written it down, his answers to the  questions.   Back to canon No. 2, avoid anything that would undermine confidence  in the judiciary. He actually said, looking at the Democrats, ``What  goes around comes around.'' Everybody knows that is a threat. He was  looking at Richard Blumenthal, who is the plaintiff in a case called  Blumenthal v. Trump, which is in the Federal district court in  Washington and will eventually make its way to the Supreme Court based  on the emoluments clause. How can Richard Blumenthal possibly believe  he would get a fair and impartial hearing from somebody who said:  ``What goes around comes around''? That phrase itself should be  disqualifying. Anybody who talks about a political party or a group of  people or millions of people or anybody else and says ``What goes  around comes around''--that is disqualifying.   I think that based upon judicial philosophy, his failure to recuse  himself from issues involving the President who appointed him--his  refusal to say he will recuse himself in issues involving the President  who appointed him, the incredible lack of documentation based upon his  record, and his demeanor last week disqualify him.   No, you don't have to believe Dr. Ford to conclude, as I have, that  Judge Kavanaugh should not be elevated to the Supreme Court.   Before I close, I should add one note: I do believe Dr. Ford.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
