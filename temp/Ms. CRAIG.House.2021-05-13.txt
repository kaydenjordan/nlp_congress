 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters for yielding and  for including my amendment in this en bloc.   Mr. Speaker, years ago, a bright and talented young man from Eagan  named Ryan Frascone took out student loans to enroll in classes at  Metro State University. Ryan studied engineering. He was a kind,  engaging, and hardworking young man. But, in 2013, Ryan passed away-- one of thousands who have tragically fallen victim to the opioid  epidemic plaguing this Nation.                                time  1330    In the midst of that tragedy, I am sure student loans were the last  thing on his parents, Julie and Mark's minds. But to this day, 8 years  after losing their son Ryan, his parents must still write a check every  month to pay for his student loans.   I think we can all agree that the last thing that any American parent  should have to undergo is a monthly reminder of such tragedy and loss  in the form of a student loan payment. Today, we have an opportunity to  right that wrong with this amendment.   Please join me in supporting the Ryan Frascone Memorial Student Loan  Relief Act. And to Mark and Julie, I want to say to you, on the  anniversary of his death this week, we are going to make this right in  this country.
