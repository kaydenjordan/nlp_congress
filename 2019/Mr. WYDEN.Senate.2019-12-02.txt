 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, here is what the Senate and the American  people need to know before the next vote coming up on the nominee to be  the Secretary of Energy.   First, Mr. Rick Perry--who until yesterday was the Energy Secretary-- has refused to comply with the subpoena to testify about his  involvement in the Trump-Ukraine scheme.   Second, Acting Secretary Dan Brouillette--nominated to replace Mr.  Perry--has failed to provide substantive answers to key questions about  Mr. Perry's dealings with the Ukrainian state-owned energy company  Naftogaz.   Third, since I have been raising questions on this matter, Naftogaz  executives have reportedly been coming forward to cooperate in a  Federal investigation into the Ukraine scheme.   Mr. Perry has virtually skipped town, leaving his job after insisting  for months that he was determined to stay while the Ukraine scheme is  front and center in the House impeachment inquiry.   Now, with the vote on Mr. Perry's replacement just minutes away, the  Senate is truly in the dark, lacking answers to important questions.  Those questions include issues pertaining to Mr. Perry's role in a  campaign to change the leadership of Naftogaz; questions about what Mr.  Perry, his donors, and certain crooked associates of Rudy Giuliani's  stood to gain from those changes; questions about Mr. Perry's role in  the Ukraine scheme, which Trump administration officials have admitted  was about withholding critical military aid in a face-to-face meeting  until the Ukrainian President agreed to do for Donald Trump what he  described as a political favor.   These are serious issues closely tied to ongoing investigations. This  goes way, way beyond the well-documented waste we often see in the  Trump Cabinet--private jets, soundproof booths, $30,000 desks; this is  about the administration using its full might to push a foreign leader  into helping Donald Trump's reelection campaign. The Senate ought to  know about Rick Perry's involvement, especially since he was described  by Mr. Holmes and others as one of the ``three amigos'' who were right  in the center of all this.   What exactly is the rush on confirming his replacement? This isn't  the first week of a new administration. Nothing is going to happen to  the powerplants or nuclear facilities if the Senate takes the time to  get answers to these central questions. Dan Brouillette is already the  Acting Secretary. No American interest suffers if the Senate insists on  getting answers that go right to the heart of the Senate's oversight  responsibilities.   I briefly want to recall what this is all about.   The ``three amigos'' basically seized control of our country's ties  with Ukraine under the direction of the President and his personal  lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Secretary Perry led the American delegation that  attended President Zelensky's inauguration in May after the Vice  President was told to stay home. The Vice President and President  Zelensky held private meetings.   It has been reported that Perry pushed President Zelensky to fire  members of the board of Naftogaz and replace them with Mr. Perry's own  political donors. At a subsequent meeting with the Ukraine Government  and energy sector officials, Perry reportedly said that the entire  board ought to be replaced.   The Associated Press reported that at that meeting--and I am going to  quote here--the Associated Press said that one of those people who  attended that meeting where Perry was in attendance ``said he was  floored by the American requests because the person had always viewed  the U.S. government `as having a higher ethical standard.'''   The changes Mr. Perry was seeking lined up with changes sought by a  pair of now-indicted men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were  apparently friends of Mr. Giuliani's. They, too, wanted different  leadership at Naftogaz. Here is what the Associated Press had to say  about that:         As Rudy Giuliani was pushing Ukraine officials last spring       to investigate Donald Trump's main political rivals, a group       of individuals with ties to the president and his personal       lawyer were also active in the former Soviet republic. Their       aims were profit, not politics. This circle of businessmen       and Republican donors touted connections to Mr. Giuliani and       Trump while trying to install new management at the top of       Ukraine's massive state-owned gas company. Their plan was to       then steer lucrative contracts to companies controlled by       Trump allies, according to two people with knowledge of their       plans.    Federal prosecutors are investigating the role of Mr. Giuliani. At  least one Naftogaz official is reportedly cooperating in the  investigation.   Some of Mr. Perry's political donors did score a lucrative energy  deal in Ukraine after Perry got involved there. Perry admits he was in  contact with Giuliani about Ukraine.   It was also revealed in impeachment testimony that Perry was  seemingly made aware in July of the Trump scheme and Ukraine.   Unlike Fiona Hill, unlike David Holmes, unlike Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman, Rick Perry has refused to testify and share what he knows with  the public.   For nearly 3 weeks, I have been trying to get answers. At Mr.  Brouillette's nomination hearing on November 14, I asked him really  basic questions. I had plenty of time--to a great extent, courtesy of  my good friend the ranking minority member, who is always fair. I had  plenty of time. I asked basic questions. It came down to this:   Who did Secretary Perry meet with regarding Ukraine and Naftogaz? He  was the head of a powerful department. He was one of the self-styled  ``three amigos.'' Who else was in the loop? What did they talk about?   Acting Secretary Brouillette only acknowledged--he wasn't willing to  say  [[Page S6785]]  anything. This was a full court stonewall. He wasn't willing to say  anything other than that there were meetings--no other information and  nothing substantive on the questions I asked. So I just kept asking  him.   Who took part in the meetings with Secretary Perry on Naftogaz? When  and where did they take place? What materials were produced? I don't  think Secretary Perry just went to those meetings all by his lonesome  with maybe a bag lunch or something like that. My guess is that he had  staff from the Department of Energy with materials produced by the  Department of Energy.   Who outside of the Department did Secretary Perry speak with  regarding changes in Naftogaz, and what was the substance of those  communications? It is not like Secretary Perry would have paid his own  way and freelanced a ``three amigos''-Ukraine policy in secret. This is  the head of the Energy Department. It looks like he was right in the  center of the Trump corruption scheme in Ukraine.    I am just going to close in this way. I don't understand the rush.  Mr. Brouillette is at the Department of Energy now. He is the acting  chief. Western civilization is not going to end if the Senate insists  on getting some answers to the questions that I have presented this  afternoon. We are still going to have our powerplants and nuclear  facilities running, and all of the national security activities that go  on at the Department of Energy will still go forward if the Senate  takes the time to require that there be substantive answers to the  questions that I have asked of this nominee.   I believe it is malpractice for the U.S. Senate to rush this debate  before getting answers from this administration, Mr. Brouillette,  Secretary Perry, and those who, I believe, could answer these questions  if they didn't want to, in effect, say to the U.S. Senate: We are just  going to pass here. You might want to hold us accountable, but we have  a chance to just skip out, and we are going to take it.   This is not the way the Senate is supposed to work. That is why I  cannot support moving forward with this nominee, and I will be voting  no this afternoon.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
