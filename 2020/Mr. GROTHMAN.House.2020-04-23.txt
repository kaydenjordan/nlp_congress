 Madam Speaker, like all bills, this bill comes down to  how it is implemented.   Right now we have a problem, and I hope that bureaucracy does a  better job of implementing it.   The PPP in this program is going to, I believe, a lot of businesses  that are actually even better off because of the virus, because it is  being so sloppily administered. I hope in the future, if we pass this  bill, that people pay attention to that.   I also realize a lot of money is going to hospitals who have relied  on predictions coming out of Washington that they were going to get a  lot of patients that they may not be getting.   Right now in my district and many other districts, nurses and other  hospital personnel are being laid off and hospitals are losing money  because they were expecting a deluge of patients that never came,  gratefully.   I hope in the future that the recommendations out of Washington are  more on target and the employees of my hospitals can get back to work  as we begin to do colonoscopies, mammograms, hips, knees, and  diagnostic tests one more time.
