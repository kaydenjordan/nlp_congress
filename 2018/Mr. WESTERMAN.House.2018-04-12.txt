 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Sergeant Jack Coleman Cook of Hot Springs, Arkansas, for his heroic  actions in World War II. Sergeant Cook was a ball turret gunner on a B- 17 Flying Fortress named the Challenger.   On February 3, 1945, the 384th Bomb Group participated in a mission  over Berlin. During the mission, the Challenger was hit by flak,  damaging multiple engines, gas tanks, and the fuselage, but left the  crew unharmed.   On the return journey home, the plane began losing altitude and  crash-landed in the frigid North Sea. The crewmembers abandoned the  aircraft and boarded two life rafts but became separated.   Navigator Edward Field, a crewmember who stayed in the water, began  to push his raft towards the other raft but became numb and said that  he could no longer hold on. Sergeant Cook got into the water so the  crew's navigator could get out of the cold sea and take his spot in the  raft. The sergeant then swam for 45 minutes until they reached the  second raft. Shortly afterward, air-sea rescue located the crew, but  Sergeant Cook had little life left in him, and he passed away on the  boat.   It is with great gratitude and respect that I honor Jack Coleman  Cook. Sergeant Cook is a true American hero. He selflessly gave his  life for his fellow man, and for this, we remember him more than 70  years later.                            ____________________
