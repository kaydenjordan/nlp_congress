 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, ``No end in sight''--that is how one Border  Patrol chief described the influx of migrants in the Rio Grande Valley  sector of the southern border in March 2021. ``No end in sight.'' That  was 2\1/2\ years ago, and there is still no end in sight to this  crisis.   On Friday, we learned that 232,972 individuals were caught trying to  illegally cross our southern border in the month of August--232,972.  That is the highest August number yet for the Biden administration. All  signs suggest that we are on track for a third recordbreaking year of  apprehensions at the southern border. In fact, roughly 11,000  individuals were apprehended attempting to cross our southern border in  just 24 hours this past weekend--11,000 in 24 hours.   If the White House really thinks it is ``stopping the flow at the  border,'' as the White House Press Secretary said last month, it should  think again.   It is important to note that the numbers I have mentioned only  reflect individuals who were actually apprehended. They don't include  individuals who have made their way into the country illegally  without--without--being caught. Since the beginning of the Biden  administration, there have been at least 1.5 million known ``got- aways,'' individuals the Border Patrol detected but was unable to  apprehend.   The Biden administration's so-called border plan is clearly not  working, and State and local governments are stretched thin. And I am  not just talking about border towns and border States; I am talking  about places like New York City, Chicago, Massachusetts. As migrants  flood into these locations, blue States and blue cities are learning  what border States have been experiencing for years, and they are  struggling with the costs this crisis is imposing.   Denver, CO, has spent almost $25 million sheltering migrants.   Chicago is projected to spend more than $250 million this year on  migrant care.   New York City could spend $12 billion--billion with a ``b''--by 2025  on the migrant crisis, possibly precipitating cuts to city services.  Just to give you one example of the current crisis, the city has begun  housing 3,000 illegal immigrants at a makeshift shelter on local soccer  fields, eliminating a popular source of activity and recreation for  local children.   Here is what New York City Mayor Eric Adams had to say about this  crisis the other day, and I quote:         Let me tell you something, New Yorkers, never in my life       have I had a problem that I did not see an ending to--I don't       see an ending to this. This issue will destroy New York City.    That from the mayor of New York.   The border crisis we are experiencing is a predictable outcome of the  decisions made early in the Biden administration. The President's team  was warned of the possibility of a migrant surge. Yet the moment the  President took office, he set about dismantling the immigration  policies of his predecessor and weakening our Nation's border security.  And it wasn't long before the border was overwhelmed.   And while after 2 years the Biden administration finally started to,  at least halfheartedly, acknowledge the border crisis, what few  proactive measures the  [[Page S4693]]  administration has taken have been ineffective, to say the least. As  one columnist put it recently in the Washington Post:         The Biden administration's various efforts have amounted to       Band-Aids on a massive, open wound.    I am also deeply concerned about some of the new policies the  administration seems to be considering. The Department of Homeland  Security is reported to be considering requiring some illegal migrants  to remain in Texas or, perhaps, other border States while they await  asylum screening. Now, I am not sure if this an attempt to spare blue  States from having to deal with the border crisis or a recognition that  releasing tens of thousands of illegal immigrants into the interior of  the country isn't a good idea; but, regardless, forcing border  communities to shoulder even more of the border crisis is a terrible  and profoundly unjust idea.   How about actually turning illegal immigrants back at the borders of  this country instead of keeping them within the borders and border  States?   And then there is the supplemental funding request the White House  sent to Congress. As our colleague Senator Hagerty has pointed out, the  request includes a provision that would allow Immigration and Customs  Enforcement funding to be used for shelters and migrant services. In  the words of the Senator from Tennessee, this could:         [E]ffectively convert ICE from a law enforcement agency       into a U.S. travel agency for illegal aliens and into a       grant-making bureaucracy for sanctuary cities.    I am pleased that the administration and Mexico have reached an  agreement in which Mexico will attempt to reduce pressure on its border  cities by sending migrants back to their home countries, among other  reforms. But after letting this crisis deepen for 2\1/2\ years, the  administration has a lot more work to do.   Currently, immigration is high on Americans' list of concerns, and it  is no wonder. Americans can tell that our borders are open and that  things are not getting better. They know that our current situation is  not sustainable. It would be nice if the President could figure that  out as well.   Ultimately, it is really quite simple. President Biden created this  crisis--no ifs, ands, or buts about it--and he has the power to end it.  He just needs to decide he is going to enforce the law. Pure and  simple.   Unfortunately, until he does so, I am afraid that it will continue to  be no end in sight at our southern border.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
