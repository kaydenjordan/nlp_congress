 Madam Speaker, last week in Federal court,  President Trump radically expanded his war on American's healthcare,  asking the court not only to strike down protections for people with  preexisting conditions, but to eliminate every last protection and  benefit provided by the ACA.   I am a two-time cancer survivor. Two of my four kids have lived with  Crohn's disease for 14 years. There is no way to spin this. Without the  protections of the Affordable Care Act, my family would be in big  trouble.   If America's healthcare system was a reality TV show, under this  President's mean-spirited, every-person-for-himself approach, I guess  my family would get voted off the island because, with the hand God  dealt us, we simply cost too much.   This week, the people's House will vote to make clear that we don't  believe in that vision of America, and we will not stand idly by while  Mr. Trump does everything he can to take away the protections and the  benefits that American families like mine depend on.   Madam Speaker, I implore my Republican colleagues to stand with us  and improve the ACA for the American people.
