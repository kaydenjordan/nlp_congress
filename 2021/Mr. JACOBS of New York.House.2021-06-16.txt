 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my  legislation, the Help Wanted Act, which would reinstate work search  requirements for unemployment benefits and end disincentives to work.   We have now gotten two job reports that fell short of projections.  Meanwhile, it was reported that there were a record 9.3 million job  openings in the United States.   In my home of western New York, there are reports that restaurants  are turning customers away when they need them most because they are  short-staffed.   In February, the Congressional Budget Office published a report  stating our economy would return to pre-pandemic strength without  additional government spending. Yet, the President and Democrats forced  through a highly partisan and unrelated $2 trillion package.   The result is it has now become more lucrative to stay at home than  to seek employment, a detriment to our overall economic recovery.   Vaccines are rolling out; the CDC has updated their guidance; and  positivity rates are dropping. It is time to get back to work.                            ____________________
