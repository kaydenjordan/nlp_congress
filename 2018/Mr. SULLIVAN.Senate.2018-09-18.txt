 Mr. President, it is Tuesday, and normally I come to  the Senate floor on Thursdays, and I do what is the favorite part of  the week for me. I do our series called the ``Alaskan of the Week.'' So  we are going to talk about the Alaskan of the week, which is a great  opportunity for me to talk about somebody in the great State of Alaska  who has done something good for their community, their town, their  State, or maybe their country, and I get to brag a little bit about  what I think makes my State the best State in the country. It is the  people. It is the community. It is people who are doing wonderful  things and are an inspiration.   Today I want to transport you to a village called Anaktuvuk Pass in  Alaska's North Slope Borough. It is about 500 miles north of Anchorage,  way up north, beyond the Arctic Circle. It is smack-dab in the Brooks  Range, surrounded by beautiful, rugged, majestic mountains. It is  Alaska's real-life version of the mythical Shangri-La. Anaktuvuk Pass  is the place that Stanley Riley, an amazing young Alaskan, calls home.   Stanley made his village proud recently by bringing home a gold and  two second place finishes from his first World Eskimo-Indian Olympics.  Let me spend a minute or two talking about the World Eskimo-Indian  Olympics, another Alaskan institution. The games began in 1961. They  test the skills, strength, ability, agility, and endurance of Alaskan  Natives, who for millennia have needed to be able to survive in some of  the harshest conditions in the world.   The games leave no part of the body untested. There is the seal hop,  the four-man carry, the ear pull--that one is really popular--the high  kicks, and the muktuk eating contest, which is whale blubber. They also  reflect what is very unique about the great State of Alaska. Stanley  won a gold for the head pull. It is another competition at these  incredible World Eskimo-Indian Olympics.   Let me describe the head pull. You lie down on the ground, facing  your competitor. Both of you are up on your hands, and you share a  strap looped around each other's necks. Whoever is able to use enough  neck and shoulder strength to pull the other over wins. That is the  head pull.   He almost won the four-man carry, where you walk for as long as you  can with four people clinging to all sides of you. That is the four-man  carry. He spent all summer training for it, climbing up the mountains  that surround his  [[Page S6212]]  village and hauling game back down the mountains that he had shot. It  is a good way to train in Alaska. That honor went to Sido Evans from  Fairbanks, Riley's best friend. He called him a ``mountain of a Koyukon  man.''   Riley has his sights on gold for next year's World Eskimo-Indian  Olympics. It seems like when he wants something badly enough, he gets  it, particularly now, since he has found his calling.   What is his calling, you ask? His calling is to be a role model for  his people, especially the young people.   Stanley has overcome incredible odds to get to where he is now. That  is the inspiration part I was talking about. He had some rough times as  a youngster, and he has overcome them and is now an example for so many  Alaskans in his community and beyond.   As is the case for too many children across my State and across the  country, Stanley grew up in a single-parent household without a father  around. That took its toll. When he was 12, he left Anaktuvuk Pass and  got bounced around in the foster care system. He had almost 20 foster  care parents, he said, until he emancipated at 16 years old.   Then, he started to succeed. He was able to get his GED, and he had  enough internal drive that along the way he had some good-paying jobs,  but then again he had setbacks, as happens in the life of our young  people, whether in Alaska or across the country, when drugs and alcohol  get in the way.   Finally, about 4 years ago, he looked in the mirror and didn't like  the person staring back at him. He was unhealthy, unfit, and had gained  all kinds of weight--over 400 pounds. He lacked a purpose. He packed up  and moved back to Anaktuvuk Pass, intent, he said, on changing his life  for the better and on becoming a positive role model for his community,  especially the youth in his community. He started to do this. Slowly  his mind cleared, his soul brightened, and he began to get in shape.   Now he spends his summers climbing the mountains around his village  and hunting. He guesses he has climbed up about 1,000 miles this  summer. The man is in shape. He has lost all kinds of weight, and he  works as a tour guide and is an inspiration to so many members of his  community, including his nephew Jacob, who is a talented basketball  player and the light of Stanley's life. He said:         When you're with your community, it's easier to keep       yourself together. You don't want to let those people [who       you live with and are part of your community] down.    That is a great sentiment. Stanley is now a full-time student, and he  is studying to be an Inupiak language and culture teacher. He wants the  next generation to know where they came from and how strong they are  and have pride in their culture and their heritage. He said:         I want them to know that even though you have had a hard       upbringing, you can do anything [you set your mind to].    He is also an amazing chef, mixing the old and new in Alaska. For  instance, one of his signature dishes is fettuccini Alfredo with  muktuk--whale blubber. People should try that. I am sure it is really  good. I look forward to it.   His next goal is to compete in the Arctic Winter Games, something he  has been training for every day. In Alaska, we certainly are rooting  for him.   Stanley, thank you for being an inspiration, especially among the  young people, showing them that when you have hard times, you can get  up, brush yourself off, set high goals and standards, and then achieve  them. Thank you for being our Alaskan of the week.   I yield the floor.
