 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  rule to consider H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act, introduced by my  friend and colleague from Florida, Mr. Vern Buchanan.   Mr. Speaker, this week, National Police Week, we take time to honor  our Nation's law enforcement officers for the work they do and the  sacrifices they make to keep us safe on a daily basis. It is  unconscionable that law enforcement officers are being targeted and are  making the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty; and this bill aims  to make the killing or attempted killing of a law enforcement officer  an aggravating factor for the imposition of the death penalty.   Mr. Speaker, I served for 6 years as a city commissioner and two of  those as the mayor of my small town of Johnson City, Tennessee, and had  the privilege of working with first responders, firemen, and police  officers every day. It was a privilege to do it. I put on a scrub suit  to go to work. They put on a Kevlar vest and put their lives in danger.  I cannot say thank you enough to them and their families for the  sacrifices that they make.   I commend my colleague on introducing this legislation and for the  House considering it today. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation in honor of our law enforcement officers.
