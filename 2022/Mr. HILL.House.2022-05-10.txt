 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise, too, in support of S. 1872, the United States  Army Rangers Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act. I  thank my friend from Illinois for managing the time today and also  thank Senators Ernst and Duckworth for their work on the Senate side in  originating this bill and Representatives here in the House, Crow,  Miller-Meeks, and Waltz for their work on the House companion, H.R.  3577.   Madam Speaker, to become an Army Ranger is a distinct honor. Those  who have the privilege of donning the tan beret are proven warriors  whose commitment to our freedom knows no bounds. These warriors embody  the Ranger motto: ``Rangers Lead the Way.''   The 75th Ranger regiment is so well-known that it is hard to believe  that the United States had no official units organized to carry out  such specialized missions prior to World War II.   But when America entered the war, conventional wisdom changed, and it  became clear that special operation units were essential to an Allied  victory.   The first Rangers were trailblazers, whose work influenced our  Nation's approach to special operations across all branches of the  military. On May 26, 1942, Brigadier General Lucian Truscott, the U.S.  Army liaison with the British Combined Operations headquarters,  proposed to Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall that ``we  undertake immediately the organization of an American unit along  British Commando lines.''   In short order, a cable was sent from the War Department to Major  General Russell P. Hartle, the commander of U.S. Army forces in  Northern Ireland, to authorize the activation of the first-ever Ranger  unit.   The idea was to disseminate volunteer units with the British  Commandos to become combat tested in special operation warfare and  eventually to return to their original American units and share their  newfound combat knowledge.                                time  1530    It was Truscott who bestowed the title, ``Rangers'' on these brave  soldiers. Truscott said: ``I selected `Rangers' because few words have  a more glamorous connotation in American military history.   ``It was therefore fitting that the organization destined to be the  first of American ground forces to battle Germans on the European  Continent in World War II should be called Rangers--in compliment to  those in American history who exemplified such high standards of  individual courage, initiative, determination, and ruggedness, fighting  ability and achievement.''   In just a few weeks after Truscott's original proposal, the First  Ranger Infantry Battalion was activated 19 June 1942. Five more Ranger  battalions followed, as well as a provisional Army National Guard unit  known as the 29th Ranger Battalion.   The newly formed Ranger battalions had an immediate impact on the  Allied war effort. The first battalion, then led by Major William O.  Darby, was an integral part of the North Africa campaign, so much so  that the battalion was awarded battalion honors for its actions in  Tunisia spearheading Operation Torch.   Bill Darby was a hero in my home State of Arkansas. Brigadier General  Bill Darby was born and buried in Fort Smith, Arkansas. And Darby, for  all his leadership, proudly represented that Ranger uniform and Ranger  leadership. He was killed in action in Italy at age 34 in April 1945.   Darby and those early Ranger units were able to overtake enemy troops  where the Axis forces held every advantage, including that of just  sheer numbers. Our debt can never be repaid to those who have chosen to  wear the cloth of this Nation. But today, we can honor this very  special group of volunteer soldiers, those very first Ranger battalions  who, during the Second World War, set the tone for the modern Ranger  regiments.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Davidson), a distinguished member of the 75th Ranger Regiment.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Ohio.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I urge that our friends across the aisle and on this side of the  aisle support this important bill to recognize those few Army Rangers  who are still living and recognize the work of the establishment of the  Ranger Corps in our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I am so grateful that Warren Davidson was here today.  Because of Warren's work on the House Committee on Financial Services  and in this body, truly he is the embodiment of ``Rangers Lead the  Way.'' His reflection on the formation of the regiments makes us all  think back to that historic anniversary of D-day and President Reagan's  speech at Pointe du Hoc when he paid tribute to those Rangers, ``the  boys of Pointe du Hoc.''   Madam Speaker, there were, at that time, at the 40th anniversary, a  whole row of Rangers, still living at Pointe du Hoc, who sat in front  of President Reagan to hear him pay tribute to these brave men who  scaled the cliffs at Normandy. Now, so many years later, we have lost  so many more.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friends in the Senate for this bill and for  my friends in the House who worked on it. I urge all of the House to  vote unanimously to support this Gold Medal to recognize the Greatest  Generation of Army Rangers.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5911, the Fair Hiring in  Banking Act. I appreciate the hard work of Congresswoman Beatty from  Ohio in its preparation and passage.   This bill is an important step toward continuing to expand employment  opportunities for all Americans, including ex-offenders.   This bill is bipartisan. In fact, this bill codifies rules  promulgated under the previous administration. The FDIC rules struck a  balance between allowing qualified individuals to obtain employment  through the waiver process with the need to protect the safety and  soundness of our banking system.   Republicans and Democrats worked together on this bill to ensure that  both of those objectives were met. In fact, I am proud to say that one  place where we worked together to improve the bill was on the question  of rehabilitation. Just because an individual once committed a crime  does not automatically mean that they can never be trusted, nor does it  mean they are unqualified to work in our financial system.   Madam Speaker, it is our responsibility as lawmakers to ensure that  our banking system is safeguarded against bad actors, but it is also  our responsibility to ensure that those who are  [[Page H4744]]  qualified to work in America's financial institutions have that  opportunity to pursue happiness in that manner.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and support  those who have repaid their debt to society as they begin that  important journey of shifting back to society, building a new life, and  pursuing happiness.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, I thank Mrs. Beatty for her work on this bill and her  leadership as our subcommittee chair.   I think it deserves reiterating that when former FDIC Chair Jelena  McWilliams was at the helm, she is the one who led the way to issue  rules that allow individuals convicted of certain crimes who are  currently barred from employment in the banking industry to apply for  an exemption. Chair McWilliams did, I think, an outstanding job at the  helm of the FDIC on behalf of the Trump administration.   H.R. 5911 takes the approach that would codify--put into law--aspects  of that rulemaking, as well as expand the employment opportunities at  banks and credit unions.   As Congresswoman Beatty says, it does this, in part, by eliminating  that waiver requirement for certain older criminal charges and reducing  the lookback for crimes committed by persons under the age of 21.   This bill in no way eliminates the waiver requirement for crimes  specific to a financial institution, and it doesn't change the 10-year  minimum probation period.   This bipartisan bill codifies work done by the prior administration  in an effective way that opens up, as I say, the opportunity for many  people in this country to pursue happiness by way of a career in the  financial services industry.   Madam Speaker, I spent almost four decades in the financial industry  and have been involved in hiring hundreds of people in the banking  industry, and this is the kind of a practical, commonsense view that I  think will help many of our banks find and retain key members of their  staff.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for her work. I  encourage colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 5914, the Empowering States to  Protect Seniors from Bad Actors Act. I thank the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), my friend, for his work on this important  legislation.   Protecting investors, especially the most vulnerable to financial  crimes and fraud, is a bipartisan effort. In the great State of  Arkansas, our seniors make up 17.4 percent of our population and,  across the Nation, with 54 million seniors over the age of 65, senior  investors are a frequent target of investment fraudsters.   It is especially important that we protect this population against  fraud and punish bad actors, especially since these investors are  largely on fixed incomes, living on their savings.   H.R. 5914 better equips State securities regulators and their  enforcement and investigative arms to pursue, punish, and deter  financial crimes and fraud committed against our seniors.   With this being a new grant program, important provisions have been  included that require an interim and final report to the Congress. This  will allow us to determine the effectiveness of this program before it  is renewed.   I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me again urge our colleagues to provide  support for this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the committee in support of  H.R. 935, the Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and  Brokerage Simplification Act. I particularly want to thank the bill's  sponsor, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), for his leadership  on this issue on behalf of small businesses across our country. The  importance of small businesses to our economy, our job creation, and  the innovation across our Nation cannot be overstated. They are the  backbone of all of our communities.   In October 2020, the SBA, the Small Business Administration, reported  that there were 31.7 million small businesses in the United States.  Yet, too often Democrats' heavy-handed approach to business regulation  in this country can put that success at risk. A one-size-fits-all  regulatory approach disproportionately burdens small enterprises. For  those looking to grow through merger and acquisition, they often face  additional costs, the expense of that transaction.   The committee has found that merger and acquisition brokers provide  crucial services to small businesses whose owners desire to sell the  business or merge with another firm. However, certain of these brokers  face significant compliance costs, including SEC registration fees,  which, of course, are passed on to their clients, the small businesses.   H.R. 935 helps to alleviate these costs by amending the Exchange Act  to create a simplified registration system for these kinds of merger  and acquisition brokers.   The Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, agrees with the  premise of this bill. In fact, back in 2014, the SEC issued a no-action  letter to exempt certain M&A brokers from registration, and that no- action letter, Madam Speaker, is relied upon today.   Without a change in law, the regulated community is left in a state  of uncertainty when it comes to Federal securities laws. The gentleman  from Michigan's bill will clarify, simplify, and provide much-needed  certainty as to that process without compromising important investor  protections.   I also remind my colleagues that this bill has passed the House in  previous Congresses. Therefore, our committee urges our colleagues to  support H.R. 935, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the author of this legislation and the ranking  member of our Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital  Markets Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, let me conclude the discussion on H.R. 935  by thanking my friend from Michigan for his persistent leadership over  many Congresses on this topic. I urge my colleagues to support him in  this effort, putting it over the goal line, and getting a great result  out of the Senate in the days ahead.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois for managing the bill.  It is also good to be on this House floor again talking on an issue  that we share in common, and that is the importance of sanctions being  successful as a part of our strategy to get Mr. Putin out of Ukraine.  So it has been very good to partner with my friend from California (Mr.  Sherman) on H.R. 7066, the Russia and Belarus Financial Sanctions Act.   Madam Speaker, U.S. financial institutions are already prohibited  from engaging in transactions with sanctioned Russian entities, but  H.R. 7066 extends that prohibition to entities owned or controlled by  U.S. financial institutions as well. This is a commonsense provision,  and it has helped other sanctions programs be more successful, and I  cite particularly the efforts to isolate Iran and North Korea.   Under the President's ongoing Russia measures, anyone providing  support to a sanctioned person runs the risk of being sanctioned  themselves. We know that U.S. financial institutions are fully aware of  us. Congress expects their full compliance and to be watchful on their  affiliates that may also do business with Russia.   As the U.S. continues to pressure the Putin regime, we must seek and  prevent opportunities for Russia to find loopholes for non-U.S.  financial institutions.  [[Page H4750]]    I am glad to see that our current sanctions on Russia are making it  more difficult for Moscow to find alternatives to Western banks.  However, opportunities remain for us to tighten these multilateral  sanctions and increase pressure on Russia, particularly in Russia's  energy exports. Both the United States and Europe continue to provide  carve-outs for energy transactions, and the next step on the sanctions  ladder is to close these loopholes so that Russia cannot receive hard  currency by selling oil and gas.   I hope that Republicans and Democrats can work together to pursue  this kind of policy and continue to collaborate on how to tighten the  financial noose around Putin. Just as we worked on this bill together,  I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will come together and  support the work of my friend from California.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank my good friend, Mr. Sherman, on this bill, and let me remind  the leaders of the Kremlin that Americans on both sides of this aisle  are unified in our efforts to cut off the economic flow to the Kremlin,  and we share that objective with our friends in Europe. When I was in  Europe a few weeks ago, just before Easter, leaders in both Poland and  Romania reiterated that they are prepared to go further in economic  sanctions against the Putin regime and Moscow.   So it needs to be clear that Americans, while we are fully on board  with our transatlantic friends in constraining Mr. Putin, the announced  sanctions by President Biden and the sanctions that we are talking  about today are just a beginning point as this Congress works to  provide lethal assistance with 31 countries to help the Ukrainians  defend themselves. This Congress helps provide humanitarian assistance,  along with countries from all around the world and the United Nations,  to help the Ukrainians have the medicine, food, and material that they  need to survive in this really outrageous and unprecedented attack by  the Russians on the sovereign nation of Ukraine.   So it is important to note here that we are here not for the last  time to talk about how to fine-tune, how to tighten, and how to direct  our economic sanctions more successfully.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from California for our  collaboration on this. I encourage all Members on both sides of the  aisle to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7081, the Ukraine  Comprehensive Debt Payment Relief Act.   Last month, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy gave a speech about  rebuilding a free, sovereign, and democratic future for his sovereign  nation of Ukraine. While it seems distant now, with Putin's war raging,  we, in fact, must start to think about the country's eventual  rebuilding, recovery, and rebirth.   The United States and our allies must support Ukraine to ensure that  its debt repayments don't overwhelm the country while it continues to  confront Russia's invasion and keeps up the fight every day, not only  on the war front but on the home front in trying to keep its domestic  operations functioning.   In fact, Madam Speaker, Ukraine is spending roughly some $5 billion a  day in its core functions for government. So while Putin is pulverizing  villages, plazas, parks, and ports, the Ukrainian Government presses  on, serving its citizens.   But when this war is over, Ukraine will face an enormous financing  need that will require international financial institutions to step in  with support.   I am pleased to support this legislation, which calls for a  suspension of Ukraine's debt service payments and urges debt relief  from multilateral and bilateral creditors.   When you think of the hundreds of billions and certainly possibly  trillions of dollars of long-term reconstruction that faces Ukraine,  you have to recognize the need now for conserving cash flow and  conserving its resources.   That rebuilding is going to take immense good government; investment  in the country's municipal, health, and education infrastructure;  energy resilience; and energy independence. That will be a special  opportunity to strengthen democracy and the rule of law in Europe.   Prior to the war, Ukraine's economy had stagnated for too long.  Therefore, international financial institutions should assess how best  to foster Ukrainian industries that can expand exports, earn hard  currency, and move forward.   This bill is an important step in our bilateral and multilateral  efforts to help Ukraine mush on, get through this war, maintain its  services to its citizens, and fight Putin to the end with his leaving  the country.   This legislation was reported out of our committee unanimously, and I  look forward to its passage today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reiterate my thanks to my friend from  Illinois for his work on this bill as one key component of helping  Ukraine have the financial wherewithal, the financial resources, to  fight back against Putin's illegal invasion.   I remind my colleagues that this debt suspension has a 7-year sunset  in the bill, that this is in no way a panacea, but it is an absolutely  critical element in the cash flow conservation for the Ukrainians as  they attempt to deliver the important services that they have  [[Page H4752]]  to in their country of over 40 million people while a war wages on  their domestic and sovereign ground.   Madam Speaker, let me urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill. I thank the  gentleman from Illinois, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Congresswoman Wagner's  bill, H.R. 6891, the Isolate Russian Government Officials Act.   As the United States and our allies confront Russia's aggression in  Ukraine, we must show the world that the Congress can unite around  bipartisan legislation to hold the Putin regime accountable.   I thank my friend, Congresswoman Wagner, who recognized early that  Russia's invasion of Ukraine required a complete rethinking of Moscow's  involvement and engagement in our international organizations.   Congresswoman Wagner is eminently qualified for that as she is a  [[Page H4753]]  senior member of both the House Financial Services Committee and the  House Foreign Affairs Committee and has had the distinction of serving  our Nation abroad as our Ambassador.   Congresswoman Wagner's bill would establish that U.S. policy is to  exclude Russia from participating in key international bodies until  Moscow withdraws completely from Ukraine.   I think Americans join us in knowing that it is illogical and  unreasonable for a country that threatens peace in Europe and financial  stability globally to take part in overseeing the world's many  multilateral financial system organizations.   Our strong sanctions against the Putin regime have been vital to  raising the costs and imposing new ones, as we have talked about on  this floor today, on Moscow, on Putin's leadership, on his cronies. But  Moscow must pay a diplomatic cost as well.   We were in Romania and Poland, many of us on both sides of the aisle,  over the last few weeks, and we have also had some extraordinary  presentations by the distinguished Ambassador to the United Nations  from Ukraine. Universally, diplomats in the European Union, across  Europe, and at the United Nations are asking themselves: Are we really  going to have business as usual when a member of the U.N. Security  Council invades another United Nations member and destroys a country?   Today, we are proposing to employ a heavy diplomatic cost on Moscow,  and that means leaving Russian Government officials on the outside,  Madam Speaker, looking in.   After H.R. 6891 was introduced, Russia was suspended from the Bank  for International Settlements and agreed to no longer participate in  the meetings of the FSB, the Financial Stability Board. These moves  would be codified in law when Mrs. Wagner's bill is enacted. We now  need the G20 to follow suit.   While it is a symbolic step for Treasury Secretary Yellen and other  allied officials to walk out of the recent G20 meeting last month,  where Russian representatives were attending, this Congress and our  transatlantic partners need to do more.   Under this bill, a hostile Russia would have no future in the G20.  H.R. 6891 presents a clear choice for the Putin regime: End your  destabilizing, illegal violations of Ukrainian sovereignty or remain an  international pariah.   Our response to Putin's invasion should signal to China a similar  fate awaits Beijing should it ever decide to follow in Putin's ill- conceived footsteps. The costs imposed on Russia through this bill  foreshadow costs that China or any other nation bears if it violates  the international norms of behavior.   This strong measure passed unanimously in the House Financial  Services Committee, and I, too, welcome its passage on this House  floor. I thank Chair Waters for her work on H.R. 6891 and appreciate  the strong bipartisan work on this important national security,  economic security, and diplomatic cost measure.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Mrs. Wagner), the author of H.R. 6891. Let me reiterate Congresswoman  Wagner's experience as the vice chairwoman of the House Financial  Services Committee and vice chairwoman for the House Foreign Affairs  Committee.                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   First, I reiterate my thanks to Mrs. Wagner for her leadership on  this bill and as she has done so well ably, even as a diplomat in our  own House of Representatives, provided leadership through the  Committees on Foreign Affairs and Financial Services on this issue.   Secondly, let me reiterate Mr. Connolly's comment that we do speak in  one voice on this House floor as it relates to Putin's illegal,  unprovoked invasion of a sovereign nation, Ukraine, particularly  egregious for a permanent  [[Page H4754]]  member of the U.N. Security Council, to place the world in this  position. But I think we do have to take to heart Ukrainian Ambassador  to the United Nations' view of ``we are not going to have business as  usual.''   So while we speak as one voice here in the people's House, let's  encourage the executive branch, under President Biden, to also speak  with one voice on this point. Let's not have weasel words from former  Secretary Kerry talking about, ``Oh, but we need the Russians' support  on climate'' or Jake Sullivan saying, ``Oh, but we have got to have  Russian support negotiating with Iran on the failed JCPOA reentry  project of this administration.''   I agree it is not business as usual, and you can't have it both ways  when you are having Ukraine, a nation of over 40 million people, the  size of the State of Texas, in the heart of central Europe, invaded by  a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. It is outrageous. They  don't have a seat at the table, and this bill demonstrates it and  demonstrates that strong bipartisan view in the House of  Representatives that Putin doesn't deserve a seat at the table.   I think Americans, as I said earlier, believe it is illogical and  unreasonable for a country that threatens peace on the Continent of  Europe and financial stability globally in any way, shape, or form,  take part in overseeing the economic affairs of our international  order.   Therefore, I reiterate that this bipartisan support for Ukraine is  fully embraced in H.R. 6891. I urge all Members to support it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation being  considered here on the House floor, the Russia and Belarus SDR Exchange  Prohibition Act, H.R. 6899.   This legislation would prohibit the United States from exchanging any  Special Drawing Rights, or SDRs, with Russia or Belarus. These SDRs are  reserve assets issued by the International Monetary Fund, the IMF.   This bill would also require the Secretary of the Treasury to work  with other IMF member countries to prevent them from doing the same.   Now, let's be blunt. We should be especially concerned by Russia's  ability to exchange its SDRs for Chinese renminbi or pledge their SDRs  for a loan that isn't transparent to the world in support of Russia's  illegal invasion by a country such as China, using those reserve  assets.  [[Page H4755]]                                     time  1700    This is a particular risk, as Moscow is increasingly forced to  potentially turn to China in response to global sanctions imposed on  the nation of Russia and its central bank. Mr. Speaker, the world is  watching, and we must send a message that the United States is not  standing idly by and allowing SDR assets to be used to finance the  destruction of Ukraine.   Russia alone owns over $25 billion of these IMF reserve assets, and  these IMF assets represent unconditional liquidity and a source of  financing for the Kremlin. It is important to note that of that $25  billion of SDR assets on the books of the Russian central bank, more  than $17 billion of it was just recently gifted to czar Putin last  year, through the Biden administration's $650 billion green-lighting of  a general SDR allocation by the IMF.   Nearly a billion dollars in SDRs were also awarded to Belarus last  year, a move that our colleagues from the bipartisan Friends of Belarus  Caucus warned would be rewarding state-sponsored violence against  civilians.   Now, Mr. Speaker, on this House floor, in our committee, and in many  other forums over many months, I urged Treasury Secretary Yellen and  the administration not to pursue this flawed policy. There were  superior policy choices with an eye to benefiting the poorest nations  on our globe that have had the hardest macroeconomic impact as a result  of COVID-19, superior policy choices, far superior to an across-the- board general allocation, because not only do wealthy countries get  that allocation and the poor countries get it, but the foes of freedom  get the allocation. We are back on this House floor today talking about  the ramifications of when that happens. Two foes of freedom today, no  doubt, are Belarus and Russia.   My warnings came long before the invasion of Ukraine began, but those  warnings were not heeded. Today, we come to the House floor united as a  bipartisan leadership team saying under no circumstances should the  central banks of Belarus and Russia in any way, shape, or form have  access to their special drawing rights, pledge their special drawing  rights, or exchange their special drawing rights, and we once again  urge our Treasury Secretary to put up the guardrails, lay those rules  of the road out, prohibit anyone who is a member of the IMF from doing  likewise. That work with our allies at the IMF is critical to ensure  that China or some other nation doesn't throw Vladimir Putin an SDR  lifeline.   Passing this bill, too, sends a clear signal to Beijing that the  United States will not tolerate such a move, and I would argue our  European Transatlantic partners would not tolerate such a move.   This bill also requires the administration to oppose conventional  loans to Russia or Belarus if they approach the IMF as a lender of last  resort. This is important, because as we seek to exert maximum pressure  against these regimes, we cannot, as Mr. Sherman talked about a few  minutes ago, allow loopholes to be exploited for potential assistance  from the IMF.   H.R. 6899 presents a clear choice to Russia and Belarus: End the  destabilizing activities in Ukraine or find yourself shut off from  emergency liquidity just like on this floor we have talked about  shutting off diplomatic efforts at global responsibility.   I conclude my comments by thanking Chair Waters and her Democratic  colleagues for their support of this bill and her work on this bill and  her recognition of what a tragedy a backdoor bailout of Russia by  others using central bank assets would be.   We will continue to find a way to deprive Russia of cash and  financing as it continues to wage war in Ukraine. H.R. 6899 is a strong  step in that direction. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   As Russia continues to wage war on Ukraine, this body, on a  bipartisan basis, will continue to ensure that we are using all the  levers to exert and utilize maximum pressure, maximum lethal assistance  pressure to Ukraine, maximum diplomatic pressure through isolating  Russia in international organizations, and maximum economic pressure  that we are talking about on this floor, of which H.R. 6899 is one cog  in that wheel.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank U.S. Senators Rick Scott and Joe  Manchin, who have introduced the companion legislation to H.R. 6899 in  the U.S. Senate.   I look forward to this becoming law soon. I urge all my colleagues to  support the Russia and Belarus SDR Exchange Prohibition Act, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6015, the  Benjamin Berell Ferencz Congressional Gold Medal Act. I thank  Congresswoman Frankel and the numerous original cosponsors for their  work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, Ben Ferencz was the last surviving prosecutor in the  Nuremberg trials. A few minutes ago, we were reflecting on how few Army  Rangers we have left from World War II. Truly, the Greatest Generation  is passing before us.   Ben Ferencz is one of the few people remaining on Earth who had a  front row seat to witness the horrors brought about by Nazi Germany  before and during the war. As we witness the horrors now being carried  out in Ukraine, it has never been more important for the world to hear  his story.   Ben Ferencz's family fled to New York City to escape Romania's  persecution of the Hungarian Jews. As a young man, Ferencz studied at  the City College of New York and attended Harvard Law on a scholarship.  After graduating from Harvard in 1943, Ferencz joined the U.S. Army.  Like so many Americans, this was a decision that put him face to face  with the potential of death and face to face with the worst case of  persecution and genocide in history, the Holocaust.   After 2 years at Camp Davis in Holly Ridge, North Carolina, Ferencz  was transferred to the headquarters of General Patton's Third Army.  There he was assigned to a team tasked with setting up a war crimes  branch, collecting the evidence of the horrors that had been carried  out at the recently liberated concentration camps. One of those  liberators in April 1945 was my father-in-law, Captain William A.  McKenzie, a brand-new graduate of Texas A&M University, an Army  engineer with Patton's Third Army. One spring day in April 1945, their  convoy rolled up to the gates of Buchenwald concentration camp.                                time  1715    There, he bore witness to the Nazi terror, a terror that started with  an  [[Page H4757]]  ideology of hate and superiority based on race and creed.   Bill McKenzie was just a good kid from Texas, put in an incredible  position, and that was being one of the first U.S. Army officers to see  smoke still coming out of the chimneys, bodies stacked up, and  survivors.   In 1994, at the 50th anniversary of freedom in Europe and Paris, Bill  McKenzie, that skinny captain from Texas A&M, got to meet a survivor  from Buchenwald, Jacques Graubart, who was from Brussels, who had been  imprisoned in Buchenwald and survived, and 50 years later, they met  face to face in Paris, France.   Mr. McKenzie swaggered up to this man and said, Well, what unit were  you in in World War II? And Mr. Gruber said, I wasn't in a unit. I was  in the Buchenwald concentration camp.   And Mr. McKenzie was so caught with emotion, so embarrassed for his  question, that he said, I never expected to meet a survivor. And  Jacques looked at Bill McKenzie and said, I never expected to meet  someone who saved us to say thank you.   So today, we are back on this floor to thank the work of Ben Ferencz  and so many Americans and other Allies who worked against the ideology  of the Nazis, such an affront to American values. And Ben Ferencz was  there to put those puzzle pieces together that those American Army  officers found at Buchenwald.   Ben Ferencz would travel to that concentration camp. He would collect  the evidence of the horrors. He would honor us with the work in that  war crimes branch. And Sergeant Ferencz was honorably discharged in  1945 and recruited to work on those trials for many, many years. For  three years he led the researchers investigating those records, and we  know it was no easy task.   As the lead prosecutor for the Einsatzgruppen case, Ben Ferencz  successfully convicted 22 men for taking part in a mobile death squad,  which was responsible for nearly a third of Jewish civilian deaths. His  work at the Nuremburg trials established an incredible mandate for  international criminal responsibility for the commission of war crimes  and crimes against humanity.   And Ben Ferencz' work, his sacrifice, echoes true for all of us as we  see what Assad has done in Syria, and we see what Putin is doing in  Ukraine. Ferencz' career spanned several decades and included fighting  for proper compensation for the victims and the survivors of the  Holocaust and working to establish an International Criminal Court.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to come together in support of this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and  I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank Ms. Frankel for her leadership,  Congresswoman Manning for her testimony there, and we all, on both  sides of the aisle, stand in recognition of Ben Ferencz' pioneering  efforts of his and his colleagues in the Nuremberg trials for laying  out the protection of evidence, the careful documentation of it,  preserving a way to convict the perpetrators of the Holocaust.   Those lessons and Ben Ferencz' legacy live on today, as just a few  months ago we received one of our first convictions in a court in  Germany of an Assad henchman for murder and mayhem in Syria. There is  no doubt in my mind that the chain of evidence and the actions of this  Congress, the actions of the United Nations, to promptly set up an  evidence protection and evidence documentation effort for Ukraine will  bear fruit in coming days. Those are all efforts standing on the  shoulders of Ben Ferencz and his colleagues in Nuremburg.   I urge all my colleagues to support this recognition of his efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
