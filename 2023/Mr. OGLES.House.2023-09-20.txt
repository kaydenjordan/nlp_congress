 Mr. Speaker, Elon Musk, someone generally known for  promoting free speech and autonomy, falsely stated that Taiwan is an  ``integral part of China.''   On a practical level, think about what that means for our efforts. We  in Congress can promote Taiwan's participation in international  organizations. We can argue that Taiwan must have a seat at the table,  but if we refuse or fail to confront the CCP on their falsification of  the historical record, if we, as a Congress, can't confront the CCP  with the truth, we are letting Xi Jinping dictate the terms of the  debate. That is irresponsible and wrong.   Unfortunately, this wasn't the first time that Mr. Musk has spread  misinformation about the relationship between the CCP, China, and  Taiwan.   For Elon to spread the talking points of the CCP from a position of  influence in the United States is unacceptable, which is why I am  sending a letter to Elon Musk providing him with an accurate account of  Taiwan's history and a clear message: Taiwan is not part of the  People's Republic of China and their free will is not for sale.                            ____________________
