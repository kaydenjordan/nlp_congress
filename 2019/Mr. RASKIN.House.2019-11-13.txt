 Mr. Speaker, it is an outrage that President Trump has  honored President Erdogan today with a meeting at the White House.   During his infamous May 2017 visit to the White House, Erdogan  dispatched his thugs to beat up peaceful protesters at Sheridan Circle  here in the Capital of the United States of America, demonstrating  before the world his contempt not only for human rights but for the  rule of law in our country. He should have been banned from America  until he makes all of his victims whole.   This time, his visit coincides with Turkey's savage military campaign  in northern Syria, an invasion that has killed hundreds of civilians,  displaced and driven from their homes over 160,000 people, threatened  our national security, and produced a massive humanitarian crisis.   Just weeks ago, the U.S. House passed H.J. Res. 77 and H.R. 4695, the  Protect Against Conflict by Turkey Act, which denounced Turkey's  military actions against the Kurdish people in northern Syria.   We also cannot overlook Erdogan's continuing oppressive actions  against the Turkish people. He has executed a campaign of repression  against anyone who dares disagree with his barbaric policies.   This meeting should not be taking place.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1663) to amend title 36, United States Code, to revise the  Federal charter for the Foundation of the Federal Bar Association.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am proud to have served as the lead Democratic cosponsor of this  bill introduced by my friend from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), H.R. 1663, the  Foundation of the Federal Bar Association Charter Amendments Act of  2019.   The Federal Bar Association serves as the primary voluntary bar  association for attorneys, both in the private and public sectors,  practicing in Federal courts. This bill will permit the FBA Foundation  to better fulfill its role as the only institution in America chartered  by Congress to promote the Federal administration of justice, the  advancement of Federal jurisprudence, and the practice of law in the  Federal courts by providing it with the organizational flexibility that  it needs to fully meet its contemporary mission.   The original 1954 charter created a framework that has served FBA for  the last six decades. During these years, the foundation has indeed  strengthened Federal jurisprudence, advanced legal education, and  promoted effective legal practice. The organization's initiatives have  also directly improved the lives of our people.   For example, one community outreach program, the Wills for Veterans  Initiative, is a pro bono project where FBA chapters provide the  drafting of wills and signing services for veterans in their  communities. I know a number of my constituents who participate have  found great fulfillment working on this project, just as many veterans  have benefited from it.   Another initiative establishes a mentorship program for law students  to work alongside experienced attorneys.   The current charter must be amended to allow the organization greater  flexibility of operation and growth.   For example, the existing charter codifies strict membership and  governance requirements that constrain member development and nimble  governance of the organization. This rigidity presents serious  challenges as the organization seeks to expand its critical charitable  and educational initiatives.   H.R. 1663 makes technical fixes to the charter that will give the FBA  the needed flexibility in the new century. In the place of  legislatively fixed membership criteria, it permits the FBA to  proactively establish and update membership criteria through the bylaws  process. Similar provisions authorize enhanced flexibility in the  composition and duties of the members of the board.   In general, this measure would enable the FBA to swiftly meet its  needs and improve the administration of Federal justice.   A similar version of the bill was introduced last year, which was  passed by this body on a voice vote, but it did not pass in the Senate  for various reasons. One was that the language in the bill's proposed  nondiscrimination provision did not explicitly prohibit discrimination  on the basis of gender identity, as most of the new antidiscrimination  legislation does.   To that end, I am very pleased that the Federal Bar Association took  it upon itself to amend its own bylaws on April 18 of this year to  include the following language: ``The terms of membership may not  discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, disability,  age, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.''   As a cosponsor of the Equality Act, introduced by the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), my good friend, I fully support equal  rights for all. The proactive amendment of the FBA bylaws, I believe,  makes clear the  [[Page H8795]]  intent of the Federal Bar Association that everyone must be protected  against invidious discrimination.   In light of this development, I believe that H.R. 1663 will help the  FBA to flourish for many decades to come. I strongly support the bill,  and I look forward to the FBA's continued positive involvement in our  Nation's Federal legal system, and I urge all of my colleagues to  support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia  (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentlewoman, who is a great champion for the people of  Washington, D.C., and I could not agree more with her sentiments about  efforts being made in the Senate to relocate agencies central to the  operation of the national government away from the national capital  region. I stand firmly with her in opposition to that disturbing trend.   As the gentlewoman noted, the Foundation of the Federal Bar  Association operates independently of the Federal Government and is  currently headquartered in Arlington. I have received assurances from  the FBA that they have no plans to relocate their principal offices as  a result of the passage of this bill.   FBA's mission and institutional interests, advancing the quality of  justice in the Federal judiciary, necessitate location close to  Washington, D.C.   Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Ohio is prepared to close, I am as  well.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank the distinguished and always eloquent gentleman from  Georgia for his comments on a number of interesting things. One is the  question of bipartisanship and us working together, and I think the  gentleman correctly invites us to study the record of legislative  success and achievements in our body.   It is true that the best legislation, like the Voting Rights Act, for  example, is legislation that came through a bipartisan process where we  had both parties working together.   All of our great Presidents have been people who themselves were  involved in partisan politics, and often in a bare-knuckled way, but  also, once they were in office, called the country to try to speak  across party lines.   Jefferson said, ``We are all republicans. We are all federalists'' in  his inaugural address in 1800.   And Lincoln, of course, said: We are friends; we must not be enemies.  We must be friends, and we must not be enemies.   And President Obama said: We are not the red States of America; we  are not the blue States of America. We are the United States of  America.   And so we have to try to aspire to that even though we work in a  party system. And the reason we have a party system is because we are  not a one-party dictatorship.   One way to get rid of partisanship is you get rid of political  parties and you have a one-party state. But we don't believe in that.  We have got political freedom in America.   But, at the same time, once we get in, the same way that we render  constituent service to all of our constituents without regard to  whether they are Democrats or Republicans or Independents, we should  try to render legislative service to the whole country at the same  time.   Let me just make one other point to my friend about the Seat of  Government Clause.   Now, as the gentleman knows, the distinguished gentlewoman from the  District of Columbia represents 700,000 people who have no voting  representation in Congress, and the basis for that, what I think is a  historical accident, has been the existence of the District Clause that  Congress exercises exclusive legislation over the land that is ceded to  Congress for the purposes of a seat of government.   Well, I suppose to the extent that there is an attempt to justify us  being the only country on Earth where the people of the Capital City  are not represented, it has to do with the fact that this is where the  Federal Government is located.   Now, the District of Columbia is involved in a statehood struggle,  which I support. Like every other American, they want to be part of a  State. But as long as they are in the so-called seat of government, it  seems to me that the gentlewoman makes a good point, which is that  truly Federal functions should not be stripped away from Washington,  D.C., and relocated around the country.   Now, most Federal employees don't live in the National Capital area;  80 to 85 percent of them live across America at Army bases or post  offices, Departments of Justice around the country. They work in all of  those Federal functions around the country.   But there are certain things that do belong here. The Federal  departments clearly belong within the seat of government, and I think  that the gentlewoman was just identifying that there has been an effort  to strip away essential Federal functions and to relocate them to other  parts of the country, leaving her constituents with the worst of both  worlds, which is no representation the way that our constituents are  represented, but, at the same time, a gradual stripping away of the  Federal offices and departments.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Chabot for his excellent  work on this legislation, and I want to thank Mr. Collins for his  thoughtful intervention.   Mr. Speaker, this bill was advanced to allow the Foundation of the  Federal Bar Association the flexibility it needs to successfully manage  its own affairs, as Mr. Chabot pointed out. I urge its passage, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
