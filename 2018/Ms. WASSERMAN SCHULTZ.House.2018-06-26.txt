 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I commend Ranking Member Visclosky and Chairwoman Granger  for producing a bill that provides the resources necessary for our  armed services to perform the critical role of securing our Nation.   The bill funds both the assets our armed services need and invests in  servicemembers, providing for a 2.6 percent increase in military pay.   I thank my colleague, the chairwoman from Texas, for including in the  committee report language addressing the metastatic cancer task force  report on research related to metastatic cancer. I look forward to  working with the chairwoman and ranking member to ensure that DOD not  only considers the recommendations from the task force, but  expeditiously implements them to ensure that we are making progress in  reducing the estimated 90 percent of cancer deaths that are due to the  direct or indirect effects of metastasis. I thank the chairwoman for  her commitment to doing that.   Mr. Chairman, I also want to point out that I filed an amendment to  this bill that would prevent agencies from stopping Members of Congress  from visiting facilities housing foreign national minors.   Last week, Senator Nelson and I were denied access, after first being  told we would be admitted, to a temporary shelter housing foreign  national minors in Homestead, Florida. Allowing Congress to conduct our  appropriate oversight role without restriction is absolutely essential  to us being able to make sure we can be good stewards of the people's  resources.   Regardless of party affiliation, as Members of Congress, we should  all agree that it is not only our right, but our duty to conduct  oversight of the administration on our terms and on our timeline.    I urge the Republican majority to make my amendment in order so that  we can do just that.   Mr. Chair, I urge Members to support this well-crafted Defense  Appropriations bill.
