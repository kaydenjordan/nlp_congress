I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place the  bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to my  own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 3 p.m. on  Monday, January 30; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and the Senate be in a period of morning business with Senators  permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    For the information of the Senate, Senators should expect  a rollcall vote at approximately 5:30 p.m. on Monday.   If there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask that  it stand adjourned under the previous order.    Mr. President, yes. I will yield. I withdraw my request.
