 Mr. President, the good news about the tax bill that I  believe we will pass over the next few days is that it will go into  effect on the first day of January and people will quickly see, no  matter how loud others are talking, the exact facts. For work done in  January, people who get that check in January or February or whenever  they get paid for their January work--there is going to be a  substantial tax decrease for working families at all levels. Our  friends want to talk about what happens after 2025 or 2027, but surely  the Congress can do its job between now and then.   This is a pro-growth policy. There are two ways to increase people's  take-home pay, and we are going to pursue both of them. One is to take  less out of your pay right now. That will happen not a year from now  and not a year and a half from now; that will happen next month. So  next month, when people get their paychecks, it will be clear to them  who had the facts and who didn't have the facts on this. The second way  it will increase people's pay is by having better jobs to start with.  Hundreds of economists who have looked at this bill say that it will  make the United States of America the best place to invest money and  create jobs, and I think we will know sooner rather than later that  that happens.   So good tax policy, commonsense regulation, and judges--another thing  we are working on this week--make a difference in how people look at  the economy that they want to invest in and an economy that they want  to grow. Why would judges make a difference? Judges make a difference  because judges create a sense of fairness in the court. They create a  sense of an ability to get your case heard. And they create a sense  that what the law says hopefully is what the judge will decide rather  than what the judge thinks the law should say.   We are making great progress in all of those areas if we add good tax  policy to what has been happening.   Right now, Mr. President, we are talking about judges, and President  Trump has a unique opportunity to shape the long-term view of the  judiciary. This week we are going to confirm three circuit judges, and  I wish to speak in just a little while about what that means.   At the start of President Trump's term, 12 percent of all of the  Federal judiciary seats were vacant. No President has had that kind of  opportunity  [[Page S7991]]  since President Clinton had that opportunity now almost 25 years ago  when he started his first year. And the President will have the  opportunity--and is making the most of it--to fill those vacancies.   I believe President Trump made the right choice when he selected  Justice Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court. There was a record as a  circuit judge; you can look at what he had decided. The Presiding  Officer and I and other Members of the Senate can look at what he has  decided and anticipate, after 10 years of that record, what his record  would look like. It makes a difference. I have no doubt that President  Trump will continue to nominate judges who will rule as did Justice  Scalia, whose unfortunate death created the most recent vacancy.   Justice Scalia, by the way, served on the Supreme Court for 26 years  after the person who nominated him left the White House and 13 years  after President Reagan died. So the legacy of what happens here is  important.   Justice Scalia was profound in his sense that the work of the Court  was not to decide what the legislature should have done; the work of  the Court was to decide what the law and the Constitution said. There  are ways to change the law, and there are ways to amend the  Constitution, but a person on the Court needs to look at what the  Constitution and the laws say.   While Supreme Court vacancies tend to get a lot of attention, it is  just as important that the Senate nominate and confirm the jobs the  President and the Senate share. It is our responsibility too.   The Constitution could have said: Will report to the Senate, and,  unless there is some big objection, that person becomes a judge. That  is not what it says. It says: The Senate will confirm.   As of this morning, there are slightly more than 140 lifetime  vacancies on the courts to be filled. So far this year, we have  confirmed 10 circuit court judges. By the time we leave this week, I  think we will have confirmed 12 circuit judges this year. That will be  close to a post-World War II record. It has been a long time since  World War II, and it has been a long time since a President has had the  opportunity to do that.   Why do we need to do that? First of all, the people of this country  have a right to seek justice and to believe that the rule of law will  prevail. The Supreme Court hears about 100 to maybe 150 cases in a  year, but the 12 circuit courts--where you appeal a lower Federal court  ruling to--hear many cases, and about 7,000 of those cases are appealed  to the Supreme Court; the Supreme Court deals with 100 to 150 of them.  So the judges in the 12 circuits often write what, in our structure, is  essentially final law; the final rule of any court is at the circuit  level.   The Federal Bar Association says that the ``number of federal  judicial vacancies throughout the federal court system is straining the  capacity of the federal courts to [do their job].''   In cooperation with the President, we have a job to do here. The  capacity to hear these cases is important. Justice delayed is justice  denied.   Filling these vacancies is also critical to ensuring that the balance  of the Constitution is in place. This was a brandnew idea when James  Madison and others thought of putting a machine together. They  sometimes referred to the Constitution as the instrument that would be  the guideline for a machine--a machine that was so finely balanced that  it would govern itself.   The courts--the judiciary--the legislative branch, and the executive  branch all have unique powers, and those unique powers were designed to  keep the government in check. This concept, new in 1787, has worked  well for us, but it doesn't work if one of the groups is allowed to  become out of balance. So filling these vacancies matters.   The leadership of the majority leader and the leadership of Chairman  Grassley in his committee make a difference. As we move forward with  the confirmation process for three more nominees this week, we are  advancing our goal of restoring the courts to judges who will determine  what the law says, not what they think it should say.   I urge my colleagues to support these well-qualified nominees. But I  also urge my colleagues on the other side to stop using the process to  frustrate the other work of the government. There is a right to 30  hours of debate, which is what we are in right now; we are in 30 hours  of debate on a circuit judge, but nobody is talking about that circuit  judge. Other bills could have been brought to the floor, and other  issues that could have been dealt with aren't being dealt with because  the minority has decided to abuse their power--to say that we are going  to have 30 hours of debate about this judicial nominee, and then have  no debate about the judicial nominee.   It doesn't mean we don't need to confirm the judges, but it does  mean, if we did so in a way that made sense for the people we work for,  we would be doing other business now, and these three judges would have  already been confirmed. They will be confirmed this week.   My belief is that if the rules designed to protect the minority in  the Senate are abused, they will not last forever. Eventually, you have  to say: OK, facts are facts. This rule isn't being used this way, and  the Senate has to do the people's work. If rules have to be changed to  do that, I am for changing those rules.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule  XXII, at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, December 13, there be 30 minutes of  postcloture time remaining on the Willett nomination, equally divided  between the leaders or their designees; that following the use or  yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the confirmation of the  Willett nomination; and that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.
