 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this resolution, which would stack the  deck against hardworking families, small businesses, and nearly any  group or individual who needs financial services.   Mr. Speaker, universal access to fair and impartial courts is a  principle that is enshrined in both the Sixth and Seventh Amendments of  our Constitution. It is the cornerstone of our justice system. Without  that access, we cannot hold bad actors accountable; families and small  businesses suffer; justice is denied.   Forced arbitration clauses protect the powerful by denying Americans  their day in court. Big corporations have enormous leverage. They offer  essential services and have few competitors.   For many consumers, having a cell phone or a checking account means  accepting arbitration. Often there are no other options.   The CFPB has sought to correct that injustice. The Bureau's  arbitration rule ensures that those who are wronged by a financial  institution have meaningful recourse. At Wells Fargo and elsewhere,  recent events have shown why that recourse is essential.   When our courts are out of the picture, accountability can slip;  cutting corners becomes less risky and more attractive.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution.
