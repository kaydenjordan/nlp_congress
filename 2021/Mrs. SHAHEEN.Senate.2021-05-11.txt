 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Lisa  Morris, New Hampshire's director of public health at the State  department of health and human services, for her years of service to  the Granite State. Throughout her career, first serving the people of  New Hampshire's Lakes Region at the Partnership for Public Health and  later the entire State at the New Hampshire Division of Public Health,  Lisa has made it her mission to improve the health and well-being of  the New Hampshire public. I am grateful for her service to our State,  especially her work to address the COVID-19 pandemic over the past  year.   Prior to her time as the New Hampshire director of public health,  Lisa served for over a decade as the executive director of the  Partnership for Public Health in Laconia, providing invaluable public  health information and services to the people of the Lakes Region. In  this role, Lisa was a leading voice in advocating for resources to meet  the health needs of the region and solve the most pressing public  health concerns. During her time as executive director, the Partnership  for Public Health was able to provide the region with invaluable  services such as a community emergency response team, an immigration  welcome center, flu vaccine clinics, and other community health  education programs. I especially commend Lisa for her attention to the  substance misuse crisis during her time as executive director.   Lisa has served as the director of public health for the State of New  Hampshire since 2016 and has provided essential leadership through  several public health challenges. In 2014, contamination from per- and  polyfluoroalkyl substances--PFAS--was first discovered in New Hampshire  at the site of the former Pease Air Force Base. In the time since, more  contamination has been found throughout our State, including in the  town of Merrimack and at the Coakley Landfill in North Hampton. While  information about the toxicity and human health impacts of PFAS was  only just emerging as the contamination was discovered, Lisa and her  team worked diligently to keep the public and physicians updated with  necessary information. The division of public health, which Lisa led,  conducted PFAS blood testing for more than 1,800 individuals who  reported exposure from contaminated drinking water while living,  working, or attending childcare on or near the campus of the Pease  International Tradeport. This information has been invaluable for those  individuals worried about their health, and I thank Lisa for her  leadership to provide this information to families.   I also commend Lisa for her leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic.  As we all know, a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic has been difficult for us  all, but Lisa's leadership has been an incredible asset to the State of  New Hampshire. From New Hampshire's announcement of the first case of  COVID-19 in March 2020 to the present, the New Hampshire Division of  Public Health has been a reliable resource, providing daily reports on  the number of COVID-19 cases and positivity rates, which have been an  important source of data for State leaders, businesses, and the general  public. With her leadership, New Hampshire was able to establish  partnerships with the New Hampshire National Guard to stand up testing  sites and vaccine distribution sites throughout our State. New  Hampshire's vaccine distribution rollout has been recognized as one of  the best in the Nation and the most efficient in reaching the public  with shots in arms. These achievements can only happen with competent  and forward-thinking leaders like Lisa.   On behalf of all the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and  all Americans to join me in thanking Lisa for her years of service,  advocacy, and leadership. I wish her well in her retirement and the  years ahead.                            ____________________
