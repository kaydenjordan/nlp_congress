 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  3401.   We have all seen the tragic pictures of immigrants held in extremely  overcrowded CBP facilities never designed to hold families and tender- aged children. I and many colleagues have been to the border and  witnessed firsthand the horrific, indisputably untenable and  intolerable conditions.   This bill addresses this humanitarian crisis and sets forth strong  oversight provisions and requirements to ensure the basic human care of  migrants in custody, especially the children.   Funding for the Department of Homeland Security totals nearly $1.5  billion, $150 million above the Senate committee bill.                                time  2000    This crucial funding will directly address the humanitarian crisis at  the border by supporting temporary CBP holding facilities to relieve  dangerous overcrowding and by providing medical and transportation  support, blankets, food, water, and other consumables for migrants.   Combined with funding in title III for unaccompanied children, the  bill also provides resources needed to reduce time in CBP custody and  to ensure their facilities are safe, sanitary, and humane.   The bill also includes $200 million for an innovative multiagency  pilot program to better address the medical and legal needs of families  and unaccompanied children. It will also improve the Department's  efficiency in migrant processing without compromising migrant legal  protections.   This pilot will co-locate Customs and Border Protection, Immigration  and Customs Enforcement, Citizenship and Immigration Services, Office  of Refugee Resettlement, and nonprofit humanitarian organizations into  a single facility. This will reduce overall processing time, provide  consistent medical assessments and treatment, and offer legal  orientation much earlier. Nonprofit organizations will provide  assessments of migrants' needs and vulnerabilities and help families  transition to local shelters or alternatives to detention.   The bill also includes $60 million to help nonprofits and local  jurisdictions continue their efforts to provide assistance to migrants  released from DHS custody.   The Office of Refugee Resettlement is nearly out of money. Without  additional resources for sheltering capacity, children will continue to  be held for weeks or longer in ill-equipped CBP holding facilities  never intended to hold children for more than a few hours.   Let me be clear: Without passage of this bill, the only alternative  is the Senate bill, which has insufficient oversight provisions and  leaves the door open for further abusive behavior by the  administration. H.R. 3401 takes a constructive, balanced approach with  the right mix of funding and oversight.   Madam Speaker, Congress simply cannot adjourn without providing the  funding needed to address the humanitarian crisis and trauma of  migrants and their children at the border. The only way to ensure the  inclusion of strong oversight, compliance requirements, and priorities  in the emergency supplemental package is to pass H.R. 3401.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this supplemental.
