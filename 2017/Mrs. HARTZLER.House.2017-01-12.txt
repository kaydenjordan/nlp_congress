 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge this administration  to stop releasing terrorists from Guantanamo, where they can be  returned to the Middle East and rejoin the fight. Approximately one in  three former Guantanamo Bay detainees are confirmed to have reengaged  or are suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities after transfer.   The White House, despite clear understanding of congressional intent,  recently gave four more individuals the opportunity to resume their  fight against American ideals by releasing them to Saudi Arabia. This  is irresponsible and dangerous.   Even more disturbing are the President's plans to transfer more  detainees, further threatening the safety of our troops and the  security of the American people. It is appalling to me that the  President would consider transferring the likes of Osama bin Laden's  security guards and others trained by al Qaeda.   I urge this administration, in its final 8 days, to bear in mind  potential consequences of his decision and to halt any more transfers.  The security of American families and military personnel are at stake.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Commodity  End-User Relief Act. I thank the chairman for the countless hours that  he and members and staff of the Ag Committee have put into crafting  this bill, which is designed to provide relief to the end users across  the Nation that were never intended to be burdened by these rules and  regulations.   I have heard from many end users in my district about the need for  commonsense reforms to our financial regulations that are encapsulated  in this bill. These financial regulations affect entities and the  people I represent and rely on every day, from the rural electric  cooperatives that use these financial tools to keep energy prices as  low and as stable as possible for rural Missourians, to the local grain  elevators and farmers that manage their price risk using futures and  options at a time when prices are low. And times are hard in farm  country. Regulatory relief for Main Street is way past due on these  regulations that were designed to regulate Wall Street.   During this debate, I have heard some of my colleagues' concerns that  this bill has not followed regular order. But we have spent countless  hours in briefings, hearings, and markups on this very bill. Many of us  even took a trip to Chicago to visit the CFTC office and to tour key  industry facilities. In the 6 years that I have served on this  committee, we have held 22 hearings on the future of the Commission and  the state of the derivatives industry. We held two separate markups on  previous versions of this reauthorization in the 113th and 114th  Congresses, followed by passage of these bills on the House floor. In  fact, the bill we are taking up today is almost identical to the bill  passed on this floor last Congress. Every single amendment to this bill  offered by a Member of the House will be voted on today, including my  amendment to provide relief to farmers, agricultural cooperatives, and  grain elevators from burdensome reporting requirements. The process of  considering the bill has been fair and open.   I thank the chairman for bringing up this much-needed bill to provide  regulatory relief to my constituents through this fair and open  process. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of the bill, add the following:       SEC. ___. DELAY IN FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINAL RULE ON                     OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL REPORTING.         The Commodity Futures Trading Commission may not enforce       non-compliance with the final rule titled ``Ownership and       Control Reports, Forms 102/2S, 40/40S, and 71'' (78 FR 69178;       November 18, 2013) until the Commission votes to approve a       final rule that has been amended to--        (1) provide that the reportable trading volume level shall       be at least 300 contracts;        (2) provide that the reporting entity shall not be required       to provide natural person controller data; and        (3) provide that the reporting entity is not obligated to       supply data that violates foreign privacy laws.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 40, the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to  bring certainty to farmers, agricultural cooperatives, and grain  elevators across Missouri and the country that are having problems  complying with burdensome reporting requirements at the CFTC. Dodd- Frank never intended to regulate end users like independent grain  elevators who work on behalf of Missouri farmers to help manage their  price risk. My amendment works to correct this oversight and provide a  stable environment for all players in the industry.   My amendment is simple. It would require the Commission to address  three outstanding concerns to the Ownership and Control Reports rule,  better known as the OCR rule, before the Commission can begin  enforcement, which, by the way, the CFTC is not enforcing presently.  This industry currently is operating under a no-action relief letter,  meaning the OCR rule is not being enforced due to the inability of the  industry to meet the stringent requirements of the CFTC regulations.  That could change, and the problem needs to be addressed.   Specifically, my amendment does three things. First, it increases the  threshold from 50 to 300 contracts per day per commodity for those  market participants that need to comply with this rule. This will  exempt low-volume entities like grain elevators and small agricultural  cooperatives from the reporting requirements for large trading firms  and major players in these markets. Even with the new threshold  established by my amendment, the CFTC will still gather ownership and  control information on the major players and midsized traders.   Second, my amendment removes a small but very burdensome portion of  the long list of reporting requirements under the final OCR rule. My  amendment removes the natural person controller requirements which  require farmer cooperatives and grain elevators to report specifically  personally identifiable information on individual employees. The CFTC  has never required such granular information for many of my constituent  businesses, and such requirements are making Futures Commission  Merchants much less willing to work with small and medium-sized  entities in the countryside. Even with the small changes made by my  amendment, the CFTC will still be properly equipped to track ownership  and account control data across the market.   Finally, this amendment will require the CFTC to ensure that current  regulations do not conflict with current foreign privacy laws. Having a  large, open, liquid market is important to managing risk, and operating  on an international basis is a valuable aspect of a commodity market.  The CFTC should be responsible for dealing with other governments on  privacy concerns. It is inappropriate to push that burden onto the  firms and customers that it regulates.   This amendment is supported by a wide range of industry and farmers  groups, and I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment to  provide relief from the regulatory burdens of this rule on small  cooperatives, grain elevators, and farmers who are merely hedging their  legitimate market risk and serving their customers' interests.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I would remind our colleagues that this rule is right  now under a no-action relief letter because it isn't working, and that  is what this amendment does is to fix this problem. So I believe this  amendment is very important. It makes a few commonsense changes to the  OCR rule that will provide regulatory relief to farmers, agricultural  cooperatives, and grain elevators while allowing the CFTC to adequately  regulate the futures industry.   So, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).   The amendment was agreed to.
