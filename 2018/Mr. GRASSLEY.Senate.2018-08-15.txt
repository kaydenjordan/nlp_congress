 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week I announced that the Senate  Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination  for the Supreme Court starting on September 4. The hearing will begin  57  [[Page S5607]]  days after the President announced Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, more  than a week longer than the period between the announcements and  hearings for the last three Justices--Sotomayor, Kagan, and Gorsuch.   The Senate has already received more documents from Judge Kavanaugh's  time in the executive branch than we did for any previous Supreme Court  nominee. We have so far received more than 184,000 pages of documents,  of which more than 124,000 are currently publicly available to anybody  in this country going to judiciary.senate.gov.   The team of lawyers who work for the majority have already reviewed  more than 10,000 pages of the 307 judicial opinions that Judge  Kavanaugh wrote, along with hundreds more opinions that he joined, in  his 12 years of service on the DC Circuit. The team of lawyers who  worked for the majority have reviewed 110 pages of written answers and  over 17,000 pages of materials Judge Kavanaugh submitted to the  committee in response to its bipartisan questionnaire--the most robust  questionnaire ever submitted to a Supreme Court nominee.   The team of lawyers who work for the majority has already reviewed  every page of the more than 184,000 pages of emails and other records  that the committee has received so far from Judge Kavanaugh's time as a  government lawyer in the White House and also serving with Judge Starr  when Starr was independent counsel.   I expect that we will receive even more documents this very night or,  at the latest, tomorrow and that all remaining documents responsive to  our request will be produced next week. We will work to make every  unrestricted record publicly available as quickly as possible.   As I predicted, this confirmation process is the most transparent  ever, particularly as it relates to the number of documents that we are  receiving. We have already received more documents from Judge  Kavanaugh's executive branch service than any nominee in history, with  many more to come.   Senators have more time to review Judge Kavanaugh's record than they  did for at least three Supreme Court nominees. So I am very confident  that the committee and the Senate will have ample information and time  to carry out our responsibilities under our Constitution to advise and  consent.   But some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  attempting to manipulate the American people. I just described to you  the largest document production in the history of a Supreme Court  nomination. But guess what. The minority leader describes it as  ``unprecedented secrecy.'' This argument is very ridiculous on its  face, and the American people aren't buying it.   I got a lot of questions at my town meetings across Iowa over the  last week. In 20 different counties in Iowa, this issue about the  Supreme Court always came up--that shouldn't surprise anybody--but  there was hardly any mention of this document issue, which was cooked  up by the Washington insiders.   Let's not forget how this document issue started. First, liberal dark  money groups and their Senate allies announced immediate opposition to  Judge Kavanaugh. Some of them even announced it before the name  Kavanaugh was announced by the President. The minority leader said that  he would oppose Judge Kavanaugh with everything he has.   So their first tactic was to argue that the Senate shouldn't confirm  anyone during a midterm election year. They attempted to invoke the  Biden rule, which bars confirmation of Supreme Court Justices during a  Presidential election year, to make this argument. Of course, this was  a ludicrous position, unsupported by precedent and widely rejected by  objective observers and even fact checkers.   The minority leader and his allies abandoned that argument, but they  didn't abandon their goal, which is to stall Judge Kavanaugh's  confirmation until after the midterm elections and hope that the other  party will take control of the Senate. That is why the minority leader  refocused his tactics and manufactured a very phony controversy  regarding Judge Kavanaugh's White House documents.   How do we know it is phony? On the one hand, the minority leader has  publicly stated that he would oppose Judge Kavanaugh's nomination with  everything he has. On the other hand, he is insisting that the Senate  needs millions more pages of documents on top of what we already have  in order to make an informed decision.   Indeed, the Senate Democrats demanded the search of every page of  every email and every other record from every one of the hundreds of  White House staffers who came and went during every one of the 8 years  of the Bush administration just because the name ``Kavanaugh'' could  have been in those emails. In other words, the Senate Democrats  demanded the search of every scrap of White House paper for the entire  Bush Presidency.   As I stated repeatedly, I am not going to put the American taxpayers  on the hook for the Senate Democrats' fishing expedition. How much more  information do the minority leader and his outside dark money allies  need if they have already made up their decision to vote no on Judge  Kavanaugh?   When they are in that position, they don't care about Judge  Kavanaugh's record because they know what their vote is going to be.  How much more do they need to know to vote no?   They simply want to bury us in a mountain of paper so there is no  chance that we can hold a confirmation vote on Judge Kavanaugh's  nomination any time this year. There is already a mountain of paper for  our committee members to go through and their staffs. The Democrats  want to make it be Mount Everest.   Let's not forget that Judge Kavanaugh has a 12-year judicial track  record from his time on the DC Circuit. During that time, he authored  more than 300 opinions and joined in hundreds more. These opinions  provide the most relevant information for assessing Judge Kavanaugh's  legal thinking and whether or not he ought to be approved to be on the  Supreme Court.   I go back to something my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  said back in 2009. My Democratic colleagues were making this very same  argument with respect to Justice Sotomayor. Of course, they are flip- flopping now. The current minority leader said in 2009 that ``everybody  knows'' a judge's record on the bench ``is the best way to evaluate a  nominee.'' He said to Justice Sotomayor: ``I want to turn to your  record on the bench, which I believe is the very best way to get a  sense of what your record will be on the bench in the future.'' Then  Chairman Leahy said:         We have Judge Sotomayor's record from the Federal bench.       That is a public record that we had even before she was       designated by the President. Judge Sotomayor's mainstream       record of judicial restraint and modesty is the best       indication of her judicial philosophy. We do not have to       imagine what kind of a judge she will be because we see what       kind of a judge she has been.    Well, Senator Schumer, the same logic applies to Judge Kavanaugh's  long judicial track record of 12 years. Despite this record being more  than sufficient to assess how Judge Kavanaugh approaches legal issues,  I requested hundreds of thousands of additional pages from his time as  a government lawyer, in the interest of full transparency.   But even the most transparent confirmation process in history is not  enough for those who decided to oppose Judge Kavanaugh before they even  saw his record.   The document requests for Justice Kagan's confirmation provide strong  support for how the Judiciary Committee is proceeding now. Then, the  Senate requested Justice Kagan's White House records, but not internal  documents from the Solicitor General's Office. We refrained out of  respect for the sensitivity of internal deliberations in the Solicitor  General's Office. We did so even though these documents would have been  extremely helpful to our assessment of Justice Kagan's views on the law  given that she lacked any judicial experience or record. Justice Kagan  herself testified that Senators should look at her time as Solicitor  General in order to evaluate her, but we didn't ask for those records.  This precedent supports my decision not to ask for documents from Judge  Kavanaugh's time as White House Staff Secretary. If internal Solicitor  General documents were too sensitive to produce, then, of course,  documents from Judge Kavanaugh's time as Staff Secretary at the White  House are as sensitive as well.  [[Page S5608]]    The Staff Secretary serves as the in-box and out-box for the  President of the United States. These documents include some of the  most sensitive documents in all of our government, implicating our  national security and the President's other core duties. These  documents are at the heart of what the Constitution recognizes as  executive privilege. In addition to being the most sensitive documents,  they are the least probative of Judge Kavanaugh's legal thinking. The  Staff Secretary's primary role is to make sure that the President sees  advice from a range of policy advisers across the entire executive  branch and that he not provide his own policy or legal advice as Staff  Secretary.   To recap, Judge Kavanaugh wrote more than 300 judicial opinions and  joined in hundreds more in his 12 years on the bench. Justice Kagan, by  contrast, had written or had joined zero judicial opinions before her  nomination. Despite having less of a need for Judge Kavanaugh's  executive branch records--in light of his substantial judicial record-- the Senate has already received more such documents than it had for  Justice Kagan or for any other nominee, and we will still receive many  more. In fact, for Judge Kavanaugh, we could receive up to 1 million  pages, which is more than for the five prior Supreme Court nominees  combined.   Democratic leaders have also tried to argue that Judge Kavanaugh's  White House records are being cherry-picked by a lawyer by the name of  Bill Burck, whom they label as a partisan lawyer. I guess they have  forgotten how the Senate received documents for the last three Supreme  Court nominees. Otherwise, they wouldn't have made this silly argument.  The Senate received documents for Justice Sotomayor's confirmation  after they were reviewed by Leslie Kiernan. She represented Obama  campaign manager David Plouffe and former Representative Charlie  Rangel, and she eventually became Deputy White House Counsel in the  Obama administration.   As the Wall Street Journal pointed out in an editorial yesterday, the  Senate received documents for Justice Kagan after they were reviewed by  Bruce Lindsey. Mr. Lindsey overlapped with Justice Kagan in the White  House, which was a Democratic White House. He also served as President  Clinton's national campaign director in 1992, as President Clinton's  hyperpartisan senior lawyer and a really big fixer in the White House,  and as the CEO of the Clinton Foundation for 10 years, including when  Justice Kagan was nominated.   Now, I would think anybody who raises questions about a lawyer by the  name of Burck ought to be really embarrassed by bringing up that issue  when you look at how it was handled with previous nominees to the  Supreme Court by people who were partisan. How much more partisan can  you get than the people I just mentioned who handled issues of  Presidential privilege for Democratic nominees Sotomayor and Kagan?   It happens that Bill Burck is President Bush's Presidential Records  Act representative, as Mr. Lindsey was for President Clinton. Mr. Burck  has held this position not just recently because of this nomination-- no--but since the year 2009. He is a partner, it happens, at one of the  most liberal law firms in America. Mr. Burck also served as President  Bush's Presidential Records Act representative during the Gorsuch  nomination, but I didn't hear any Democrat objecting to Mr. Burck's  involvement in that nomination. They also didn't object to Ms.  Kiernan's or Mr. Lindsey's involvement during the Sotomayor and Kagan  nominations. Their objection to Mr. Burck's role now is another  opportunistic attempt to discredit the process and to avoid talking  about Judge Kavanaugh's qualifications.   I would like to correct one additional misconception before I yield  the floor.   As has been claimed by some people, the National Archives is not  being cut out of this process. Under the Presidential Records Act,  President Bush has the right to request his own administration's  documents. He can choose to make a document public or claim that it is  protected under executive privilege. This is precisely what he is doing  now. President Bush is providing a very valuable public service to the  American people at what is a very considerable cost but happens to be a  nonpublic expense. He is expediting the review process and making sure  that the Senate has all of the documents it needs to conduct a timely  and efficient confirmation process. President Bush and his legal team  should be thanked, not scorned, for providing this tremendous service  to the American people.    I want to tell you how much on top of this former President Bush was.  On the day after Kavanaugh's nomination, he called me and said: I want  to do everything I can to cooperate so you get all of the records you  need to make sure that you give a fair and thorough hearing to  Kavanaugh.   Thanks to these people, we have Judge Kavanaugh's papers in time to  hold a confirmation hearing and to vote this very year just as the  American people expect us to do.   Democratic leaders have played up this phony document controversy to  deflect attention from Judge Kavanaugh's extraordinary qualifications  and sterling reputation as a judge of 12 years on the second most  important court in this land. In his 12 years on the bench, the Supreme  Court has on 13 occasions adopted legal opinions from Judge Kavanaugh's  opinions. This is an exemplary track record in the Supreme Court--to  have one's opinions backed up by the Supreme Court not once but 13  times.   Judge Kavanaugh is dedicated to judicial independence. He is not  afraid to tell another branch of government when that branch has  exceeded its lawful authority. At the same time, he has great respect  for the separation of powers, and he will interpret the law as it is  written by the people's representatives in Congress, instead of trying  to be a superlegislator. As I am, I hope all of my colleagues are  looking forward to hearing from Judge Kavanaugh when he will appear  before the Judiciary Committee on September 4.   I yield the floor.
