 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senator Lankford and Senator Hawley.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senators Daines,  Lankford, and Hawley is for counsel for the President:         Over the past 244 years, eight judges have been removed       from office by the U.S. Senate but never a President. The       eight judges have been removed for bribery, perjury, tax       evasion, waging war against the United States, and other       unlawful actions. How do the current impeachment articles       differ from previous convictions and removals by the Senate?    Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief Justice, there is an enormous  difference between impeaching and removing a judge, even a justice, and  impeaching and removing a President. No judge, not even a Chief  Justice, is the judicial branch. You are the head of the judicial  branch, but there is a judicial branch.   The President is the executive branch. He is irreplaceable. There  isn't always a Vice President. Remember, we had a period of time when  there was no Vice President. We needed a constitutional amendment.   So there is no comparison between impeaching a judge and impeaching a  President. Moreover, there is a textual difference. The Constitution  provides that judges serve during good behavior. That is the  Congressman Schiff standard, and it is a great standard. We wish  everybody served only during good behavior. But the Constitution  doesn't say that the President shall serve during good behavior. The  big difference is the President runs every 4 years, and the public gets  to judge his good behavior. Judges don't run, and so there is only one  judge of the good behavior; namely, the impeachment process.   So to make a comparison is to make the same mistake that when people  compare the British system to the American system. We have heard a lot  of argument that we adopted the British system by adopting five words:  ``other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Yes, those words may have been  borrowed from Great Britain, but the whole concept of impeachment was  not. First of all, impeachment no longer exists in Great Britain; but  when it did, it only operated for low-level and middle-level people.  All the impeachment trials that have been cited involve this guy in  India, this guy in the commerce, this guy here, this guy there--utterly  replaceable people.   In the British system, on the other hand, you can get rid of the head  of state--the head of government, rather, by a simple vote of no  confidence. That is what the Framers rejected. The Framers rejected  that for a President. And so the notion that we borrowed the British  system has it exactly backward. We rejected the British system.   We did not want a President to serve at the pleasure of the  legislature. We wanted the President to serve at the pleasure of the  voters.   Judges don't serve at the pleasure of the voters, so there needs to  be different criteria and broader criteria, and those criteria have  been used in practice. For the most part, judges have been impeached  for criminal and removed for criminal behavior.   But take an example that was given. If a judge is completely drunk  and incapacitated and cannot do his job, it is easy to imagine how a  judge might have to be removed for that.   But the President--there is an amendment to the Constitution, the  25th Amendment, specifically provided because there was a gap in the  Constitution. And, please, Members of the Senate, it is important to  understand, your role is not to fill gaps that the Framers deliberately  left open.   Good arguments have been made: Why is it important to make sure  people don't abuse their power, people don't commit maladministration?  But the Framers left open, left those gaps. Your job is not to fill in  the gaps. Your job is to apply the Constitution as the Framers wrote  it, and that doesn't include abuse of power and obstruction of  Congress.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Delaware.
