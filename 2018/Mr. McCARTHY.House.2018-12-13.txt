 Mr. Speaker, I first want to begin by thanking my  friend. Today could be our last scheduled colloquy together.   Over the years, we have had many spirited debates on this floor. We  have celebrated moments of cooperation, from tackling the opioid  epidemic to fighting human trafficking to leveling tough sanctions on  American adversaries. As my friend knows, most of what we do in this  Chamber is bipartisan.   A study by Quorum found that the 115th Congress enacted the highest  percentage of bipartisan bills of any Congress in the last 20 years.  That success could not have happened without a lot of working across  the aisle to find common ground.   Now, beyond legislation, I look forward to continuing to work with my  friend on our shared passion for a more efficient, effective, and  accountable government through events like Congressional Hackathon.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I  thank him for those kind words.   There are other things we also did on this floor. We have also  mourned during times of grief, including our colloquy just 1 day after  the shooting at the GOP baseball practice.   Those moments of shared humanity reflect the very best that this  House has to offer. And, yes, we have had our share of debates--debates  over policy, over politics, and how to make the country better. But I  have always known my friend to be a man of integrity and a fair and  honest broker.   And although his questions were rarely confined to the schedule for  the week to come, I have actually grown to enjoy these colloquies.  Because no matter the subject, these colloquies represent some of the  last true debate that occurs in this Chamber. So while the transcripts  of what we say one day will fade, I wish my friend well as he carries  forward this rich legacy of debate on the basis of mutual respect in  the people's House, and I know he will.   Mr. Speaker, my friend knows I love metrics, so here are a few final  stats. On average, our weekly colloquy this year has lasted 42\1/2\  minutes. I apologize to the House recordkeepers and to the Members  trying to give 1-minute speeches like they are today. The shortest was  8 minutes, and the longest lasted more than an hour.   Mr. Speaker, today will likely be on the shorter end, because our  schedule for next week remains fluid and subject to change.  Conversations are currently ongoing between the House, Senate, and the  White House. In the meantime, Members should be on standby and prepared  to return to Washington for votes next week. We will provide advance  notice ahead of any expected votes.   As of today, I would estimate first votes for the week to occur at  6:30 p.m. next Wednesday. I would encourage all Members to make the  necessary arrangements to be here as we complete our work for the 115th  Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. That is completely  accurate. So we will have votes 6:30 Wednesday night, and we will  finish our work to make sure our government continues to move forward.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for the question. I also  thank my friend for coming back to where he originally was years ago.  Earlier in this Congress, it was not his belief that shutting the  government down was bad, and I am thankful that he learned that lesson,  because I didn't think it was helpful when he shut the government down  over immigration last time. Nobody did. America didn't, and we had to  put it back to work.   Now, my friend is correct that we have enacted 75 percent of the  discretionary budget into law already. I think all Members should take  pride in that, even if one side voted ``no'' the majority of times.  That is because that is better than any Congress has been able to do in  nearly 25 years. So, obviously, 25 percent remains.   My friend is correct, there are 12 days left. We did not want to be  here with 12 days left. Unfortunately, we had the passing of President  Bush.   Now, President Bush--there is a legacy to lead. He found a way to  find compromise. My friend on the other side says there is six of the  seven we agree with, but I can't compromise on the seventh. He says  that the American public wants to make sure it stays open. Yeah, we do,  too. The American public also wants to make sure we are safe.   So I think, in the spirit of the season, of the time, we should come  to an agreement, knowing that neither side will get everything that  they want. One side wants nothing to happen. The other side wants a  certain number. I think we can find common ground. I think we could get  it all done next week, and it is really my intention and belief that we  will have that vote on this floor, that we can find common ground, keep  the government open--I am very thankful that he believes in that again,  as we do, and that we finish the job the American public asks for. And  when we finish that job, America is stronger, safer, and on a footing  to make sure we continue to lead for the 21st century.    Not into law.    One by one?    I like your calendar.    You said Wednesday.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. I  appreciate my friend's comment. I appreciate that he told us that  people on his side of the aisle want to have border security.   Then why don't we do the job? Why would we finish a year to settle  for mediocrity?   My friend also said that he had passed all the appropriations bills,  but they never were enacted into law. The most ever done in the last 25  years is what we did this Congress, because of the Senate and the 60  votes. That is why you had Leader Schumer over there at the same time,  because Democrats control whether we keep this government open or shut  down. They have shown that power before, just as they have done earlier  in this Congress.   Now, my friend knows that he wants this country protected. I agree  with him 100 percent. I do not challenge his belief on the protection  of this country.   I hope my friend also knows that, on that border, they catch, on  average, 10 known terrorists a day.   Homeland security is not like any other appropriations. It is not one  we just set aside because we disagree with it. This country has known  the damage of setting something aside and not paying attention to the  warning signs. I think we are better than that.   Yeah, it might be uncomfortable. We might have to work a little  harder. We are going to stay here a little later than we all planned to  be, but there were other circumstances that caused that.   I think let's do all seven. Let's get them all done. Let's end on a  high note. And it will probably make your job a little easier in the  next Congress as well. You won't have to worry about it.   But, in doing so, I think we are both going to have to do something.  We are both going to have to look the American public in the eye, and  we both made our arguments of what we wanted. But we are going to have  to accept that you and I are not going to get 100 percent of what we  want.   I will make this pledge to you right now: I am willing to find some  common ground. What that means is, the common ground is, we don't leave  until we get this done.   Now, your vote has been funding the wall. You voted for that before.  I don't know if you have changed your position on that now. But what we  are asking for is border security. That means more than just that.   I think there is a window, and I think the American public expects it  to get done. I would hate to leave and go home and say, oh, I finished  the majority of everything, but that homeland security, that one that  keeps our constituents safe, that one that looks around for whatever  can happen to us in any part of this country, in so many places, we  just did what we did last year.   You know that harms the agency. You know that holds them back. And I  can't look at somebody's face that maybe loses a loved one because  something happens in the future because I wanted to leave, because I  couldn't find compromise.   Mr. Speaker, I will make that promise. I will find common ground, and  I will take as long as it does inside any room to make that happen,  that we do not leave this Congress without funding all and making sure  homeland is not living under the same rules that they had before. When  they know it is a changing society, it is also a changing place for  those who want to do us harm.   What a CR does is locks them in these continuing resolutions that  they can't do something new, when they have found that new technology  to protect us throughout the homeland.   So I want to find common ground. I want to protect America. I want to  make us safer, and I want to make us stronger. And I make that  commitment to you, sir, that we can get it done.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I respect my friend. I even follow my friend on  Instagram. And today is Thursday, and I almost feel like he is throwing  a Throwback Thursday up, because now he calls a shutdown stupid.   But in this Congress, that is not what he did. In this Congress, he  actually whipped to have a shutdown. I did think it was stupid then,  and I think going into a shutdown is stupid now. That is why I want to  solve the problem.   Mr. Speaker, my friend says: Can we make the border better? Yes. He  keeps talking about the wall. I just talk about security.   When he described what is happening along the border, it was  interesting, the words he chose. He said there were ``some people''  down there. I am sure the rest of America has watched what has gone on  down there, gone on down there before it even got into Mexico, where  they broke down their wall and came across, where they stormed and they  threw things at our Border Patrol.   I think the border could be more secure. I know my friend lives in  Maryland, but to those of us who live in a border State, maybe we  understand this a little differently.   Now, I am the first one who believes in legal immigration. This has  nothing to do with it. This is about keeping the country safe. And if  two sides cannot sit down to solve a fundamental problem, it is bad for  the country.   There is a check and balance, as the gentleman well knows. There is a  House; there is a Senate; and then there is an administration, a  President, who either signs or vetoes a bill.   The gentleman started the conversation earlier very proud of the fact  that he passed all 12 bills. We have done that before, too. The test is  really the final end, does it get all the way there?   We are 75 percent there. Twenty-five percent should not stop us, and  we should be able to get it done.   But in the gentleman's quest of talking about passing all 12 bills,  they didn't become law. Why? Because of the Senate and the 60 votes  there.    Mr. Speaker, no, I am not. I was here. The gentleman  shut down the government.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman voted. He whipped.    Mr. Speaker, here, yes.    Mr. Speaker, yes.    Mr. Speaker, my plan to do that is I need 60 votes in  the Senate.    Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I do not want the gentleman to get more  Pinocchios, because that is not true. We have brought two major  immigration reform bills to this floor, and not one person on the other  side of the aisle voted for either.   My friend knows the hours that we have spent in our office discussing  with everybody trying to come to an agreement, but we had two on this  floor.    Mr. Speaker, no, we did not.    Mr. Speaker, because between those two bills, the  gentleman held all of his Members to vote ``no,'' the same way he did  with taxes, the same way he did with children's health, the same way he  did on many other elements.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, he doesn't want to work with us. I guess the plan is to  go back to what the motto of the gentleman had been earlier in this  Congress.   The gentleman says it is hard to pass bills here. What is  interesting, in that same Quorum study, more bills have passed this  House and this Congress than any in modern history. So, yes, we pass  bills. We even do it when the gentleman's side tries to hold back.   So when the children were worried about their health insurance and he  held back, we did not. When we worried about growing the economy, when  he held back, we did not. When he worried about trying to shut the  government down, we kept moving forward.   When we wanted to solve the immigration problem, yes, we had two  different bills; yes, it takes 218; and, yes, we had more than the 225  votes on either of those bills--you just had 218 on one. But there  wasn't one on the other side, even though there were people on the  other side of the aisle who would come to me and tell me they wanted to  [[Page H10188]]  vote for these bills but their own leadership twisted their arms and  said they could not.   Now, yes, were there struggles at times and do we have different  factions within the Conference? Yes, we do. But if I were the  gentleman, I would watch my words, because I am going to look forward  to seeing how well he does with the new faction coming in on his side.    Mr. Speaker, it will be quite interesting to watch.   I know my struggles. I hope the gentleman doesn't have the same  struggles, but I will make this promise to the gentleman: When we  agree, I will be there.   We do not have differences because we have parties; we have parties  because we have differences.   The gentleman's challenge is he continues to bring up the wall. The  question would be, then: Does border security work? Having a wall a  part of that security, does it help?   Coming from a State that borders Mexico, we put a wall, which the  gentleman had voted for, down in San Diego. You know what the results  were? A 92 percent drop in illegals coming across. We built a wall in  Tucson, down 90 percent; El Paso, 95 percent.   At one time, El Paso was one of the most dangerous cities in America.  Now, today, it is one of the safest, and it has been able to live with  that.   Yuma, down 95 percent.   So the question is: What is the plan? The plan and the hope, yes, we  will take a bill up. But my hope was that, in the spirit of the season,  it wouldn't be the gentleman's way or no way, that he would break from  this tradition that Republicans have to pass everything on their own.   Look, I put a bill in that I fully fund the wall at $25 billion. I  know I am not going to get that. Am I going to run away and say, then,  I am going to vote for nothing? No, because that is not the way our  government works.   You see, we have to have compromise because of the structure. And I  don't want to have a plan where I am going to sit up here as majority  leader and say, oh, I passed all the bills, but none of them became  law.   I want to make law. I want to solve the problem.   Listen, this is not the time to continue to go through and argue.  This is the time to solve the problems. Look, the campaign is over.    Mr. Speaker, do you know what the solution is? Sit down  with us and come to a compromise, not that it is his way or no way.   Mr. Speaker, let me ask the gentleman a question.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has already voted for  funding of the wall. So my question is: Democrats had to vote for it  with 60, the gentleman voted for it on here to fund the wall. Is the  gentleman now saying he does not want to fund any of the wall going  forward?    Mr. Speaker, no. I am not one who shuts the government  down. We went through that.    Mr. Speaker, I thought that was the gentleman's quote  from our Congress earlier.   So I don't hold people to what they go through. I realize all the  time we had these colloquies before, all the time I studied the history  in here, the gentleman always said a shutdown was bad. I quoted back to  him numerous times where he had told me that all the way through these.  But when the day came in this Congress, he changed his ways. He thought  a shutdown was right. I am thankful that he changed. That quote could  have been his quote just in this Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I think we might be hitting our average for how long  this colloquy goes.    Mr. Speaker, we should debate ideas; but if the idea  is, ``What is your plan?'' it wasn't my plan that we had to do it  alone. If we have to, we have proven we have done that before. He knows  it will go on to the Senate.   But if my friend has changed his belief, I don't hold it against him.  He might have changed his belief. Or maybe his belief always was that  we should have no border security. I don't know.   My friend did acknowledge that there was a great number of people who  were trying to get into our country and storming the gates. That is not  all the bill. The bill is border security and homeland security.   If the idea is it has to just be a CR or they can't deal with it, do  you know what my plan has been all along? It is to work with the  gentleman. But I am not hearing that he is even willing to work with  us, that I am saying I am willing to.   Compromise. He has already voted for part of border security to be a  wall. He doesn't even want to sit down and discuss how much should that  be, how much border security should we have.   Is 10 terrorists a day coming across the border okay with the  gentleman? Because it is not with me.   Is 2,000 inadmissible people coming across? Is that okay with the  gentleman? It is not with me. It takes away from those, like our own  relatives, who come here legally.   I was at a naturalization just a few months ago. I sat there inside  this service. I watched individuals with such pride raising their hand.  And do you know what I told them? George Washington is now their  founding father; Abraham Lincoln was their liberator; Martin Luther  King spoke of their dreams; and the flag that sits on the Moon is their  flag today. And I want them to be safe.  [[Page H10189]]                                     time  1200    And I don't know what those terrorists have planned when they come  across the border, or when those people storm the gates. But I do know  we have a responsibility--that I can't get everything I want--a  responsibility that we find security, and that we protect our own  border security at the same time.   I think there is a window that we can do this. I don't want to do it  alone. So my plan was to do it with the gentleman. If he is saying to  me he can't, then I am going to have to change my plan, just as we had  to do when it came to the children's health insurance. We were not  going to let that lapse. Just as it happened when you were going to  shut the government down over DACA; we weren't going to let that  happen.   We believe the government should stay open. So that is my plan. Will  you join with us? Will you make sure that we don't shut down? Will you  make sure that we make America stronger and safer for the future?   I don't want to leave work for the gentleman to get done. He is  excited about his majority. I want him to be successful. I may smile  for the challenge that he is going to have with some people I see  coming in, and I will be right over here to debate where we disagree;  but when we agree, I will be right there with him, and I will find  compromise in every part I can.   I think this is a window to show--even to all those new freshmen,  even to those who are leaving and these could be some of their last  votes--that we did the very best with the moments that we had for the  future of this country.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of the season, I have a  little gift for the gentleman from Maryland. It comes from a little  shop in my hometown, family-owned. They are excited about what we have  been able to do this Congress. It is a little candy that might sweeten  his spirit, and he might even be more likely to work with us to solve  the problem.   Merry Christmas.
