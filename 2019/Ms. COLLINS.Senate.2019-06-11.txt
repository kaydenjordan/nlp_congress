 Mr. President, along with my colleagues, Senators Jacky  Rosen, Martha McSally, and Amy Klobuchar, I am introducing the Stamp  Out Elder Abuse Act of 2019, a bill that seeks to help combat the abuse  and financial exploitation of our Nation's seniors. Our bill would  create a semipostal, or fundraising, stamp that would allow Postal  Service customers to make a voluntary contribution to raise awareness  and combat elder abuse by purchasing this special stamp.   The proceeds from this stamp would go to the Department of Health and  Human Service's (HHS) Administration on Community Living (ACL) and the  Department of Justice (DOJ). The funding would allow the ACL to further  support the development and advancement of emerging practices to  prevent and respond to the abuse of older adults, and would assist DOJ  in improving prosecution, data collection, litigation support, and  initiatives that prevent elder abuse. Notably, this bill would help to  provide needed additional revenue to tackle elder abuse without costing  the Federal government a single penny.   Abuse of older Americans is sadly prevalent--no matter the person's  gender, race, religion, or ethnic or cultural background. Each year,  hundreds of thousands of adults over the age of 60 are abused,  neglected, or financially exploited. Abuse can happen in many places,  including a person's home, a family member's house, an assisted living  facility, or a nursing home. Just as abuse can occur in various  settings, there are many types of elder abuse, including physical  abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, abandonment, and  financial exploitation, to name a few. Although there are different  types of abuse, it is common for a victim to experience more than one  form of abuse.   According to the National Council on Aging, approximately one in ten  Americans aged 60 years old or older have experienced some form of  elder abuse. According to the GAO, financial fraud targeting older  Americans is a growing epidemic that costs seniors an estimated $2.9  billion annually. We know, however, that the true number is probably  much higher since many of these cases are never reported because the  victim is too often embarrassed to report abuse, particularly when it  involves a family member. In fact, the National Center on Elder Abuse  reports that only one in 14 cases are reported to the authorities.   In Maine--the State with the oldest population by median age--an  estimated 33,000 seniors each year are the victims of some kind of  abuse or financial fraud. Moreover, in as many as 90 percent of  financial cases, the senior is victimized by someone he or she knows  well. A 2017 report of financial exploitation of Maine's older adults  found that in most cases, financial exploitation is perpetrated by a  family member, typically the victim's own adult child.   In a recent case in Maine, police charged a pastor in York County,  Maine, with exploiting an incapacitated elderly woman. They say the man  befriended the woman while he was volunteering at the assisted-living  community where she lived. According to police, the State determined  the woman to be incapacitated and assigned her a guardian and  conservator. The pastor allegedly took the woman to her bank, withdrew  money to have the locks changed on her former home, which had been on  the market, and he took down the ``for sale'' sign.   Police say the pastor told the woman he would help her return to her  house, even though it was not equipped for the wheelchair access she  required. He suggested his daughter could live with the woman to care  for her. Police say his goal was to ingratiate himself and have access  to this woman's financial accounts and property. Fortunately, in this  case, the conservator, who was legally responsible for protecting the  [[Page S3324]]  woman's assets, identified and reported the suspected criminal activity  to the police.   Combatting elder abuse of seniors is primarily the responsibility of  State and local agencies, particularly adult protective services  agencies. Prevention and response to cases of abuse require coordinated  efforts, including State and local agencies, law enforcement, the  social work and medical community, and financial institutions.   The Federal government also plays an important role in providing  leadership to combat this problem. The Elder Justice Coordinating  Council, led by HHS and DOJ, has brought other Federal agencies to the  table to coordinate efforts to protect older individuals from abuse.  Last year, the DOJ took a major action by directing all 94 U.S.  Attorneys' offices to each designate an elder justice coordinator, who  will develop strategies to protect seniors in their districts. This  will promote greater cooperation between the DOJ and its law  enforcement partners. While the best way to intervene in the problem of  elder abuse is to prevent it from happening in the first place, when  abuse does occur, it is crucial that the perpetrators of the crimes not  go unpunished.   I worked closely on the Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act of 2019 with Philip  C. Marshall. Philip is the founder of Beyond Brooke, a campaign named  to honor Philip's late grandmother, Brooke Astor, a well known  philanthropist, recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and  victim of elder abuse and financial exploitation. In 2015, Mr. Marshall  testified before the Senate Aging Committee about how his father  mistreated his grandmother and mismanaged her assets while she suffered  from Alzheimer's disease. In addition, I am pleased that the non- partisan Elder Justice Coalition, which represents more than 3,000  members, along with the National Center for Victims of Crime, the  National Sheriffs Association, and the National Association on Area  Agencies on Aging all support our bill.   Mr. President, I ask that letters from these organizations appear in  the Record immediately following my remarks.   Preventing and combating elder abuse require law enforcement and  social service agencies at all levels of government to work  collaboratively with the private sector. The Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act  would assist the Federal government's role to help make that happen. I  urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                    The Elder Justice Coalition,                                      Washington, DC, June 11, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Chairman, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Collins: On behalf of the nonpartisan Elder       Justice Coalition which represents more than 3,000 members, I       write to congratulate you and Senators Rosen, McSally, and       Klobuchar on the introduction of the Stamp Out Elder Abuse       Act of 2019, which will create a semi-postal stamp to provide       additional funding to the federal government for programs to       address elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The EJC is       proud to have worked closely on this legislation with you,       your staff and Philip C. Marshall, founder of Beyond Brooke,       a cause-based campaign named to honor Philip's late       grandmother, Brooke Astor, who was a well-known       philanthropist, recipient of the Presidential Medal of       Freedom, and a victim of elder abuse and elder financial       exploitation.        We are pleased that the bill will direct the United States       Postal Service to develop the semipostal stamp and use the       proceeds from its sales to provide funding to augment the       elder justice initiatives at both the Administration on Aging       in the Department of Health and Human Services and at the       Department of Justice. These programs include prevention,       education, data collection, services to protect and support       victims, and demonstration projects, in addition to       initiatives to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of       elder abuse and financial exploitation. Further, the       departments will be able to use their resources to support       dissemination of the stamp.        Thank you again for your leadership on this and other elder       justice issues. Please let us know if we can be of assistance       in securing passage of the Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act of 2019.            Sincerely,                                                Robert B. Blancato,      National Coordinator.                                   ____                                             The National Center for                                                Victims of Crime,                                        Arlington, VA, May 23, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Chairman, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Collins: As the Executive Director of the       National Center for Victims of Crime which advocates for       stronger rights, protections, and services for all crime       victims and the advocates who serve them. I write to       congratulate you on the introduction of the Stamp Out Elder       Abuse Act of 2019, which will create a semi-postal stamp to       provide additional funding to the federal government for       programs to address elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation.

Mai Fernandez,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                   National Sheriffs' Association,                                       Alexandria, VA, June 3, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Sheriffs'       Association (NSA) and the more than 3,000 elected sheriffs       nationwide, I write to endorse the Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act       of 2019 proposed by Senator Collins. This Act initiates a       semi postal stamp that not only raises elder abuse awareness,       but also dedicates the proceeds to elder justice programs       within DOJ and HHS.        As you may know, the NSA was one of the founding groups in       the National Association of Triads, Inc. National Triads       serves as a clearinghouse of information, best practices and       early alert system for local Triads. Triad is a national       community policing concept that partners law enforcement       agencies with older adult volunteer groups and older adult       related community services to educate older adults on crime       and fraud, to reduce crime against the elderly, and eliminate       the unwarranted fear of crime.        After twenty-two years in existence, there are Triads in       more than 680 counties in 36 states. Triad serves 16 million       seniors nationwide--nearly half of America's senior       population. The National Sheriffs' Association and local       sheriffs have long recognized the need to ensure the safety       and quality of life for the growing number of senior citizens       by supporting the formation of community partnerships under       the auspice of Triad. Triad has a clear vision and a simple       mission--to keep seniors safe from crime.        The Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act of 2019 makes a clear effort       to increase awareness and support for the elderly community.       We applaud the efforts to support prevention and education,       investigation and prosecution, and victims' services in an       effort in combat elder abuse.            Sincerely,                                              Jonathan F.
