 Mr. President, Iowans recall the derecho that tore  through parts of our State in 2020. The storm hit alongside the COVID- 19 pandemic, when communities faced unprecedented challenges, including  stalled school meal programs. Such unforeseen events can disrupt  communities. Individuals like Michael Rojas of Polk County step up-- often on a moment's notice and without pause--to keep that from  happening.   Mr. Rojas helped lead FEMA's response to the 2020 derecho, putting to  work his expertise from a prior post with Iowa's Habitat for Humanity,  where he dealt with tornado and flood damage. During the pandemic, he  spearheaded critical plans to address food insecurity in our State.  Today, he is a disaster program officer with Volunteer Iowa, which  facilitates opportunities for local nonprofits and nearby residents to  engage in projects with impacts close to home.   Iowans who cross paths with Mr. Rojas undoubtedly know his  selflessness, ingenuity, and efficacy. By honoring Mr. Rojas on a  national scale with its Excellence in Disaster Services Leadership  Award, AmeriCorps seems to have hit the nail on the head. I  congratulate Mr. Rojas on this well-earned recognition and thank him  for his continued, exemplary service to Iowa.                            ____________________
