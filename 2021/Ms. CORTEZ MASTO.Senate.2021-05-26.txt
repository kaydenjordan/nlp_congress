 Madam President, I rise to recognize the  graduating class from the Kirk Kerkorian School of Medicine at the  University of Nevada, Las Vegas. This is an incredible milestone in the  school and university's history, as well as for Southern Nevada. Fifty  students who began their studies 4 years ago as the charter class of  medical students had their degree of medical doctor MD, conferred  earlier this month on May 7, 2021.   For Southern Nevada, this is a pinnacle achievement because until  now, Las Vegas was the largest metropolitan area in the Nation without  an MD-  [[Page S3499]]  granting medical school. Nevada has grown exponentially over the past  few decades, and the number of physicians has not kept pace in our  communities. Nevada ranks 45th in the Nation for the number of active  physicians per 100,000 residents and comes in 48th for primary care  physicians and 50th for general surgeons. Making this graduating class  all the more exceptional, 18 of the 50 newly minted physicians plan on  staying in the Silver State for their residency.   Many of these graduates no doubt had some assumptions of what the  beginning of their lifelong medical journey might look like when they  began, and few could have anticipated what these past 4 years have  brought. From the COVID-19 pandemic and before that, the Route 91  Harvest festival mass shooting in 2017, these graduates have mourned  with their community, risen to the challenges, and proven just what it  means to be battle-born. This is an incredible moment for Nevada, the  University of Nevada, Las Vegas, our communities, and these dedicated  graduates and their families.   I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this  achievement.                            ____________________
