 Mr. President, I want to thank my friend, former  roommate, and colleague in leadership for, as usual, his articulate and  on-the-money remarks about the tax bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we have a long to-do list before the end  of the year, and time is running short. We had hoped to make progress  with the administration on these issues in a meeting this afternoon.  Unfortunately, this morning, instead of leading, the President tweeted  a blatantly inaccurate statement and then concluded: ``I don't see a  deal.'' The President said: ``I don't see a deal'' three hours before  our meeting, before he heard anything we had to say.   Given that the President doesn't see a deal between Democrats and the  White House, Leader Pelosi and I believe the best path forward is to  continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress,  instead. Rather than going to the White House for a show meeting that  will not result in an agreement from a President who doesn't see a  deal, we have asked Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan to meet with us  this afternoon.   We don't have any time to waste addressing the issues that confront  us. So we are going to negotiate with Republican leaders who may  actually be interested in reaching a bipartisan agreement. If the  President, who already earlier this year said that ``our country needs  a good shutdown,'' isn't interested in addressing the difficult-year  agenda and wants to make the government shut down, we will work with  those Republicans who are interested in funding the government, as we  did in April.   We have so many things to do. We have to fund the government. We have  DACA. We have the Children's Health Insurance Program. We must  reinstate cost sharing for health premiums and out-of-pocket costs. We  have to deal with disasters. We have to fund our defense and our  nondefense sides of the government in a reasonable way. There is so  much to do. We are eager to get that done in a bipartisan way.  Obviously the President isn't, but hopefully Leader McConnell and  Speaker Ryan are, and we look forward to sitting down with them to  resolve this in an amicable way, as we did in April. When the President  wasn't involved, we got it done.                            ____________________     On the Republican tax bill, we are only a few days away  from a final vote, but from all reports, the Republicans are still  debating significant changes to the text of the bill. Some are angling  for a change to the passthrough provisions, feeling that a gargantuan  new tax loophole for many high-income individuals needs to be widened  even further. Right now, it is reported that 70 percent of these  passthroughs go to the top 1 percent. The changes that are being  proposed would make it even worse.   Help small business, yes. Don't open a giant loophole for wealthy  hedge funds, big-shot law firms, and lobbyists. We don't need that.   Others are rightly worried about the impact this bill would have on  the deficit and debt. What I would remind my Republican colleagues is  that, with any more changes, it is virtually certain you will be voting  on a bill without any expert analysis of its impacts; you will be  voting without any estimate of whether it will grow or shrink the  economy; you will be voting without a good sense of the long-term  impacts of the changes you are making to the Tax Code.   Certainly, 1 week of markup in the Finance Committee, with only one  expert witness, is not a satisfactory process, particularly considering  the changing nature of this bill. Changing the Tax Code in broad brush  is a difficult thing. There are so many unintended consequences.   If our Republican colleagues should pass this bill and it becomes  law--and I hope it won't--week after week, we are going to find new  things in this bill--some intended, some not intended. The people who  voted for it are going to regret it. The public will ask: Why didn't  you know? With a tax bill, it is impossible to know all these things  unless you let it sit out there in the Sun and bake so that people,  experts from around the country--there are tens of thousands of tax  lawyers paid to figure out ways around our Tax Code and help the  wealthy, who are their clients. Unless you examine the bill carefully  in sunlight, unless you have a lot of hearings, unless you hear from  all kinds of witnesses, the result is usually quite bad for America,  with so many unintended consequences.   Our Republican colleagues, in their rush to get a bill done, are  legislating in an irresponsible way, especially when it comes to  something as important and complex as the Tax Code. If the product were  a great one, that would be one thing. We all know this is not a great  product. We don't even hear our Republican colleagues bragging about  this product, with a few exceptions. Everyone says this could be  better, that could be better.   Every independent analysis has shown that the tax bill will end up  raising taxes on millions of middle-class families, despite the early  intentions of the President and Republican leaders. The Tax Policy  Center estimates that 60 percent of middle-class families will see a  tax increase--60 percent of middle-class families will see a tax  increase--by the time the bill is fully implemented, while folks making  over $1 million a year would get an average tax cut of over $40,000.   Some would say: Well, they are making more money; they should get a  bigger tax break. No. I would like to take every dollar of that $40,000  a millionaire gets and give it to the middle class. They are the ones  who need the help, not the wealthy people. They are the ones who buy  the products and keep the economy humming. They are the ones who,  throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, created the best economy  America has ever had, not just the few millionaires. It is astounding.   If the President and Republicans in Congress set out to pass a  middle-class tax cut, as they claim--if that is where they set out,  this bill completely misses the mark. Meanwhile, the big winners--big  corporations, the very wealthy--are doing great already. Estates worth  over $11 million get a tax break? Why is that? Why is that, when  average middle-class people are struggling? Corporations get a  permanent reduction in their rates, while individual tax breaks expire  after a few years. The bill would even open up drilling in the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge because this tax bill wouldn't be complete  unless they help Big Oil too.   All of this to saddle the next generation of Americans with larger  deficits, even larger debt--something many of my friends on the other  side of the aisle have labored against their whole  [[Page S7341]]  careers. We have heard so many speeches from the other side about  deficit reduction. I think my colleagues were sincere. Why are they  abandoning it now?   Every one of our colleagues knows that we could do a lot better job  in a tax bill at reducing the deficit than we have here. From the very  beginning, Democrats have told our Republican colleagues that we want  to work with them on tax reform, we want to lower taxes on the middle  class, we want to reduce burdens on small businesses, we want to erase  the incentives that send jobs overseas and bring jobs back home, and we  want to do all these things in a way that doesn't add to the deficit.   From the very beginning, Republicans have said to us: We are not  interested in working with you. We are going to draft it ourselves and  use reconciliation so we don't need your votes, and you can vote for  our bill if you want.   That is not bipartisanship, what the Republican leadership has done.   I know there are some Republicans on the other side who wish we could  work together. Well, we can. Today at 11 a.m., I think more than a  dozen--certainly a large number of Democrats went to the Press Gallery  and said: We want to work with our Republican colleagues to create a  better bill.   They came and visited me last night. I encouraged them to do it. This  leader--this leader--is not going to stand in the way of bipartisan  reform that meets the goals we have talked about: helping the middle  class, reducing the deficit, not unduly or in any way aiding the 1  percent.   Bipartisanship and compromise are very possible on tax reform. It is  an issue crying out for a bipartisan solution. There are a lot of areas  in which we agree. We have to work to find a middle ground that is  acceptable to both parties. I daresay it would be a better bill for the  American middle-class than the one we are looking at right now.                            ____________________     Finally and briefly, Mr. President, because I know my  colleagues are waiting, on the Katsas nomination, the DC Circuit is  often called the second most powerful court in the Nation because it  adjudicates so many highly charged political issues, including cases  that deal with the limits of Executive power and regulations issued by  Federal agencies. As examples, major cases on climate regulations, the  CFPB, and gun safety laws in the District of Columbia are now before  that court. On such a court, we should prize independence and  moderation and look warily at candidates with highly political  backgrounds.   Unfortunately, Gregory Katsas has been intimately involved in a  number of the most partisan and legally dubious Executive orders of the  current administration. He was involved in the President's  controversial travel ban, his decisions to terminate DACA, to end  transgender service in the military, and to establish an election  integrity commission based on the lie that 3.5 million people voted  illegally in the last election.   His tenure and views in the Trump administration raise important  questions about his independence and moderation, particularly on a  court that will likely hear cases related to the very same issues he  worked on in the White House. He appears to be another example of the  Republican majority pushing judges from a political extreme of their  party as a way of advancing their interests in lieu of a legislative  agenda, which has floundered.   I will vote no on his nomination and urge all of my colleagues to do  the same.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
