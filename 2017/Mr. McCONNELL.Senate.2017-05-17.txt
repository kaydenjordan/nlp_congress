 Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted to confirm  Jeffrey Rosen as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation. In a couple of  hours, we will take a cloture vote to advance another well-qualified  nominee, Rachel Brand, to serve as the Associate Attorney General.   Rachel Brand's impressive background includes experience clerking for  Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, and she has already been  confirmed by the Senate twice before. She is ``extraordinarily  talented,'' as Chairman Grassley noted at her hearing, and ``dedicated  to the full and even-handed enforcement of our laws.''   Ms. Brand also has the support of a bipartisan group of former senior  officials at the Justice Department, including Jamie Gorelick and Seth  Waxman, who, in a recent letter on her behalf, cited her ``stellar  reputation for . . . integrity, legal skills, and respect for the  law.''   As they pointed out, Ms. Brand's extensive private and public sector  experience would serve her well as the Associate Attorney General. They  also noted she would be a ``trusted leader in the Department.'' I look  forward to advancing her nomination later this morning.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, as I outlined last  week, during the Obama years, the American people struggled with an  economy that failed to meet its potential. It had the slowest recovery  since World War II, the middle class losing its historic status as the  majority in our country, too many out of a job and looking for work,  too many giving up after years of fruitless searching, too many  fortunate just to have a paycheck but not one large enough to keep pace  with ever-rising health costs and energy bills. This is the Obama  legacy on the economy.   Over 8 long years of failed leftwing policies on everything from  regulations to taxes, a Democratic administration put on a virtual  clinic in how not to get an economy moving again. No wonder the  American people opted for a pro-growth direction in November.   Ever since, this Republican Congress has been working to get our  economy moving again and spur job creation. Rather than bury our  economy in an avalanche of redtape, like the last administration, it is  time for a new direction on regulations--smarter and pro-growth.  Already, we have taken action to kick-start those efforts, like passing  important legislation to provide relief from Obama-era midnight  regulations.   Rather than make our Tax Code more complex like the last  administration, we think it is time for a new direction on taxes-- simpler and pro-jobs. Passing tax reform legislation would mark a major  achievement in bringing us closer to that goal. This Republican  Congress and this administration made it a priority from the very  start. Over the years, many of our Democratic friends have also  expressed the view that we need tax reform.   For years, it has been clear that we should help American workers by  reforming our outdated and convoluted tax system, which currently  discourages investment here in America and deters companies from  growing, creating jobs, and increasing wages.   For years, it has been clear that we should remove a huge drag on job  creation by reforming our overly complex and punitive tax system, which  currently undercuts employers that want to expand with new investments,  jobs, wages, and employee benefits.   For years, it has been clear we should make taxes simpler and lower  for both businesses and individuals; that we should strive for a tax  code that works for American families and for American businesses,  rather than working against them. This year, we finally have the  perfect opportunity to achieve that goal. Rather than engage in blind  opposition for its own sake on yet another issue, I hope Democrats will  instead take the kind of constructive approach we saw the last time our  country enacted comprehensive tax reform. Back then, both parties  recognized the  [[Page S2974]]  need to address the burden and growing complexity of our Tax Code, and  they came together to actually do something about it. Republicans and  Democrats worked side by side and across the aisle to move that tax  legislation. It was a big win for both parties, for Ronald Reagan and  the Republicans, for Tip O'Neill and the Democrats.   Now it is once again time we do something about the issue, and I  would hope our Democratic colleagues will once again work on a  bipartisan basis toward that end. This has been a growing problem for a  number of years now. The American people deserve a tax system that  allows them to keep more of their hard-earned money, that empowers them  to invest in their futures, and actually makes it easier to succeed  rather than harder.   We have to get this accomplished because Americans have waited long  enough for an economy that finally lives up to its potential and  finally allows them to realize theirs as well.   I appreciate the House under Speaker Ryan's leadership for the role  it is playing in these efforts. That work continues now with a Ways and  Means Committee hearing dedicated to tax reform tomorrow and more to  follow in coming days.   I also appreciate the good work of Members in both the House and the  Senate, particularly the Senate Finance Committee under Chairman Hatch,  who has been leading our discussions. For years, the chairman has been  hard at work with fellow Finance Committee members on both sides of the  aisle on options for tax reform, and I am confident Senator Hatch will  continue to lead the way on these efforts in the days and months ahead.   The task before us is certainly a significant one, but I am confident  we are up to the challenge because we know how important it is for us  to get this done, and we know how long overdue this is as well.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to remember a noble  Kentuckian and a decorated World War II veteran, Wilburn K. Ross, who  passed away on May 9, 2017, just days before his 95th birthday. A  native of Strunk, KY, Ross was awarded the highest decoration in the  U.S. military, the Medal of Honor.   As a private, Ross gained national acclaim for his service in St.  Jacques, France, on October 30, 1944. His company lost 55 of its 88  members fighting a group of German mountain troops. Ross' light machine  gun was about 10 yards ahead of his supporting riflemen. As intense  enemy fire fell around him, Ross repelled the enemy through seven  German attacks. When the next attack came, many of his supporting  rifleman had run out of ammunition. As his Medal of Honor citation  read, ``Pvt. Ross fought on virtually without assistance and, despite  the fact that enemy grenadiers crawled to within 4 yards of his  position in an effort to kill him with handgrenades, he again directed  accurate and deadly fire on the  [[Page S3004]]  hostile force and hurled it back.'' During the 5 hours of fighting,  Ross killed or wounded at least 58 Germans and saved his brothers in  arms.   Ross reenlisted in the Army to see action in Korea, serving another  two decades. He retired from Active Duty in 1964 at the rank of master  sergeant. He was awarded the Medal of Honor, ``[f]or conspicuous  gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call of  duty.''   Although he moved to DuPont, WA, after his retirement from the U.S.  Army, Ross made a trip back to his hometown in Kentucky nearly every  year on his birthday. In his own words, he enjoyed coming back to the  Commonwealth because, ``[e]verybody here treats me well.''   He turned down offers to make his life into a Hollywood film, but  Ross has been memorialized on a U.S. Postal Service stamp and by a  section of Kentucky Route 92 in his home county. In 2014, Ross was a  member of the inaugural class admitted to the Kentucky Veterans Hall of  Fame.   Like so many other members of the Greatest Generation, Wilburn Ross  answered the call to defend our Nation. Through his bravery and  sacrifice, he helped secure freedom across the globe. The story of his  courageous actions and selfless service will continue to be told, both  in McCreary County and across the Commonwealth. Elaine and I send our  condolences to his family and friends.                            ____________________
