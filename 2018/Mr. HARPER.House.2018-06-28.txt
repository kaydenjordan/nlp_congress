Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Gowdy: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       6160, the Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act Amendments bill.       There are certain provisions in the bill that fall within the       jurisdiction of the House Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform.        In the interest of permitting the Committee on House       Administration to proceed expeditiously for floor       consideration of this important bill, I am writing to request       a waiver of your committee's right to a referral. I request       with the understanding that by waiving consideration of this       bill, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matters contained in the bill which fall within its Rule X       jurisdiction.        I will place this letter into the committee report and into       the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure       on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit.            Sincerely,                                                      Gregg Harper,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                     Washington, DC, June 28, 2018.
