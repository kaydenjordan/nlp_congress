 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Affordable  Insulin Now Act, critical legislation to cap out-of-pocket costs for  insulin at $35 per month.   I consistently hear from Granite State families about how the rising  cost of insulin is forcing them to put their health at risk by cutting  back on doses or skipping them all together because it is just too  expensive.   We cannot continue to force American families to make impossible  decisions between their medication and their well-being. At the end of  the day, the work that we do is about our constituents, and I can say  right here, right now that I care more about the well-being of my  constituents and their health than I do about the profits of certain  companies that seem to be protected on the other side of the aisle.   No one should pay more than $35 a month for their insulin, and I urge  my colleagues to support this bill.
