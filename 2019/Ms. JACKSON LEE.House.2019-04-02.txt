 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong and unequivocal  support for the rule governing debate on H. Res. 271 as well as the  underlying resolution and ask all Members to join me in supporting this  resolution which condemns the Trump Administration's ongoing legal  campaign to take away health care from more than 100 million Americans  and to make health care dramatically less affordable for those  fortunate enough to be insured.   I thank Congressman Allred, my Texas congressional delegation  colleague, for introducing this important resolution.   As a new member of Congress who unseated an opponent who voted to  repeal the Affordable Care Act dozens of times, the gentlemen from  Texas knows first-hand how important and critical access to affordable,  high quality, accessible health care available to everyone, including  those with pre-existing conditions, to the well-being of American  families.   Because of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the national  uninsured rate has been slashed from 14.8 in 2012 to 8.89 percent in  2018.   Texas has long led the nation in rate of uninsured so the comparable  rates are 24.6 and 15 percent, respectively.   Madam Speaker, I distinctly recall a candidate for the highest public  office in the land saying ``Obamacare is a disaster'' and appealing for  voters to support him with this question:   ``What have you got to lose?''   The question deserves a response so I hope that person, who occupies  the Oval Office, is listening to my answer.   The Affordable Care Act, or ``Obamacare,'' has been an unmitigated  success to the more than 20 million Americans who for the first time  now have the security and peace of mind that comes with affordable,  accessible, high quality health care.   Madam Speaker, Tip O'Neill used to say that ``all politics is local''  so let me share with you how Obamacare has dramatically changed lives  for the better for the people in my home state of Texas.   1.874 million Texans who have gained coverage since the ACA was  implemented could lose their coverage if the ACA is entirely or  partially repealed or invalidated.   1.1 million Texans who purchased high quality Marketplace coverage  now stand to lose their coverage if Texas v. United States, No. 4:18- cv-00167-O (N.D. Tex.), the lawsuit brought by Republican Governors,  and now whole-heartedly supported and aided by the Trump Administration  were to succeed.   913,177 individuals Texans who received financial assistance to  purchase Marketplace coverage in 2016, averaging $271 per individual,  are at risk of having coverage become unaffordable if the Republican  Congress eliminates the premium tax credits.   1.1 million Texans could have insurance if all states adopted the  ACA's Medicaid expansion; these individuals will not be able to gain  coverage if the Republican Congress eliminates the Medicaid expansion.   508,000 kids in Texas who have gained coverage since the ACA was  implemented are also at risk of having their coverage rolled back.   205,000 young adult Texans who were able to stay on a parent's health  insurance plan thanks to the ACA now stand to lose coverage if the  Republican Congress eliminates the requirement that insurers allow  children to stay on their parents' plans until age 26.   646,415 Texans who received cost-sharing reductions to lower out-of- pocket costs such as deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance are now at  risk of having healthcare become unaffordable if the Republican  Congress eliminates cost-sharing reductions.   10.28 million Texans who now have private health insurance that  covers preventive services without any co-pays, coinsurance, or  deductibles stand to lose this access if the Republican Congress  eliminates ACA provisions requiring health insurers to cover important  preventive services without cost-sharing.   Women in Texas who can now purchase insurance for the same price as  men are at risk of being charged more for insurance if the ACA's ban on  gender rating in the individual and small group markets is invalidated.   Before the ACA, women paid up to 56 percent more than men for their  health insurance.   Roughly 4.5 million Texans who have pre-existing health conditions  are at risk of having their coverage rescinded, being denied coverage,  or being charged significantly more for coverage if the ACA's ban on  pre-existing conditions is struck down.   346,750 Texas seniors who have saved an average of $1,057 each as a  result of closing the Medicare prescription drug ``donut hole'' gap in  coverage stand to lose this critical help going forward.   1.75 million Texas seniors who have received free preventive care  services thanks to ACA provisions requiring coverage of annual wellness  visits and eliminating cost-sharing for  [[Page H2955]]  many recommended preventive services covered by Medicare Part B, such  as cancer screenings, are at risk of losing access to these services if  congressional Republicans go forward with their plan to repeal the ACA.   The Affordable Care Act works and has made a life-affirming  difference in the lives of millions of Americans, in Texas and across  the country.   This is what happens when a visionary president cares enough to work  with a committed and empathetic Congress to address the real issues  facing the American people.   You want to know why the American people have Obamacare?   It is because Obama cared.   The same cannot be said about this Republican president and  congressional Republicans who have made careers of attacking and  undermining the Affordable Care Act's protections and benefits for the  American people.   I urge all Members to vote for H. Res. 271 and send a powerful  message to the President and the American people that this House will  not stand idly by as this Administration tries to take away health care  from more than 130 million persons.   Instead, this House will resist by all constitutional and appropriate  means, including opposing this Administration in the courts and by  passing the ``Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions and Making Health Care  More Affordable Act of 2019,'' which will lower health insurance  premiums with strengthened and expanded affordability assistance by:   1. strengthening tax credits in the Marketplace to lower Americans'  health insurance premiums and allows more middle-class individuals and  families to qualify for subsidies;   2. ensuring that families who don't have an offer of affordable  coverage from an employer can still qualify for subsidies in the  Marketplace; and,   3. providing funding for reinsurance, to help with high-cost claims,  improve Marketplace stability, and prevent the Administration's  sabotage from raising premiums.   The ``Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions and Making Health Care More  Affordable Act of 2019,'' will also strengthen protections for people  with pre-existing conditions by curtailing the Administration's efforts  to give states waivers to undermine protections for people with pre- existing conditions and weaken standards for essential health benefits.   These improper waivers leave consumers with less comprehensive plans  that do not cover needed services, such as prescription drugs,  maternity care and substance use disorder treatment.   Another way the ``Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions and Making  Health Care More Affordable Act of 2019,'' protects consumers is by  prohibiting insurance companies from selling junk health insurance  plans that do not provide coverage for essential medical treatments and  drugs, or cover people with pre-existing medical conditions.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 274         Strike section 2 of the resolution and insert the       following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 280), Protecting the health care of all       Americans, especially those with preexisting conditions. The       resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution to adoption       without intervening motion or demand for division of the       question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Energy and Commerce. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX       shall not apply to the consideration of House Resolution 280.     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong and unequivocal  support for H. Res. 271 as well as the underlying resolution and ask  all Members to join me in supporting this resolution which condemns the  Trump Administration's ongoing legal campaign to take away health care  from more than 100 million Americans and to make health care  dramatically less affordable for those fortunate enough to be insured.

Mr. Speaker, in the 2016 election, as the candidate  who now is in the Oval Office said that ObamaCare is a disaster, the  question was asked: What do you have to lose?   Well, now we know. It is the Affordable Care Act, which has provided  20 million Americans, for the first time, with security and peace of  mind in healthcare.   I rise to support H. Res. 271, and I thank the gentleman from Texas,  my colleague, Colin Allred, because we know that the Texas case is the  epicenter of destruction of the Affordable Care Act.   The administration's flip on us to now be against the position of  survival of the Affordable Care Act tells us we have a lot to lose: 1.8  million Texans have gained coverage; 1.1 million Texans have purchased  high-quality marketplace coverage; 913,000 individual Texans have  received financial assistance.   More importantly, there are 1.1 million Texans who have insurance. If  all the States adopted ACA's Medicaid, we would have that as well. We  did not do it.   But, as well, Texans have no lifetime caps. They have the ability to  have their children on their health insurance plans.   This is a tragedy. Mr. Speaker, I condemn the action of the  administration in filing their opposition to the Affordable Care Act.                            ____________________
