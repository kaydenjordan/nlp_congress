 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 409) to provide for the availability of amounts for customer  education initiatives and non-awards expenses of the Commodity Futures  Trading Commission Whistleblower Program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 409         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION WHISTLEBLOWER                     PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, there is established in the Treasury a separate account       (referred to in this section as the ``account''), the amounts       in which shall be available for the sole purposes of--        (1) carrying out the activities described in section       23(g)(2)(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.       26(g)(2)(B)) (referred to in this section as ``customer       education initiatives''); and        (2) funding the administrative, programmatic, and personnel       expenses of the Whistleblower Office and the Office of       Customer Education and Outreach of the Commodity Futures       Trading Commission (referred to in this section as the       ``Commission'') in carrying out section 23 of the Commodity       Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 26) (referred to in this section as       ``non-awards expenses'').        (b) Transfers From Fund Into Account.--        (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, the Commission shall transfer up to $10,000,000 from the       Commodity Futures Trading Commission Customer Protection Fund       established under section 23(g)(1) of the Commodity Exchange       Act (7 U.S.C. 26(g)(1)) (referred to in this section as the       ``Fund'') into the account.        (2) Availability.--Amounts transferred under paragraph (1)       shall be available for obligation without further       appropriation and remain available until October 1, 2022.        (3) Remaining amounts.--Amounts remaining in the account       that are unobligated on October 1, 2022, shall be returned to       the Fund.        (c) Requirement for Obligations.--The Commission may make       obligations from the account only when the unobligated       balance of the Fund is insufficient to pay non-awards       expenses and expenses for customer education initiatives due       to awards that the Commission has ordered under section 23(b)       of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 26(b)).        (d) Reports to Congress.--The Commission shall include in       each report required under section 23(g)(5) of the Commodity       Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 26(g)(5)) the same information with       respect to the account as the Commission includes in the       report with respect to the Fund, to the extent the       information is relevant to the account.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 409.  [[Page H2987]]    S. 409 provides a bipartisan, short-term legislative solution to  address a funding shortage in CFTC's Customer Protection Fund. The  Consumer Protection Fund is used to pay whistleblower awards that fund  the salaries and expenses of the Whistleblower Office and the Office of  Customer Education and Outreach.   Without this critical funding, CFTC would have to suspend some  operations and furlough employees in the Whistleblower Office and the  Office of Customer Education and Outreach.   This short-term solution is by no means a replacement for the much- needed comprehensive CFTC reauthorization. It will still, though, be a  positive step to ensure that the CFTC can accomplish the important  mission to promote the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of the U.S.  derivatives markets.   The Committee on Agriculture passed a committee print equivalent of  this measure unanimously by voice vote last Wednesday.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
