 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Supreme Court  Justice Bill Cunningham from Lyon County, of the First District of  Kentucky, on his upcoming retirement from the Kentucky Supreme Court.   After serving in the United States Army, Bill Cunningham was the  Eddyville city attorney, the public defender for the Kentucky State  Penitentiary, and the Commonwealth's attorney for the 56th Judicial  District. He then served on the bench as a circuit judge for 15 years  before his election to the Kentucky Supreme Court in 2006.   As an avid writer, Bill Cunningham documented important parts of  Kentucky's history in his books. Through his writings and life as a  concerned citizen, he sought improved race relations and minority  representation on juries.   Justice Cunningham evidently passed his passion for public service on  to his son, Congressman Joe Cunningham of South Carolina. I am proud to  serve alongside Congressman Cunningham and look forward to working with  him to promote bipartisan legislation in the 116th Congress.   As Justice Cunningham begins the next phase of his life, I join with  the people of western Kentucky to express our gratitude for his  lifetime of public service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.                            ____________________
