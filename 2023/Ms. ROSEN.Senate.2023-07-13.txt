 Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate and House Abraham  Accords Caucus co-chairs, it is with tremendous pride that I have the  opportunity to welcome and honor my friend His Excellency Isaac Herzog,  President of the State of Israel, ahead of his address to a Joint  Meeting of Congress.   Nearly 3 years ago, we witnessed the historic signing of the Abraham  Accords, and in that time, the Accords have transformed the Middle  East, enhanced Israel's security, created economic opportunities for  our partners and allies in the region, and advanced vital American  security interests. On the 75th anniversary of the founding of the  State of Israel, we recognize the profound possibilities the Accords  offer to Israel and its Arab neighbors alike.   In 2022, Senators James Lankford, Cory Booker, Joni Ernst, and I  launched the bipartisan Senate Abraham Accords Caucus, alongside the  House Abraham Accords Caucus, founded by Representatives Cathy McMorris  Rodgers, Brad Schneider, Ann Wagner, and   David Trone. Together, we  are working to build on the success of these historic agreements, help  encourage and deepen partnerships among Israel and our Arab partners,  and widen the circle of peace to new countries. We have advanced  bipartisan legislation to deepen security cooperation between the  United States, Israel, and our Arab partners and are developing  initiatives to further cooperative and sustainable development  partnerships in the areas of energy security, water infrastructure,  trade, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.   In January, seven members of the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus  traveled to Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Israel, the  first-ever congressional delegation to visit these four nations since  the signing of the Accords, where we saw firsthand how normalization is  transforming the region. President Herzog believes in this vision,  declaring: ``The Abraham Accords proved above all else how the courage  of leaders and nations can open a window to a world that had previously  seemed unattainable, and how much space there is for momentum and  growth when we choose to change paradigms and learn about each other.''  As we celebrate 75 years of the enduring friendship between the people  of the United States and Israel, we are also committed to advancing  Israel's integration into the Middle East in pursuit of a more peaceful  region.   President Herzog, we welcome you on this historic occasion and  reaffirm the unbreakable bond between our two nations.                            ____________________
