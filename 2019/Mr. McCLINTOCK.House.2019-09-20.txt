 Madam Chair, this bill purports to assert a very  important constitutional right: the right to trial by jury in civil  actions. But it does this by denying another very important  constitutional right: the freedom of unimpaired contract, the right of  two parties to agree to exchange goods and services according to their  own best judgment.   Now, because of the excesses and expenses and uncertainties that have  plagued our civil courts, many consumers and producers and many  employees and employers find it mutually advantageous to waive their  right to civil jury trials in any disputes between them in favor of  simpler, cheaper, and faster arbitration.   Now, the proponents tell us that it is an uneven playing field and  this requirement is often imposed in nonnegotiable, take-it-or-leave-it  propositions. First of all, this isn't exactly true. Every employee and  every consumer, no matter how weak and vulnerable, has an absolute  defense against a bad agreement: It is the word, ``no.'' No, the pay  isn't good enough; no, the price is too high; no, I don't like the  terms, and I am taking my business elsewhere.   Even when there aren't good alternatives, the fact is that every  provision in a contract is a take-it-or-leave-it proposition if one  side or the other insists on it. The question for each side is whether  the totality of the contract is beneficial to them or not. It is my  right to make that decision for myself without somebody in government  making it for me.   Now, remember, an arbitration provision binds both sides. For  example, I am not a lawyer. I can't afford to hire one to take a big  company to court. For me, binding arbitration helps level the playing  field by providing an inexpensive alternative that the company must  abide by. This bill takes that protection away from me.  [[Page H7843]]    According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, through arbitration,  employees prevail three times more often, recover twice as much money,  and resolve their claims more quickly than if they went through the  civil courts in litigation; and, in most cases, the employer pays the  entire cost of arbitration.   According to one study, in claims between $10,000 and $75,000, the  consumer claimant was charged an average of $219. Now, you compare that  to the cost of hiring an attorney and taking on an entire corporate  legal department.   The net result of this bill will be higher prices for products and  lower wages for workers as companies factor the higher cost of  litigation into their business models, and, meanwhile, it denies  consumers and employees the freedom to choose a much simpler and less  expensive way to resolve their disputes.                                time  0930
