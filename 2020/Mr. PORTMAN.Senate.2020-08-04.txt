 Mr. President, I am here on the floor today to talk  about some positive news and some positive news that happened just  today. It is not about the coronavirus. It is not about politics. It is  not about Hurricane Isaias.   It has to do with some urgent and historic help for our national  parks, something that is really important to all of us. We all love our  parks.   Today President Trump signed into law the landmark Great American  Outdoors Act, landmark, bipartisan legislation that will protect and  conserve our public lands. I am happy to see this effort finally cross  the finish line because the natural beauty and rich history of America  is something that we must preserve for future generations.   A big part of the new law is bipartisan legislation that is called  the Restore Our Parks Act that I have worked on for more than 3 years  with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Senator Mark Warner from  Virginia was my partner in this, as well as Senator Lamar Alexander of  Tennessee and Senator Angus King of Maine. Our legislation involves  urgent stewardship of our national parks, which is something that I  have spent more than a dozen years working on. I guess I shouldn't  admit that. Sometimes things take a long time around here. But going  back to my days as Director of the Office of Management and Budget  under President George W. Bush, I started focusing on this issue of the  backlog of maintenance projects at our national parks.   It is alarming. It has been growing. It now adds up to over $12  billion, far more than the parks could ever afford to take care of  based on the annual budgets we provide them from Congress. By the way,  the annual budget from Congress for all operations and all maintenance  is less than $3 billion. Yet there is a $12 billion maintenance  backlog.   When Teddy Roosevelt started the national parks, he wanted to  preserve some of the most beautiful, pristine lands in America. He  wanted to be sure they were going to be there for public use. It was a  good decision. We now have 84 million acres of parkland all around the  country. Some are those beautiful, pristine places like Yosemite and  Yellowstone and the Tetons with spectacular, beautiful vistas, but  others preserve our history.   We have historical parks around the country. We have battlefields  that we have preserved around the country to tell the story of our  country, good and bad. We have Presidents' homes that have been  preserved to be able to help, again, tell the story of America.   Recently, I was at one of our national park sites in Ohio, and it is  the home of an individual who was the first Black colonel in the United  States Army. He was also the first Black superintendent of a national  park. The home is also a site on the Underground Railroad, so it is a  place where people can go and see where escaping slaves were harbored  and understand more of the history, not just of slavery but also of the  cooperation and the seeking for freedom that came out of the  Underground Railroad. This is the Charles Young home near Xenia, OH.   So our national parks are really important for so many reasons. Yet,  during the past couple of decades, we haven't taken care of them as we  should, and this backlog has built up.   People appreciate our parks. During the past decade or so, we have  had an increase of about 58 million in the number of visitors to our  national parks. More are coming every year. Why? It is a relatively  inexpensive vacation. They are beautiful. People from all over the  world know about our national parks, and it is one of the things they  love about America.   The problem is that, when these people visit the parks nowadays, they  are  [[Page S4719]]  going to find that, over the years, we haven't kept up with these  maintenance needs so the water systems, the roads, the bridges, the  bathrooms, the visitor centers, some of the trails--many of these are  now in bad shape. Some are closed, actually.   When you go to a national park, you may find that a facility is  closed because of a lack of funding for the deferred maintenance. We  just haven't had the funding to do the capital improvements they need  so that they can stay functional.   Just the other week, I saw that firsthand at Cuyahoga Valley National  Park in Northeast Ohio. It is a great park. It is the 13th most visited  national park in America. It kind of runs between Cleveland and Akron,  OH.   It suffered from these deferred maintenance problems for years. I saw  a crumbling trail. I saw trails that were falling into the Cuyahoga  River and couldn't be used. I saw rusting historic train tracks that  run through the park. It is a tourist railroad that runs through. Train  tracks are an expensive thing to replace. Again, it has to be done. I  saw a bridge that was really unsafe to be on and has to be restored. It  is a historic bridge. We want to preserve it, but the costs are just  too high given the annual budget for that park.   Their maintenance backlog at that park alone is $50 million, yet  their annual budget is about $11 million, which goes to the rangers and  the programs and the maintenance and operations but is not enough money  to take care of these big problems.   In a way, by not fixing these problems, we are also increasing the  cost. Think about it. These costs compound year after year. In your own  house, you might think about what happens if you don't fix the leak in  the roof. What happens is the drywall begins to have problems. You  might have mold. The floors begin to get wet and wood floors begin to  buckle. You have additional costs that, if you had just fixed that  roof, you wouldn't have.   Well, that is where we are with the parks. If we take the time and  the effort to make the fixes now, we will save money over time for  taxpayers because we will not have the compounding costs. Every day, it  gets worse and worse.   Now, finally, we have come up with a way to deal with it. Congress  has asked our parks, over the last few years, to give us their deferred  maintenance projects with specificity: What are your priority projects?  What are the top priorities? We have asked them to lay it out in  detail.   It has been very helpful because we now know we have over $12 billion  in maintenance needs but about $6.5 billion of that is high-priority  projects--the projects most in need of immediate attention. We know  what they are. They are shovel-ready. They have been vetted. We are  proposing a source of funding to be able to deal with that because,  again, the annual appropriations process does not come near enough to  matching what we need to have done.   The highest priority needs at the parks is about $6.5 billion. In  this legislation--now law of the land--royalty income is taken from  onshore and offshore oil and gas, and some of that royalty is directed  toward this use.   The next 5 years, enough of that funding will be there to deal with  the $6.5 billion, half of the maintenance backlog. We would like to do  better, but, frankly, this is historic. Never have we had so much  funding go to the parks, never have we been able to deal with these  backlogs that have built up over years.   It is really a debt unpaid. That is how I look at it. It is something  we should have been doing all along. We weren't. The costs have now  snowballed, and now we need to deal with it. It is not so much a new  responsibility as it is stewardship we never did in the first place. It  is a debt unpaid.   Second, again, it is going to save us money over time--assuming we  want the parks to be working, we want the trails to be open, we want  the visitors centers to be welcoming--all of which, of course, we do  want and we must have.   The bill is not just important for our parks but also our economy,  too, because these projects are infrastructure projects. We have talked  a lot about that here on how to get more jobs into our economy right  now. With the impact of coronavirus on our economy, we need more  opportunities out there. Infrastructure is one. These are  infrastructure jobs--over 100,000 new jobs in this legislation alone.   Again, these projects are shovel-ready. They are vetted. They are  ones that Congress--thanks to our asking the Park Service for the  information--knows what jobs are out there and what projects need to be  done.   It is a long-term investment too. As of 2019, visitor spending in  communities near our parks resulted in $41.7 billion of benefit to the  Nation's economy and supported 340,000 jobs. It is new jobs in terms of  construction, but it is also ensuring the parks continue to be able to  be attracting these visitors, which adds such a big economic boost to  our economy.   I am proud that Congress has come together as Republicans and  Democrats in a nonpartisan way to support this important initiative,  and I am thankful for the President and his support. He showed bold  leadership by saying: You know what, we are going do this. Other  Presidents have talked about it. In the last three or four  administrations, we have talked about it. Again, I have been working on  it for a dozen years. Now we have actually been able to do it.   I also want to thank the Director of Office of Management and Budget,  Russ Vought, for his help; the Secretary of the Interior, David  Bernhard; and other members of the President's team, including Ivanka  Trump, who has always been strongly supportive of our national parks.   This is about responsible stewardship. These repairs were a debt  unpaid. We are finally addressing them before the cost increase. Our  parks have stood tall for more than a century now as the embodiment of  American history and our shared commitment to preserving some of our  most magnificent lands. Thanks to Restore Our Parks Act, we will now  ensure that those parks stand tall for centuries to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I also want to talk this afternoon a  little about the Heroes legislation, the HEALS legislation, and some of  the commonalities I see between the two. On the floor of the Senate  this week, there has been some discussion about the need for us to come  together in a bipartisan way to put together a package to deal with the  coronavirus. Some call it the COVID 5.0 package. It is really probably  8.0. We have done a lot of legislation already, but there are things  that still need to be done and some urgent matters, including dealing  with the expiration of the unemployment insurance.   I am on the floor today to talk about how I see the opportunity for  us to move ahead by looking at some of the commonalities between the  Democratic support and the Republican support for different  legislation. As we all know, the discussions over the past week have  not moved forward as quickly as we would like. In fact, it is pretty  discouraging. Despite the fact that many people thought the Heroes Act  was really a messaging bill--POLITICO wrote a story, one of our news  media sources up here--and said: ``a messaging bill that has no chance  of becoming law.'' Others made the same comments. Why? Because it was a  $3.5 trillion pricetag for legislation, which would make it by far the  most expensive bill ever passed by either House of Congress. But also,  at a time when we had $1.1 trillion leftover from the CARES package and  States have only allocated an average of about 25 percent of their  CARES Act funding, it seemed like pushing taxpayers to foot the bill  for the costliest legislation in history maybe wasn't the right way to  go.   Also, it had virtually no support from Republicans. Also, this  legislation included a lot of stuff that had nothing do with COVID-19.  The sense was: Yes, it is an important messaging bill for Democrats-- that is out there--but that we needed to figure out a way now to come  together as Republicans and Democrats.   Leader McConnell also introduced legislation. That legislation is  called the HEALS Act. It is time for us to figure out how to come  together and figure out a solution going forward. Particularly with  regard to some of these  [[Page S4720]]  urgent matters like unemployment insurance, we are already past time.  Unemployment insurance already expired last Friday. We have to move  forward with that. We should not be playing politics with people's  livelihoods and making this a political football.   Last week, and again today, my colleague from Arizona, Senator  McSally, introduced what I thought was a great commonsense idea: Let's  extend the existing unemployment insurance, $600 per week Federal  supplement, for another week while we continue these negotiations so  that people are not going to see their unemployment insurance checks  decrease substantially. They would lose all the Federal benefit unless  we do that. They would still have the State benefit but lose the $600  per week   Unfortunately, Senate Democrats said no, objected to this commonsense  idea. I don't quite get that. I think we ought to keep the $600 in  place while we negotiate for the next week, and we ought to be sure and  put the interests of the American people first and come to a  commonsense solution. Now isn't the time for games. It is the time to  get it right.   I also note that with regard to unemployment insurance, there are  lots of ideas out there. For the last few months, I have been proposing  the idea of a return-to-work bonus. Maybe that is not the best idea.  Maybe people have better ideas. The notion there would be the $600,  which is the current Federal benefit, allows people on unemployment  insurance, in many cases, to have more income on unemployment than they  would working.   According to the studies that have been done, including by the  University of Chicago, about 68 percent of the people on unemployment  insurance are making more money on unemployment insurance than they  were making at work.   Most Americans, including most Members of this Chamber--Republicans  and Democrats alike--think that is not right. You shouldn't make more  not to work. Unemployment insurance is meant to give you a little help.  In Ohio, it is about 50 percent, up to a certain cap, but it is not  meant to replace your wages, plus--which is what is happening--on  average, 134-percent increase in wages if you are on unemployment  insurance.   There must be a way for us to come together and to solve this  problem. There are Democrats and Republicans alike who have talked  about perhaps lowering that amount from $600. I heard one of my  Democratic colleagues on the floor today--the Senator from Oregon--talk  about maybe you can tie it to the unemployment in the State. Others of  us, again, and I have talked about the return-to-work bonus. You could  take some of that $600 with you and go back to work, which would deal  with, on a voluntary basis, the need for people to go back to work  because employers are looking for folks.   Right now in Ohio, we have a lot of jobs open, a lot of manufacturing  jobs, as an example. I was at a plant recently--a Ford plant--where  they are looking for people. They have a 25-percent absenteeism rate  right now. They attribute a lot of that to the fact that people can  make more money on unemployment insurance, but they need the workers  badly.   There are Honda plants in Ohio--that is another one of our  manufacturers--where the white-collar workers are going to work on the  assembly lines because they can't get enough workers coming in.   I hear it across the board. I have heard it from those who are  involved with developmental disabilities trying to get their workforce  back. I have heard it from people who are involved with the treatment  for opioids, so the alcohol and drug addiction boards are trying to get  their people to come back to work. I have heard it from our small  businesses that are trying to figure out how to reopen and reopen  safely but have a tough time getting people to come back to work. There  is a need for us to figure this out.   For the workers themselves, it is much better for them to be  connected with their employer again, isn't it? After all, that is where  they are likely to get their healthcare. If they have it, they are  likely to get their retirement savings. They are likely to get the  training there to be able to keep up with the times.   It is good to have people at work. The dignity and self-respect you  get from work is something that is of value. We should all want that.  All of us in this Chamber should focus on this issue and say: OK. The  $600 was put in place during a tough summer. Let's be honest. A lot of  people had a really tough time, and some people are still having a  tough time. There should still be, in my view, a Federal supplement,  but it can't be paying people more not to work than to work. That makes  no sense, as we are starting to open this economy and open it safely.  We have to figure out a way forward here.   There are some Democrats who have worked on this issue. Timothy  Geithner is an example of one who was Secretary of Treasury under  President Obama, who put forward, along with other Democrats and  Republicans, a proposal that said: Let's lower the amount, and let's  tie it to the unemployment.   This is something that, in talking to my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle, including some Democratic colleagues who have talked to me  privately, that, you know, they get it; this is not working, and we  need to fix it. Let's do that. It seems to me there is a lot of  commonality there, and we should be able to figure out a way forward.   Let me mention some of the other places where I see a lot of  commonality. First, both Republicans and Democrats agree that it is  absolutely essential that as people return to work they do so safely.  In the legislation we talked about earlier, the HEALS package, which  Senator McConnell introduced, there is a proposal that is called the  Healthy Workplace Tax Credit Act. Basically, what it says is, if a  business is willing to put in place safety measures like a Plexiglas  shield or do testing or have the PPE--the gloves and the masks and, in  some cases, the gowns that are needed to stay safe--they should be able  to get a tax credit for that. It not only encourages more employment,  but it encourages employers to open in a safe way.   I spoke to a bunch of restaurants yesterday from Ohio. They called in  to talk about the legislation. They love this because they have a lot  of costs associated with making their places safe during the  coronavirus pandemic. But this legislation, again, is stuck because we  can't seem to get to a negotiation. That is one where Democrats and  Republicans could come together.   There is another one that I think makes a lot of sense. It is called  the Work Opportunity Tax Credit Expansion. That also is in the HEALS  legislation. This has always been a bipartisan issue--the work  opportunity tax credit. We have said simply that just as you can get a  tax credit to hire veterans or to hire second-chance individuals who  have come out of the prison system, you should be able to hire people  from unemployment insurance who have lost their job because of COVID-19  and get a tax credit. This is something that, again, Democrats and  Republicans should be able to work on together.   Finally, in the HEALS package, we also have legislation that has a  lot of appeal to Republicans and Democrats that is an expansion of the  employee retention tax credit from the bipartisan CARES Act. This is  legislation that passed 96 to 0 around here. We say, let's make this  employee retention tax credit work better. We expand the amount you can  get in terms of tax credit, expand the amount of time that has to be  covered. It makes it a much better package for small businesses to use  to be able to attract employees and to retain the employees they have.  Again, this is nonpartisan, I would say, and certainly one that can be  bipartisan   Historically, these tax provisions have had bipartisan support. I  worked with my friend Ben Cardin in designing the employee retention  credit in March, expanding the opportunity tax credit, which has always  had bipartisan support, and the healthy workplace tax credit. Senator  Sinema actually has a very similar bill.   Second, there is agreement on both sides of the aisle, we have to  support our schools and our businesses so our kids can get back into  the classroom and our parents can get back to work.   With regard to schools, there is supposedly a big partisan divide  over this issue. When I see it, I see schools,  [[Page S4721]]  money being practically identical in the HEALS package and the Heroes  Act that passed the House of Representatives. In fact, House Democrats  provided around $58 billion for K-12. The HEALS Act actually increases  that to $70 billion. There is actually more money in the HEALS  legislation.   On the business front, both Democrats and Republicans have seen value  in the Paycheck Protection Program we introduced in the CARES Act,  which is why both bills seek to expand it. Albeit in somewhat different  ways, but there is greater consensus here than one might think. We just  need to sort out the details.   My colleague from Louisiana is here with me tonight in the Chamber.  He has talked a lot about the need for us to improve the way we provide  funding to local governments, municipalities, and to provide more  flexibility. I don't think there is much disagreement about that on  either side of the aisle. There may be a disagreement the numbers, the  amount of funding, but, again, the HEALS package has funding. The  Democrats have more funding. But flexibility--that is one where I think  there is a lot of bipartisan consensus.   I know it is a popular right now to say that we are so far apart we  can never get together, but as I look at this, when you actually look  at the individual pieces of this, I see a lot of commonalities. The  final one I want to mention is one where I would think all of us should  be together. That is addressing the underlying health crisis we face.    Both the HEALS package and the Heroes Act provide increased funding  for research into vaccines and antiviral treatments for this disease.  Both acts also recognize the importance of increasing funding for  testing, which is critical in making sure we can safely and sustainably  reopen.   There are more points of commonality between the Republican and  Democratic approaches that I could touch on, like providing another  $1,200 in stimulus checks for all Americans who make less than $75,000  a year. That, I understand, is something that both Democrats and  Republicans support. That would be a huge part of this new package.   The House-passed Heroes Act has, again, a pricetag that is just too  high--$3.5 trillion. I think most people would acknowledge that. I also  know there is a big difference between that and the $1 trillion that  was in the proposal from Senator McConnell--$1 trillion. That used to  be a lot of money.   Again, when you look at the actual details of this, when you look at  what is actually in these two pieces of legislation, there is so much  commonality. I think it is critical that we get this legislation right.  We have time to do that. In the meantime, as Senator McSally has  proposed, let's continue the $600 for the next week.   Let's be sure that we can build on these commonalities we see between  these two pieces of legislation. Retreating into partisan corners at  this critical time doesn't benefit any of us. It certainly doesn't  benefit the United States, and it doesn't benefit us as an institution.  It certainly doesn't benefit the people I represent.   I yield the floor.
