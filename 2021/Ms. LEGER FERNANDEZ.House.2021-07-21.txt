 Madam Speaker, PFAS chemicals are life- threatening. They are forever chemicals and need to be cleaned up. We  will act today to regulate these chemicals and protect public health.   Highland Dairy is a family-owned operation that has served the  eastern part of my district for four generations. In 2018, Highland  learned that PFAS from the nearby Air Force base leaked into the shared  aquifer that watered the grass which fed the cows. The PFAS  contamination poisoned the cows and the dairy could not sell the milk  or the cows. Highland is on the brink of disaster merely by being a  neighbor to the Air Force base. We cannot allow PFAS to work itself  into our food system.   Madam Speaker, my amendment requires the EPA to consider the risk  PFAS poses to water used for agricultural purposes, like that at  Highland.   Madam Speaker, the EPA's work must be inclusive of farmers, rural  America, and the food we eat. I urge my colleagues to adopt the  amendment and pass this bill.
