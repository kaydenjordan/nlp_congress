 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S237]]     Mr. President, I believe the American people should be  deeply concerned about the vote the Senate took yesterday to invoke  cloture; in effect, ending real debate and preventing the Senate from  considering any amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  reauthorization.   This isn't what is called regular order. This isn't how the Senate  ought to operate. In fact, it is not even how the Senate has handled  surveillance bills in the past. Even in the weeks after the horrendous  attacks of 9/11, the Senate considered amendments to the PATRIOT Act.  In 2008, when the Senate first considered section 702, the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act, there were, in fact, amendments.   Now debate has been cut off, and no Senator--neither a Democrat nor a  Republican--is going to be allowed to offer an amendment. What the  country is going to be left with is a deeply flawed bill that, in a  number of ways, is actually worse than current law.   I want to talk first about whose rights are at stake. We are talking  primarily, at this part of my address, about Americans who talk to  foreigners overseas--law-abiding Americans whose communications can get  swept up under this law. They could be, for example, American  businesspeople--perhaps somebody working for a tech company in Colorado  or Oregon or perhaps somebody working for a steel company in the  Midwest. These are American businesspeople--law-abiding people--talking  to a foreign contact. They could be swept up under this law or we could  be talking about first-, second-, or third-generation Americans talking  to family and friends still overseas. Maybe they are catching up. Maybe  they are talking about kids and grandkids. Maybe they are just talking  about their hopes and aspirations, but they are still law-abiding  Americans who could get swept up in this bill. We could be talking  about American journalists covering foreign stories. We could be  talking about U.S. servicemembers talking to foreign friends they made  while deployed. Try to get your arms around that one.   I think it is particularly unfortunate because one of the things I am  proudest of is I was able to ensure that Americans overseas-- servicemembers--would have their privacy rights protected. We have a  law passed to do that.   I remember George W. Bush had reservations about that proposal I made  to protect the privacy rights of our law-abiding servicemembers  overseas. He originally said he might veto the bill. In the end, it was  in his press release saying how great it was, and I think it was  because nobody had really talked about the rights of these wonderful  men and women who wear the uniform in the United States.   We did it right back when George W. Bush was President. We protected  the privacy rights of our servicemembers overseas. Now we are talking  about walking back the rights of those U.S. servicemembers if they are  talking to foreign friends they made while deployed, and we could be  talking about American teachers and researchers seeking information  from foreigners.   Now this body isn't going to have a chance to even consider reforms  that might protect the constitutional rights of these Americans--the  businessperson, the servicemember, the first-, second-, or third- generation American immigrant--because what has happened is the Senate  is being forced to vote on a reauthorization bill without any public  discussion about any kind of alternatives. The one committee  consideration--what is called a markup--occurred entirely in secret.  That is public law being debated in secret.   Yesterday, the Senate discussed whether to cut off debate on a bill  that authorizes vast, unchecked surveillance powers in less time than  it takes to shop for the week's groceries. So now, with no amendments  possible, there is not going to be a single opportunity for the public  to see its representatives explain why they are supporting or why they  are rejecting these key reforms.   You can only conclude from this that opponents of reforms were just  scared. They were frightened. They just didn't want to have them  debated in the open. They must be worried that the more Americans  understand about the program--and the more they hear about commonsense,  bipartisan proposals to fix it--the more the public is going to say we  can do better. We can do better than the status quo because the public,  once they have the benefit of a little transparency and a little open  debate, what I have seen--and I just finished my 865th open-to-all town  meeting at home in Oregon. Once you talk to folks at home about these  issues, they understand that security and liberty aren't mutually  exclusive; that sensible policies get you both and not-so-sensible  policies and failure to look at the issues really get less of both.   My view is the Senate let down the American people yesterday. In my  view, we have a solemn obligation to deliberate, to consider  amendments, and to vote up or down. I think that is really what the  Senate is all about.   One of the worst arguments for jamming this bill through without  amendments was that somehow this law was going away. It just wouldn't  be around. It was expiring.   First, Members who wanted to debate reforms were prepared to go to  this floor many months ago. Nothing stood in the way of a floor debate  last year. Even today, there is no reason to rush all this through.  Absolutely nothing prevents the Congress from extending 702 authorities  for a week or two to allow us to carry out our constitutional  responsibilities. By the way, the Director of National Intelligence has  said publicly and on the record that its authorities continue until  April. I was stunned.    I had Senators on both sides of the aisle whom I like very much-- good, dedicated Senators--saying: Oh, my goodness, we have to act. If  we don't act in the next few days, oh, my goodness, powerful tools we  need to stop the terrorists--and I will not take a backseat to anybody  in terms of stopping the terrorists--they are going to be gone. That is  just not true.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  an article with the statement from the Office of National Intelligence,  where the Director said on the record that its authorities would  continue.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From The New York Times, Dec. 6, 2017]   Warrantless Surveillance Can Continue Even if Law Expires, Officials                                    Say                            (By Charlie Savage)         Washington.--The Trump administration has decided that the       National Security Agency and the F.B.I. can lawfully keep       operating their warrantless surveillance program even if       Congress fails to extend the law authorizing it before an       expiration date of New Year's Eve, according to American       officials.        National security officials have implored Congress for the       past year and a half to extend the legal basis for the       program, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, before it       lapses at the end of the month. They portrayed such a bill as       the ``top legislative priority'' for keeping the country       safe.        But with Congress focused on passing a major tax cut and       divided over what changes, if any, to make to the       surveillance program, lawmakers may miss that deadline.       Hedging against that risk, executive branch lawyers have now       concluded that the government could lawfully continue to spy       under the program through late April without new legislation.        Intelligence officials nonetheless remain intent on getting       lawmakers to pass a durable extension of Section 702 by the       end of the month--warning that even a stopgap short-term       extension of several months, as some lawmakers have proposed,       would risk throwing the program into a crisis in the spring.        ``We fully expect Congress to reauthorize this critical       statute by the end of the year,'' said Brian Hale, a       spokesman for the Office of the Director of National       Intelligence. ``Not doing so would be unthinkable in light of       the considerable value Section 702 provides in protecting the       nation.''        The expiring law grew out of the Bush administration's       once-secret Stellarwind warrantless surveillance program       after the Sept. 11 attacks. After it came to light, Congress       enacted the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to legalize a form of       the program.        Under Section 702, the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. may collect       from domestic companies like AT&T and Google the phone calls,       emails, texts and other electronic messages of foreigners       abroad without a warrant--even when they talk with Americans.       The program has expanded to a broad array of foreign       intelligence purposes, not just counterterrorism.        If Congress fails to reauthorize the law this month, Mr.       Hale acknowledged that the government believes it can keep       the program going for months. Its reasoning centers on a       legal complexity in how the program works: Under the law,       about once a year, the secretive Foreign Intelligence       Surveillance Court  [[Page S238]]       sets rules for the program and authorizes it to operate for       12 months.        The court last issued a one-year certification on April 26.       That matters because a little-noticed section of the FISA       Amendments Act says that orders issued under Section 702       ``shall continue in effect until the date of the       expiration.''        Mr. Hale said the provision, which is recorded in federal       statute books as a ``transition procedures'' note       accompanying the main text of the law, makes it ``very       clear'' that ``any existing order will continue in effect for       a short time even if Congress doesn't act to reauthorize the       law in a timely fashion.''        Given that conclusion, the government is making no plans to       immediately turn off the program on New Year's Day, no matter       what happens in Congress, according to a United States       official familiar with the Section 702 program who spoke on       the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic.        The disclosure has significant ramifications for the debate       over the program.        Congressional leaders have discussed including an extension       of the program in other must-pass legislation, like a       spending bill to keep the government from shutting down. But       lawmakers will face less pressure to jam through such a move,       short-circuiting a full and open debate over reform       proposals, if the alternative is not an immediate termination       of the collecting of intelligence authorized by the law.        Little consensus exists in Congress about what, if any,       changes to make to the law as part of extending it. Lawmakers       have submitted legislation spanning the gamut from making the       law permanent without changes to imposing significant new       limits to safeguard the privacy rights of Americans whose       communications get swept up in the program, as well as a       range of intermediary proposals.        One key disagreement centers on what limits, if any, to       impose on how government officials may search for, gain       access to or use in court information about Americans that       gets swept into the warrantless surveillance program. Some       lawmakers want to impose a broad provision forcing officials       to get a warrant before they may query the repository about       an American. Some want a more limited requirement that       officials get a court's permission to gain access to the       results of such a query if it is for a criminal investigation       but not a national security one. Some want to impose no new       constraints.        Another major issue confronting lawmakers is what to say,       if anything, about the N.S.A.'s old practice of collecting,       from network switches on the internet's backbone,       international emails and other such messages that mention a       foreigner who is a target of surveillance but are neither to       nor from that person. The N.S.A. recently halted that       practice but wants to retain the flexibility to turn it back       on; some bills would codify a ban on it, and some would not.        The question of a Section 702 overhaul, and trade-offs       between national security powers and privacy protections, has       scrambled the usual party lines. Representative Robert W.       Goodlatte of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the       Judiciary Committee, has warned that legislation whose       changes fall short of a compromise bill that he worked out       with Democrats on his committee is unlikely to pass the       House.        In an interview, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat,       declined to comment on the government's theory, but said he       was open to making it possible to have a full and open debate       over the proposed changes to the surveillance law early next       year if time runs out this month.        ``We've seen this movie before: wait until the last minute,       and then say, 'crowded congressional calendar, dangerous       world, we've just got to go along with it,'' Mr. Wyden said.       ``Anything now that creates an opportunity for several months       of real debate, I'll listen to.''        Either way, the United States official said the executive       branch and the courts would still need a durable new version       of the law well before the late-April deadline. The problem,       the official said, is that it will take a significant amount       of time to develop new procedures based on the new law,       submit them to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court,       make changes the court wants and then work with       communications companies to implement the new certifications.        Mr. Hale declined to comment on those specifics, but said       that a gap in the surveillance program's legal authorization       would generate uncertainty.        ``So while the orders would be in effect for a short time       after the end of the year, the fact is that we would need to       be planning for the end of the program,'' Mr. Hale said,       ``and that cannot be done in a matter of days--to effect that       takes some time, and is not like turning on or off a light       switch.''        Planning to turn off the Section 702 program, the other       official said, would include steps to mitigate that change as       much as possible, including by systematically going through       the list of more than 100,000 foreigners abroad who are being       targeted under the program and triaging which are the most       critical, then developing lengthy packages of information to       submit to the surveillance court to seek individualized       orders to wiretap them.        But because of the resources such an effort would require       and the higher legal standard the government would need to be       able to meet, surveillance would ultimately cease on most of       the Section 702 targets, the official added.     Thank you, Mr. President.   Despite yesterday's vote, I regret to have to say I am going to have  to oppose this legislation's final passage. My view is, if this bill  does not go forward now, it is possible to get Democrats and  Republicans back to work together to ensure there is a meaningful  debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate and that this is done with ample  time to meet this window that the Office of National Intelligence has  talked about publicly, but if that doesn't happen, the Senate has  denied itself the opportunity to even attempt to fix this badly flawed  bill.   This surveillance authority allows the government to sweep up some  untold amount of law-abiding Americans' communications. The government  says, of course, that its targets are terrorists, and this is about  keeping Americans safe from terrorism. I don't take a backseat to  anybody in terms of fighting terrorist threats.   Having served on the Intelligence Committee for some time now, I can  tell all Members and the public there is no question that the terrorist  threat is real and that there are significant numbers of people who  represent a very real threat to the well-being of our country.   Now, if somebody says, We have to keep Americans safe from terrorism,  I am all in. I would submit that I don't know of a single U.S.  Senator--not 1 out of 100--who is not all in on this fight against  terrorism, but that is not what the law says. The law says that, under  section 702, the government can collect, without a warrant, the  communications of foreigners ``to acquire foreign intelligence  information.''   Here is how the law defines ``foreign intelligence information.'' It  is information that relates to the conduct of the ``foreign affairs of  the United States.'' That is just about any piece of information about  a foreign country.   Who can the government target to get all of this information? Anybody  ``expected to possess, receive, and/or is likely to communicate'' that  information. So if you unpack that, you don't have to be a terrorist  suspect or any kind of threat to the United States to be a target under  section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The  government just has to think you know something the government wants to  know.   That is why so many Americans--Democrats, Republicans, and  Independents--are worried about getting their private communications  swept up. They are law-abiding people, as I have been saying-- servicemembers, businesspeople, Americans who, on a regular basis, talk  to friends, families, and contacts overseas. They are worried because,  based on what the law says, which I have just read, those foreigners  could be the targets, and Americans' communications could be collected  by the government.   Now, for years, I and other Members of the Congress--both Houses,  both parties--tried to at least get an estimate of how many law-abiding  Americans' communications have been getting swept up. As recently as  April 2017, the Director of National Intelligence said the public was  going to get some kind of estimate, but in June, the Director suddenly  changed course and told the public and the Congress: You are not  getting anything. What that means is no one knows the size of the  database. Nobody knows how many Americans' private communications are  sitting there, waiting to be searched and possibly used against those  Americans.   Just yesterday, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board was  invoked by those opposing reforms, but what that Board had to say about  the sheer volume of Americans' communications being swept up is  actually, in their words, ``too much expansion in the collection of  U.S. persons' communications or the uses to which those communications  are put may push the program over the [constitutional] line.''   So here they were being cited, in effect, as supporters for the  status quo when I just read you their concern about the status quo.   This is why today section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act is an end-run on the Constitution, and it is what the  Presiding Officer and other Members of this body--both Democrats and  Republicans--have wanted to change.  [[Page S239]]    This end-run is not just about the collection. It is that, after all  the communications of our people are swept up, the government can go  searching for individual Americans through all that data. They don't  have to be suspected of anything. The government just has to decide on  its own that your private communications might reveal some intelligence  or some evidence of a crime, and like the collection of the  communications, that search can take place without a warrant--no  warrant on the collection of Americans' communications, no warrant on  searching for individual Americans. This is a case of two wrongs  certainly not making a right.   What the Senate did last night was prevent any debate on this basic  constitutional question. The USA Rights Act, introduced by 15 Senators  of both parties, would have required a warrant for those searches of  Americans.   Our colleagues Senator Leahy and Senator Lee have legislation  requiring a warrant--a Democrat and a Republican. Other Members have  had their own proposals. None of them are going to get heard by the  Senate.   We had a chance to consider amendments. We could have fixed the  underlying bill, which doesn't require any warrants for any searches  for Americans. Let me just repeat that. The underlying bill does not  require any warrants for any searches for Americans--none, not in  intelligence cases, not in criminal cases. Warrantless fishing  expeditions for Americans can just go on and on and on.   The bill's so-called reform only applies to the government's access  to the results of the searches, but it really doesn't even do that. It  only kicks in if the government is already well down the road of  investigating somebody.   This means the bill provides more rights to criminal suspects than to  innocent Americans. Think about what that is going to mean in Texas or  Oregon or North Carolina or anywhere else in the country. As I have  described it, this bill provides more rights to criminal suspects than  to innocent Americans.   It gets worse because the bill is even narrower than that. It imposes  no limitations at all if the government determines the search relates  to national security or to a criminal matter that has anything at all  to do with national security. Why are opponents of reform happy now?  Because their bill does nothing.   I went and read the Director of National Intelligence's statistics  for 2016. The CIA and the National Security Agency conducted over 5,000  warrantless searches for Americans, according to this material. It  doesn't include the FBI, whose searches are supposedly too numerous to  even count. It doesn't include communications records, which number in  the tens of thousands.   How many times does the government encounter a situation in which,  under this bill, there would even be the possibility of needing a  warrant? Exactly one--that is right--one among the thousands and  thousands of warrantless searches for Americans. Even that is an  overstatement because that one instance in 2016 could have occurred  prior to a predicated investigation; in which case, it, too, would be  exempt from warrant requirements.   Basically, this bill we will vote on provides an easy-to-read roadmap  to the government to make sure it never has to get a warrant for  anything. Meanwhile, the thousands of Americans subject to warrantless  backdoor searches each year have no protections at all.   Had there been amendments, I think there would have been the familiar  argument against requiring a warrant for searches of Americans' private  communications. We would have heard that section 702 of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act is necessary to connect the dots between  suspects and terrorists.   Here is why that is misleading. Opponents of reform like to talk  about a tip to the government that somebody is acting strange on a  bridge. They say this is a situation where the government needs to go  directly to reading the private communications of this person. That is  just not how the Constitution works.   Think about it. Would you want the content of your private  communications searched, accessed, and read just because somebody has a  slight suspicion about you?   Here is the misleading part. Opponents of reform say that, unless the  government searches for and reads the emails, it just can't connect the  dots to the terrorists. That is just false. The government already has  the authority to get this information and in a less intrusive way.   Some may remember just a few years ago there was a debate about  ending metadata--the bulk collection of millions of phone records of  law-abiding Americans. What remained at the end of that debate was the  authority of the government to go get the phone and email records of  anyone as long as the records were relevant to an investigation. If it  is an emergency, the government can get those records immediately  without having to go to the court first.   I want to emphasize that because it is something I have felt very  strongly about. I wrote that section, section 102 of the USA Freedom  Act, because I wanted to make sure it was clear in this debate about  finding policies where security and liberty are mutually exclusive,  where we have both, that the strongest possible message was sent; that  if the government believes there is an emergency, the government can  move immediately--immediately--to get the information it needs and then  come back later and settle up with the court.   When I have the opportunity to be in the Oval Office, which I have  had several times--it is a wonderful honor and privilege given by the  people of Oregon to pursue these issues--I will say what I say to the  President, not what the President says back because I think those are  private communications of the President. At one point in this debate, I  said to President Obama: If you and your staff feel the current  emergency provisions are not adequate, if you think they are not strong  enough, I want to know about it because I will work with you to make  sure they do the job.   That is because when there is an emergency and the security and well- being of the American people is on the line, the government gets a  chance to move quickly, come back, and settle later with the court. I  have included that in essentially all the legislation that I have  authored. This provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  is what allows the government to connect the dots without going  directly to the content of private communications. That is how our  system is supposed to work. The government gets less intrusive  information on Americans, using a lower standard, first.   But what if the government needs the content of communications  urgently? What if the government sees an immediate threat and believes  it has no choice but to read those communications right away? As I  said, that is why we had the amendment that I have described in USA  Freedom Act, and it is why we said in our amendment to section 702--in  this proposal--that we would also have an emergency exception. Again,  the USA Freedom Act has an emergency exception, and our reform to  section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has an  emergency exception. In this case, under our proposal, in an emergency,  the government can search for and read those communications immediately  and seek a warrant later. Our proposal also includes other exceptions  to the warrant requirement, such as a hostage situation, where a search  might help save someone.   I bring this up only by way of saying that reformers have been very  clear. When the government has an emergency that is defined by the  government--not by somebody else who might conceivably not have all the  information--what we did in the USA Freedom Act is what we are doing in  section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is  protecting the American people in an emergency.   Now, there are other facts about warrantless backdoor searches that  opponents of a warrant requirement omit from public argument. For years  after the original passage of section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act, the CIA and the National Security Agency didn't have  the authority to conduct these searches. What is more, the Bush  administration never asked the FISA Court, or the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act Court, for those authorities. The Bush administration  didn't think it was a problem  [[Page S240]]  that the CIA and the NSA couldn't conduct warrantless backdoor searches  of Americans. But now people act like the warrantless searches are  somehow inseparable from the broader program. They pretend that we  really can't have an effective foreign intelligence collection program  unless you just make sure you are violating the rights of Americans.   This week should have been an opportunity to discuss the facts of how  this bill could have been improved. It should have been an opportunity  to clarify that Americans don't have to choose between security and  liberty. It should have been the Senate's chance to push back against  scare tactics and fearmongering and to lay out for the public what the  government does and doesn't need to protect us. Instead, we get a bill  that isn't necessary for our security and does nothing to protect our  liberty.   There are other important amendments that are not going to be  considered. One relates to what is known as ``abouts'' collection, a  process in which two innocent Americans could have their communications  swept up if they just write an email referencing a foreign target. We  are talking communications entirely among individuals who themselves  are not targets and are, potentially, all Americans. The whole concept  is just contrary to the Fourth Amendment. As the privacy board  concluded, there was ``nothing comparable'' in the law.   ``From a legal standpoint, under the 4th Amendment, the government  may not, without a warrant, open and read letters sent through the mail  in order to acquire those that contain particular information.  Likewise, the government cannot listen to telephone conversations,  without probable cause about one of the callers or about the telephone,  in order to keep recordings of those conversations that contain  particular content.''   That is the quote from the privacy board, and we sure heard on the  floor sponsors of the status quo, in my view, suggest that the privacy  board had a different view of what they were up to.   From a practical standpoint, this form of collection was so  problematic that the government itself was forced to shut it down. Now,  the underlying bill says: Go ahead and start it up, as long as you tell  Congress. Congress has to be told anyway.   Based on the bill before us, if Congress does what it does best-- which is nothing--the government can just go ahead.   Again, I don't think that is what the public thinks the Senate should  be about. If the government ever wants to get back into the business of  this collection, it can come to the Congress and get it authorized.  If their argument wins the day, so be it, but preemptively writing into  black letter law this form of collection, sight unseen, means that this  Senate is surrendering our constitutional responsibilities.    This is one of the examples, the ``abouts'' collection, which I  mentioned, of why this bill actually is a retreat from current law.  Congress has never approved ``abouts'' collection. It wasn't in the  2008 bill creating the law or the first reauthorization of section 702.  It happened because of a secret interpretation of law, and most of  Congress knew nothing about it. But now, for the first time, when the  government itself has suspended it--largely because they know it had  been abused--what we are doing is essentially setting up what amounts  to a fast-track process to write it back into the law. It defines  ``abouts'' collection broadly--broader even than the government--and it  invites its resumption.   The Senate also is not going to get to consider an amendment limiting  how information on Americans can be used against Americans. The bill  allows unlimited secret use of section 702 information--all collected  without a warrant--in any investigation or in any administrative or  civil procedures against Americans. Now, Americans understand how the  government can thoroughly disrupt their lives without ever charging  them with a crime, particularly if they are doing it based on secret  information.   But even when it comes to using 702 information as evidence in  criminal proceedings against Americans, the bill provides no real  protections. All the government needs is for the Attorney General to  determine that the criminal proceedings relate to national security or  involve a set of crimes that have nothing at all to do with national  security. There is a catch-all category called ``transnational crime.''  Now, I have tried for some time to get the government to tell me what  this ``transnational crime'' is. I haven't gotten much of a response.  In any case, the underlying bill here specifically says that the  Attorney General's decisions cannot be challenged in court.   So there you are. If the Attorney General decides that the crime you  are being charged with somehow relates to national security or is a  ``transnational crime,'' that decision by the Attorney General is  really pretty much sacred. You can go to jail without ever being  allowed to challenge the government's use of section 702 information  against you--information obtained without a warrant and potentially  uncovered as a result of warrantless searches specifically conducted to  find your communications and communications about you.   The ways in which the government could potentially use this  information, collected without a warrant to investigate and prosecute  Americans and those in the United States, are limitless--immigration  status, recreational drugs, back taxes. The list goes on and on. I  don't think Americans think that is how the system is supposed to work.  Is that what a warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance bill is  supposed to do? I don't think so--immigration status, recreational  drugs, back taxes--but this bill allows it.   The bill leaves in place other problems that affect our rights. One  of them is the issue of what is called parallel construction. That is a  lot of fancy legalese that says that, even if information against an  American originally comes from section 702, if the government  subsequently constructs a case from other collection, it never has to  tell that American that it used section 702. My bill, with Senator Paul  and 13 other Senators, would have fixed that.   The bill we are voting on shortly, without any debate on amendments,  also leaves in place a big catch-22 that prevents anybody from ever  challenging section 702 in court. Section 702 collection is secret, so  almost no one can prove definitively that they personally were swept  up. That means it is also almost impossible to get standing to go to  court to challenge section 702. I am sure it pleases opponents of  reform, but it means that section 702 isn't going to be part of any  court review process where both sides of the adversarial system get  heard.   Fixing this problem is not, as so many in the House misleadingly  said, giving rights to terrorists. That was part of the fear-mongering  that went on. This is simply saying that section 702 is not exempt from  constitutional challenges that apply to every single Federal statute-- by the way, the hallmark of our constitutional system.   There are other problems that could have been fixed with amendments.  I am particularly troubled by the fact that the underlying bill doesn't  fix the problem of reverse targeting. This is where the government  targets a foreigner overseas when it is really interested in collecting  the communications of an American without a warrant. Right now, the law  as written allows this collection to continue without a warrant,  unless, in effect, the only purpose of the collection is to obtain the  American's communications. My concern is that, if the government has  even the slightest interest in the foreign target, it is not going to  seek a warrant, regardless of the intensity of the government's  interest in the American on the other end of the phone or the email.  This could mean, again, frequent, ongoing searches of the American's  communications. It could mean the use of the American's communications  in investigations and criminal proceedings. There is a solution to  this, and we proposed it; that is, if a significant purpose for  targeting a foreigner is to get an American's communications, the  government would need a warrant--pretty simple. I note that the  Presiding Officer of the Senate is supportive of reforms and our  bipartisan coalition. I very much appreciate that.   Just think about that. We had a solution to the fact that reverse  targeting had been abused. We simply said, if a significant purpose of  the government for targeting a foreigner is to get an  [[Page S241]]  American's communications, the government would need a warrant--and, of  course, we have an emergency exception in the bill as well.   The bill also doesn't prevent the government from directing service  providers to modify or weaken encryption without any court oversight. I  am telling you that this problem has been underappreciated. As we all  know, there is an ongoing debate about whether the government should be  able to mandate backdoor weaknesses in encryption. I believe this kind  of authority is just a loser all around. I think Americans, if you  weaken strong encryption, will be less safe. Certainly, parents who are  concerned about a youngster don't want to weaken the protection in  their smartphone for the tracker so they can keep tabs on their  kids. If the government is allowed to mandate backdoor weaknesses in  our products, I believe we will be less safe, we will have less  liberty, and it will be a big loser for many of our high-skilled, high- wage companies.    I have already announced that, if there is any effort to weaken  strong encryption, I will do everything in my power to block that  legislation because it is a loser from a security standpoint, it is a  loser from a liberty standpoint, and it will be bad news for a lot of  our companies that pay good wages for the high skills of Americans, but  even those who argue that the government should be able to mandate  backdoor weaknesses in encryption assure us it is only going to happen  if the court orders it. But under section 702, the government could  direct a service provider to do that without any court awareness at  all. And, of course, Congress might not know either.   Again, we would have liked to have fixed this here on the floor. The  bipartisan legislation I have with Senator Paul requires that the FISA  Court approve the kind of technical assistance the government is  seeking from providers, which would also result in the Congress finding  out. This bill we will be voting on soon doesn't do that. As a result,  the court and the Congress could end up totally in the dark about an  issue that I think is absolutely central to the security and well-being  of our people in the 21st century.   The bill also provides no clarification on the question of whether  section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act can be used to  collect communications the government knows are entirely domestic. Put  your arms around that. This law is called the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act, and we can't even get a straight answer from the  government's Director of National Intelligence about whether the law  can be used to collect communications the government knows are entirely  domestic.   When I first asked the head of national intelligence whether 702  provided this authority, he said in a public hearing: No. That would be  against the law.   Then, apparently, he told folks in the news media that he was  answering a different question than the one I asked.   Once again, I asked the Director of National Intelligence to answer  the question I had asked, at which point he then wrote and said that  the whole thing was classified.   This is the essence of what is secret law. I believe it is the kind  of thing that erodes trust in the government and in the intelligence  community specifically.   Had we been able to have a real debate, I would have offered an  amendment that would, in effect, write in the black letter law what the  head of national intelligence told me at first when I asked him ``Could  FISA be used to collect wholly domestic communications?'' before all  this George Orwell stuff. The head of national intelligence said: No,  FISA could not be used to collect wholly personal communications. That  answer would have reassured the American people.   After all of this back-and-forth and the bizarre situation where the  Director of National Intelligence says the whole thing is classified  after he has already given an answer in public, now the public isn't  going to have an opportunity to see its representatives address this  issue or take a position.   Supporters of the bill point to provisions related to oversight of  section 702. Here is how inadequate those are. Yesterday, we again  heard about the privacy board. Right now, the privacy board is  restricted to reviewing counterterrorism programs. Most intelligence  programs aren't neatly categorized that way. They are broader than  that. And, of course, the effect on Americans' privacy has nothing to  do with whether a collection program is about terrorism or anything  else. This bill leaves in place completely arbitrary limits on the  privacy board and their ability to oversee the country's intelligence  programs.   The bill does not meaningfully strengthen the FISA Court in a way  that I think is very basic. There are people with top security  clearances who appear before the court and provide the only alternative  view in what is otherwise basically the government's show. The FISA  Court has often gone years without addressing serious legal and  constitutional questions. Sometimes, the court never gets to them.  Right now, these sort of friends of the court are only heard from when  the court invites them. But imagine if these folks who have top  security clearances were informed about what was going on and could  raise issues with the court whenever they felt it was important. This  would not hinder the FISA Court, but it would greatly improve the  chance that the court would consider serious issues earlier. Once  again, no reform.   There are also basic principles of transparency that are ignored in  the bill. Right now, the CIA and the NSA are obligated to inform the  public how many searches of Americans they conduct. The FBI is not. I  don't see a good argument why Congress shouldn't change that. The  American people deserve to know how often the CIA and the NSA conduct  warrantless searches looking for information on them. They deserve to  know how often the FBI does so, particularly because the FBI conducts  searches for evidence of a crime as well as for intelligence.   I believe I have outlined the faults of the bill. This is not reform.  It is not even business as usual; it is a retreat. It is, in fact,  worse than just extending the program's business as usual because, for  the first time, it writes into black letter law the problematic  practices that I have outlined. There is not real oversight. There is  not transparency. That is what the public demands. That is what I heard  people asking for at the townhall meetings I held last weekend in  Oregon. Americans still have a lot of unanswered questions about the  program.   There are certainly many Members of Congress who share my concerns  who have devoted much of their career to ensuring that Americans have  security and liberty. I want to especially express my appreciation to  Senators Paul and Lee. They have been tireless champions. Chairman  Leahy has led on this critical matter for decades. Senator Heinrich, my  seatmate on the Intelligence Committee, is one of this body's rising  stars because he is willing to dig deeply into the issues. In the  House, 183 Members voted for the most comprehensive section 702 reform  bill, the House version of the USA RIGHTS Act. As we saw last night-- and the President of the Senate and I were involved in a lot of those  deliberations down here in the well of the Senate--this was a very  close vote.   A lot of people say: Well, the reformers are going to say their  piece, and they are going to get 6, 8, 10 votes and the like.   I think, last night, we really brought home what I hear Americans  say, Democrats, Republicans--by the way, many Independents--who have  questions about the way the government works and want to see their  liberties protected in a way that also keeps them safe, and a big group  of Members in the other body. And last night, a big group of Senators  said: What a quaint idea. Let's have the U.S. Senate be the U.S.  Senate. Let's have a few amendments.   It was communicated to the leaders. I want to thank Senator Schumer  for making it clear that he thought that some amendments would make  this a better, fuller, and more complete debate. I think it is very  unfortunate, with the fact that there are so many important issues  here--it is an important bill. I hope people have seen that--having  spent a lot of time on these issues over the years, I think we really  need to have more time spent on this floor getting a chance to debate  these issues, having Senators of both  [[Page S242]]  parties work in good faith, work toward constructive solutions.   I think support for what we sought last night, which is a real debate  and real solutions and actual amendments--I think more and more  Americans are coming around to see that is the way to proceed because  Americans aren't going to buy the idea that, well, we will just say you  have to give up some of your liberty to have security. Ben Franklin  said it very well: Anybody who gives up their liberty to have security  doesn't really deserve either.   What we need are smart policies. That is why I talked about  encryption. Strong encryption makes us safer. It also protects our  liberty. That is why I outlined some of the deep flaws in this bill. I  think this bill puts on fast track going back to ``abouts'' collection,  where somebody is barely mentioned and, all of a sudden, the government  is collecting the communication.   I will oppose final passage of this legislation. Nothing is  preventing the Congress from getting this right. As I mentioned, the  office of national intelligence--the Director of the relevant agency  has said there is plenty of time for us to take this bill, have a few  amendments, a real debate, and come up with a bill that better ensures  that Americans are both safe and free.   With that, I yield the floor.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my law clerk,  Jeff Gary, be granted floor privileges for the remainder of this  Congress.
