 Mr. President, millions of men, women, and children  across the world are victims of human trafficking. But it is not a  problem that stops at our shores.   Eight years ago, I held a hearing in the Subcommittee on Human Rights  and the Law entitled, ``In Our Own Backyard: Child Prostitution and Sex  Trafficking in the United States'' to raise awareness about this  problem.   Sadly, not much has changed since then. The National Center for  Missing and Exploited Children receives about 9,000 to 10,000 reports  of suspected child sex trafficking each year. It estimates that more  than 80 percent of the trafficking incidents have occurred online. The  worst offender is the website Backpage.com, which the National  Association of Attorneys General has called a ``hub'' of human  trafficking.   The U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations spent 2  years looking into sex trafficking and its facilitation online. After a  thorough inquiry, the subcommittee found that more than 93 percent of  Backpage's ad revenue in 2011 came from its so-called ``adult''  section, with projected revenue reaching nearly $250 million by 2019.  However, ``adult section'' is really a misnomer--many of Backpage's ads  were designed to sell children for sex.   One of those children was Desiree Robinson of Chicago. When she was  16, Desiree ran away from home. A pimp soon found her and sold her  repeatedly on Backpage. On Christmas Eve, Desiree was taken to a garage  to meet a john. Hours later, she was found dead in that garage. She had  been raped and beaten, and her throat had been slashed.   Last year, Desiree's mother, Yvonne Ambrose, testified before the  Senate Commerce Committee about her daughter's tragic murder. She  described how her daughter was, quote, ``preyed on and sold online by  pimps who took advantage of her.'' She went on to say:         On . . . December 24th, 2016, Desiree, my baby, was       brutally murdered and now my life is changed forever. . . .       If there were stricter rules in place for posting on these       websites, then my child would still be alive with me today.        The truth is [that] Backpage.com and other sites are making       millions of dollars by exploiting our children and allowing       them to be taken advantage of by predators. If we don't speak       up now, these websites will continue to profit off       trafficking our babies. It could be your child, your niece,       your nephew, your cousins, your friend's children next if you       don't stop this.    Yvonne went on to urge the Senate to pass the Stop Enabling Sex  Traffickers Act, or SESTA.   SESTA is a narrowly crafted bill that would ensure that Section 230  of the Communications Decency Act does not provide legal immunity to  websites like Backpage that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking. For  years, Backpage and others have successfully exploited this loophole  and avoided legal liability, despite hosting advertisements for the  sale of sex acts with young victims of trafficking. Their ability to  hide behind this reprehensible defense will come to an end with the  passage of this bill.    SESTA was incorporated into House companion legislation called the  Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, or FOSTA.  The House overwhelmingly passed this bipartisan, compromise legislation  last month, in a 388 to 25 vote.   The combined legislation will ensure that victims and survivors of  sex trafficking can seek justice against websites that knowingly  facilitated the crimes against them. It would also enable state law  enforcement officials--not just the Federal Department of Justice--to  take action against individuals or businesses that violate federal sex  trafficking laws.   The bill has been endorsed by major anti-trafficking groups, law  enforcement organizations, and numerous technology companies.   We need to protect victims of trafficking, and we need to hold  websites like Backpage accountable for their exploitative, criminal  actions. As we prepare to vote on this bill, consider Yvonne Ambrose's  plea:         I would not wish this pain and hurt on my worst enemy. And       I pray that Desiree's life can make a difference, so no one       else has to ever endure this pain again. I'm asking you, the       U.S. Senate, to amend Section 230 and be the change you want       to see in this world--not only for justice for Desiree, but       for all of the countless Jane Does out here and the other       little girls to come who don't have a voice.    I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation.    Mr. President, during Women's History Month, as we  celebrate the mothers, daughters, sisters, and, for some of us, the  granddaughters in our lives, I would like to take a minute and honor a  few women from my home State of Illinois.   During the nearly 170-year history of the New York Times, only about  15 to 20 percent of its obituaries have been written for women. Earlier  this month, the New York Times announced a new feature called  ``Overlooked,'' celebrating the lives of people from underrepresented  communities. March, being Women's History Month, the New York Times  started by publishing obituaries for 15 women who never received them.  The first on the list: Ida B. Wells. Now, Ida is not from Illinois, but  her incredible life's journey brought her to Chicago near the end of  the 19th century, where she lived until her death in 1931.   Born into slavery, less than a year before the Emancipation  Proclamation, Ida B. Wells was an intrepid journalist and a  trailblazing activist in the Civil Rights and woman's suffrage  movements. Ida was recognized worldwide for her writings exposing the  truth behind why Black men were being lynched in the South. Ida B.  Wells' work forced her from her home in the South, and after traveling  to New York and England, Ida settled in Chicago.   Among her many accomplishments, including helping launch the National  Association of Colored Women and the National Association for the  Advancement of Colored People, Ida B. Wells became an early pioneer in  social work, fighting for justice and equality. Following her death,  the Chicago Housing Authority, recognizing the need for affordable  housing for African Americans in the late 1930s, began a project to  provide 1,662 apartments, two and three story row houses, sitting on 47  acres of land in the Bronzeville and Oakland neighborhoods of Chicago.  They were named the Ida B. Wells Homes. She certainly left her mark in  Chicago.   Not far from my Chicago office, Ida B. Wells is among the 65 women  honored in the Chicago Women's Park & Gardens. The park also includes a  beautifully moving monument called ``Helping Hands,'' recognizing the  contributions and legacy of Jane Addams, one of the world's most  influential social reformers.   In 1888, Jane Addams and her friend Ellen Starr visited a settlement  house called Toynbee Hall in the slums of London, which provided a  variety of services to poor industrial workers. It sparked what would  become their lifelong mission helping the poor and championing the  rights of all, including immigrants, women, and children. Jane Addams  and Ellen Starr were determined to bring that model to the United  States, which was emerging as an industrial giant and in the early  years of an immigration boom.   In 1889, Jane Addams and Ellen Starr returned to Chicago and started  Hull House, the first settlement house in the United States. Its humble  beginnings started by simply inviting people from the community to hear  readings from books or look at slides of paintings. They listened to  those who came, and it became clear that many of the neighborhood's  women were in desperate need for a place to bring their children. So  they started a kindergarten and daycare for working mothers. As it  expanded, Hull House helped prevent the exploitation of immigrants  living on the West Side of Chicago by providing services such as  housing, child, medical aid, educational, and vocational classes.   In addition to her contributions in the field of social work, Jane  Addams was known as one of the leading antiwar activists in the  country. During World War I, she became the chair of the Women's Peace  Party and president of the Women's International League for Peace and  Freedom. Jane Addams' efforts to end the war earned her the 1931 Nobel  Peace, becoming the first American woman to receive the honor.  [[Page S1873]]    In the spirit of these remarkable women, I would like to fast forward  to today and mention the work of two of my heroes who belong to the  Sisters of Mercy of the Americas religious order: Sister JoAnn Persch  and Sister Pat Murphy. Between the two of them, they have nearly 200  years of doing God's work here on Earth. As was true in Jane Addams'  day, immigrants, refugees, and individuals seeking asylum so often  arrive in our country and communities with urgent needs: food,  clothing, shelter. For years, they have supported immigration reform,  marching at rallies, speaking at news conferences, and lobbying  Illinois State senators and representatives in Springfield. They have  become so well known in immigration circles, they are simply known as  ``the Sisters.''   In 2007, when ``the Sisters'' were told they couldn't provide  pastoral counseling to immigrant detainees in jails and in the Federal  Immigration Detention Center on Broadview, they said: ``We'll see about  that.'' So they founded the Interfaith Committee for Detained  Immigrants, or ICDI. The next year, the ICDI persuaded the Illinois  General Assembly to change the law and allow immigrants, refugees, and  asylum-seekers in detention in my home State to receive pastoral  counseling, if they choose, and they didn't stop there. ICDI has since  grown to provide a broad range of services to immigrants who are  detained and those who are awaiting action on their cases, from legal  assistance and help learning English, to healthcare, and more. ICDI  also runs two hospitality houses in the Chicago area, one for men and  the other for women and children in Hyde Park. I have seen the good  work being done in Hyde Park, and let me tell you, Jane Addams would be  proud.   I will close with a story about one of the many families that ICDI  has helped: the Saffaf family. Four years ago, Marwan Saffaf was a  banker, living with his wife and their four children in Hama, Syria, a  town about 85 miles from Aleppo. This was 2 years into Assad's bloody  assault on the Syrian people. Marwan knew that he and his family had to  leave Syria after he was kidnapped and threatened by gunmen who mistook  him for a government official. The family fled to the United Arab  Emirates.   After 2 years, Marwan received permission for most of his family to  come to America. But for some reason, his eldest child--his only  daughter--was denied permission to join her younger siblings. So Marwan  and his wife made one of the hardest decisions of their lives. Marwan  and the boys would come to America. His wife and daughter would wait in  the UAE for permission to join them. With help from ICDI, Marwan and  the boys found a new home, an apartment in Des Plaines, IL, and landed  a new job.   Two years after Marwan and his boys arrived in Chicagoland, Marwan's  wife and daughter finally received permission to come to America. Then  came President Trump's first Executive order--banning immigrants from  seven majority-Muslim nations--including Syria--from entering the  United States. Marwan's wife and daughter's future in this country was  unclear. Fortunately, the President's order was blocked, and after 2  years of living apart and in fear, the Saffaf family was finally  reunited. Thank goodness for ``the Sisters'' and ICDI.   We could use more strong, courageous women like Sister JoAnn Persch  and Sister Pat Murphy who fearlessly follow in the footsteps of  trailblazing women like Ida B. Wells and Jane Addams. This March, as we  once again honor the women who have moved this country forward and  inspired each of us, let's renew the challenge to build on their  legacies and fight for the country they envisioned.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business.    Mr. President, back in 1985, I was a second-term Member  of the House of Representatives and a member, I was proud to say, of  the House Appropriations Committee. The Committee chairman was a man by  the name of Jamie Whitten. He was from the State of Mississippi. He was  a Mississippi Democrat. Yes, there used to be Mississippi Democrats.   Jamie Whitten had been a witness to a great deal of American history.  He was on the floor of the House as a newly minted Congressman from  Mississippi on December 8, 1941, when Franklin Roosevelt delivered his  ``Day of Infamy'' speech.   There I was speaking to this same man 44 years later, and I was a  junior member of his Appropriations Committee. I knew that  Appropriations, under the House rules, had several members who were  also represented on the Budget Committee. So one day I went to Chairman  Whitten from Mississippi and suggested to him that I wanted to be on  the Budget Committee in the slot reserved for Appropriations members.  Chairman Whitten looked down at me and he asked: Why do you want to be  on the Budget Committee?   I said: I think it is good because the Budget Committee makes the  spending decisions and blueprints that Appropriations and other  committees follow.   He kind of sat back in his chair and Chairman Whitten said to me:  Well, if you want to be on that committee, you can be on that  committee, but I want you to remember one thing, the Budget Committee  deals in hallucinations and the Appropriations Committee deals in  facts.   I will never forget that exchange. I served on the Budget Committee  and again in the Senate on the same Budget Committee, and I have come  to believe that Chairman Whitten was not that wrong in his conclusion.  I call that ``Whitten's Law.'' It remains one of the most important  lessons I have learned about the Federal budget.   I have learned other lessons from Mississippi politicians, and one of  them is a man by the name of Thad Cochran, my colleague from the State  of Mississippi and one of my friends who cochairs the Defense  Appropriations Subcommittee with me. I shouldn't say cochairs; I am the  ranking member on that committee and he, of course, is the chairman.  Thad Cochran taught me and others many important lessons about the  Federal budget and about public service in general.   Thad Cochran is a man of humility and integrity, and he is a man of  his word. He is a conservative Republican who values principle and  cooperation over pointless confrontation. He prefers common ground to  scorched Earth because he knows it is better to build on.   Senator Cochran and I have served together in the Senate for more  than two decades. For much of that time, we have both been on the  Senate Appropriations Committee. He has been the committee's ranking  member and chairman twice. In all of those years, I can only think of a  time or two when he and I disagreed so completely on an issue that we  found ourselves unable to find that principled compromise. Some may  call that ``old school.'' I call it leadership in a representative  democracy.   As a member and two-time chairman of the Senate Appropriations  Committee, Senator Cochran's skill as a negotiator has served  Mississippi and the United States exceedingly well. He has helped keep  his State and our Nation strong and safe and economically sound.   In a time that increasingly prizes the quick profits and short-term  vision, Thad Cochran has helped to protect and increase America's  investments in scientific, technological, and medical research. That is  a proud part of the legacy he leaves.   His voice is common and quiet, but don't be fooled. When it comes to  protecting the interests of his State or this Nation, he is tenacious.   That was never more apparent than in the weeks and months after  Hurricane Katrina pummeled the Mississippi gulf coast and other States  in 2005. Senator Cochran helped secure appropriations that enabled  thousands of homeowners in Mississippi to rebuild after their insurance  companies turned them down.   As the former chairman and now ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee Defense Subcommittee, I worked closely with Chairman Cochran  to protect critical national security priorities in my State of  Illinois, and he has worked hard for his State.   Behind every Senator, of course, there are hard-working staff members  without whom we could not do our jobs. Senator Cochran's personal staff  and his committee staff are first-rate public servants. I want to thank  them too. They have been part of a winning team with Senator Cochran.  Their hard work and loyalty on his behalf and on behalf of the Senate  has served this Nation well.   I wasn't surprised the other day when I learned that Senator Cochran  had been an Eagle Scout. I was surprised to learn, however, that he  once failed in pursuit of a Boy Scout merit badge as a young man. He  learned a lesson from that experience that he said has stayed with him  all his life: Always be prepared.   Thad Cochran's adherence to that lesson, his remarkable skill as a  negotiator, and his deep integrity and honesty are qualities we could  all do well to emulate.   I thank Senator Thad Cochran and wish him all the best as he departs  the Senate, and I thank him for his great service to Mississippi and to  America.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last week Congresswoman Louise Slaughter  of New York passed away after representing the Rochester area of that  State for more than three decades. She was tough, unfailingly gracious,  and wonderfully effective in helping people throughout her life.   Louise carried titles you don't see often around here. She was the  Congress's only microbiologist. She was also a blues and jazz singer as  well. She was a fighter, first and foremost, earning the respect of her  colleagues and even those who disagreed with her. I have counted her as  a friend and an ally in many causes.   She hailed from Harlan, KY, the daughter of a blacksmith in a coal  [[Page S1882]]  mine. Louise can trace her lineage to the legendary Daniel Boone, and  you can hear it in her voice.   She went to college and graduate school at the University of Kentucky  to study microbiology and public health to honor her sister who passed  away due to pneumonia at a young age.   She went on to serve in both the Monroe County legislature and the  New York State Assembly before joining Congress in 1986 to represent  the Rochester New York area, which includes the area around the  historic Seneca Falls Convention.   She was one of only 29 women in Congress when she first arrived and  quickly became a champion and a trailblazer for the American worker and  the American women.   Louise coauthored the landmark Violence Against Women's Act in 1994,  curbing domestic violence and aiding its victims.   She also helped shepherd the Affordable Care Act through Congress as  the very first woman to chair the House of Representatives Rules  Committee.   Louise's storied career has included defending her constituents  against Big Business and bringing national attention to pressing  medical issues. She introduced the first legislation barring genetic  discrimination in 1995. It finally became law in 2008.   She introduced a bill every Congress to fight drug-resistant  bacteria.   In 2015, President Obama incorporated parts of Louise Slaughter's  plan to identify superbugs and increased funding for new antibiotics  and vaccines into the administration's initiative to encourage the  responsible use of antibiotics in livestock.   Louise also introduced the first bill to ban insider training by  Members of Congress.   She did all of this, and some of it controversial, and still won the  respect of her colleagues.   I worked with her on many projects, from the Bicameral High-Speed and  Intercity Passenger Rail Caucus, to demanding the Supreme Court adopt  an ethics code.   It was not a coincidence that on the day when news of her passing  broke, the words ``nicest'' and ``Rochester'' were trending on Twitter  in Washington, DC.   Through all of her hard work, she was smart and kind and always  funny. She will be missed by her colleagues and friends and family,  including her three daughters, Megan, Amy, and Emily Robin; seven  grandchildren, Lauren, Daniel, Emma, Jackson, Mason, Linus, and Ione;  and one great-grandchild, Henry.   Louise was a great Congresswoman. I am going to miss her as a  colleague and a friend.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this crisis we face in this country  involving DACA is a crisis that was created when President Trump  announced the end of the program on September 5 of last year and gave  us a deadline of March 5 of this year to come up with an alternative.  Many of us, including the Presiding Officer, battled mightily to do  that--a bipartisan effort with compromise on both sides--but we never  could come up with a proposal the President accepted. As a consequence,  the destiny of the DACA recipients is uncertain.   They are now temporarily protected by an injunction from two  different Federal lawsuits--an injunction which could end in a matter  of weeks or months. In the meantime, their status is so uncertain that  it is difficult for them to make plans for their lives. That is where  we are today.   DACA has been a huge success. It is a program designed to give those  who were brought here as children, toddlers, and infants an opportunity  to become part of America--a legal part of America--and an opportunity  to one day become citizens.   DACA was an Executive order of President Obama's which President  Trump has now abolished. There is no protection, other than the court  injunction for those who are facing the end of DACA.   Yesterday, I convened a meeting with some of my Senate colleagues  with the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen. Here is what  we learned: As of yesterday, more than 35,000 DACA renewal applications  are pending because of these court orders. Of these pending renewal  applications, 10,000 were from recipients whose DACA protection had  already expired. Tens of thousands more Dreamers have DACA protection  due to expire soon. Around 13,000 DACA permits could expire in March,  another 5,300 in April, and nearly 14,000 more in May.   Understand what happens: When a person is protected by DACA and loses  that protection, technically, they can be deported. In addition, they  cannot legally continue to work in the United States.   There is some good news, though. Secretary Nielsen promised me that  the Department of Homeland Security will not deport any DACA recipient  with a pending DACA application, even if their DACA status has expired.  I thank her for that commitment, and I intend to hold her to that  commitment. Many lives are at stake.   However, for DACA recipients whose status has expired, that same  Department will not authorize them to work unless and until DACA is  renewed, so there can be a gap in their employment. Understand that the  people we are talking about are not folks, by and large, with part-time  jobs. They are teachers. They are medical professionals. Some of them  are serving in our military.   What we now know about the expiration of this work permit is that  tens of thousands of DACA-eligible individuals could be forced to leave  their jobs while their applications for renewal are pending and before  those applications are approved.   Then consider the fate of Dreamers who are eligible for DACA but  never reached the necessary age to attain that status. They can no  longer apply for DACA because President Trump's decision prohibits them  after September 5. If a child turns 15, the youngest age at which they  can apply for DACA, they are now blocked from applying because of the  President's decision.   The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute estimates that in addition  to 800,000 DACA recipients, there are an additional 1 million Dreamers  eligible for DACA. Because of President Trump's decision to end DACA,  1.8 million Dreamers are at risk of deportation and cannot work to  support themselves and contribute to the only country they know and the  country they love.   President Trump called on Congress to legalize DACA, but he has,  unfortunately, refused to accept six different bipartisan offers to  achieve that. One of those offers also included $25 billion for his  wall. Yet he wouldn't accept it.   Let me tell my colleagues the story of one of these young people, as  I have done before. I have come to the floor of the Senate more than  110 times to tell these stories. I just think when you hear the stories  of an individual, it helps us understand what the real issue is.   This is a photo of Irving Calderon. He is the 112th Dreamer I have  talked about on the Senate floor. When he was 7 months old, Irving was  brought to the United States from Mexico by his parents. He lived in  California for 10 years and then moved to Texas where he currently  lives. His childhood memories include Disneyland, going to the beach,  and celebrating Christmas and the Fourth of July with his family.   Irving found out he was undocumented when he was 12 years old. At  first he didn't believe it because he said there is nothing about him  that wasn't American. Then, as he got older, he realized he couldn't  get a driver's license, he couldn't work, he couldn't save money for  college, but he didn't give up.   In high school, Irving maintained a 4.0 grade point average. He was a  member of the Honor Society and the student council. He served as  president of the school's chapter of the Future Business Leaders of  America, played varsity basketball and tennis.   Because of his accomplishments, Irving was accepted into the  University of Texas at Austin. In college, he served as director of the  Hispanic Business Students Association, and under his leadership, the  group adopted a street to clean. Irving organized events for  underrepresented high school students and middle school students and  volunteered at an orphanage every Thanksgiving.  [[Page S1883]]    He graduated from the University of Texas with a bachelor's degree in  business administration. Thanks to DACA--created by President Obama and  then eliminated by President Trump later--Irving was able to put his  degree to work. For the last 3 years, he has worked as an information  technology business analyst at General Motors. He creates software  systems for one of the largest automakers in the United States.    He wrote me a letter, and here is what he said:         I've always felt completely American. I've been here since       I was 7 months old. It's the only place I know and the only       place I've ever considered home. Being an American is not       something that is just given to you; it's about the work you       put in. . . . I feel that I have contributed to America.    I do too. It would be an American tragedy to deport someone like  Irving, who has overcome so many obstacles and has so much to  contribute to our country. People like Irving Calderon are the reason  more than 400 business leaders signed a letter to Congress urging us to  pass a bipartisan Dream Act. The letter and these business leaders say:         Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our       economy. With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of       why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage.    President Trump created this crisis, but instead of working toward a  solution, he has sabotaged every effort we have tried to make on behalf  of Dreamers. Now it is up to Republican leaders in Congress to take yes  for an answer and accept any one of the six bipartisan solutions we put  on the table to save these young people.   Congress should do our job and make the Dream Act the law of the  land, or we will be responsible for forcing hundreds of thousands of  talented young immigrants out of the workforce and putting them at risk  of immediate deportation.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
