 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, the distinguished  gentleman from Massachusetts, Chairman McGovern, for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Madam Speaker, today's rule covers two items. The first item I will  discuss is H.R. 3237, a supplemental appropriations bill intended to  provide security funding for the Capitol complex, including funding for  the U.S. Capitol Police, the National Guard, and other agencies that  responded to the January 6 attack on the Capitol complex, as well as to  provide funds to address the coronavirus throughout a variety of  agencies Congress directly controls.   Although the process leading to this bill started out with bipartisan  negotiations, unfortunately, no deal was reached. Instead of  negotiating with Republicans on our counterproposal, as is typical in  these discussions, Democrats walked away, once again, choosing to go it  alone with the bipartisan bill before us today.   Madam Speaker, it is truly disappointing that Democrats were  unwilling to continue to work towards an agreement with Republicans on  a matter of this magnitude, and given that the Senate is in no hurry to  take up this legislation, a few additional weeks of discussion could  and likely would have led to a bipartisan product instead of a product  destined for the legislative graveyard.   In the wake of the January 6 attack, I would hope that the majority  would join with Republicans and choose to speak with one voice.  Instead, like so many items in this Congress, the majority has insisted  on its way or the highway. And today, they are doing it so again with  this partisan bill.   House Republicans and even some Senate Democrats have concerns with  this package. The bill creates a rapid response force with the D.C.  National Guard. Any rapid response force intended to provide backup for  the United States Capitol Police and to protect the Capitol complex  should be under the control of, and housed within Congress.   As a number of my colleagues mentioned during the debate in the  Committee on Rules yesterday, housing these capabilities within the  D.C. National Guard introduces the exact same concerns my friends on  the other side raised in the aftermath of January 6, that Congress  would be reliant on the executive branch to deploy this rapid response  force.   Madam Speaker, I have deep concerns about putting this rapid response  force under the control of any other entity, whether that is the  government or the District of Columbia or the executive branch. I also  have grave concerns about assigning this role to the military since  this is undoubtedly a law enforcement function.   Further bipartisan and bicameral negotiations would have helped us to  tailor the package to allay some of the serious concerns Members have,  and at the same time would direct funds to where they are needed most.   Madam Speaker, I do know that what the House passes this week will  not be the final word. And I am hopeful that in the not-too-distant  future, the House will take up a different version of this package, one  that has been negotiated with Republicans and that can pass the Senate,  and I look forward to supporting that package before the President  signs it into law.   Madam Speaker, our second item for today is H.R. 3233, a bill which  establishes a national commission to investigate the January 6 attack  on the United States Capitol complex.   I thank Ranking Member   John Katko and Chairman Bennie Thompson of  the Committee on Homeland Security for their hard work in putting this  legislation together. They took an unworkable and hyper-partisan  proposal from the Speaker and turned it into a far better bill. I  commend these two gentlemen for their desire to find bipartisan  agreement.   However, I continue to have concerns with the legislation, concerns  that could have been addressed if several of the amendments proposed at  our Committee on Rules hearing would have been made in order.                                time  1300    On an issue this serious, the full House deserves the opportunity to  debate and discuss areas of disagreement to see if we can find common  ground. One of these areas of continued disagreement is that of scope,  which remains too narrow in the proposal.   As the culture of our national politics has coarsened over the past  several years, there has been a resulting broader wave of political  violence in this country. This includes events like the 2017 domestic  terror attack that targeted Republican Members of Congress at a  baseball practice, and which would have been catastrophically worse but  for the bravery of the U.S. Capitol Police officers who were present  that day.  [[Page H2565]]    It includes the April 2 attack that killed U.S. Capitol Police  Officer Billy Evans.   It includes the wave of violence, rioting, and property destruction  that swept across the country last summer.   The commission should have specific flexibility to examine these  events in their appropriate context.   I am also concerned about current language in the bill related to the  ongoing work of law enforcement to bring the perpetrators of January 6  to justice. There are multiple investigations already underway. Several  committees in both the House and the Senate have held, and will  continue to hold, hearings on the topic.   The Architect of the Capitol is reviewing security vulnerabilities in  the Capitol complex. As of yesterday, more than 450 people have been  arrested in connection with the events of January 6, with at least 100  more arrests to come. All of these individuals will be prosecuted to  the fullest extent of the law, as well they should.   Given each of these ongoing investigations and proceedings, I fear  that adding yet another investigation from this proposed commission  would only muddy the waters and make achieving due process and reaching  justice all that much harder.   For that reason, I supported an amendment offered in the Rules  Committee that would ensure that the ongoing and critically important  work of law enforcement would continue unimpeded by this commission.  For reasons I do not fully understand, this amendment was blocked.   Moreover, in my personal opinion, the commission would benefit from  any revelations emerging from the investigations currently underway.   In addition, I note that it was 14 months between the events of 9/11  and the creation of the 9/11 commission. During that time, many facts  emerged that informed the investigation of the commission. The same  could be true here. As such, it makes sense to take more time prior to  commencing an undertaking like this commission.   Though I have reservations about the bill, I have no reservations at  all about the job Ranking Member Katko and Chairman Thompson have done.  I am hopeful that this bill will be improved further as it proceeds  through the legislative process.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up House Resolution 153, a resolution  condemning the recent hate crimes committed against Asian Americans and  Pacific Islanders.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Steel), my good friend, the author of the resolution,  to further explain the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the distinguished  chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, for his excellent work on  this bill; and I want to thank his ranking member and negotiating  partner. I think they, frankly, moved us in the right direction toward  agreement.   We continue to have concerns. It is a long, legislative process.  Obviously, we will have to pass something through the Senate as well.  So it is my hope we can build upon their work and continue to move  forward.   We are not prepared at this time to provide huge support for this  bill. We think it can continue to improve. But that doesn't take  anything away from my appreciation and admiration for the gentleman  from Mississippi for his good work. We will continue to try and work  with him and others and get to a place we can all come to agree.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule. The majority is proposing two  significant pieces of legislation today. Unfortunately, concerns remain  with both of them.   H.R. 3237, the supplemental appropriations package intended to  provide funds for the security of the Capitol complex is, unfortunately  and unnecessarily, a partisan bill.   It was the subject of bipartisan negotiations, and there is no reason  we could not have gotten to a bipartisan result had the majority wanted  to do so. Instead, we are left with a partisan package that does not  meet the needs of the institution and, frankly, has no chance of  becoming law in its current form.   I would urge my friends particularly to look at the section relating  to the rapid response force. That is something where I think, honestly,  with a little bit more reflection, we could find some common ground.   I think it is a mistake to put a force like that under the control of  either the District of Columbia or the executive branch. I think we  need direct control of that ourselves. I know some of my colleagues on  the other side feel strongly that way, too. It simply  [[Page H2571]]  makes sense that if we are having a crisis here, we ought to make the  decision if we need an extra force.   I think if we keep working at it, we are going to find some common  ground there, and I hope that we do.   H.R. 3233 establishes a commission to investigate the January 6  attack on the Capitol complex. Here, too, I want to acknowledge that  real progress was made in the course of negotiations, and I want to  commend particularly Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Katko for  having brought us closer to agreement.   However, on our side, many of us continue to have reservations about  this bill and the parameters of the commission itself. After all, the  events of January 6 did not occur in a vacuum. If we truly hope to find  answers for the American people, then we must take into account  everything, all the other political violence that has taken place in  recent years.   I would just ask my friends to go back--and I know they have--and  look at the 9/11 Commission, which did exactly that. It didn't just  look at 9/11. It looked at the attack on the USS Cole. It went back to  the attack on the African Embassies that we experienced.   There is room here, I think, for context and additional discussion.  We also have concerns structurally with some of the staffing provisions  and other items that I have mentioned that we hopefully would look at.  We would like to continue to work on that.   I think we could have made good progress had any of the amendments  that were offered in the Rules Committee been made in order. My friends  chose not to do that. That is their privilege to do so, but I think it  probably obstructed what could have been a larger bipartisan vote for  this particular piece of legislation.   But, again, we will see going forward. What we do here isn't the  final arbiter. This is one stage in the process. The United States  Senate is the next stop. Hopefully, there will be some changes made  there. Then, it will have to come back here. We should look at both of  these matters as stops in a journey, or parts of a journey, not as the  final decision on any of them.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
