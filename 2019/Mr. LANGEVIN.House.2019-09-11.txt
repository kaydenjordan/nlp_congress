 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the Atlantic Coast has never been a site  of significant offshore drilling, and for good reason. In my home State  of Rhode Island and all along the coast, we know the importance of  these waters to tourism and to the fisheries that they sustain. Indeed,  waterways are part of our way of life. It is part of our identity and  who we are.   This amendment will instruct GAO to perform a study on the costs and  the impacts of drilling on the coastal communities and their economies.  This study will address how oil and gas companies interact with local  stakeholders, including fishermen. It will explore how the Interior  Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management works with other Federal  agencies during siting. It will examine how response teams have reacted  to offshore oil spills and the cost of those spills to tourism and the  food supply of the affected region.   And finally, it will analyze the caliber of the data that we have on  hand today regarding these undrilled areas of the Outer Continental  Shelf, and whether such data can be reliably used to gauge the impact  of proposed drilling.   These are all questions that have arisen during my conversations with  fishermen, tourism leaders, and other Rhode Islanders deeply concerned  about the risks of drilling off our coast.   Mr. Chairman, I believe that offshore drilling puts the safety of our  waterways at risk, which we have seen from numerous spills over the  years, including the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout.   We owe it to those who live in our coastal communities to be honest  about the damage that such drilling can cause to them.   Mr. Chairman, it will take decades to recover from an incident like  the one we experienced with the Deepwater Horizon spill. While the news  cycle eventually moves on, the coastal communities and the people that  are affected have to deal with the consequences and often continue to  suffer.   That is why I am putting forward this amendment today, so that we can  properly understand the full costs of drilling off our coast.   I would like to thank Congressman Cunningham from South Carolina for  sponsoring the underlying bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it  and my amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his comments  and his insights. I see that this amendment gets exactly the right  information that we need. I am certainly not opposed to the gentleman's  suggestion, and if at a later date he is going to offer such additional  information to be gathered by GAO, I would certainly like to look at it  and perhaps even support it.   But this is the amendment that we have before us. I believe it is  well thought out. Again, it is a GAO study to perform--to look at the  costs and the impacts of drilling on coastal communities, which my  community would be directly affected, and how they would be affected  and their economies. And I think having more information is better. I  think this hits the right mark, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserved the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I have said everything I need to say, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the September 11  attacks, and especially those who lost their lives on that day,  including people from my own home State in Rhode Island.   I was 8 months into my first term in Congress when our Nation's  course was inexorably altered that blue Tuesday morning. Over the last  18 years, as an inaugural member of the Committee on Homeland Security  and as a member of the Committee on Armed Services with oversight over  our Special Operations Forces, I devoted myself to ensuring our country  is safe.   I know that we have made progress, important progress, and we worked  to eliminate terrorist enclaves around the world. We strengthened our  security at home so that we are no longer a soft target. We, of course,  paid dearly for these gains through the sacrifice of our servicemembers  and the tax dollars of our citizens.   However, we still have a long way to go. This summer, Congress, of  course, finally enacted, permanently, to protect 9/11 first responders.  It is certainly long overdue.   We must also now fulfill our commitments to our veterans returning  home from the Global War on Terror. We must protect our country against  new and emerging threats, including in the cyber domain. And each year,  we must renew our pledge to ``never forget.''                            ____________________
