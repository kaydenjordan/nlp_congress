 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  H.R. 1500 and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1500, the Consumers First  Act, which restores the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, so it can  carry out its mission of protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive,  or abusive acts or practices by financial institutions.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created by Congress  following the financial crisis in order to ensure that there is an  agency in place with the sole, dedicated purpose of protecting every  consumer of financial products and services and holding bad actors  fully accountable when consumers are harmed.   Under the leadership of its first Director, Richard Cordray, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was a resounding success. During  that time, the agency put nearly $12 billion back in the pockets of  over 30 million consumers who were harmed by financial institutions.  The agency put in place important new protections so that consumers no  longer had to worry about exploding mortgages, hidden prepaid card  fees, or unnecessary foreclosures due to weak servicing standards.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also helped to take the  confusing jargon out of various financial  [[Page H4076]]  products, such as student loans, by creating tools students can use to  compare financial aid and costs when deciding where to go to college.   But Donald Trump and his appointees have made it their mission to  destroy the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from within. Mick  Mulvaney, who was Trump's Director of the Office of Management and  Budget before Trump inappropriately installed him as Acting Director of  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, made it his mission to  dismantle the agency from the inside. In fact, enforcement actions have  fallen by 75 percent under Trump's appointees, there have been zero  public fair lending enforcement actions, Mulvaney originally requested  zero dollars from the Fed to fund the CFPB, and the number of employees  at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has declined by 10 percent.   I introduced the Consumers First Act to fix the damage that Mulvaney  caused at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. For example,  Mulvaney stripped the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity of  its supervisory enforcement powers. The Consumers First Act restores  those powers.   Mulvaney fired the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's consumer  advisory board. The Consumers First Act restores and strengthens the  advisory panel to ensure consumers are heard by the agency's  leadership.   Mulvaney stacked the senior leadership of the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau with ideological political appointees. The Consumers  First Act limits the number of political appointees at the agency.   Mulvaney stopped the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from  supervising its regulated entities for compliance with the Military  Lending Act, which is in place to prevent servicemembers from being  ripped off. The Consumers First Act directs the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau to promptly resume Military Lending Act exams.   Mulvaney worked to hide the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's  consumer complaint database from the public. The Consumers First Act  requires that the consumer complaint database remain publicly  accessible so that there is transparency about the complaints consumers  are making about financial institutions.   H.R. 1500 puts consumers first by reversing the harmful actions  Mulvaney took that we are aware of one by one. Over 50 consumer, civil  rights, and labor organizations support the Consumers First Act.   The harm at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is continuing  under Director Kathy Kraninger, who appears to be following Mulvaney's  lead by rolling back payday lending protections and reducing the  collection of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA data, which is  used to identify discrimination in lending. And she is just getting  started. Following general debate on the bill, the House will debate  several amendments to undo the harmful actions taken by Director  Kraninger.   Congress will not tolerate the Trump administration's anticonsumer  actions, and H.R. 1500 will ensure that the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau is able to fulfill its statutory mission to put  consumers first.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.           Committee on Education and Labor, House of             Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, May 17, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, House Committee on Financial Services,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: I write concerning H.R. 1500, the       ``Consumers First Act.'' This bill was primarily referred to       the Committee on Financial Services, and secondarily to the       Committee on Education and Labor. As a result of your having       consulted with me concerning this bill generally, I agree to       forgo consideration of the bill, so the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1500,       we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter       contained in this or similar legislation, and we will be       appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward so we may address any remaining       issue within our Rule X jurisdiction.        In agreeing to forgo consideration, I respectfully request       your support for the appointment of outside conferees from       the Committee on Education and Labor should this bill or       similar language be considered in a conference with the       Senate.        Finally, I would appreciate a response confirming this       understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during       floor consideration thereof.            Very truly yours,                                                  Rep. Bobby Scott,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                       Washington, DC, May 21, 2019.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, House Committee on Education and Labor, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I writing to acknowledge your letter       dated May 17, 2019, responding to our request to your       Committee that it waive any jurisdictional claims over the       matters contained in H.R. 1500, ``the Consumer First Act,''       that fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. The       Committee on Financial Services confirms our mutual       understanding that your Committee does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and your Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within your jurisdiction.        The Committee on Financial Services further recognizes your       interest in appointment of outside conferees from the       Committee on Education and Labor should this bill or similar       language be considered in a conference with the Senate.        Pursuant to your request, I will ensure that this exchange       of letters is included in the Congressional Record during       Floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your       cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to       continuing to work with you as this measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                        Chairwomen.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) the chair of the Subcommittee on  Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets.   ( Mr. Chair, we have no regrets about how we organized the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the supervisory authority is  already in law. All they have to do is implement it.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Clay), the chair of the Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development  and Insurance on the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chair, it is absolutely unbelievable that the  Republicans on the opposite side of the aisle now talk about wanting to  work with us after they have done everything possible to undermine the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   We move ahead with restoring it from all the harm that has been done  to it.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.    David Scott), a leading senior member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Chair, this is a consumer bill. My friends on the  opposite side of the aisle who would try to kill this bill evidently do  not understand that the day is over when predatory lending will go  forth in this body.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty), the chair of the Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion on  the Financial Services Committee.                                time  1245     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), a member of the Ways and Means Committee and  always a strong leader on consumer protection issues.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), a strong defender of consumers.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Chair, I would like to inquire as to how much time  is remaining.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I am so proud of this legislation, I am so proud of the  members of the Financial Services Committee, and I am so proud of our  Democratic Caucus. We have strong support for this legislation. I am so  proud of the over 50 consumer, labor, and civil rights organizations  who strongly support H.R. 1500, the Consumers First Act.   It has been said more than once today that we went through a  recession here in this country--almost a depression--in 2008 when  predatory lending from the major financial institutions in America  caused this recession and caused us to have communities that were  devastated--boarded up homes--we had communities, not only where the  homes were boarded up, but the weeds were growing up, in many instances  animals had taken over the property, and many consumers and homeowners  who lost these homes really did not know what had happened to them.   It was predatory lending. It was the tricks that were fostered on  innocent people who simply wanted to live the American Dream and own a  home. They signed on the dotted line for products and mortgages they  didn't understand and could not afford. And they were led into signing  on the bottom line because we had predatory lenders who wanted to get  them into a situation where they could get some money, perhaps up  front, and sell off the products that they were getting signed on up to  Wall Street, et cetera, et cetera.   Of course, we worked for 2 years, and it was in 2010 that we were  able to put the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau together, which is  indeed the centerpiece of the Dodd-Frank reforms. So we had Mr. Cordray  who was our first Director who did a magnificent job, and it has been  cited here time and time again.   My friends on the opposite side of the aisle have done everything  that they could do to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau, and, Madam Chair, none of them are going to vote for this bill  today. None of them will criticize the big banks on Wall Street and  others who took advantage of our consumers.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    No, I am not prepared to close.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green), who is the chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight  and Investigations on the Financial Services Committee.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to just say that we send a message from this House today, and  our message that we are sending out across this Nation is that we are  now in a position to undo what has been done and the wreckage that has  been caused with our Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   We send a message that the day for predatory lending is over.   We send the message despite the fact that we have Members of this  House who would dare not stand up for students and servicemembers and  not criticize what has happened to consumers in the way that it has  happened in this country. And so I want that message to be loud and  clear.   I want those on Wall Street and the major banks who had the predatory  products and who had the exotic loans, I want all those who mismanaged  the way that they deal with our students when our students had  complaints and they looked for someone to help them, I want all of them  to know, well, I suppose, there is a new sheriff in town.   We are going to make sure that the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau is strong, that it is not simply made up of political  appointees, and that they do not have to worry in the way that they are  worrying now. We have personnel who have quit the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau because it was not carrying out the mission that was  intended.   Again, I have said earlier how proud I am to have this bill on the  floor and to have the support of the Democratic Caucus.   I would just ask my friends on the opposite side of the aisle to  think about what is going on and to think about ways that they can  begin to take into consideration their constituents who need  protection, and prior to our legislation there was no protection for  consumers.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am so proud that, today, we are going to  stand up for consumers on this side of the aisle. It is unfortunate  that our friends on the opposite side of the aisle have not seen fit to  support consumers. They will all vote against this bill. We will vote  for this bill on this side of the aisle.   Madam Chair, again, I urge my colleagues to come to the floor quickly  and vote for consumer financial protection, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to amendment  No. 6.    Madam Chair, this amendment would take the widely  successful consumer complaint database dark, hiding from the public how  consumers report personally being harmed by financial institutions.   The Dodd-Frank Act required the CFPB to establish a consumer  complaint database to provide consumers with the opportunity to report  complaints about financial products and services.   A public database empowers consumers to seek redress when harmed and  benefits the public by providing firsthand stories to help other  consumers to avoid similar harms.   A public database also promotes market discipline and encourages  financial firms to treat their consumers fairly. The Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau has received over 1.5 million consumer submissions,  with a 97 percent response rate by financial firms to the consumer  complaints.                                time  1415    This means that the American people know, need, and use this  function. Taking this away from the public only harms hardworking  people in need of help and benefits the bad actors.   Through its research, education, market monitoring, and the much-used  consumer complaint database, the CFPB has been able to directly address  problems in the market and issues that directly harm hardworking  families. This is especially useful for the millions of consumers who,  unfortunately, do not have the financial means, time, or access to the  judicial court system.   Mandating that the consumer complaint database remain transparent and  publicly accessible is an important aspect of this bill and will  promote better conduct from providers of financial services across this  country. Thus, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment to H.R.  1500, the Consumers First Act.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, I would like to reiterate my strong opposition to this  amendment.   Congress must ensure that consumer complaints to the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau are available to the public to hold  companies accountable to the American people for their actions or lack  of actions.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment to H.R.  1500, the Consumers First Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment because it seeks to  limit the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by using the  appropriations process to politicize and defund the agency.   All the bank regulators are independently funded. In addition to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the  FDIC, and the NCUA are all funded outside of the appropriations  process. In fact, so is the FHFA, the FSOC, and OFR.   Congress provided the regulators with independence from the executive  branch and the appropriations process to ensure that financial  regulators focused on protecting the financial system from harm.   However, ever since it was created, Republicans have focused on the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's funding because, more than any  other agency, it has helped level the playing field between Wall Street  on one side and families, communities of color, older Americans,  servicemembers, and students on the other.   Under the guise of the appropriations process, Republicans are  seeking to do by amendment what they were unable to do for the 8 years  they were in power, eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  entirely.   To that end, Mulvaney's first request for funds to be transferred  from the Federal Reserve to fund the CFPB's operations was zero. He  later asked Congress to turn the CFPB, which he previously called a  ``sick, sad'' joke of an agency, into an appropriated one.   In addition, Republicans often point to the Securities and Exchange  Commission, which is subject to annual appropriations, as an example we  should follow. What they seem to forget is that during Trump's 35-day  shutdown, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau remained open while  the SEC was effectively shuttered.   Advocacy groups like Americans for Financial Reform also point out  that ``big banks would be able to use the politically charged  appropriations process to deny funding for rule-writing or enforcement  actions that Wall Street particularly dislikes. They could simply  starve the agency of the basic funds it needs to do its job or threaten  to do so in order to intimidate the agency out of taking actions to  curb abuses by powerful companies.''   The difference with Mulvaney and the Trump administration is that  they have purposely sought to ignore or disregard the law and the  independence Congress tried to create. Mulvaney, who reports directly  to Trump, clearly ignored the law when he directed the agency to stop  supervising banks for violations of the Military Lending Act.   Nevertheless, I am not surprised that Republicans' efforts to reform  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau involve trying to starve the  agency of funding.   Madam Chair, Democrats want to ensure the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau can do and is doing its jobs and puts consumers  first. This amendment does exactly the opposite, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose it.  [[Page H4094]]    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, I would like to reiterate my strong opposition to this  amendment.   Today, the House is trying to return the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau to its mission of putting consumers first. This  amendment, instead, is meant to slow down and ultimately starve the  agency by using the appropriations process.   Madam Chair, my friends on the opposite side of the aisle have tried  everything they could try to dismantle the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau. I think it is odd that they would spend their time  opposing what is good for consumers and, yet, embracing the very  institutions that caused us to have a recession in 2008 and to harm the  American people.   Madam Chair, I ask that everyone oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
