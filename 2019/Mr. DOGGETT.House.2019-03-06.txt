 Mr. Speaker, Texas is ground zero for voter suppression.  Texas Republicans enacted the most stringent voter ID law in the  country. They slashed communities across our State through partisan  gerrymandering. And now, this year, in what a Federal court has just  described as a ``ham-handed move'' which ``exemplifies the power of  government to strike fear and anxiety and to intimidate the least  powerful among us,'' the Abbott administration has initiated a massive  voter purge by making the false claim that tens of thousands of people  have voted illegally in our State.   Our State has a problem. It is not too many people voting illegally;  it is too few people voting at all. The difference that you see in this  debate is that we believe elections should be won for one party or the  other based on turning out the voters, and too often, our Republican  colleagues believe they are won by throwing out the voters.   I believe that the important reform that we are considering today  will replace these purges with the urge to have voters participate by  removing the many obstacles that stand in their way.   It makes the right to vote more than a paper guarantee. It makes it a  reality by allowing people to know their own power, to shape our  democracy, and hold every public official accountable. ``For the  People'' means stopping the steady Trump erosion of our democracy by  empowering the people to make their voices heard.   I am so pleased that this legislation includes a provision that I  authored to ensure that we seek the business tax returns, as well as  the personal individual returns, of candidates for President.   Now, this particular amendment is directed not specifically at Mr.  Trump, but his conduct underscores why we must require it. He had his  personal law firm review his tax returns, and they awarded him an all- clear from any Russian connection.    Mr. Speaker, they noted that he was the sole or  principal owner of 500 separate business entities that stretched from  Azerbaijan to Miami, and they gave him an all-clear, upon which he  asked us to rely without noting that the same firm had proudly boasted  that it was ``the Russia law firm of the year.''   Some of us believe we need a little more credible source to review  his conduct. But not just review his conduct, that of anyone, for  either party, who aspires to be the most powerful person in the entire  world.   Even President Nixon invited the Joint Committee on Taxation to  review his tax returns, explaining that the people have got to know  whether their President is a crook--something very relevant to our  times. Candidates who cannot meet the very low Richard Nixon standard  have no right to our highest office.   If left untouchable and unreachable, without exposure to sunlight, we  will find business tax returns hide the darkest secrets. It is good  that we have a strong act demanding disclosure of those returns.                                time  1300
