 Madam President, later today, the Senate is scheduled to  take the first procedural step to begin consideration of the annual  defense bill.   Our Republican colleagues have said for weeks that we need to move  quickly to take up the NDAA and pass it through the Chamber.   This morning, we are continuing to work with our Republican  colleagues to strengthen the substitute with as many amendments from  Senators as possible. We are making really good progress, and so we  will give the Armed Services Committee more time this morning to review  the text and come to a final agreement.   But the Senate needs to move forward on this bill, and quickly. With  so much bipartisan interest in getting NDAA done soon, I see no reason  why we can't finish this legislation or come to an agreement to finish  this bill quickly.   I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, and especially  our committee chairs. I thank them because they are propelling this  important legislation forward.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to resume  legislative session.    I move to proceed to Calendar No. 144, H.R. 4350, the  National Defense Authorization Act.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5142, which was received  from the House.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, we just passed H.R. 5142, which awards  the Congressional Gold Medal to 13 servicemembers. They are American  heroes, and today the Senate will honor them as such.   Our Nation is forever indebted to these brave men and women and their  families for their sacrifice that enabled the safe evacuation of more  than 100,000 Americans and Afghan allies.   They risked their lives for our country, and their heroic efforts  will not be forgotten.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 455, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, November 18; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to H.R. 4350, the National Defense Authorization Act,  postcloture; further, that all time during adjournment, morning  business, recess, and leader time count postcloture.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:27 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, November 18, 2021, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
