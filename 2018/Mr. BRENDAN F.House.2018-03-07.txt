 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  acknowledge a distinguished Philadelphian who will be leading our  city's annual St. Patrick's Day parade as grand marshal, Sister Mary  Scullion.   Sister Mary is a towering figure and a driving force for social  change in Philadelphia. She belongs to the Sisters of Mercy, the third  largest congregation of Sisters in Philadelphia, and is the cofounder  of Project HOME, an influential nonprofit that seeks to break the cycle  of homelessness.   Since 1989, Sister Mary's organization has helped provide shelter to  the homeless, set up programs for at-risk youth across the city, and  organized wellness and healthcare services. She has also been a leader  at the city, State, and Federal level to bring about awareness and  much-needed funding to address the root causes of homelessness.   As a religious and community leader, Sister Mary has become a  household  [[Page H1468]]  name in Philadelphia and a champion for the voiceless in our city. It  is fitting that she has been selected to lead this year's St. Patrick's  Day parade, and I rise to commend her on her lifetime of devoted  service.                            ____________________
