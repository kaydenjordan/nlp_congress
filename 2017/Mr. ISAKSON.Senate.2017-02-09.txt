 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these  answers to four questions that have been raised in the last few days in  the media be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   Four Examples of the Liberal Character Assassination of Dr. Tom Price         Even the great Perry Mason would be stumped by this one.       Democrats, with the help of an eager media, have attempted a       character assassination of Rep. Tom Price, M.D., President       Trump's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services.       Despite an impeccable record in both public service and       medicine, they insisted Dr. Price's good name, built       throughout decades of serving others, did not belong to him       anymore.         And they almost got away with it. Here's how it happened.        Exhibit A: New York Magazine forecasts Price character       assassination.        Buried in a December 27 story in New York Magazine, then-      incoming-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY)       broadcasts that he has unanimous Democratic opposition to a       single Trump nominee: Dr. Tom Price. He plans to inflict as       much pain as possible on the HHS pick, and Democratic       staffers indicate they'll delay the process as long as       possible.        ``Senate Democrats appear to be unanimous in their       opposition to Tom Price, Trump's choice for Health and Human       Services secretary, and they hope to raise such a ruckus       about Medicare during Price's hearings that at least three       Republicans decide to vote against Price, too, thus handing       Democrats their first scalp of the Trump era.        ``According to various Senate aides, Schumer doesn't       believe his party has a chance of torpedoing any other Trump       nominees, but he hopes to make their confirmations as       bruising--and, with smart floor management, as prolonged--as       possible. (Schumer himself decided to comment.) `The goal       will be to show the public how controversial these       nominations are,' explains a Senate Democratic aide.''        Evidence A: http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/12/ who-will-do-what-harry-reid-did-now-that-harry-reid-is- gone.html        Exhibit B: Democrats, with help from media, begin Zimmer       Biomet smear.        In mid-January 2017, CNN began nonstop coverage of what       they believed was a bombshell story that would rock the HHS       nomination process. Dr. Price, they claimed, introduced       legislation to benefit a medical device manufacturer, Zimmer       Biomet, whose stock he owned.        ``Rep. Tom Price last year purchased shares in a medical       device manufacturer days before introducing legislation that       would have directly benefited the company, raising new ethics       concerns for President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for       Health and Human Services secretary.''        The written piece breathlessly continues that theirs is the       ``latest example of Price trading stock in a healthcare firm       at the same time as pursuing legislation that could impact a       company's share price.''        Predictably, Schumer and his henchmen began gleefully       alleging on television that Dr. Price potentially broke       federal law--a law that calls for up to 15 years of       imprisonment if broken.        Except none of what CNN said happened actually happened.        1) Dr. Price's Morgan Stanley broker purchased the Zimmer       Biomet stock without his knowledge as a part of a routine       rebalancing of his portfolio on March 17, 2016. They notified       Dr. Price on April 4, 2016. He disclosed it in his filings on       April 15, 2016.        2) The 26 stocks, totaling less than $2,700, were so small,       in fact, that even Zimmer Biomet, like Dr. Price, was not       even aware that he was a stockholder.        3) The legislation CNN and others keep referencing concerns       Dr. Price's well-documented efforts, including a 2015 letter       and subsequent bill, requesting the delay of a rule issued by       CMS.        4) While CNN claims this would have benefitted Zimmer       Biomet, the company actually supports the CMS rule and       publicly opposed Dr. Price's legislation,        So, CNN (and Congressional Democrats musing about alleged       crimes punishable by imprisonment) runs--and reruns and       reruns--a story about Dr. Price potentially breaking the law       or behaving unethically and doesn't even get the story       correct about Zimmer Biomet's position on the very       legislation they claim he introduced for them? Way to go,       guys.        Evidence B: http://www.freebeacon.com/issues/dem- accusations-regarding-tom-prices-stock-trades-  unsubstantiated.        Exhibit C: Democrats, with help from media, go low with       Innate Immuno play.        In a salacious twist, media and Democrats turn their       attention to Australian medical company Innate Immuno. At the       recommendation of another Member of Congress, Dr. Price       decided to purchase Innate Immuno stock through a ``friends       and family'' referral program. Any eligible buyer referred to       the company by a current stockholder received a 12 percent       discount to fund a research project the innovator was       launching.        This fact didn't stop Democrats from claiming he received       ``insider information'' as a Member of Congress, a rather       strange accusation about a company based in Australia.        Then, they pointed to what they insisted--and insisted and       insisted--was his active support for the 21st Century Cures       Act, legislation they said would help Innate Immuno gain       access to American markets.        That would be pretty suspicious, except for the fact that       Innate Immuno went on the record with the Wall Street Journal       back in  [[Page S1011]]       December to express that they didn't care about the bill one       way or the other because they were governed by Australia and       New Zealand law.        And then, of course, there's the little detail that Dr.       Price was not a co-sponsor of the 21st Century Cures Act. He       never whipped for the bill. He never even voted for it. In       fact, he was one of only a handful of Republicans to vote       against it when it was introduced in the U.S. House of       Representatives. As House Committee on the Budget chairman,       Dr. Price had concerns that the law would bust spending       limits set by the budget. Thus, he could not vote for the       bill. So, a lawmaker doesn't co-sponsor the bill, doesn't       whip for the bill and doesn't even vote for the bill, and yet       he's being accused of crafting it, pitching it to his       colleagues and promoting it to the public? Seems a bit odd,       doesn't it?        Months later, the conference committee on the bill (of       which Dr. Price wasn't a member, since he voted against the       legislation) repaired the funding mechanisms for it, moving       it from mandatory spending to discretionary spending. Then,       Dr. Price felt comfortable voting to approve of the       conference report, which, again, is not the same as       ``actively supporting the legislation.'' And to top it all       off, it was because of Dr. Price's opposition to it that the       American taxpayers weren't on the hook for 21st Century Cures       as mandatory spending.        So, another swing-and-a-miss from the media and the Left.       He didn't ``actively engage'' in supporting legislation that       they insist he spearheaded, and funnily enough, neither did       the company!        EVIDENCE C1: http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll433.xml        EVIDENCE C2: http://budget.house.gov/ news/docmentsingle.aspx?Document      ID=393978        EVIDENCE C3: http://www.georgiapol.com/2016/12/23/tom- price-stock-investments-needed-perspective/  EXHIBIT D: Puerto Rico Lies, Lies, Lies        Another story emerged that Dr. Price introduced legislation       to benefit himself, via stocks he held in a pharmaceutical       company that did business in Puerto Rico. Again, the facts       don't match their claims.        In 2004, Congress enacted the Section 199 deduction for       qualified U.S. manufacturing activities. Realizing a       technical omission, in 2006 Congress extended the 199       deduction for Puerto Rico on a temporary basis. As a result,       Puerto Rico was returned to a level playing field and would       no longer be competitively disadvantaged against the       mainland. The 199 deduction was temporarily extended in both       2011 and 2014.        The Section 199 deduction was not extended as a part of the       PATH Act in 2015. Dr. Price's bill would simply make       permanent the 199 deduction, no longer requiring periodic       reauthorizations, just as it is for the mainland. This would       not give Puerto Rico or any U.S. company (and thus, a       shareholder of such a company) a tax advantage. It merely       creates a tax neutrality so a company can make a decision to       invest in a jurisdiction for economic purposes, rather than       tax. Dr. Price was never lobbied by PhRMA on this       legislation. However, it is a priority of American companies,       such as Georgia-based Coca-Cola, who would prefer to maintain       their operations in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Ricans they       employ, who already face perilous economic circumstances,       would be inherently disadvantaged if these extenders did not       occur.        Whoops.        Evidence D: https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tax-services/ publications/insights/assets/pwc-new-section-199-regs-could- affect-wide-range-of-taxpayers.pdf                                   Summary         Dr. Price's detractors on the Left have no actual defense       of their opposition to him. They can't deny his       qualifications or expertise, so they've resorted to an       attempted character assassination. The media, eager for       flames to fan, ran these baseless attacks time and time       again, despite easily accessible information (i.e. a Google       search) that would disprove these outrageous claims.        Both the Left and their media support must be held to       account for conjuring up lies and spreading them for the past       two months.     Mr. President, I would also like the Record to reflect  that I have never been to Montana. I have been to Delaware, but I  respect anything either one of these Senators would say about any  physician in Delaware or any physician in Montana. They have never been  to Georgia. I have been to Georgia for 72 years. I have lived there for  72 years, and for 30 of those years, I served with Tom Price in the  State legislature, in the same neighborhood organizations. He has been  my friend. He has been my doctor. He is a great individual, and my  knowledge of him is firsthand. I am not going to read to you something  that somebody told me Tom Price was or is or did or was accused of. I  am going to tell you about the man I know who has been nominated for  Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.   I have known Tom, as I said, for 30 years. He is a great family man.  He and his wife Betty are great members of our community. He is a great  churchman. He is active in his church in his community. He started out  working in neighborhood organizations, graduated to the State  legislature, and became the first elected Republican majority leader in  the history of the Georgia State Senate. He went from the Georgia State  Senate to the Congress to replace me. He raised the intellectual  component level of that seat tremendously when I got out and when he  came in. He has done a tremendous job here in the seven terms in this  Congress, representing the people of my State.   Now, I don't know much about medicine, except that shots hurt, and I  don't want to go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. Tom knows  everything about medicine because he has delivered it for 30 years. He  knows about the affordability of health care. He knows about the needs  of senior citizens. He knows about the innovations that are necessary  to help all of us stay healthy for the rest of our lives.   Tom Price is a committed public servant who has worked diligently and  hard for the State of Georgia and people of Georgia.   There have been a few things said about Tom that I want to address,  not because I want to waste my time talking about things that are just  allegations that are put together in some fashion or form to make him  look bad. I want to just make the record straight.   First of all, it has been said that Tom is for taking funds away from  Medicare. That is ironic to me because last December, Tom and I were  called on by AARP, the representative of the senior citizens of  America, to go on the road and talk about how we were going to save  Medicare and save Social Security--not cut and rob it. So we  represented the organization AARP at their request. We wanted to save  Social Security and save Medicare. We have never spent a minute of our  time talking about taking it away from anybody. If there is anybody who  is going to be able to make sure Medicare works for the senior citizens  of the 21st century, it is Dr. Tom Price, of Georgia, and he is going  to do it as Secretary of Health and Human Services in the United States  of America.   Secondly, there have been a lot of things impugning Tom and his  investments--the investments he has made.   I introduced Tom to the Senate Finance Committee. I introduced Tom to  the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. I went  through his application. I have seen everything on it. Everything that  he is being accused of doing, he disclosed in his report. They are just  using a technique that trial lawyers use called desperate impact, where  you take two facts, put them over here, and put them together to make  them a negative, rather than a positive. It is all in how you explain  it and how you describe it. It is not how the act took place.   As the chairman of the Ethics Committee and the one that administers  the STOCK Act for this body, I know what we have to submit and make  public; I know what we don't. Every single thing he has been accused of  doing is from information taken out of his own disclosures, which  anybody who owns a computer can get today to make him look like he is  bad and a bad guy.   In fact, I told the Senate Finance Committee when I went to introduce  him there--after listening to Chuck Schumer on the Sunday shows for 2  weeks talking about Tom Price--that I felt like I was going to have to  be a character witness for a convicted felon at a sentencing hearing.  That is not right for us to do that to people.   Tom Price is a great man. He has done a great public service. He has  done a great job, and he will do a great job as Secretary of Health and  Human Services.   I am proud to have introduced him. I am proud to know him as a  friend, and I am proud that he is going to be my Secretary of Health  and Human Services. America and all of her citizens will be better off  because the doctor will be in the house.   I urge a vote for Tom Price and yield the floor.
