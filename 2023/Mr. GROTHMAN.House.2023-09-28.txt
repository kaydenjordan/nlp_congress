 Mr. Speaker, we just had another vote on this floor  regarding the war between Russia and Ukraine. One more time, more money  was spent on the war.   As bad as the money that is spent on the war, what is worse is the  huge cost in human lives and suffering going on as long as the war  exists.   I think there is a shortage of serious concern as to how this war is  going to end and a shortage of desire to end this war.   Eventually, this war will end, but I believe the United States has  traditionally been the world leader, and we should take our  responsibility as world leader and try to push somebody, be it Israel,  be it France, be it, Turkiye, into negotiating a peace.   The longer this war goes on, the more you will have wounds between  countries that are not going to turn around, and the more Russians and  Ukrainians die.   I remind this body that Ukraine has the second-lowest birthrate in  the world. Russia has a very low birthrate as well and, even before the  war, was suffering from a lot of its young people leaving Russia and  coming to other countries such as the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I plead with President Biden to take a leadership role  and try to negotiate an end to this war.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
